2. **Business Ethics (18/20)**: The company scores exceptionally well with a robust governance framework, including an anti-corruption policy and employee training programs. The only drawback is the lack of transparency regarding the effectiveness of these programs, which slightly reduces the score.

1. **Tax Transparency (10/20)**: The company is currently engaged in ongoing tax-related controversies, which negatively impacts its score. While it maintains a low estimated tax gap, the need for improved communication and proactive management of tax practices is critical. Points are awarded for the low tax gap but deducted for the controversies and lack of transparency.

2. **Business Ethics (17/20)**: The company demonstrates a strong commitment to business ethics with comprehensive systems in place, including a dedicated committee and regular training. However, the lack of continuous assessment of ethics training programs and reporting mechanisms slightly limits the score. Points are awarded for the robust framework but deducted for the opportunity for improvement.

3. **Accounting (12/20)**: The accounting framework is generally positive, but the internal investigation into trade spend and the need for restatements raise concerns about vulnerabilities in reporting processes. While there are no major auditor issues, the need for enhanced internal audits and proactive communication limits the score. Points are awarded for strong internal controls but deducted for the investigation and restatements.

4. **Ownership & Control (15/20)**: The ownership and control framework is sound, promoting shareholder rights and democracy. However, the absence of cumulative voting rights is a missed opportunity for empowering minority shareholders. Points are awarded for the balanced governance environment but deducted for the lack of cumulative voting.

5. **Remuneration (16/20)**: The remuneration structure is robust and aligned with performance metrics, with effective governance in CEO equity ownership. However, the need for more detailed context around performance metrics and consistent disclosure of total compensation data limits the score. Points are awarded for fair practices but deducted for transparency issues.

6. **Board Governance (14/20)**: The board governance framework is strong, with independent oversight and a separation of roles. However, the underrepresentation of female directors is a notable deficiency. Points are awarded for independence and governance practices but deducted for the lack of diversity.

**20 out of 100**",20,"Based on the evaluation summary provided, here is a detailed breakdown of the governance performance rating:

1. **Tax Transparency (15/20)**: The company has no involvement in ongoing tax-related controversies, which is a significant strength. However, the lack of detailed information on tax risk management and stakeholder engagement limits the score. Points are awarded for the absence of controversies but deducted for insufficient transparency practices.

2. **Business Ethics (12/20)**: The company demonstrates a commitment to ethical governance with an Audit and Compliance Committee and a formal anti-corruption policy. However, significant gaps exist in supplier anti-corruption policies, whistleblower protections, and employee training. Points are awarded for the existing framework but deducted for the lack of comprehensive policies and training.

3. **Accounting Practices (17/20)**: The accounting practices are evaluated favorably, with no ongoing investigations or concerns about auditing independence. The lack of material weaknesses in internal controls is a strong point. However, the need for enhanced transparency regarding accounting practices limits the score slightly. Points are awarded for effective governance but deducted for the lack of detailed disclosures.

4. **Ownership & Control (14/20)**: The ownership structure appears balanced, with no undue control by any single shareholder. However, the lack of information regarding governance complexities limits transparency. Points are awarded for the balanced distribution but deducted for the need for improved shareholder engagement processes.

5. **Compensation and Pay (13/20)**: The executive compensation practices are robust, with alignment to performance metrics and clawback provisions in place. However, weaknesses in linking pay to sustainability performance and the absence of comprehensive disclosures regarding pay equity and severance packages limit the score. Points are awarded for strong practices but deducted for the need for improvement in sustainability links and transparency.

6. **Board Governance (12/20)**: The board governance reflects a commitment to independence, but weaknesses exist regarding the presence of executive directors and the independence of key committees. Points are awarded for the overall governance framework but deducted for the need to enhance board diversification and independence.

However, the lack of detailed disclosures regarding potential tax issues limits the score. Points are awarded for the absence of controversies but deducted for insufficient proactive communication.

2. **Business Ethics (17/20)**: The company demonstrates robust governance with a comprehensive set of policies, an ethics committee, and whistleblower protections. However, concerns about corruption risk exposure due to a lack of specific data on high-risk operations slightly limit the score.

However, there is an opportunity for greater transparency regarding internal controls and audit committee processes. Points are awarded for effective governance but deducted for the lack of detailed disclosures.

Points are awarded for the healthy governance environment but deducted for the need for clearer ownership disclosures.

5. **Pay (14/20)**: The company shows a commitment to equitable compensation practices, linking executive pay to performance and sustainability. However, the absence of specific stock ownership guidelines for non-executive directors limits the score. Points are awarded for sound practices but deducted for the lack of clear directives.

6. **Board Governance (15/20)**: The board demonstrates a strong commitment to independence, with no noted issues regarding leadership influence.

**20 out of 100**",20,"Based on the evaluation summary provided, here is a detailed breakdown of the governance performance rating:

1. **Tax Transparency (16/20)**: The company shows strong performance with no ongoing tax-related controversies, indicating a commitment to compliance. However, the lack of additional disclosures on tax strategies and contributions limits the score slightly. Points are awarded for the absence of controversies but deducted for insufficient transparency.

2. **Business Ethics (15/20)**: The company has a comprehensive Compliance Model with policies against bribery and anti-corruption, along with whistleblower protections and employee training. However, concerns about operations in high-risk areas suggest a need for more transparency. Points are awarded for strong ethical practices but deducted for the lack of specific operational disclosures.

3. **Accounting (17/20)**: The absence of material weaknesses and auditor concerns reflects effective internal controls. However, the company could enhance stakeholder trust by disclosing more information about its internal control robustness. Points are awarded for effective governance but deducted for the lack of detailed disclosures.

4. **Ownership and Control (12/20)**: The ownership structure shows complexities due to significant control by the E. Abaroa Foundation, which raises concerns for minority shareholders. Points are awarded for recognizing the need for transparency but deducted for the lack of clarity regarding governance structures and voting rights.

5. **Pay (13/20)**: The assessment highlights transparency in executive pay and alignment with performance metrics, but the absence of formal stock ownership guidelines and clawback policies limits the score. Points are awarded for sound practices but deducted for the need for clearer guidelines.

6. **Board Governance (14/20)**: The board maintains a majority of independent directors and a strong audit committee, but concerns about the influence of a non-independent chair and long-tenured members affect objectivity. Points are awarded for the independent structure but deducted for the need for term limits and diversity initiatives.

**20 out of 100**",20,"Based on the evaluation summary provided, here is a detailed breakdown of the governance performance rating:

1. **Tax Transparency (18/20)**: The company demonstrates commendable tax transparency with no ongoing controversies, reflecting a proactive approach to compliance. Points are awarded for strong practices, but a slight deduction is made for the lack of regular public reporting on tax strategies.

2. **Business Ethics (16/20)**: The company has established comprehensive policies and oversight mechanisms, including a dedicated committee and employee training programs. However, the lack of information on sustainability-related training suggests an area for improvement. Points are awarded for robust ethical governance but deducted for the gap in sustainability training.

3. **Accounting (17/20)**: The accounting practices are robust, with no indications of issues and effective internal controls. However, the documentation could benefit from more details on how the company addresses emerging accounting issues. Points are awarded for effective governance but deducted for the lack of detailed disclosures.

4. **Ownership & Control (14/20)**: The ownership structure is stable, but the presence of multiple classes of shares with different voting rights raises concerns for minority shareholders. Points are awarded for stability but deducted for the potential inequity in voting rights.

5. **Pay (13/20)**: The executive compensation practices align with performance metrics, but the lack of ties to sustainability performance and specific stock ownership guidelines for non-executive directors limits the score. Points are awarded for sound practices but deducted for the need for improvement in sustainability metrics and ownership guidelines.

6. **Board Governance (12/20)**: The board structure is robust with independent members, but the lack of at least 30% female directors indicates a need for improvement in diversity. Points are awarded for strong governance but deducted for the lack of gender diversity.

**Total Score Calculation**: 
- Tax Transparency: 18

2. **Committee Structure and Functioning (15/20)**: The audit committee is recognized for its independence, but there is inadequate information on the pay and nomination committees. The lack of transparency raises concerns about oversight in executive compensation structures, indicating a need for clearer guidelines and documentation.

3. **Executive Compensation Practices (15/20)**: There is strong alignment between executive pay and company performance, with sustainability measures incorporated into compensation packages. However, the lack of comparability to peer group standards for total awarded and fixed pay suggests a need for enhanced disclosure practices.

4. **Shareholder Rights and Ownership Structures (10/20)**: Limited information on controlling shareholders and shareholder engagement practices raises concerns. The inadequacy of discussions around voting rights and the ability to convene meetings may lead to uncertainties for minority shareholders, necessitating clearer frameworks and regular disclosures.

5. **Ethical Standards and Anti-Corruption Measures (5/10)**: The assessment reveals significant gaps in the company's ethical policies, including the absence of comprehensive anti-corruption measures and training initiatives. Implementing robust policies and increasing whistleblower protections are essential for improving governance.

1. **Tax Transparency (18/20)**: The company has a commendable stance with no tax-related controversies and a minimal tax gap, indicating strong compliance and transparency. However, the recommendation for proactive communication about tax strategies suggests a slight area for improvement. Points are awarded for strong practices but deducted for the need for enhanced communication.

2. **Business Ethics (16/20)**: The company showcases a strong framework with comprehensive anti-corruption policies, employee training, and whistleblower protections. However, the lack of detailed disclosures regarding the implementation and outcomes of these policies limits the score. Points are awarded for robust ethical governance but deducted for insufficient transparency in outcomes.

3. **Accounting (17/20)**: The accounting practices are sound, with no indications of issues or weaknesses. However, the opportunity to enhance transparency through periodic disclosures of audit outcomes and internal control assessments suggests a minor area for improvement. Points are awarded for effective governance but deducted for the lack of regular disclosures.

4. **Ownership & Control (14/20)**: The ownership structure demonstrates stability, but the presence of multiple equity classes and flagged indicators regarding managing interests indicate a need for better disclosure practices. Points are awarded for stability but deducted for the need for clearer communication about governance nuances.

5. **Executive Compensation (13/20)**: The alignment of pay practices with performance is positive, but the lack of clarity on run rate concerns and guidelines for non-executive directors limits the score. Points are awarded for sound practices but deducted for the need for clearer guidelines and transparency.

6. **Board Governance (14/20)**: The board governance reflects a strong composition of independent directors, but concerns about the chair's independence and the need for improved expertise in oversight suggest areas for enhancement. Points are awarded for the independent structure but deducted for the need for recruitment of industry experts.

1. **Board Independence and Structure (20/30)**: The separation of the chairman and CEO roles is a positive aspect, and the presence of a senior independent director supports board dynamics. However, the classification of the chair as non-independent and the lack of clear metrics regarding independent directors present governance risks that need addressing.

2. **Board Composition and Transparency (15/20)**: While the majority of directors maintain independence from management, there is insufficient information on the independence of directors concerning various interests and related-party transactions. Improved communication and comprehensive disclosures are necessary.

3. **Executive Compensation Practices (15/20)**: The alignment of annual bonuses with performance metrics is a strength, but there are issues with long-term performance metrics and compensation misalignment with total shareholder return. Refining long-term incentive plans and increasing transparency in pay benchmarking are recommended.

4. **Ethical Standards and Compliance (15/20)**: The company demonstrates a commitment to ethical standards, but there are gaps in reporting on employee training and the anti-money laundering framework. Enhancing disclosures and adopting robust policies in these areas is essential.

5. **Ownership Structure and Shareholder Rights (10/10)**: Concerns regarding the ownership structure and lack of explicit information on controlling shareholders highlight the need for transparency. Establishing mechanisms for equitable treatment of all shareholders and clarifying provisions around shareholder rights are crucial.

Points are awarded for strong compliance but deducted for the need for enhanced transparency in tax planning.

2. **Business Ethics (16/20)**: The company shows a strong commitment to business ethics with comprehensive policies, board oversight, and employee training. However, concerns regarding exposure to corruption risk due to insufficient data on operations in high-risk areas indicate a need for better disclosure.

3. **Accounting Integrity (17/20)**: The accounting practices reflect stability and transparency, with no investigations or auditor concerns. However, the evaluation could benefit from commentary on accounting policies and improvements over time. Points are awarded for effective governance but deducted for the lack of detailed disclosures.

Points are awarded for a generally healthy governance structure but deducted for the need for clearer disclosures.

Additionally, the need for more context regarding severance vesting conditions suggests areas for improvement. Points are awarded for sound practices but deducted for the need to address stakeholder feedback.

**20 out of 100**",20,"Based on the evaluation summary provided, here is a detailed breakdown of the governance performance rating:

1. **Tax Transparency (17/20)**: The company demonstrates a commendable commitment to tax practices with no involvement in controversies and a low tax gap. However, the recommendation for additional information on tax strategy and community engagement suggests a minor area for improvement. Points are awarded for strong compliance but deducted for the need for enhanced transparency.

2. **Business Ethics (16/20)**: The company has a robust governance structure for ethics, including a dedicated committee, anti-corruption policies, and employee training. However, the lack of metrics to gauge the effectiveness of training and ethical culture initiatives indicates an area for improvement. Points are awarded for strong ethical practices but deducted for the need for better engagement with industry best practices.

3. **Accounting (18/20)**: The accounting practices are exemplary, with no investigations or auditor concerns. The timely filing of reports demonstrates sound governance. However, the need for more insights into accounting policies and practices limits the score slightly. Points are awarded for effective governance but deducted for the lack of detailed disclosures.

4. **Ownership and Control (14/20)**: The governance model is well-structured with a diverse shareholder base and minimal risks. However, the need for more deliberation on shareholder engagement mechanisms suggests an area for improvement. Points are awarded for a healthy governance structure but deducted for the need for clearer communication regarding shareholder engagement.

5. **Pay (15/20)**: The pay practices align with best practices, with links to sustainability performance and adherence to clawback policies. However, the lack of detailed disclosures about performance metrics linked to short-term incentives limits the score. Points are awarded for sound practices but deducted for the need for enhanced transparency.

6. **Board Governance (15/20)**: The board governance structure is robust, with a majority of independent directors and a commitment to diversity. However, the lack of information on evaluation processes for board effectiveness suggests an area for improvement. Points are awarded for strong governance but deducted for the need for better transparency regarding board evaluations.

1. **Board Independence and Structure (25/30)**: The non-executive chair is independent, and there is a clear separation of roles between the CEO and chair. The board has a majority of independent non-executive directors, which is a positive indicator. However, the lack of information regarding the percentage of executive directors on the board suggests a need for greater transparency.

2. **Related-Party Transactions (10/20)**: The absence of detailed information about compliance and related-party transactions raises concerns about accountability in financial dealings. Expanding transparency in this area is necessary to provide stakeholders with insights.

3. **Executive Compensation Practices (15/20)**: The company shows a strong commitment to linking executive pay with sustainability metrics and provides detailed pay disclosures. However, insufficient data regarding the CEO's total awarded pay and other compensation elements obscures effective evaluation, indicating a need for improved disclosure practices.

4. **Ownership and Control (10/20)**: There is a significant lack of information regarding ownership structures, including controlling shareholders and cross-shareholdings. This absence of critical details raises concerns for minority shareholders and necessitates enhanced disclosure about ownership structures and voting rights.

5. **Ethical Governance and Compliance (10/10)**: The company demonstrates a commitment to ethical governance, but several key indicators are flagged due to a lack of explicit information. Increasing transparency in anti-corruption policies, employee training, and supplier policies would bolster stakeholder trust.

**20 out of 100**",20,"Based on the evaluation summary provided, here is a detailed breakdown of the governance performance rating:

1. **Tax Transparency (12/20)**: The company has ongoing tax controversies and a substantial tax payable liability, which raises concerns about its tax governance practices. While the company has disclosed these liabilities, the need for improved communication around tax strategies and dispute resolutions indicates an area for enhancement. Points are awarded for transparency in disclosures but deducted for the presence of controversies and insufficient communication.

2. **Business Ethics (13/20)**: The company has a generally robust framework with independent oversight and clear anti-bribery policies. However, significant shortcomings exist in employee training, the absence of an anti-money laundering policy, and lack of regular audits. Points are awarded for the existing framework but deducted for the need for comprehensive training and policy development.

3. **Accounting (10/20)**: The company is currently under investigation for its commercial practices, which is a significant concern. Although there are no auditor concerns or internal control weaknesses, the ongoing investigation necessitates greater transparency in accounting matters. Points are awarded for the absence of related auditor issues but deducted for the investigation and lack of disclosures.

4. **Ownership & Control (14/20)**: The ownership structure is healthy, with no controlling shareholders, but the lack of detail regarding the overall ownership structure limits understanding of potential influences on governance. Points are awarded for a generally sound structure but deducted for the need for clearer disclosures.

5. **Pay (11/20)**: The executive compensation practices have established frameworks, but the lack of information on CEO equity policies, potential dilution, and extreme pay ranges raises concerns. Points are awarded for existing frameworks but deducted for insufficient transparency and clarity in compensation practices.

6. **Board Governance (13/20)**: The board has a largely independent composition, but the absence of disclosures regarding related-party transactions poses risks to integrity and public trust. Points are awarded for the independent structure but deducted for the lack of transparency regarding related-party transactions.

2. **Executive Pay and Performance (15/20)**: There is commendable alignment between short-term pay incentives and performance metrics. However, concerns regarding long-term pay practices and the absence of information about equity holdings and peer benchmarks suggest that the company should establish clearer pay guidelines.

3. **Ownership and Control Structures (10/20)**: While there are no controlling shareholders, significant gaps in the disclosure of the company's capital structure raise concerns about minority shareholder rights. The company needs to articulate its ownership structure more clearly to foster trust among stakeholders.

4. **Auditing Practices and Accounting Oversight (15/20)**: The assessment of auditing practices is largely positive, with no significant issues identified. However, the lack of specific disclosures regarding auditing practices and engagement with external auditors indicates a need for greater transparency.

**20 out of 100**",20,"Based on the evaluation summary provided, here is a detailed breakdown of the governance performance rating:

1. **Tax Transparency (10/20)**: The company has no ongoing tax controversies, but the lack of information regarding tax practices and the absence of an estimated tax gap raise concerns. Points are awarded for the absence of controversies but deducted for insufficient transparency and communication.

2. **Business Ethics (15/20)**: The company demonstrates a robust ethical governance framework with a board-level committee and comprehensive training. However, the lack of quantification regarding operations in high-risk areas and insufficient details on whistleblower policy effectiveness indicate areas for improvement. Points are awarded for the strong framework but deducted for the lack of specific data.

3. **Accounting Practices (16/20)**: The accounting practices are well-structured with no investigations or auditor concerns. However, the absence of specific information regarding auditor independence and potential restatements leaves room for skepticism. Points are awarded for effective governance but deducted for the lack of transparency in auditing processes.

4. **Ownership and Control (14/20)**: The ownership structure is commendable with no significant control by any single shareholder, which benefits minority shareholders. However, vagueness regarding bylaws amendments and shareholder requisition rights suggests a need for improvement. Points are awarded for a healthy structure but deducted for insufficient clarity on governance policies.

5. **Compensation Structure (12/20)**: The compensation policies show some alignment with performance metrics, but significant gaps exist in transparency regarding sustainability-linked pay and clawback policies. Points are awarded for existing alignment but deducted for the lack of clarity and potential concerns about fairness.

6. **Board Governance (13/20)**: The board governance shows strengths in independence and separation of roles, but concerns about the independence of the board chair and the lack of designated lead directors indicate areas for improvement. Points are awarded for the independent structure but deducted for insufficient disclosure regarding board composition and roles.

**Total Score Calculation**: 
- Tax Transparency: 10
- Business Ethics: 15
- Accounting Practices: 16
- Ownership and Control: 14
- Compensation Structure: 12

Thus, the final rating is: **80 out of 100**. 

In the required format: **80\s+out\s+of\s+100**.",80,"Based on the Governance Indicators Report, the company's governance performance can be evaluated as follows:

1. **Board Independence and Leadership Effectiveness (15/30)**: The presence of a non-independent chair and the absence of an independent lead director raise significant concerns about governance. While the majority of directors are independent of management, the lack of clarity regarding their independence from other interests is troubling. Recommendations for improvement include appointing an independent lead director and establishing clear policies for assessing independence.

2. **Board Composition (15/20)**: The majority of directors are classified as independent, which is positive. However, the absence of substantial information regarding the independence of directors from other interests and the presence of overboarded directors pose risks to effective governance. Improving transparency and placing limits on board service would enhance governance capacity.

3. **Executive Compensation Practices (10/20)**: There are substantial concerns regarding the alignment of executive compensation with performance metrics. The lack of disclosure related to the CEO's equity holdings and the absence of clawback policies indicate gaps in accountability. The company needs to develop robust compensation practices that align with both short-term and long-term performance criteria.

4. **Ownership and Control Structures (10/20)**: The lack of information regarding potential controlling shareholders and their influence is a significant concern. Without clarity on shareholder dynamics, it is challenging to assess risks associated with minority shareholder interests. Enhancing transparency regarding ownership structures is essential.

5. **Internal Controls and Ethical Practices (10/10)**: The company demonstrates solid internal controls with no material weaknesses identified. However, previous restatements based on new accounting standards suggest the need for further investigation. Strengthening auditing processes and enhancing transparency regarding whistleblower protections and anti-money laundering policies would improve governance.

Points are awarded for the absence of controversies but deducted for insufficient transparency.

2. **Business Ethics (14/20)**: The governance structure for business ethics is robust, with a board-level committee and comprehensive anti-corruption policies.

However, the lack of information regarding the payment structure between audit and non-audit services raises concerns about auditor independence. Points are awarded for effective governance but deducted for insufficient transparency in financial relationships.

Points are awarded for a balanced structure but deducted for the need for clearer communication about ownership dynamics.

However, the discrepancy between the CEO’s pay and the median pay for other executives suggests a need for improvement. Points are awarded for existing frameworks but deducted for the lack of internal pay equity transparency.

6. **Board Governance (14/20)**: The board governance is commendable with a majority of independent directors, but the lack of information regarding related-party transactions indicates a need for greater transparency.

**35 out of 100**",35,"Based on the evaluation summary provided, here is a detailed breakdown of the governance performance rating:

1. **Tax Transparency (12/20)**: The company has raised flags due to significant provisions for uncertain tax positions, indicating potential tax-related issues. The lack of detailed information on ongoing tax controversies limits the evaluation. Points are awarded for acknowledging the issues but deducted for insufficient transparency in disclosures.

2. **Business Ethics (10/20)**: The report indicates weaknesses in the oversight of anti-corruption policies, whistleblower protections, and employee training. The absence of specific requirements for suppliers and a whistleblower protection policy are significant gaps. Points are awarded for existing policies but deducted for the lack of comprehensive ethical frameworks.

3. **Accounting (15/20)**: The accounting practices reflect a solid foundation with no significant issues. However, the lack of specificity regarding auditor independence raises concerns. Points are awarded for effective governance but deducted for insufficient clarity on auditor relationships.

4. **Ownership & Control (14/20)**: The governance structure is robust with no controlling shareholders, but concerns about the unilateral rights of the board and lack of clear provisions for shareholders' rights indicate areas for improvement. Points are awarded for a generally healthy structure but deducted for insufficient clarity on governance processes.

5. **Pay (11/20)**: The evaluation raises concerns about the alignment of executive compensation with performance metrics and the lack of information on clawback policies. Points are awarded for existing frameworks but deducted for insufficient transparency and alignment with performance.

6. **Board Governance (13/20)**: The board has strengths in independent directors, but issues with the chair's independence and potential entrenchment due to long tenured directors raise concerns. Points are awarded for the independent structure but deducted for the need for better governance practices.

While there is a majority of independent directors, the lack of transparency regarding their independence from other interests is troubling.

2. **Board Composition (15/20)**: The majority of directors are independent, which is positive. However, the absence of specific metrics regarding the percentage of executive directors and the independence of board members from other interests indicates a need for improved disclosures.

3. **Executive Compensation Practices (10/20)**: Although there are mechanisms linking pay to performance, critical information about the correlation of CEO compensation with long-term performance metrics is lacking. The company should implement comprehensive guidelines to ensure that executive compensation practices are equitable and transparently aligned with organizational goals.

4. **Ownership and Control (10/20)**: The absence of a controlling shareholder is a positive aspect, but significant gaps in understanding ownership dynamics, such as dispersal of ownership and potential cross-shareholdings, suggest a need for more detailed reporting to mitigate governance risks.

5. **Ethical Governance and Risk Management (5/10)**: The assessment reveals substantial weaknesses in documenting policies around anti-corruption, whistleblower protections, and employee training on ethical standards. Strengthening these areas through comprehensive documentation and transparency is essential for fostering an ethical organizational culture.

1. **Tax Transparency (17/20)**: The company shows a commendable lack of involvement in tax-related controversies, indicating effective tax compliance. However, the need for proactive communication regarding tax practices suggests a minor area for improvement. Points are awarded for strong practices but deducted for the lack of detailed disclosures.

2. **Business Ethics (15/20)**: The company has a robust framework for business ethics, including strong anti-corruption policies and whistleblower protections. However, the lack of information regarding exposure to corruption risk indicates an area for enhancement. Points are awarded for existing policies but deducted for insufficient risk assessment disclosures.

3. **Accounting Practices (16/20)**: The accounting practices are solid, with no investigations or negative auditor reports. However, the lack of detailed insights into potential late filings or material restatements suggests an area for improvement in transparency. Points are awarded for effective governance but deducted for insufficient disclosures.

4. **Ownership & Control (14/20)**: The ownership structure is stable with no controlling shareholders, promoting balanced governance. However, gaps in disclosures regarding multiple equity classes with differing voting rights indicate a need for improvement. Points are awarded for a healthy structure but deducted for the lack of clarity.

Points are awarded for existing alignment but deducted for insufficient integration of sustainability.

6. **Board Governance (13/20)**: The board governance reflects a strong structure with independent directors, but the lack of gender diversity raises concerns.

4. **Shareholder Rights and Ownership Structures (10/20)**: While there are no explicit concerns regarding controlling shareholders, the lack of clarity on ownership and voting rights, including supermajority requirements, raises potential issues for shareholder influence. Establishing comprehensive shareholder rights policies is essential for enhancing governance practices.
