Taylor Wimpey plc,"Based on the evaluation summary provided, here is the detailed rating breakdown for the company's governance performance:

1. **Tax Transparency (18/20)**: The company demonstrates commendable tax transparency with no ongoing controversies, reflecting a proactive approach to compliance. Points are awarded for the positive standing, but a minor deduction is made for the lack of regular public reporting on tax strategies.

2. **Business Ethics (16/20)**: The company has established comprehensive policies and oversight mechanisms for business ethics and anti-corruption. The presence of training programs and whistleblower protections is commendable. However, the lack of information on sustainability-related training leads to a slight deduction.

3. **Accounting (17/20)**: The accounting practices are robust, with no indications of internal investigations or auditor concerns. The absence of restatements and effective internal controls are strengths. A minor deduction is made for the lack of details on how the company addresses emerging accounting issues.

4. **Ownership & Control (14/20)**: The ownership structure is stable, with no significant concerns, but the presence of multiple classes of shares with different voting rights raises potential issues for minority shareholders. Points are awarded for the balanced approach, but a deduction is made for the unequal voting rights.

5. **Pay (14/20)**: The company aligns executive pay with performance metrics effectively, but the lack of ties to sustainability performance and absence of ownership guidelines for non-executive directors represent areas for improvement. Points are awarded for the positive aspects but deducted for the gaps.

6. **Board Governance (13/20)**: The board has a robust governance structure with an independent chair and a majority of independent members.

1. **Tax Transparency (17/20)**: The company has a commendable stance with no tax-related controversies and a minimal tax gap, indicating strong compliance. However, the recommendation for proactive communication about tax strategies suggests a minor area for improvement.

2. **Business Ethics (16/20)**: The company showcases a strong framework with comprehensive anti-corruption policies and employee training. While the internal oversight mechanisms are effective, the need for more detailed disclosures regarding the implementation and outcomes of these policies leads to a slight deduction.

However, the opportunity to enhance transparency through periodic disclosures of audit outcomes and internal control assessments results in a minor deduction.

Points are awarded for the overall stability but deducted for the lack of clarity.

5. **Executive Compensation (14/20)**: The alignment of pay practices with performance is positive, but the lack of clarity on run rate concerns and guidelines for non-executive directors suggests areas needing attention. Points are awarded for the structured approach but deducted for the gaps in clarity.

1. **Tax Transparency (17/20)**: The company shows a commendable commitment to strong tax practices with no involvement in tax controversies and a low tax gap.

2. **Business Ethics (16/20)**: The company demonstrates robust business ethics with a comprehensive governance structure, including a board-level ethics committee and anti-corruption policies. While the foundation is strong, the opportunity for improvement in measuring the effectiveness of training and ethical culture initiatives results in a slight deduction.

3. **Accounting (18/20)**: The accounting practices are exemplary, with no internal or regulatory investigations and timely filings. However, the lack of insights into accounting policies and practices regarding estimates and judgments leads to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the strong integrity.

4. **Ownership and Control (14/20)**: The governance model is well-structured with a diverse shareholder base and minimal risks. However, the need for more deliberation on shareholder engagement mechanisms leads to a deduction. Points are awarded for the overall governance structure but deducted for the lack of clarity in engagement processes.

5. **Pay (15/20)**: The pay practices align with best practices, linking compensation to sustainability performance and adhering to clawback policies. However, the need for more detailed disclosures about performance metrics linked to short-term incentives leads to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the positive aspects but deducted for the gaps in transparency.

1. **Tax Transparency (12/20)**: The company has no ongoing tax controversies, but the lack of information regarding tax practices and the absence of an estimated tax gap leads to a flagged status. Points are awarded for the absence of disputes but deducted for insufficient transparency.

2. **Business Ethics (15/20)**: The company demonstrates a robust ethical governance framework with a board-level committee, anti-corruption policy, and employee training.

1. **Tax Transparency (16/20)**: The company demonstrates a commendable lack of involvement in ongoing tax controversies, indicating effective tax compliance. However, the need for proactive communication regarding tax practices leads to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the positive standing.

2. **Business Ethics (15/20)**: The company has a robust framework for business ethics, with strong anti-corruption policies and whistleblower protections. However, the gap in assessing exposure to corruption risk leads to a slight deduction. Points are awarded for the strong ethical framework.

Severn Trent Plc,"Based on the evaluation summary provided, here is the detailed rating breakdown for the company's governance performance:

1. **Tax Transparency (15/20)**: The company shows a lack of involvement in tax controversies, indicating a strong commitment to transparency. However, the need for ongoing disclosure regarding tax policies and practices leads to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the positive standing but deducted for insufficient detail on tax strategy and risk exposure.

2. **Business Ethics (14/20)**: The company has a robust framework for business ethics, including a board-level committee and anti-corruption policies. However, concerns regarding operations in high-risk geographies and the need for clearer insights into employee training and ethical audits lead to a deduction. Points are awarded for the strong ethical framework.

3. **Accounting Practices (17/20)**: The accounting practices are sound, with no investigations or auditor concerns. However, the lack of information regarding the tenure of the auditing firm raises questions about auditor independence, leading to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the overall integrity of accounting practices.

4. **Ownership & Control (13/20)**: The ownership structure is favorable with no controlling shareholders, but the lack of detail on ownership distribution and minority shareholders' rights leads to a deduction. Points are awarded for the positive governance environment but deducted for the lack of clarity.

5. **Compensation and Pay (12/20)**: The alignment of executive pay with sustainability initiatives is a strength, but gaps in CEO equity policies, pay transparency, and potential extremes in compensation relative to peers lead to a deduction. Points are awarded for the existing frameworks but deducted for the gaps in transparency.

6. **Board Governance (13/20)**: The board governance is well-structured with independent directors, but concerns about the balance of power due to the presence of executive directors and the lack of diversity indicators lead to a deduction. Points are awarded for the overall governance strength but deducted for the identified weaknesses.

1. **Tax Transparency (17/20)**: The company has no ongoing tax controversies and a low estimated tax gap, indicating strong tax integrity and compliance. However, the need for additional information about tax strategies and community contributions leads to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the positive standing.

2. **Business Ethics (16/20)**: The company has a well-structured framework for business ethics, including a board-level committee, anti-corruption policy, and regular employee training. However, the absence of publicly disclosed training metrics and effectiveness evaluations leads to a slight deduction. Points are awarded for the strong ethical framework.

3. **Accounting (16/20)**: The accounting governance structure is robust, with no significant concerns or flags. However, the raised flag regarding auditor independence due to higher non-audit service payments leads to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the overall integrity of accounting practices.

4. **Ownership & Control (15/20)**: The ownership structure is stable with no controlling shareholders, promoting equitable governance. However, the lack of proactive communication regarding shareholder engagement practices leads to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the positive governance environment.

5. **Pay (13/20)**: The executive compensation structure shows strong alignment with performance metrics, but the absence of links to sustainability performance and a significant vote against pay practices lead to a deduction. Points are awarded for the existing frameworks but deducted for the gaps in transparency.

6. **Board Governance (14/20)**: The board governance reflects best practices with a majority of independent directors and adequate female representation.

1. **Tax Transparency (12/20)**: The company has ongoing tax matters but lacks specific information regarding controversies or estimated tax gaps. This limits insight into its tax practices and highlights a need for improved transparency. Points are awarded for the absence of controversies but deducted for insufficient disclosure.

2. **Business Ethics (11/20)**: The presence of a Responsible Business Committee and a whistleblower protection policy indicates a proactive approach to ethics. However, the absence of a formal bribery and anti-corruption policy and the lack of documented audits lead to a significant deduction. Points are awarded for the existing framework but deducted for critical inadequacies.

3. **Accounting (16/20)**: The accounting environment is robust, with no internal investigations or auditor concerns. However, the lack of transparency regarding auditor fee breakdown raises questions about auditor independence, leading to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the overall integrity of accounting practices.

4. **Ownership & Control (13/20)**: The ownership structure is favorable with independent directors and no controlling shareholders. However, gaps in information regarding minority shareholder concerns and potential barriers to equitable treatment during takeovers lead to a deduction. Points are awarded for the positive governance environment but deducted for the lack of clarity.

5. **Pay (13/20)**: The executive pay structure is positively perceived, particularly with the minimum shareholding requirement for the CEO. However, the lack of information on sustainability in executive compensation and absence of a clawback policy indicate areas for improvement. Points are awarded for the existing frameworks but deducted for the gaps in transparency.

6. **Board Governance (12/20)**: The board composition includes numerous independent directors, but concerns regarding the independence of board committees and overboarded directors lead to a deduction.

1. **Tax Transparency (17/20)**: The company has no ongoing tax-related controversies, indicating strong transparency practices. However, the recommendation for enhanced disclosures regarding tax strategies and compliance measures leads to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the positive standing.

2. **Business Ethics (13/20)**: The company has a structured approach to business ethics with a Responsible Business Committee and established anti-corruption policies. However, the absence of specific policies for suppliers, whistleblower protections, and employee training programs leads to a deduction. Points are awarded for the existing framework but deducted for the gaps.

3. **Accounting Practices (16/20)**: The accounting practices reflect a solid foundation with no investigations or auditor concerns. However, the unclear tenure of the external audit firm raises potential transparency issues, leading to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the overall integrity of accounting practices.

4. **Ownership & Control (14/20)**: The ownership structure is stable with no concentration of control among shareholders. However, flagged indicators regarding dispersed ownership and variable interest entities suggest a need for clarification. Points are awarded for the positive governance environment but deducted for the lack of detail.

5. **Executive Pay (12/20)**: The executive compensation aligns with established guidelines, but the absence of information on clawback policies and sustainability links leads to a deduction. Points are awarded for the existing frameworks but deducted for the gaps in transparency.

6. **Board Governance (13/20)**: The board governance shows a strong foundation with an independent Chair and separation of roles. However, concerns regarding the number of independent directors and related-party transactions lead to a deduction. Points are awarded for the overall governance strength but deducted for the identified weaknesses.

1. **Tax Transparency (16/20)**: The company has no involvement in tax-related controversies, indicating strong compliance and proactive measures.

Points are awarded for the positive standing but deducted slightly for insufficient detail.

2. **Business Ethics (14/20)**: The company demonstrates a comprehensive ethical governance structure with board oversight and anti-corruption policies. However, the absence of dynamic elements such as case studies or measurable outcomes from training programs leads to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the strong ethical framework.

However, the acknowledgment of material weaknesses in IT general controls indicates a need for improvement, leading to a minor deduction. Points are awarded for the overall integrity of accounting practices.

4. **Ownership & Control (13/20)**: The ownership structure is stable with no significant risks, but the lack of detailed exploration of ownership distribution and shareholder engagement mechanisms leads to a deduction. Points are awarded for the positive governance environment but deducted for the lack of clarity.

5. **Pay (12/20)**: The executive compensation practices show responsible alignment with performance metrics, but concerns regarding long-term pay performance relative to shareholder returns and the lack of sustainability integration lead to a deduction. Points are awarded for the existing frameworks but deducted for the gaps in transparency.
