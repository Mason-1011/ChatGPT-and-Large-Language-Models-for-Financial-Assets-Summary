Sustainability

We are determined to be the leading 
national sustainable housebuilder. 
We were recognised on the CDP Climate 
Change A List for Leadership, one of 
fewer than 300 companies worldwide. 
We believe that fundamental to building 
quality homes is building a positive 
environmental, social and economic 
legacy for future generations. This is 
reflected in our ambitious targets 
and clear plans and actions. 

Build quality

Build quality is monitored across our developments by the NHBC. 
There are five key stages in the home building process, each 
marked by NHBC inspections and the logging of reportable items, 
(RIs). Barratt has delivered the lowest rate of RIs across the 
major housebuilders consistently for each of the last four years, 
highlighting our focus on build quality controls and high standards 
across our developments.

Scale

We are the largest housebuilder in 
the UK with our operations spanning 
England, Scotland and Wales and 
encompassing both greenfield 
development and brownfield 
regeneration activities. Through our 
network of 29 divisions, we deliver 
more homes than any other 
housebuilder across the UK.

Employees committed 
to excellence

Our site managers compete every year to secure 
industry-wide recognition for their management 
of excellent site standards and build quality, through 
the Pride in the Job Awards. Our site managers won 
96 awards in 2023 – more than any other housebuilder 
for the 19th year running.

Future Homes Hub

Our Chief Executive and other members of the senior leadership 
team are playing leading roles in the Future Homes Hub. This 
organisation brings together the housebuilding sector, the wider 
supply chain, the infrastructure sector, finance and the 
Government to ensure we, as an industry, have a long-term 
delivery plan for the sector in line with the Government’s legally 
binding net zero target.

 See page 64

Strategic land

Land remains the foundation of our business. Our current land 
bank provides the land we require in the short to medium term 
to support our development activity. Our strategic land supports 
our long-term growth, securing land for future development 
but without committing to current land values.

During the year we have expanded our strategic land bank 
by more than 10,000 plots and we held 101,784 plots of strategic 
land at the year end. 

Future leaders 

Through our internal development programmes we are 
committed to developing the potential of our employees and 
developing our leaders of the future. 

Our “Catalyst” programme is designed to help high potential 
female employees develop their careers within the Group. 
Our “Rising Stars” programme seeks to identify and support our 
diverse future leaders across all aspects of the Group’s activities.

Homes for everyone

Everyone deserves a safe and affordable home, 
whether buying, or renting in the public or private 
rental sectors. We build homes for everyone. 
During the year, we completed 12,456 homes for 
private homebuyers and those looking to rent in 
the private rental sector, as well as 3,922 affordable 
new homes, sold at 55% below the average price 
of private new homes completed in the year.

Helping address cost 
of living pressures

Our customers unlock significant annual 
savings by moving into our new build homes. 
The average new house buyer is saving more 
than £180 per month or £2,200 per year on 
energy bills, when compared with purchasers 
of equivalent older houses. Our customers also 
benefit from lower utility costs through reduced 
water usage. Beyond the compelling financial 
benefits, our new homes dramatically lower 
carbon emissions for our customers too.

This is the first time we have moved

Barratt not just because of the style,

always on hand to answer questions; 
we felt absolutely at ease with them.”

The backdrop
The housebuilding industry is in a period of adjustment, reflecting the impact of inflation and the 
subsequent changes in the cost of living and mortgage interest rates. These dynamics remain 
significant in the near term but the long-term need for additional housing is clear.

We will manage these near-term challenges and ensure we emerge a stronger business, 
capable and ready to deliver the high quality, energy efficient, sustainable homes the 
country so desperately needs.

Shorter owned land bank
We operate an efficient “build and sell” 
model. We seek to run one of the shortest 
but most developable land banks in the 
industry. As soon as land is acquired, we 
look to begin development at the earliest 
opportunity, to drive our build efficiency and 
home completions. This minimises capital 
employed and brings forward returns, 
resulting in greater value for investors.

Strong balance sheet  
and cash generation
We maintain strong financial discipline, 
recognising the cyclicality of the industry 
in which we operate. We maintain a 
strong balance sheet with a focus on 
cash generation and a clearly defined 
operating framework. 

Highly experienced build  
and sales teams
We have an experienced management team 
and workforce as well as long-standing 
and committed sub-contractors who 
schedule, manage and deliver our high 
quality, sustainable homes to exacting 
standards. Our experienced teams also 
leverage our reputation around build 
quality, customer service, national scale 
and financial strength to unlock additional 
sales channels with our significant 
expansion in the private rental sector. 

Quality and service
Build quality and customer service are 
fundamental to our business and customer 
trust. Our build quality is recognised as 
industry-leading through the external 
checks on our homes during the build 
process, as well as a 19-year unbroken 
record in the industry’s Pride in the Job 
Awards. We are the only major housebuilder 
to be awarded a 5 star rating for customer 
satisfaction for 14 consecutive years.

Nationally diversified
We operate throughout England, Scotland 
and Wales. We design and build homes 
that meet local market demand, from 
one-bedroom apartments to five and 
six-bedroom homes. We deliver homes 
for private homebuyers, social landlords 
and the private rental sector, supplying 
the desperately needed high quality, 
sustainable new homes across this 
variety of tenures.

Leading in sustainability
We are the leading national sustainable 
housebuilder. Our ambitious targets are 
supported by clear plans and action. 
We lead the industry in developing and 
testing the step-change in future home 
designs, which will allow the industry 
deliver net zero at scale. We believe that 
fundamental to building quality homes is 
building a positive environmental, social 
and economic legacy for future generations.

Chair’s Statement

Strong and resilient

The Group is well placed to navigate the challenging market 
backdrop, continuing to deliver the high-quality, sustainable 
homes that are needed across the country.

Committed to leading the future of housebuilding 
for our customers
I am pleased to present my first Annual Report as Chair, having 
taken over from John Allan on 30 June 2023. I joined the Group 
at the end of a financial year in which we delivered a strong 
operational and financial performance whilst maintaining our 
industry-leading quality, customer service and sustainability 
credentials, against a backdrop of both political and economic 
instability. Our balance sheet, with net cash of £1,069m, is 
robust and provides the financial strength and flexibility to 
ensure we can manage through this period of uncertainty and 
emerge well positioned for the future.

As part of my induction, I have met with our senior leadership 
team, employees and external stakeholders, which has helped 
me to gain a good understanding of the business and how it 
operates. It is evident that there is a strong internal culture of 
‘doing the right thing’, as well as a desire throughout the 
organisation to ensure everyone has the opportunity to develop 
to their full potential within a diverse and inclusive workplace. I 
have been very impressed with the dedication and commitment 
of our senior leadership team, and with the passion and purpose 
of all our colleagues across the business. 

Our focus on leading the industry in terms of customer service, 
quality and sustainability is evidenced through the achievement 
of the HBF 5 star rating for the 14th consecutive year, 96 NHBC 
Pride in the Job Awards for our site managers and by the Group 
joining the CDP Climate Change A List for Leadership, one of 
fewer than 300 companies worldwide. The industry’s 
contribution to climate change makes it imperative that we 
continually scrutinise and challenge the ways in which we 
operate, as well as the environmental and social impact of 
our business. I am delighted to have joined a Group with both 
a successful history and a clear focus on its leading role in 
developing the sustainable homes of the future. (For more 
information on the HBF customer satisfaction survey see 
pages 30, on Pride in the Job Awards see page 33 and on 
our approach to sustainability see pages 40 to 49.)

The Board recognises that we must manage the Group through 
what is likely to be a more challenging period of trading, but we 
will remain focused on managing these risks and challenges 
whilst ensuring the Group is in the best possible position to 
create long-term value for all our stakeholders.

Caroline Silver
Chair

The future
Looking ahead, we recognise that there are significant  
macro-economic headwinds, most notably the continuing 
inflationary pressures and the resulting interest rate 
environment which is impacting mortgage affordability and 
availability in the UK as well as economic growth, employment 
and consumer confidence and spending.

We are in a strong position to deal with these challenges with a 
proven operational team, a prudent net cash balance and a solid 
forward sales position. The experienced senior management 
team are responding to market conditions by driving revenue 
through the efforts of our sales teams across the country 
with the focused use of incentives, as well as diversification 
to secure sales into the private rental sector.

The Board will continue to monitor changes in both the housing 
and land markets, as well as the wider economy, but our 
operating disciplines, forward order book and strong financial 
position provide us with resilience and flexibility to adjust to 
changes in the operating environment in the year ahead, 
and as the market evolves thereafter. 

Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would like to express our 
thanks to our colleagues and our supply chain for their 
commitment to the Group, both over the last year, and as we 
look forward to the year ahead. On a personal note, I also look 
forward to meeting many more colleagues as I get around more 
of the Group’s operations in the coming year.

Caroline Silver
Chair
5 September 2023

Board changes
There have been several changes in the composition 
of the Board during FY23. 

Jasi Halai joined the Board as an Independent Non-Executive 
Director on 1 January 2023 and, as announced later in January, 
I joined as a Non-Executive Director and Chair designate on 
1 June 2023. Full biographical details and membership of 
Committees can be found on pages 102 to 105 and details of the 
recruitment processes can be found on page 119.

John Allan stepped down from the Board on 30 June 2023. John 
played a key role in the Group’s development since joining the 
Board in August 2014 and taking up the role of Chair in 
November 2014. His experience and dedication were invaluable 
and the Board wishes John well for the future.

As announced in January this year, Dame Sharon White decided 
to step down early from her position as a Non-Executive Director 
on 30 June 2023, after more than five years of service on the 
Board, due to her other commitments. The Board would like to 
express thanks to Sharon for her dedication and service.

Finally, I am pleased that Nigel Webb has agreed to join the Board 
as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 October 2023. 
Nigel brings a wealth of property, construction and land 
experience to the Board, which complements the skills of the 
existing Board members. Further details can be found on page 117.

We will continue to assess our composition and that of our 
committees, considering the recommendations of the FTSE 
Women Leaders Review, the Parker reviews and the McGregor-
Smith review. For information on the diversity of the Board 
please see page 117.

Shareholder returns
The Board declared an interim dividend for FY23 of 10.2 pence 
per share (FY22: interim dividend of 11.2 pence per share) and is 
pleased to recommend a final FY23 dividend of 23.5 pence per 
share (FY22: final dividend of 25.7 pence per share) in line with 
our dividend policy of maintaining cover at two times.

Subject to shareholder approval, the final dividend will be paid 
on 3 November 2023 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 29 September 2023. Shareholders who 
elect for the Dividend Reinvestment Plan should do so by 
13 October 2023.

The total proposed dividend for FY23, including the interim 
dividend paid in May, is 33.7 pence per share (FY22: 36.9 pence 
per share) lower than last year, reflecting the reduction in 
adjusted earnings per share, offset by the reduction of dividend 
cover to two times. We also returned surplus capital during the 
financial year with a £200m share buyback programme.

The Board has reviewed our capital allocation policy in light of 
current market conditions. In principle, the Board continues to 
believe that excess capital should be returned to shareholders 
when it is appropriate to do so. Whilst the Company remains 
in a strong financial position, the UK housing market remains 
difficult and the outlook remains uncertain. We have therefore 
agreed that whilst our reduction in dividend cover to 1.75 times 
will apply from FY24 as planned, there will be no further share 
buybacks at this stage. The Board will continue to review the 
capital allocation policy as market conditions develop.

How we build value

Our resources

People 
Barratt recruits, trains and retains an 
experienced and committed workforce. 
Our people’s experience supports 
delivery of a high quality product. 

Expertise
The Group, established in 1958, has deep 
knowledge and expertise in the design 
and construction of housing in the UK, 
both in conventional brick built properties 
and through the use of timber frame. 
Barratt continues to advance its 
capabilities through investments such as 
in the Zed House and Energy House 2.0.

Stakeholder relationships
Barratt builds great places to live 
through partnerships in the supply chain, 
with JV partners in our build programmes, 
and with local communities as part of our 
site planning and development. 
We develop innovative products to 
support home ownership in conjunction 
with mortgage lenders. Our strong 
relationships with our stakeholders are 
critical in developing the products that 
our customers want. 

Land and planning
Barratt’s owned land bank is short 
by design, but is complemented by 
investment into strategic land and 
promotional agreements. Through its 
acquisition of Gladman in 2022, the Group 
has sought to increase its level of 
in-house land expertise to drive margin 
and deliver a better return on capital. 

Finances
The Group’s financial position and 
balance sheet are robust, giving the 
Group confidence, irrespective of market 
conditions, to deliver homes into the 
market at the right price and to engage 
in the land market with value-accretive 
bids. The Group held c. £1.1bn of cash 
as at 30 June 2023.

Competitive edge

Value for our stakeholders

We build  
homes in which  
customers want  
to live, in locations 
where people  
want to live

We do this with an 
experienced team 
which delivers the 
best homes on 
the market

We operate 
nationally and  
at scale, rapidly 
converting our land 
bank to cash

We see  
sustainability  
as a differentiator, 
and a way to 
create value

We have the financial resources, in-house 
expertise and stakeholder network to allow 
us to tender for land in desirable locations 
around the UK. We use our knowhow and 
the experience of our people, supported by 
our three complementary brands, to design 
and build developments which delight our 
customers, support local communities and 
deliver competitive returns for our investors. 

Total home completions

17,206

Our customers tell us that our homes are 
the best in the market. For 14 years in a 
row, we have been 5 star rated by the Home 
Builders Federation, meaning over 90% of 
our customers would recommend us to a 
friend. In addition, in 2023, our site managers 
won 96 Pride in the Job Quality awards, the 
19th year in a row that Barratt has won more 
awards than any other housebuilder. 

HBF customer satisfaction rating

5 star

We are the UK’s biggest housebuilder by 
volume and we operate with a national 
footprint. This allows us to leverage 
economies of scale across our supply chain, 
deploy our capital into attractive development 
opportunities across the country and more 
easily navigate an increasingly complex 
regulatory environment. 

Average active sales outlets

367

We seek to lead the industry to a more 
sustainable future, both as a responsible 
home builder, and to develop better, more 
affordable products for our customers which 
are easier to finance. We are investing in 
projects such as the Energy Home 2.0 to 
understand how this can be done, both to 
see how such housing can be built and to 
understand how our customers can benefit 
from the change. 

Scope 1 & 2 carbon intensity

23.7% reduction

vs. FY18 

Customers
We deliver high quality, energy efficient 
homes, with 99% of our homes being 
EPC A or B-rated. This means our homes 
should have running costs that are lower 
than average. 

Employees
We offer a great place to work which is 
focused on performance and personal 
development and invest in our people both 
through training and longer-term career 
development. We support our people through 
economic challenges with help such as our 
£1,000 cost of living payment and invest in 
their health and wellbeing.

Shareholders
We deliver capital returns, having declared 
dividends each year since 2013, and in 2023 
we completed a £200m share buy-back 
programme. With our operating framework, 
we aim to balance business growth with cash 
returns and seek to develop markets for our 
products, whether through private sales, bulk 
deals or the private rental sector.

Suppliers
We nurture our supplier relationships by 
being honest and transparent, giving forward 
visibility on both demand and workload. We 
work with our suppliers to help develop the 
next generation of housing. 

Communities
We seek to create a positive legacy in our 
developments, incorporating affordable 
housing alongside private sales. We increase 
biodiversity on our sites, creating a space for 
nature and for communities to thrive, and 
invest to improve community infrastructure 
as part of our planning gain contributions. 

Wider society
In 2023 we paid £186.0m in direct taxation 
and a further £251.7m in indirect taxes, 
driven by the sale of 17,206 homes, and 
employed 6,728 people at the year end. 
As the largest housebuilder in the UK, we 
take our responsibility to support the industry 
and our supply chain in our journey to a 
net zero future seriously. We are investing 
to understand how to get to a zero carbon 
future and are committed to reaching 
that destination.

Trends in our markets

The UK economy
UK economic output has grown by 1%1 during the 12 months to 30 
June 2023 with the last quarter to June 2023 registering 0.2% 
growth on the previous quarter from January 2023 through 
March 2023. UK monthly GDP at the end of June was 0.8% ahead 
of that prior to the onset of the pandemic in February 2020. The 
outlook for the UK economy in the remainder of 2023 and into 2024 
is uncertain. Stubborn inflationary pressures being experienced 
across the whole economy are being exacerbated by limited labour 
availability and resulting labour cost inflation. Government 
economic policies and the Bank of England’s decisions around 
interest rates, to further dampen inflation, will be critical in the 
months ahead, most notably with the Autumn Statement. 

In its March 2023 “Economic and fiscal outlook”, the Office for 
Budget Responsibility forecast a GDP decline of 0.2% in 2023 and 
growth of 1.8% in 2024. HM Treasury‘s August collated consensus 
economic forecasts suggested limited GDP growth of just 0.3%2 
in 2023 and 0.6%2 in 2024. 

Housing supply and demand
There remains a fundamental shortage of homes in the UK. 
This is evidenced both by the long-term growth in home prices 
relative to incomes and the significant inflationary pressures 
being seen in the rental market, as an ever increasing number 
of households are being failed by inadequate housing supply. 

New build housing additions in England were 210,0703 in the 
last reported 12-month period to 31 March 2022, growth of 9.5% 
on the 191,820 in the year to 31 March 2021. This recovery 
reflected strong home-buying demand following the pandemic, 
along with the industry’s drive to recover build activity following 
the national lockdown, although labour and building material 

supply chain constraints moderated the pace of this recovery. 
As a result, new home additions recovered but remained some 4% 
below the 219,120 homes completed in the year to 31 March 2020. 
Net new build additions may register growth when data is released 
in the winter of 2023, with respect to the year to 31 March 2023 
but new build additions look set to fall in the current year. This 
decline reflects the end of Help to Buy, higher mortgage interest 
rates and the consequent change in mortgage affordability. The 
participation of first time buyers in the market has sharply 
reduced in 2023.

Whilst house prices peaked in August 2022, affordability 
constraints have seen house prices move lower in the ten months 
through to June 2023. The average UK house price had reduced 
by 3.5%4 in nominal terms according to the Nationwide Building 
Society over the 12 months to 30 June 2023, which equates to a 
real terms decline, after adjusting for CPI, of 10.1%.

The shortage of new homes for sale has created additional 
demand in the rental sector, increasing the average household 
rent by 10.4%5 over the year to 30 June 2023, with every region 
of the UK experiencing significant rent cost increases, 
according to the HomeLet Rental Index. Based on the HomeLet 
Rental Index data, rents have increased by 22.0% over the past 
two years to June 2023 and absent a significant reduction in 
mortgage interest rates, rental demand will continue to grow 
as potential homebuyers remain unable to buy.

The housing shortage is increasingly evident across all tenures 
and is a critical issue for the UK economy and the economic 
health and wellbeing of its population.

Land supply and the planning system
The steady and consistent supply of land within a predictable 
planning system is critical to the housebuilding industry. There are 
a number of risks and uncertainties being managed by developers:

 ∙ the typical size of development sites, which is growing, 

and requiring additional time and resources;

 ∙ the uncertainty as to the timing of when construction 

activity can commence on a site given pre-development 
clearances required; 

 ∙ the speed with which labour and building materials 

can be procured for build activity; 

 ∙ the scheduling and consistency of workload for the sub-contract 

labour required to sustain the industry over the medium 
to long term; whilst also,

 ∙ ensuring build activity is delivered to required quality 

standards, whilst ensuring the health and safety of the 
workforce, as well as customers and homeowners, on 
new housing development sites.

Following the pandemic, planning consents reached a peak of 
339,4736 in the 12 months to 30 June 2021, a level consistent 
with the Government’s target to deliver 300,000 homes annually 
by the mid-2020s. However, this level has not been maintained, 
falling by 20% to 270,5596 in the year to 31 March 2023.

The political backdrop has not been conducive to delivering the 
number of planning consents needed by the industry, including 
five changes in Housing Minister in the last 18 months. There has 
been a noticeable shift in delivery since the announcement in 
December 2022 that local housing targets were “advisory” rather 
than “mandatory”, as well as to end the obligation on local 
authorities to maintain a rolling five-year land supply where they 
have a local plan in place. This has allowed 58 local authorities 
to stall, delay or withdraw their local housing delivery plans, 
with 28 doing so following the December announcement7.

In addition to this, Natural England, a non-departmental public 
body sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs, intervened in the planning process in March 2022 
and advised 74 local authorities that developments should not 
proceed if they increased the level of nutrients in water courses 
and failed to deliver “nutrient neutrality”. It is estimated that 
more than 145,0007 planning consents have been blocked 
across the 74 local authority areas, with new housebuilding 
effectively under a moratorium in these areas and many smaller 
housebuilders facing business closure.

The Government announced plans to amend the Levelling Up 
and Regeneration Bill on 29 August 2023 in order to unblock 
homes currently held up by nutrient neutrality mitigation 
measures. The details around these measures, their successful 
passage into legislation, as well as the speed with which the 
changes come into force, remain uncertain.

Finally, despite the growing complexity of planning applications, 
the resourcing of local authority planning departments has 
failed to match growing planning demands. National Audit 
Office analysis has shown that between 2010/2011 and 2019/2020 
funding for planning services reduced by £1.3bn or 55%8. 

All of these factors are conspiring to create a continuing and 
accelerating decline in planning consents which, in the first 
quarter of calendar 2023, declined by 24.7% to 63,013, when 
compared to 20226.

The mortgage market and housing affordability
The step-change in mortgage interest rates is charted below 
and highlights the challenge now faced by homebuyers requiring 
mortgage finance. Based on Bank of England data9, mortgage 
borrowing costs for new mortgages steadily declined for more 
than 12 years to a low of 1.51% in November 2021. This has 
though seen a sharp reversal in less than 18 months, with the 
average cost of new mortgages advances in June 2023 
increasing to 4.64%, a threefold increase from the low point, 
with mortgage interest rates back at levels last seen in 2009.

The Halifax Mortgage Affordability Index combines the 
prevailing mortgage interest rate on new advances with 
current home prices, and as can be seen in the chart opposite, 
the purchase of a new home now equates to 40.8% of after tax 
income, materially ahead of the long-term average at 32.9%. 
In the coming months, this affordability measure looks set to be 
impacted positively by the rate of nominal wage growth but will 
then ultimately be dependent on the future movements in both 
mortgage rates and house prices. 

We are continuing to work with banks and building societies and 
other financial institutions to introduce additional lenders to the 
new build sector and increase lender understanding as to the 
advantages of new build lending. The development of green 
mortgages remains an important initiative in this regard. We 
are also playing an active role in increasing the understanding 
amongst residential valuers through the Future Homes Hub, 
as well as developing and promoting advantageous mortgage 
products, which reflect the energy efficiency and lower running 
costs, as well as the environmental credentials and the absence 
of future retrofit spending on the insulation of our homes.

Chief Executive’s Statement

Building materials and labour
We experienced an elevated rate of build cost inflation 
at between 9% and 10% throughout FY23. This reflected: 

 ∙ the relatively positive outlook for continued housing growth, 

in the second and third quarters of calendar 2022, which, against 
a backdrop of relatively constrained supply, created upward 
pressure on forward building materials supply agreements; and

 ∙ the underlying inflationary pressures on labour costs experienced 
across the wider UK economy during the year; and the lagged 
impact of the dramatic increase in energy costs, which began 
in the autumn of 2021 and was further compounded by the 
conflict in Ukraine. These increases took time to feed through 
supply chains, given production timeframes and suppliers’ 
energy hedging arrangements.

Through our centralised procurement team, careful scheduling 
of our building materials demands and the support of our 
long-standing supply chain partners, we are focused on ensuring 
security of supply as well as sustainable but competitive pricing.

As a result of the combination of weaker forecast activity, falling 
energy costs and increased competition in the supply chain for 
future orders, we expect total build cost inflation will slow 
to around 5% in FY24.

Future regulatory changes
The industry faces future regulatory changes with respect to 
biodiversity net gain, as well as the Future Homes Standard 
over the coming three years.

Biodiversity net gain
Under legislation which will come into force in November 2023, 
all of our developments will be required to identify and deliver a 
minimum biodiversity net gain of 10%. This requires our developments 
to create plans to deliver at least a 10% measurable improvement 
in the biodiversity of the site developed, relative to the site had 
development not occurred.

How we are prepared
From January 2023 we have identified a minimum biodiversity 
net gain of 10% across all new development designs submitted 
for planning – more than nine months ahead of legislation. 
We have also embedded a comprehensive operational framework 
to deliver this change across our divisions, including colleague 

training, calculation tools, automated data collection, 
workshops with external consultants, a review of external 
consultant capacity and capability, and a network of divisional 
representatives championing BNG.

Future Homes Standard
From 2025 the FHS will require new homes to produce 75-80% 
less carbon emissions than standards applicable through to 
June 2022. The detailed requirements and performance 
measurement around this new Standard are not yet finalised 
with the timing and transition arrangements for this new 
Standard, along with industry consultation, yet to be initiated. 

How we are prepared
We are evolving our house types and trialling new technologies, 
with the eHome2 project at the University of Salford, in 
particular, testing evolving solutions which will be adopted 
to meet this new standard.

Strong performance 
in a challenging year

Introduction
During what has been a year of economic and political 
uncertainty, we have delivered a strong operational and a good 
financial performance, given the market backdrop. I would like 
to thank our employees, sub-contractors and supply chain 
partners for their hard work and commitment which enabled us 
to manage our site-based construction activity effectively, 
delivering high-quality efficient homes and great service to 
our customers. 

Our purpose remains clear: to lead the future of housebuilding 
by putting customers at the heart of everything we do.

Reflecting our position as Britain’s largest and leading national 
sustainable housebuilder, we are committed to playing a key 
role in addressing the housing shortage and delivering the 
sustainable, high-quality and energy-efficient homes and 
developments needed across England, Scotland and Wales.

We will continue to operate the business in a flexible way, with 
a short land bank aimed at maximising our delivery of housing 
from our efficient and resilient balance sheet.

Performance overview
We delivered a strong performance against a challenging 
backdrop this year, while maintaining or focus on both build 
quality and customer service.

Our performance is a testament to the disciplines embedded 
by our operating framework as well as the commitment of 
our employees, sub-contractors and supply chain partners.

Chief Executive’s Statement continued

Performance overview continued
 ∙ Total home completions were 17,206 (FY22: 17,908).

 ∙ We achieved a 21.2% adjusted gross margin (FY22: 24.8%), with 

adjusted gross profit of £1,130.4m (FY22: £1,308.1m), with reduced 
profitability reflecting the fall in customer demand, overall house 
price inflation running below build cost inflation and the 
operational gearing impact as the market has slowed down.

 ∙ The impact of adjusting items, which reflected legacy property 

costs associated with building safety related remediation 
activities, resulted in reported gross profit of £974.9m (FY22: 
£899.9m) and a reported gross margin of 18.3% (FY22: 17.1%).

 ∙ We generated an adjusted profit before tax of £884.3m 

(FY22: £1,054.8m) in line with market expectations. Reported 
profit before tax, after deducting adjusting items, was £705.1m 
(FY22: £642.3m).

 ∙ Our balance sheet strength has been maintained with year-end 
net cash of £1,069.4m (FY22: £1,138.6m) after dividend payments 
of £360m and completion of the £200m share buyback. 

 ∙ ROCE has reduced by 780 bps to 22.2% (FY22: 30.0%), largely due 

to reduced profitability.

Our priorities for the year ahead
Against the backdrop of the current more challenging market, 
our strategy is centred on four key areas.

Driving revenue
Firstly, driving reservations and home completions. This centres 
on using our industry leading quality and customer service to 
attract our core private homebuyers and then helping them to 
access affordable mortgages, thereby enabling them to buy.

As evidenced in FY23, we are also focused on securing 
reservations from other channels, building on our strategic 
partnership with Citra Living, as well as our long-standing 
relationships with registered providers of social housing, public 
sector bodies and other investors, all of which will support our 
build activity and completions in FY24.

Controlling costs
We will manage build activity and build costs and control our 
indirect cost base to be as efficient as possible, whilst ensuring 
we have in place the operational capacity to deliver growth 
when market conditions improve. When the market slowdown 
accelerated following the mini budget in late September 2022, 
we implemented a recruitment freeze which has already 
reduced our headcount by 6% from 1 October 2022 through to 
30 June 2023.

Maintaining land investment discipline
We will maintain our highly selective approach to land buying, 
particularly as prevailing land prices have not yet adjusted to 
the changed market conditions. We will continue to apply our 
long-standing hurdle requirements for land investment, which 
require a minimum gross margin of 23% and ROCE of 25%. 

Leading sustainability
Finally, we will continue to lead the industry on sustainability, 
with a particular focus on reducing our environmental impact 
and increasing the future resilience of the business through our 
continued drive to reduce construction waste, our development 
of zero carbon homes and our targeted reduction of carbon 
emissions from our own operations. We have clear action plans, 
and targets, as we look to the future to build the energy-efficient, 
sustainable homes the country needs.

Keeping people safe
Our fundamental priority is always to provide a safe 
environment for all our employees, sub-contractors and 
customers, and we are committed to achieving and maintaining 
the highest health and safety standards. We are continually 
developing our processes, challenging unsafe behaviours, and 
looking at ways we can further improve our procedures.

During FY23 we were disappointed that our Injury Incidence 
Rate (IIR) increased to 289 per 100,000 workers (FY22: 262), 
reflecting increased levels of slips and trips. Our SHE audit 
compliance was broadly maintained at 96% (FY22: 97%). 

To drive improvement, we engaged with our employees, 
sub-contractors and our supply chain, seeking their views on 
how we can further enhance our safety, health and environmental 
performance. We continue to refine our working practices in 
line with the latest guidance from Government, Public Health 
Authorities and the Construction Leadership Council. 

Responsible development 
Fire safety and external wall systems
On 13 March 2023 the Group signed the Self-Remediation Terms 
and Contract with the UK Government. This incorporated into 
contractual arrangements the commitments made by the Group 
under the Building Safety Pledge, signed in April 2022.

On 31 May 2023 the Group also signed the Scottish Safer Building 
Accord, an industry commitment supporting the remediation 
and/or mitigation of external wall cladding systems on buildings 
of 11 metres and above. We are working with Homes for 
Scotland and the Scottish Government to agree a legally binding, 
long-form contract to give effect to the principles of the Accord. 
There remains uncertainty around the extent of remediation 
which will be required in Scotland. Our existing provisions for 
Scottish buildings have been made on a consistent basis with 
England and Wales. 

During the year, through the changes in inspection parameters and 
testing, we identified a further 55 buildings on 20 developments 
requiring potential remedial works. This change, in combination 
with an update to cost estimates across the portfolio, offset by an 
increase in the discount rate applied to the provision, resulted in an 
additional charge of £117.7m (FY22: £377.7m), recognised as an 
adjusted item.

Going the extra mile 
for our customers

 See page 30

Reinforced concrete frames
Our remediation activities with respect to concrete frame 
design and construction continued during the year with the 
majority of developments proceeding in line with plan, but 
against a backdrop of inflationary build cost pressures. During 
the second half we also finalised remediation plans for the one 
remaining development from the Citiscape review, where work 
is required across five buildings. Finalisation of this remediation 
plan as well as ongoing remediation activities resulted in 
an additional charge of £51.5m, of which £21.3m related to JV 
legacy developments.

In addition, we identified two further developments where 
remediation work might be required. At the year end £2.4m had 
been spent on one JV development and £7.6m has been provided 
in relation to future remediation costs. The sum provided is 
below the initial estimate, detailed in our July trading update, 
but remains subject to further detailed analysis, which is 
ongoing and is expected to conclude over the next six months.

Our dedicated Building Safety Unit is managing our overall 
ongoing building safety remediation programme, which we 
anticipate will be delivered over the next five years, with 
building safety considerations informing the prioritisation and 
scheduling of works.

More details around the adjusted item charges with respect to 
building safety can be found in the Chief Financial Officer’s 
review on page 66. 

Further details on our approach to building safety can be viewed 
on our website at: www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/about-us/
our-approach-to-building-safety.

Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)
The CMA announced on 16 August 2022 that, after more than 
three years of investigation, it had closed its investigation into 
the Group in relation to the sale of leasehold homes with no 
action being taken.

On 28 February 2023 the CMA launched a market study into 
housebuilding in England, Scotland and Wales. We welcome 
the study, which will provide an opportunity for the industry to 
explain in detail the current challenges it is facing. We have 
taken a proactive and constructive approach in engaging with 
the CMA to assist with their study. The CMA reported on 25 
August 2023 that its review was continuing and we will continue 
to work constructively with the CMA through this process.

The Barratt Foundation
Now in its third year of operation, the Barratt Foundation is 
fulfilling our commitments to charitable giving and social 
responsibility. We believe it is important to bring together both 
our financial resources and the commitment and enthusiasm of 
our employees to support charitable causes locally and at a 
national level.  

In FY23, we raised £6.3m (FY22: £5.1m) for charitable causes 
through the Barratt Foundation, including the Group donation of 
£4m. Notable grants during the year included £900,000 in grants 
to five new national charity partners. The five charities receiving 
grants were: Whizz-Kidz (£350,000), Place2Be (£300,000), Refuge 
(£100,000), Bookmark (£100,000) and the Lighthouse Club 
(£50,000). Each of these charities was carefully selected by the 
Barratt Foundation Trustees, reflecting their alignment with the 
Foundation’s key priorities centred around promoting social 
inclusion, mental health and education.

Barratt and David Wilson Community Fund
The Barratt Foundation also continued to support the Barratt 
and David Wilson Community Fund throughout the year. This 
enables each of our divisions and Group offices to support local 
charities that really matter to them by donating £1,500 to a 
different local charity each month. Building on this, and 
reflecting the challenges faced by many over the Christmas 
period in 2022, the Barratt Foundation also provided an 
additional £5,000 to each of the Group’s divisions and two Group 
offices with donations going to 48 small local charities such as 
hospices, food banks and homelessness charities. 

Employee engagement in our charitable activities
To encourage our employees to raise funds for local causes, 
the Barratt Foundation matches funds up to £15,000 per division 
and up to £2,000 per employee for employee fundraising. The 
Group also partners with Payroll Giving in Action to enable 
employees to make regular, tax-free donations to their 
chosen charities. 

In FY23, Barratt employees and divisions raised a record £1.3m 
(FY22: £0.7m) for charities and good causes, with an additional 
£0.8m (FY22: £0.3m) provided by the Barratt Foundation in 
matched funding, after doubling the available match funding for 
employee fundraising at the start of the year.

More details around the Barratt Foundation and its activities 
can be found at: www.barrattfoundation.org.uk.

Operational review
Reservation activity
Our net private reservation rate in FY23 was 0.55 (FY22: 0.81). 
The decline across FY23 reflected a significant deterioration in 
trading following the fiscal event in September 2022, which 
continued to the end of the calendar year and was also impacted 
by the closure of the Help to Buy scheme, which closed to new 
reservations on 30 October 2022. 

Relative political stability, a modest recovery in consumer 
confidence and an easing in mortgage interest rates helped 
improve the reservation rate from the start of January 2023 
through to early May 2023, before it reduced again, reflecting 
growing uncertainty around inflation and mortgage interest 
rates for our potential customers.

Reservation activity in the year also reflected the more 
challenging backdrop for first time buyers finding it harder to 
raise deposits following the end of the Help to Buy scheme in 
October 2022 and the sharp increase in mortgage interest rates 
and reduced availability of 95% mortgages following the fiscal 
event in September 2022. There was more resilient demand 
from existing homeowners who tend to have access to larger 
deposits, where limited numbers of homes for sale in the 
wider market, the energy efficiency of our new homes and 
the backdrop of significant rental cost growth helped to 
support demand. 

Our reservation rate in FY23 was augmented by increased 
multi-unit sales into the private rented sector along with 
additional private unit sales to registered providers of social 
housing (“RPs”). This has partly mitigated sales risk during the 
period, supported our construction activity and ensured more of 
our homes will be made available for both the private rental and 
affordable homes market. The net private reservation rate 
into the private rented sector, along with additional private 
units to RPs, contributed 0.10 (FY22: 0.03) in the year. 

During the year, we operated from an average of 367 active 
sales outlets (FY22: 332) including eight active JV sales outlets 
(FY22: seven). Growth in active outlets reflected two factors. 
Firstly, we made solid progress on new site openings, despite 
both ongoing planning delays and our step back from the land 
market, launching a total of 104 new sales outlets (including JVs) 
in the year (FY22: 118). Secondly, the significantly lower private 
reservation rate on existing sites extended the sales activity of 
several outlets.

At the end of the year we were operating from 389 active 
sales outlets (30 June 2022: 352), including nine JV outlets 
(30 June 2022: nine).

In FY24, we expect to see average active sales outlets reduce 
by around 6% reflecting both reduced outlet openings given our 
step back from the land market and the impact of sites ending 
where sales activity was extended by lower reservation rates.

Construction activity adjusted to slower demand
Reductions in demand from late September 2022 required 
adjustments to construction activity across our operations. 
The result was on average 322 (FY22: 352) equivalent homes 
(including JVs) built per week in the year. 

During FY24 our construction activity will reduce further as 
we align it with sales reservation activity and ensure efficient 
deployment of working capital across our sites.

Home completions
Total home completions reduced by 3.9% in FY23. The strength 
of our order book and demand in the first quarter of the year 
supported growth of 6.9% in total home completions in the first 
half. However, the significant change in reservation activity 
during the second quarter, the closure of the Help to Buy 
scheme to new reservations from 31 October 2022, and the 
slower rate of reservations from the start of the new calendar 
year created a 12.8% decline in total home completions in the 
second half. As a result, the affordable housing share of wholly 
owned home completions increased to 23.9% (FY22: 22.3%) and 
the Help to Buy share of completions declined to 9% (FY22: 
19%).

The average selling price (ASP) of wholly-owned completions

increased by 7.9% to £367.6k (FY22: £340.8k), up 13.6% in the 
first half, benefitting from the strong private order book position 
carried into FY23, as well as steady pricing during the first 
quarter. Following the turbulence in mortgage markets, the 
private ASP in the second half only grew by 3.2% reflecting the 
softening in demand seen following the September fiscal event 
and increased sales incentives.

Within our private completions, we completed 258 homes 
(FY22: 36) for Citra Living. The ASP of these PRS completions 
was £280.9k (FY22: £172.3k) with the significant step up in 
the PRS ASP reflecting a more typical mix of the 2 and 3-bed 
homes being sought and acquired by Citra Living to the limited, 
and apartment dominated, completions in FY22.

Affordable ASP increased by 4.9% to £167.2k (FY22: £159.4k), 
reflecting an increased proportion of completions from our 
outer London operations. We anticipate that the affordable ASP 
in FY24 will be at a similar level to that reported in FY23.

Land and planning
As market conditions changed, we stepped back from the land 
market in September 2022. We have adopted a highly selective 
approach to buying land, particularly as prevailing land prices 
have not yet adjusted to the changed market conditions. As a 
result, gross site approvals increased by 31 new sites during 
the year, including two sites through planning amendments. 
These were offset by 33 previously approved sites which are no 
longer economically viable, resulting in a net decrease of two 
sites in the year (FY22: net approval of 102 sites). Given our 
current view of the market, land prices and our existing 
development pipeline, we do not expect our approach to land 
acquisition to change for the foreseeable future.

The approved sites along with planning amendments added 
4,821 plots, at a cost of £345.2m, with 5,633 plots removed with 
respect to the sites no longer proceeding, at a previously 
agreed cost of £360.1m. The result was a net reduction of 812 
plots in the year (FY22: net addition of 19,089 plots) and a net 
decrease in our land approval commitments of £14.9m (FY22: 
net increase of £1,396.1m).

We invested £822.8m (FY22: £1,036.0m) on land acquisitions 
and the settlement of land creditors during the year and we now 
expect to spend between c. £500m and £700m on land in FY24, 
largely settling existing commitments.

We continue to target a geographically balanced land portfolio 
in the medium term with a supply of owned land of c. 3.5 years 
and a further c. 1.0 year of controlled land. We are broadly in 
line with this target with the land bank comprising 3.6 years of 
owned land (30 June 2022: 3.9 years) and 0.7 years of controlled 
land at 30 June 2023 (30 June 2022: 0.8 years). 

More than 81% (30 June 2022: 75%) of our owned and 
unconditional land bank plots have detailed planning consent, 
supporting our sales outlets position and future home completions. 

Our land bank at 30 June comprised:

At 30 June 2023, the estimated ASP of plots in our owned land 
bank was £331k (30 June 2022: £322k) and the estimated gross 
margin in our land bank, based on current estimated sales prices 
and build costs, is 19.7% (30 June 2022: 25.8%). 

Strategic land activity
During the year, we delivered 3,938 (FY22: 4,530) or 24% (FY22: 
26%) of our wholly owned home completions from strategically 
sourced land, We converted 777 plots (FY22: 1,663) of strategic 
land into our owned and controlled land bank during the year. 
Our strategic land teams placed increased focus on securing 
additional strategic land to support future growth and 21,802 
plots across 70 strategic sites were approved during the year 
(FY22: 14,620 plots and 61 sites).

At 30 June 2023, around 23% (30 June 2022: around 25%) of our 
strategic land is allocated or included in draft local plans. We 
are also benefiting from the additional expertise brought by 
Gladman Developments’ planning teams who, working with our 
strategic land teams, are identifying ways to accelerate delivery 
from our strategic land bank.

We continue to target around 30% of wholly owned completions 
from strategic and promotional land in the medium term. We 
believe this is both appropriate for our business model, and 
reflects the development and planning prospects held within 
our strategic land portfolio as well as our targeted land bank 
length and focus on ROCE.

Notwithstanding that, along with the rest of the industry, we 
have experienced problems with the ineffective planning system 
over the past year, we are well positioned, with all expected 
FY24 completions (FY23: all FY23 completions) having outline or 
detailed planning consent.

Land promotion activity
Through the acquisition of Gladman we now hold a significant 
promotional land portfolio of 96,844 plots (30 June 2022: 93,696 
plots), with Gladman continuing to operate as a standalone 
business within the Group.

During FY23, Gladman secured an estimated 9,453 plots, 
(five months in FY22: 1,882 plots) through new promotional 
agreements with landowners. Following several planning 
successes, the business received planning consents on 2,437 
plots during the year (five months in FY22: 807 plots). Whilst 
wider market demand for land weakened from the end of the 
first quarter, continued demand for land with planning consent 
from smaller developers saw Gladman secure land sales 
equating to 1,813 plots, (five months in FY22: 1,332 plots).

Gladman generated revenue of £20.4m and an operating profit, 
before amortisation of intangible assets, of £3.8m during FY23, 
(five months in FY22: sales of £23.3m and operating profit, 
before amortisation of intangible assets, of £12.4m). The 
reduction in revenue and profitability reflects the slowdown in 
the land market as many housebuilders reduced their land 
buying activity.

With access to the Group’s financial resources, Gladman 
continues to engage with new and existing land promotion 
partners around alternative routes to unlocking value from 
their respective land positions. Reflecting the changing needs 
and aspirations of land promotion partners, Gladman offers the 
ability to convert promotional agreements into option, hybrid or 
freehold sale arrangements for all, or part, of their land 
promotion partners’ holdings.

Strategic Report

Current trading and outlook
Long-term housing market fundamentals reflect a continued 
and deteriorating imbalance between housing supply and 
demand. Despite this imbalance, the market is currently 
impacted by significant macro-economic headwinds, most 
notably persistent inflation and a higher interest rate 
environment. This backdrop has had a negative impact on UK 
economic growth, employment, mortgage affordability and 
consumer confidence and spending.

We entered FY24 with a solid forward sales position and at 
27 August 2023 we are 49% forward sold with respect to private 
wholly owned home completions for FY24 (28 August 2022 for 
FY23: 62%) with 51% of the private order book exchanged 
(28 August 2022: 59%).

Since the start of the new financial year our net private 
reservation rate per active outlet per average week for the 
period to 27 August 2023 was 0.42 (FY23: 0.60). This reflects 
both traditional seasonality but also the continued affordability 
challenges faced by potential homebuyers. During the period 
there was minimal impact from sales to the private rental 
sector and registered providers of social housing, which 
contributed 0.02 (FY23: 0.05) to the reservation rate.

Based on current market conditions, we are targeting total 
home completions of between 13,250 and 14,250 in FY24, 
including c. 650 home completions from our JVs and c. 750 
completions for the private rental sector, whilst ensuring we 
maintain our industry-leading standards of build quality and 
customer service. We currently estimate that around 45% of our 
completions will be delivered in the first half of the financial 
year.

Operational review continued
Maintaining efficiency and controlling costs
Maintaining the efficiency of our operations and controlling 
costs remain key focus areas for the Group. Our supply chain 
is robust and carefully managed, with approximately 95% of our 
building materials sourced by our centralised procurement 
function, and around 90% of our building materials are 
manufactured or assembled in the UK.

We remain committed to working with our supply chain 
partners to secure sustainable, competitive pricing, while 
maintaining security of supply to support our site-based 
operations and we have supply agreements in place for 73% of 
our material requirements to 31 December 2023 (FY23: 73% to 
31 December 2022), and 14% of our requirements until 30 June 
2024 (FY23: 12% to 30 June 2023).

We are starting to see some of the inflationary pressure on 
the cost of skilled labour abating, reflecting the slowdown in 
housebuilding activity across the country and the desire of 
sub-contractors and skilled trades to secure future workload. 
We are looking to drive further construction efficiency through 
standardisation in our house types and increased use of timber 
frame to reduce our labour requirements and reducing waste.

During FY23, total build cost inflation (including infrastructure 
costs, materials and labour) was between 9% and 10%, with the 
rate of inflation moderating towards the end of the year. 
Reflecting the slowdown in the market, and assuming no further 
material changes in the costs of energy or key commodities, we 
expect total build cost inflation to abate through FY24, with 
average total build cost inflation at around 5%.

We are also pro-actively managing our overhead base. As the 
slowdown in the market became apparent in late September 
2022, we began a headcount freeze which has reduced our 
number of employees by 6% since the end of the first quarter. 
We have continued to invest in priority areas including 
sustainability, building safety and in our IT infrastructure but 
are only hiring where additional skills are required by the 
business. We have also scaled back discretionary spend in 
other areas.

Customer first

Leading the industry in consistent 
customer service
Our customers are at the heart of everything we do. We believe 
our industry leadership in customer service is fundamental to 
our success and we are the only major housebuilder to have 
now been awarded the maximum 5 star rating by our customers 
in the HBF Customer Satisfaction Survey for 14 consecutive 
years, with a customer satisfaction rating at 92.8%.

New Homes Quality Code
Building on investment and training during 2022, we 
successfully adopted the New Homes Quality Code and 
activated our registered developer status with the New Homes 
Quality Board in the year. We welcome the Quality Code, which 
is centred on fairness throughout the customer journey. The 
Quality Code covers the period from initial enquiry through 
to completion and then two years post-occupation of the new 
home. We are pleased that since activating the Quality Code, 
there have been no adjudications required by the New Homes 
Ombudsman Service with respect to our homes and customers.

Delivering service beyond home completion 
for our customers
As we seek to ensure our customers receive the best possible 
service throughout their home buying journey and in the 
period post-completion, we have invested in additional training 
and workshops to enhance our service and our customers’ 
experience beyond the handover of their new home. 

We have continued to drive improvements to the customer 
journey and have adapted our processes to help our customers 
through the volatility in the mortgage market during the year. 
We will continue to work with lenders to ensure our customers 
have access to the most attractive and suitable mortgage 
products available. 

Addressing mortgage access and the affordability 
challenges faced
Given the affordability challenges now faced by potential 
homebuyers, we are continually looking at how we can help 
with numerous offers, which include:

 ∙ the housebuilding industry’s “Deposit Unlock” scheme 

which is available to our customers who only have access 
to a 5% deposit;

 ∙ our “Key Worker Deposit Contribution” scheme, where we 

offer a 5% contribution, as well as flooring included in their 
new home;

 ∙ our “Deposit Boost” scheme for customers with a 10% deposit 
where we can boost it with a further 5% contribution of the 
purchase price allowing access to 85% LTV lending rates;

 ∙ our “Parent Power” scheme where first time buyers with 

parental support can access a matching deposit contribution 
up to 5% of the purchase price of their new home; and

 ∙ our “Armed Forces Deposit Contribution” scheme where 

military service personnel will be offered a 5% contribution, 
up to £15,000.

We also continue to promote our part-exchange offers to customers. 
We were the first housebuilder to introduce part-exchange and 
we have a long record of helping existing homeowners in their 
purchase of a Barratt or David Wilson home using one of our 
five tailored part exchange schemes.

“ This is one of the most helpful 
companies I've ever dealt with; 
the staff are absolutely lovely and 
are really thorough and invested 
in getting you the best deal.”

Growing the private rental opportunity
Finally, recognising the ongoing demand for housing of all 
tenures, we have developed our relationship in the private 
rental sector, with Citra Living, on our developments across the 
country.

New build advantages for our customers 
We are continually seeking to improve the energy and water 
efficiency of our homes and adapting our home designs to 
respond to changing homebuyer demands, the Future Homes 
Standard and other changes to Building Regulations. We aim to 
build high quality homes that optimise internal space, deliver 
excellent energy and water efficiency and, as a result, unlock 
lower lifetime costs for our customers.

We actively promote the lower energy cost and environmental 
advantages of our homes across all our communication 
channels and in our sales centres. This is an increasingly 
important purchasing consideration for our customers. 
A typical Barratt or David Wilson home can unlock energy 
savings of up to £2,200 annually when compared to an average 
existing home. In FY23 99.2% of our home completions were 
EPC rated “B” or above, a level of energy efficiency shared by 
just 3.2% of the existing housing stock. In addition, all of our 
homes are built to a water use standard of 105 litres per person 
per day, creating the potential to reduce consumption by 26% 
when compared to the national average and creating further 
cost savings for our homeowners. 

Green mortgages: leading valuation and mortgage 
developments across the sector
Mortgage lenders, driven by their own sustainability initiatives, 
the growing recognition of future retrofit costs in relation to 
energy efficiency for existing homes, and the scale of annual 
savings for customers buying a new home, are increasingly 
engaging with the housebuilding industry around green mortgages.

As the leading national sustainable housebuilder we have 
adopted a dual approach to green mortgage development. 
Firstly, we are continuing to work directly with lenders to 
develop enhanced products that recognise the advantages 
of our new build homes. During FY23, we collaborated with 
The Leeds Building Society to support the launch of a new 
green mortgage product. This product, which recognises the 
advantages inherent in our new homes and has the potential 
to unlock up to a 10% uplift in lending available for our 
energy efficient homes.

Secondly, through Government engagement, notably through 
the Future Homes Hub, Barratt’s Head of Mortgage Lender 
Relations chairs the “Valuation Oversight Group”, which is 
considering how the value of sustainable benefits of new 
homes can be recognised in the mortgage valuation process.

The financial and environmental advantages of new build homes 
have never been as significant as they are today, and we are 
committed to enhancing both the access and affordability of 
our new homes in partnership with both lenders and surveyors. 

Customer First Objectives
0–1 year: We will target our continued 5 star customer 
service and drive improvement in our nine-month survey 
score. We will also launch a single portal covering our 
customers throughout their journey with the Group, 
encompassing the marketing and sale process through to 
customer care post-occupation.

1–3 years: We will develop new technology-based solutions 
to improve the planning, scheduling and efficiency of 
our customer care teams, internal technicians and 
external sub-contractors. We will continue engagement 
on green mortgage development with lenders, surveyors 
and Government.

3+ years: We will be developing immersive augmented and 
virtual reality tools to improve and further personalise each 
customer journey.

Our strategy continued

Great places

Land supply
We build homes in locations where our customers want to live, with 
good access to open space and amenities, transport connections, 
schools and workplaces. Our specialised divisional land teams, 
including the Gladman team, possess extensive local knowledge 
and strong relationships with landowners. This, combined with 
detailed research into local market conditions, means we can 
secure land in locations of strong customer demand.

Built For Life
Placemaking principles are fundamental to our business: our 
customers want to live in great places that create a positive 
legacy and for land owners too, the future legacy created by 
a site can be critical to successful land acquisition. 

Our internal Great Places design principles are aligned to 
the Government-endorsed “Building for Life 12” criteria and 
the updated “Building for a Healthy Life” standard, which 
incorporates additional health and wellbeing criteria. As a 
result, Great Places puts greater emphasis on development 
design to support good physical and mental health and 
wellbeing. We deliberately shape our developments around 
existing ecology, green spaces, walkways and cycle paths to 
encourage social interaction and a sense of community and 
appreciation of the surroundings created.

During FY23, 19 developments achieved Gold awards under 
Great Places with a further 46 developments receiving Silver 
awards and 4 developments achieved commendations under 
the “Building for a Healthy Life” standard, with Phase 4 of our 
West Hendon development achieving an “Outstanding” rating 
from the judges.

We also launched our new “Green Spaces” awards in FY23 to 
recognise and encourage developments with integrated and 
accessible green spaces.

Upton Gardens

Biodiversity net gain adoption ahead of legislation 
With our national rollout programme embedding biodiversity 
best practice across all regions completed in the year, all our 
development designs submitted for planning from January 2023 
identified a minimum biodiversity net gain (BNG) of 10% and we 
remain ahead of the legislation. 

An important ingredient in delivering BNG is landscaping. 
To drive our leadership in this area, we launched a new 
“Landscaping Handbook” which sets out best practice for the 
design and delivery of landscaping across our developments. 
Alongside the launch, we appointed divisional “BNG Champions”, 
ensuring landscaping best practice is both adopted and 
reported looking to the future. 

BNG also relies on the long-term stewardship of our 
developments, as such, measures have been put in place to 
ensure landscaping and BNG performance are also incorporated 
in the terms of operation for the management companies 
responsible for our developments post-completion.

Water resilience for our customers
Water resilience is becoming increasingly important and 
we have a responsibility to mitigate against future risks 
of geographical water scarcity and flooding. We do this 
by increasing the water efficiency of both our homes, as 
highlighted earlier, but also by increasing the resilience of our 
sites to water scarcity and flooding through careful design and 
development landscaping. 

In FY23, 83% (FY22: 72%) of our developments used above-
ground, landscape-led Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems, 
which manage surface water volumes and flow rates, reducing 
the impact of urbanisation and flood risk. We are committed 
to further sustainable drainage adoption to address water 
management on our developments. 

Objectives
0–1 year: We will embed BNG best practice and ensure our 
sites are delivering accurate reporting on BNG performance 
and progress.

We will work with Government and other interested parties 
to seek to overcome the challenges faced around nutrient 
neutrality to unlock future housing development.

1–3 years: We will further improve the layout and landscaping 
of our developments with a particular focus on inclusivity for 
all, including improvements to play areas and green spaces 
on our developments.

3+ years: Our focus will remain on leading the development 
of sustainable places that satisfy the country’s need for 
more housing whilst creating a positive economic, social 
and environmental legacy.

Leading construction

Industry leading build quality
Our absolute commitment to excellent build quality is embedded 
throughout our business. We believe a key measure of build 
quality is delivered through the NHBC’s five-stage inspection 
of our homes throughout their build. Issues relating to build 
are identified as “Reportable Items” (RIs) at each inspection. 
Throughout FY23, and for the fourth consecutive year, we have 
maintained our industry leading position amongst the major 
housebuilders, with the Group once again registering the 
lowest RIs per NHBC inspection. The Group achieved an average 
0.16 RIs per NHBC inspection (FY22: 0.13 RIs), the lowest of all 
major housebuilders. The strength of our site management, the 
standards we set for our long-standing sub-contractors, their 
familiarity with our housetypes, the photographic records taken 
of each home at key stages and our use of high-quality building 
materials all contribute to this result. 

Site management excellence for a record 19th year
Our build quality also continues to be recognised through the 
NHBC Pride in the Job Awards for site management. At the 
2022 Regional NHBC Pride in the Job Awards, 34 site managers 
won “Seals of Excellence” and our site managers secured 
five out of the nine Regional Awards where we operate in the 
“Large Builder” category. Finally, at the NHBC Pride in the Job 
Supreme Awards in January 2023, Kirk Raine, Site Manager 
at Doseley Park in our Mercia Division, was named Supreme 
Winner in the Large Builder category. 

In June 2023 at the 2023 National NHBC Pride in the Job 
Awards 96 site managers secured awards, more than any 
other housebuilder for the 19th consecutive year. No other 
major housebuilder has achieved this level of success and 
consistency, in terms of the recognition for the management 
of site standards and build quality. All of our sites also 
operate under the Group’s certification to the Environmental 
Management System standard ISO 14001, and Health and Safety 
standard OHSAS 18001. 

Innovation through modern methods of construction (MMC)
We delivered 5,578 homes using MMC equating to 32% of our 
total home completions (FY21: 4,846 homes and 27% of total 
home completions). MMC creates opportunities to build with 
greater speed and efficiency, mitigate the impact of the skills 
shortage facing the industry, reduce on-site waste, reduce 
embodied carbon and diversify the types of materials we use. 
The various MMC used across our total home completions are 
detailed below.

New timber frame facility moving into operation
Underpinning our growth in the use of MMC is the more 
widespread use of timber frame construction across our 
developments. Supporting this growth, we completed 
construction of the Group’s new Oregon timber frame facility 
at Infinity Park, near Derby. 

The new 186,000 square feet facility has been constructed to 
exacting requirements around its sustainability performance 
and has achieved a BREEAM “Very Good” rating and an EPC “A” 
rating. The facility also incorporates a wide range of energy-
efficient features including photovoltaics, air source heat pumps 
and LED lighting, as well as electric vehicle (EV) charging points 
across 10% of the parking spaces. This £45m investment has 
been commissioned and will increase production through FY24. 

Waste reduction
Waste reduction and resource efficiency remain clear 
priorities for the Group, notwithstanding our industry leading 
performance. Reflecting our workforce’s ability to drive waste 
reduction, bonus arrangements across the Group in FY23 once 
again included waste reduction targets and this will continue 
in FY24.

Supported by our dedicated Group Waste Project Manager, 
detailed action plans and incentives, and monthly waste 
monitoring, we have delivered a further improvement in our 
waste intensity with a 13.3% reduction to 4.31 tonnes per 100m2 
of legally completed build area (FY22: 4.97 tonnes per 100m2 
legally completed build area. In the year, our absolute waste 
tonnage decreased by 17.1% (FY22: decreased by 15.5%).

We continue to promote the segregation of waste and the 
efficient use of skips across our business; our diversion of 
waste from landfill remained at 96% during the year (FY22: 
96%). In FY23, more than 36,000 paint tins across our sites 
were recycled (FY22: more than 30,000), and 392,363 pallets, 
used in the supply of building materials to site, were recycled 
(FY22: 366,408 pallets).

Lightweight compactible materials continue to represent the 
largest portion of our remaining waste, particularly plastic and 
packaging materials. Several waste reduction initiatives were 
trialled in FY23 seeking to reduce packaging waste through 
specific supplier arrangement, to minimise damage to building 
materials in transit, combined with site best practice around 
building material storage on site. Future waste reduction 
initiatives will also involve revisions to our housetypes, with 
increasing standardisation of key components e.g. staircases 
and the introduction of a specific kit of parts reducing 
waste materials.

Our strategy continued

Leading construction continued
Water efficiency on site
We are committed to reducing operational water use on 
our sites and throughout our estate. Currently 80% of our 
operational sites have provided water consumption data (FY22: 
61%) and through our metering rollout plan we are targeting 
that all of our sites will have water metering by the end of FY24. 
This will provide data on our baseline water use against which 
we can plan actions to reduce water consumption and measure 
our performance. 

New building regulations
During FY23 our Group Design and Technical team, following 
the release of the Government’s SAP calculator in autumn 
2022, fine-tuned our solutions to ensure all our housetypes 
met the requirements of new 2021 Building Regulations. 
The new standards became effective on new development 
sites on 15 June 2022 and applied to all development sites from 
15 June 2023. 

The Zed House and the Future Homes Standard
The Zed House completed extended periods of occupation, 
monitoring and testing during FY23. This has yielded invaluable 
performance information which is being used to inform the 
Group in determining the most effective changes to our 
housetypes to meet the Future Homes Standard in 2025 and 
the different legislative requirements in England, Scotland and 
Wales, while also ensuring we create the best possible homes 
for our customers.

Future homes for our customers – eHome2
To achieve the Government’s carbon reduction targets, the 
UK will require a step-change in the design of new homes. 
As the leading sustainable housebuilder we are committed to 
developing homes that will meet the future challenges of both 
carbon emissions reduction and adaptation to climate change. 

A further milestone on this journey for the Group has been 
the construction of eHome2 where we have collaborated with 
Saint-Gobain to build a concept home within the “Energy House 
2.0” on the University of Salford campus. Built within one of 
two environmental chambers inside the “Energy House 2.0”, the 
largest facility of its type in the world, the eHome2 can test the 
effects of climate change and look at ways new houses can cope 
with more extreme weather conditions, whilst cutting energy 
and water usage. 

The three-bedroom family home will test both innovative 
building products and new technologies designed to meet 
the Future Homes Standard and builds on our knowledge and 
understanding gained from the Zed House. The eHome2 has 
been constructed using an advanced closed panel timber frame 
solution with an offsite pre-insulated ground floor system and 
both lightweight alternative brickslip and render systems to 
the external façade. The eHome2 was also built in less than 
14 weeks – half the time it takes to build a traditional home. 
The eHome2 will also test zero carbon performance in different 
temperatures and weather conditions to replicate extreme 
changes in the climate and the long-term expected increase in 
temperatures faced here in the UK.

With Saint-Gobain and the University of Salford, we are working 
together to create a blueprint that will enable the industry to 
design and build the low carbon homes of the future that will 
not only be attractive to our customers, but also future proofed 
for climate change and less expensive to run through their 
dramatically improved energy efficiency. 

Objectives
0–1 year: Develop the design of our new house type portfolio 
supporting the FHS and our growth in MMC.

Working with Government and the Future Homes Hub 
on realising the FHS.

1–3 years: Delivering our new house types encompassing 
changes in infrastructure connectivity, alternative building 
materials and new home technologies.

Further development of our MMC strategy, notably around 
further expansion of timber frame adoption across our 
housetype range. 

3+ years: Further development of our zero carbon strategy 
for homes in use from 2030 and from our own operations 
in 2040.

Development of our embodied carbon strategy to drive 
emissions reduction through alternative building materials 
use and supply chain collaboration.

Our continued success is ultimately achieved through the 
hard work and dedication of our employees. We aim to attract 
and retain the best people by engaging with our employees, 
investing in their development to maximise their potential, 
supporting their wellbeing and recognising their commitment by 
ensuring our employee packages are effective and competitive. 
We are also committed to becoming more diverse and inclusive 
organisation, as we believe this will create a stronger, more 
dynamic business for our customers, and also make us a more 
attractive employer.

The volatility and uncertainty in the market in the last year 
necessitated a pause in Group-wide recruitment, other than 
recruitment for a small number of critical roles, since the end 
of the first quarter. Recognising the need to develop young 
talent, our graduate and apprenticeship programmes have 
continued, albeit at reduced intake levels. 

This pause to recruitment has created opportunities to increase 
our attention on our existing employees, ensuring we are 
engaging and developing our employees to their full potential 
and that they feel recognised and valued. 

Engaging with our employees and recognising their 
commitment
Our 2022 employee engagement survey was completed in 
October 2022. This year’s survey delivered an engagement 
score of 84.4% (2021 survey: 79.4%). The improvement in the 
2022 engagement score was welcomed and highlighted:

 ∙ The benefits of the Group’s proactive policy changes in FY22 
around the provision of private medical insurance for all 
employees, an additional day’s holiday for all employees to 
celebrate a special day, and increased time for employee 
volunteering.

 ∙ The positive impact on our employees of the Group’s decision 
to award a cost of living salary supplement of £1,000 to all 
employees below senior management for the period from 
1 July 2022 through 31 December 2022.

 ∙ The introduction of enhanced family friendly policies including 
extended maternity, paternity and carer leave, effective from 
October 2022.

Following the 2022 engagement survey and reflecting our 
desire to positively respond and engage with our workforce, 
a number of new initiatives were introduced though the balance 
of FY23. These included:

 ∙ A Group-wide survey on health and safety seeking employee 
views on how we can further improve our safety, health and 
environmental performance with future targeted actions.

 ∙ A further cost of living salary supplement of £1,000 to all 
employees below senior management for the period 
1 January 2023 through 30 June 2023.

 ∙ Tiered salary increases effective from 1 July 2023, designed 

to ensure our lower paid employees were cushioned from the 
withdrawal of the cost of living salary supplements, which 
drew to a close on 30 June 2023.

ASPIRE

Degree Apprenticeships

Intermediate & Advanced 
Apprenticeships

Investing in the development and training of 
our employees
We continue to play a leading role to address the industry’s 
skills shortage.

In total, we have developed, or are developing, 136 delegates 
through our Armed Forces transition programme. Skills developed 
in the Armed Forces transfer well to site management, and 
the programme has brought a large number of high-calibre 
individuals into our business.

Our ASPIRE graduate development programme takes between 15 
and 30 graduates annually. The programme goes from strength 
to strength, attracting candidates from all degree backgrounds. 
ASPIRE is designed to provide a broad understanding of 
our business, coupled with both personal and professional 
development opportunities through a two-year programme, 
with the aim of creating leaders of the future.

During FY23, we completed recruitment for our fourth degree 
apprenticeship with Sheffield Hallam University, in real estate. 
Sitting alongside existing programmes in construction, quantity 
surveying and technical design and management this makes us 
the first housebuilder to deliver degree apprenticeships across 
the three main build functions and real estate. 

Apprenticeships remain a vital route to develop skilled 
tradespeople for our industry
Our programmes for bricklaying and carpentry apprentices 
enable participants to achieve apprenticeship level within a 
shorter timeframe while maintaining the same high standards. 
Our schemes focus on bringing new talent to the industry and 
on retaining it for the future. To date, within the bricklaying 
and carpentry apprenticeship programmes, 374 apprentices 
(FY22: 256) have attended, and 147 apprentices (FY22: 102) 
are due to complete the course in FY24, with a further 54 
(FY22: 160) recruited in FY23 for our FY24 intake.

We currently employ 483 apprentices, graduates and trainees 
(FY22: 391), around 7% (FY22: 6%) of our workforce, reflecting 
our ongoing commitment to developing future talent.

With respect to apprentice recruitment in the year, 13% (FY22: 
29%) of our apprentices were recruited from the most deprived 
areas according to the Index for Multiple Deprivation.

We engage with our future workforce through our work with 
schools, national apprenticeship bodies, universities and 
Armed Forces resettlement organisations. This includes getting 
involved with campus activities, attendance at careers fairs and 
employer-led events. For a second year we also engaged with 
more than 1,200 schools and colleges to promote careers in 
construction and housebuilding and, in collaboration with the 
HBF, the School Outreach programme now engages with over 
3,100 schools across the UK. 

Retaining the best talent
It is vital for us to develop talent within our business to ensure 
we have the necessary skills for continued operational delivery 
and growth into the future.

As part of our response to engagement survey feedback and the 
pause in recruitment, we are working to improve the visibility 
of career paths in all functions, with individual development 
plans, line manager development and the proactive prioritising 
and tracking of internal promotions. Remuneration and benefits 
are an important element of employee retention. We continue 
to review our employee packages to ensure they are effective 
and competitive.

Identifying and supporting our leaders of the future, along with 
effective succession planning, are important elements in our 
long-term success. In FY23, 344 (FY22: 269) high-potential 
employees have attended or are attending our 
“Rising Stars” programme.

Our Construction and Sales Academy programmes develop 
talent within our business and we continue to work with the 
Home Building Skills Partnership around employee training, 
learning and development. We also seek to address skills 
shortages and prepare for the future by developing our people 
through access to continuous learning. Our MyLearning mobile 
app provides colleagues with flexibility and choice in how they 
access and consume learning content.

Growing our employee networks
Our employee networks have also become an increasingly 
important way for us to create a more open and inclusive 
business, and enable us to listen directly to the needs of our 
people. Our networks include our gender network to support 
female colleagues and groups which connect parents, LGBTQ+ 
colleagues and allies, ethnic minority communities and “Barratt 
Connect”, a group for anyone who has felt isolated or misses the 
social interaction created by reduced office-based working. We 
are delighted to have launched “Scaffold”, a new network set 
up to raise awareness of disability in the workplace, influence 
policy decisions and connect disabled people and their allies 
across all divisions and functions. 

Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gap Report

Real Living Wage accreditation
During the year, we maintained our Living Wage Foundation 
accreditation, reflecting the Group’s commitment to paying 
our employees and supply chain employees an independently 
calculated rate of pay, based on the actual cost of living. The 
real Living Wage exceeds the national Living Wage (set by the 
Government) and covers all employees aged 18+, as well as 
incorporating a London weighting. Holding this accreditation 
demonstrates our clear and continuing commitment to our 
employees, suppliers and sub-contractors.

Our standard sub-contractor terms and conditions also 
mandate the payment of the real Living Wage within our supply 
chain. To support this, we implement spot checks by divisions 
on higher risk trades and operate internal remediation feedback 
systems. Where we find instances of non-compliance, we 
require this to be rectified, with follow-up audits conducted 
to ensure full compliance. For those working in jurisdictions 
other than the UK, our expectation, included within our contract 
requirements, is that local statutory minimum wages are paid.

Gender and ethnicity pay gap reporting
In December 2022, we published our annual Gender Pay Gap 
Report and, for the first time, we also included our Ethnicity Pay 
Gap Report, as part of our commitment to transparency and to 
enhance our work through our Diversity & Inclusion Strategy to 
improve the representation of all groups across the business. 

Our mean gender pay gap increased from 6.2% to 8.8%, and 
the median pay gap increased from (0.4%) to 6.3%. Although 
our mean gender pay gap is smaller than the average for UK 
businesses in 2022 at 13.9%, we remain committed to further 
action in this area and delivering against our 2025 Diversity 
& Inclusion Strategy.

Our mean ethnicity pay gap reduced from 11.0% to 7.7%, 
and the median ethnicity pay gap reduced from 7.1% to 5.9%. 

In order to deliver change in both of these areas, we will 
continue to build on the work already in place to support 
our teams through talent programmes, employee networks, 
succession planning and early careers. We will continue to 
work to close our gender and ethnicity pay gaps and ensure 
that we build an open and inclusive working environment.

Expanding employee participation in share ownership 
for our business
In April 2023, we invited all eligible employees to participate 
in the 15th grant under the Group’s Sharesave scheme, which 
allows eligible employees to contribute a maximum of £500 per 
month in one or more Sharesave schemes. As at 30 June 2023, 
51.4% of our employees participated in one or more of the active 
schemes, compared to 51.2% as at 30 June 2022.

In recognition of the continued dedication, commitment and 
loyalty of our employees, in FY23 the Board agreed that an 
annual share award would be made to all employees below 
Managing Director level. Accordingly, in July 2023, an award 
of shares equating to £1,250 (July 2022: £1,250) was made 
to all qualifying employees. This award will vest in July 2025.

Reflecting the challenges faced by our industry as well as our 
recruitment freeze implemented at the end of September 2022, 
our total Group employee turnover reduced to 15% for the year 
to 30 June 2023 (FY22: 17%). Our target over the medium term 
remains at 15%.

Our strategy continued

Investing in our people continued
Promoting both physical and mental wellbeing 
of employees
A key objective for the Group during FY23 has remained the 
physical, mental and financial health and wellbeing of our 
employees. During the year, we continued to progress our 
health and wellbeing programmes, including the development 
of a health and wellbeing strategy. We have continued to deliver 
“manage the conversation” training to our manager population, 
grow our network of mental health first aiders and enhance, 
through additional investment, the support available to our 
mental health first aiders.

We have continued to strive to reduce stigma and encourage 
openness around mental health across our employee and sub-
contractor population, with suicide awareness training made 
available to all employees and promoted to both our employees 
and well as our sub-contractors and allied trades. Continuing 
this theme, in June, in conjunction with the Barratt Foundation, 
we launched a collaboration with the Lighthouse Club 
Construction Industry Charity, which has seen a series of site 
tours being supported by the charity bringing wellbeing advice, 
help and support to our site-based teams and sub-contractors.

In order to support the financial wellbeing of our people, we 
have extended our partnership with our benefits providers to 
offer access to enhanced financial wellbeing support through 
innovative platforms and webinars. We continue to support our 
people’s physical health through investment in private medical 
support and annual health assessments, which are made 
available to all employees.

Anti-bribery and corruption policy

Diversity and inclusion
We aim to create a working environment that provides equal 
opportunities for all and we are a signatory to the Business 
in the Community Race at Work Charter.

Selection for employment and promotion within Barratt is 
based on merit, following an objective assessment of ability 
and experience, and after giving full and fair consideration 
to all applicants. We are also committed to ensuring that our 
workplaces are free from discrimination and that everyone is 
treated with dignity and respect. We strive to ensure that our 
policies and practices provide equal opportunities in respect 
of training, career development and promotion for existing and 
potential employees, at all levels throughout the business, 
irrespective of age, disability, gender, gender reassignment, 
marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race 
and ethnicity, nationality, religion or belief, sex, and sexual 
orientation. We also remain signatories to the Social Mobility 
Pledge, committing us to providing opportunities to people 
from all different backgrounds.

A detailed review of our employee representation across all 
protected characteristics, by both function and level within 
the organisation, was completed during the year. This identified 
both our strengths and where there are clear opportunities 
to improve and a new three-year strategy has been put in place 
to drive measurable improvement through to FY25 and ensure 
everyone who works within the Group feels they belong and 
are comfortable to be themselves. 

Gender diversity
Improving our gender diversity has been recognised as an 
initial priority with a support programme, a particular focus 
on graduate recruitment and early career intake and through 
carefully considered succession planning.

To drive improvement the Group:

 ∙  Is now measuring gender representation in each function 
and level within the Group on a quarterly tracking basis; 

 ∙ Has refreshed our recruitment processes, to ensure have 

balanced and diverse shortlists; and

 ∙ Has increased the female cohort on our Accelerated 
Leadership Programme, which is designed to identify 
our future Managing Directors.

Catalyst, our existing development and support programme, 
designed to help high-potential female employees develop 
their careers within the Group, is a key part of our gender 
diversity strategy. This programme is showing positive results 
with 48% of participants being either promoted or having their 
roles extended.

As well as Catalyst, we also worked with the Home Builders 
Federation and Women in Construction during the year 
to launch a nationwide employment programme for 
women, helping to address the gender imbalance in the 
construction workforce, which currently sees just 16% female 
representation.

As at 30 June 2023, women held 18% (FY22: 17%) 
of senior manager roles within the Group.

The gender diversity statistics for our employees as a whole, 
our senior managers, the direct reports to the Executive Committee, 
Executive Committee and PLC Directors are shown on page 35.  
Further information regarding the diversity (including ethnicity 
of our PLC directors and Executive Committee members can be 
found in the Nomination report on page 120.

Ethnic diversity
Increasing the ethnic diversity of our organisation is also a clear 
target over the coming years. In October 2022 we launched our 
ethnic minority community support programme, “Spotlight”. 
This is an eight-month externally facilitated programme, which 
includes feedback from the participants on actions needed, 
as well as a Group-wide EMC employee network. We were 
also delighted to have been part of the 30% Club’s “Leaders 
for Race Equity” inaugural programme, alongside nine other 
organisations seeking to share best practice and establish 
tangible actions for change. 

As at 30 June 2023, 7% (FY22: 7%) of employees were from 
ethnic minority backgrounds and 3.0% (FY22: 2.1%) of senior 
leadership positions were held by ethnic minority employees. 

Disability
Every effort is also being made to retain and support employees 
who become disabled during their time working within the 
Group and we continue to remove physical barriers for disabled 
colleagues or applicants. Our “Scaffold” network, detailed 
earlier, is an important forum to ensure we understand the 
issues faced and are supporting our disabled employees.

Human rights and anti-bribery
Our respect for human rights is embedded within our strategic 
priorities. We have policies and procedures in place that 
support the core values of the UN Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the UN Guiding Principles of Business and 
Human Rights, and we act in accordance with our principles 
regarding diversity and the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Concerns 
can also be raised anonymously via our whistleblowing process.

We are currently undertaking a thorough review of our approach 
with the aim of developing a more consistent, leading practice 
approach to managing material human rights risk across 
our value chain. In line with this, this year, we conducted 
an assessment to identify our most salient risks and key 
opportunities, and have also put in place measures to build on 
our existing due diligence systems. These have included:

 ∙  Updating signposting on our sites to encourage potential 
victims of modern slavery to seek help and, recognising 
that language barriers that may exist, our signposting 
has included QR coding for multiple languages.

 ∙ Recognising that the transition to net zero has the potential 
to increase human rights risks, particularly in relation to 
new technologies and new suppliers operating outside 
of our traditional supplier base and in more distant and 
less regulated markets. In one particular product area, 
photovoltaic panels, we are co-sponsoring the development 
of a procurement guide for responsible sourcing addressing 
the sourcing of materials and labour and the supply chain. 

Our non-financial KPIs regarding health and safety and 
employee engagement reflect our belief that it is a fundamental 
human right to work in a safe and supportive environment. 
Employees undertake training on modern slavery and site 
managers are given additional training in helping identify 
risks around modern slavery.

We have a strict anti-bribery and corruption policy and 
conduct our business in a fair, open and transparent manner. 
All employees are required to undertake regular training on 
our anti-bribery and corruption policy.

We also work closely with our partners to ensure our standards 
are applied to our extended workforce. We are signatories to 
the Gangmaster and Labour Abuse Authority Construction 
Protocol, helping us to share and receive information and 
training materials to identify and prevent modern slavery. It 
is a condition of all our supplier and sub-contractor contracts 
that they comply with the Bribery Act and our anti-bribery and 
corruption policy.

Objectives
0–1 year: Increase leadership capability in key people 
management skills, developing inclusive leadership. 
Focused people planning including diverse hiring.

1–3 years: Embed the Company’s new purpose and values 
and employee value proposition across all areas of the 
employee experience.

3+ years: Enhance the employee experience through technology.

Building sustainably

Leading sustainability

We are determined to be the leading national sustainable housebuilder. 
We believe that fundamental to building quality homes is building 
a positive environmental, social and economic legacy for future 
generations. To us, that means putting our customers at the heart 
of everything we do to create great homes and great places that are 
designed and built for better living and to meet the challenges of 
the future.

Building Sustainably Framework

We preserve and enhance the natural world 
by using resources responsibly, building 
resilient, low-carbon homes, and by creating 
places where people and nature can thrive.

Our Building Sustainably Framework 
The last year has been one of extraordinary economic, social 
and environmental shifts, and this is expected to continue. 
Global conflicts amplified what was an emerging energy 
and cost of living crisis. This has had consequences across 
our entire value chain – from the sourcing of raw materials 
through to consumer sentiment. Political upheavals in the UK 
have also challenged the ability of business to respond and 
adapt. Against this, a backdrop of increasingly urgent warnings 
about climate change and nature depletion. 

At Barratt, our response to this is simple, yet focused. We are 
responding to the most urgent issues by ensuring we are driving 
the delivery of our Building Sustainably Framework, in line 
with our targets and commitments. We view the progress on 
our environmental and social ambitions as essential to future 
proofing our business in the long term. The framework is 
built around three pillars: Nature, Places and People. These 
cover the material issues for our business and are informed by 
industry understanding, as well as the opinions and challenges 
offered by our stakeholders. 

This focus is reflected in all that we have achieved. We are 
building resilient, low-impact homes that will make our 
customers and our country future-ready. We are creating 
places where people, nature and local economies thrive 
together, whilst also addressing the skills gap and supporting 
under-represented and disadvantaged groups. We are 
unlocking affordability for more people and rewarding 
customers who make sustainable choices.

At a global level, our framework aligns with nine of the UN’s 
2030 Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), which are 
detailed within the framework wheel. We became a signatory to 
the UN Global Compact in July 2021, a voluntary initiative based 
on CEO commitments to implement universal sustainability 
principles, and to take steps to support UN goals. Our 
Communication On Progress qualifies for the Global Compact 
Advanced level. Nationally, our framework aligns with the 
UK Government’s 2050 net zero greenhouse gas emissions 
commitment and its 2025 Future Homes Standard. 

Creating value
It is crucial that, through our sustainability activities, we realise 
these benefits for all stakeholders. This means ensuring our 
sustainability programmes address societal challenges, drive 
greater financial productivity, and aid effective management of 
climate and socio-political risks and opportunities. Within each 
area of our framework, we seek to innovate, create genuine 
impact and support long-term value creation.

What matters most? 
Our Building Sustainably Framework has been created as a 
“living blueprint”, one that will evolve according to emerging 
sustainability risks and opportunities. This is why, periodically, 
we undertake a materiality review to understand which sustainability 
issues matter most to our stakeholders. Using the Future 
Fit Business Benchmark as a guiding framework, we have 
completed an extensive engagement programme of interviews 
and surveys. The next stage is to examine the findings, identify 
the issues that matter the most, and use these to advance our 
strategy, using an approach that considers business needs and 
potential for social and environmental value creation. These will 
be reported in 2024.

Leading sustainability

Creating value

What do our customers think? 
We are well positioned as the industry leader to inform and educate those in the market to buy a home. Sustainability forms 
part of our annual customer research and insight programme, which has allowed for over 25,500 interactions, reaching over 
2,700 of our customers and an additional 22,600 UK residents in the past three years. This further helps us understand their 
attitudes towards sustainability in the home and sustainable lifestyles. 

There is a clear appetite and expectation for sustainable homes. The majority of customers care about the environment and 
want to reduce their carbon emissions, and place value on homes that provide lower running costs.

63%

Say the cost of living and 
affordable energy is one 
of the top 3 issues facing 
the UK at this time*

62%

Say net zero commitments 
are an important factor when

How we manage sustainability 
An established and robust governance structure underpins the framework. We have a clear process – from identifying our 
most material issues to the operational delivery of action plans – across each of the framework pillars and their corresponding 
priorities. This allows us to create supporting work streams, which drive our implementation plans and create clear accountability 
around each issue. The Board delegates day-to-day delivery of our framework to the Executive Committee, which is supported 
by operational cross-business working groups. Regular monitoring of targets enables us to continually identify and re-prioritise 
areas for improvement. 

This year, we improved our internal reporting mechanisms – in particular enabling divisional management teams to benchmark 
and monitor carbon and energy performance to a site level to put performance improvements in place where they are most 
needed. We will include new management metrics in FY24. See page 91 for further detail on our transition pathway.

annually. Performance against our sustainability metrics is set out on page 48 and https://www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/
building-sustainably. To drive progress against our priorities, we have included a carbon reduction target in our LTPP since 2021 
and a waste intensity target in our annual bonus scheme since 2022. New bonus-related incentives at a divisional level have been 
introduced to encourage the reduction of waste across the business.

Sustainability Committee 
Our Sustainability Committee, chaired by our CEO, debates, 
reviews and scrutinises the sustainability strategy and 
implementation plan, and approves plans to mitigate risks and 
leverage opportunities. At least one member of the Committee 
must have sustainable development-related skills.

External experts are also invited to sessions to share deeper 
insights on specific topics. This year external experts provided 
input on the subject of environmental economics, the potential 
impact of carbon pricing and the transition to net zero in hard to 
abate sectors. 

The Committee’s full terms of reference can be found here: https://
www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors/corporate-governance

In this financial year, the Committee reviewed and approved 
updated sustainability policies, and agreed the outcomes of 
a Human Rights saliency assessment. 

Furthermore, progress against our strategy and objectives 
around waste, carbon, biodiversity and water were reviewed, 
with focus areas and future opportunities identified. 

Climate related issues are a standard agenda item at meetings 
– this year, the Committee reviewed our net zero transition 
pathway, international approaches to decarbonisation, carbon 
pricing and embodied carbon assessments. See page 91 for 
further detail.

The Committee also reviewed future reporting requirements, 
including likely nature related requirements. It provided input 
into the approach for the measurement and monitoring of 
biodiversity net gain and offsetting requirements and also 
considered requirements for nature positive business.

Transparency 
Transparency underpins our Building Sustainably Framework. 
Our disclosures are critical for providing insight into and 
challenging our progress on meaningful industry-wide 
improvement around sustainability. We are committed to 
continuously enhancing our disclosure to meet evolving 
stakeholder needs. This means that as well as celebrating 
success, we share where we fall short of our own expectations, 
and flag areas for improvement. As a result, all information 
on our strategy, targets, and performance is publicly available 
through our website and other publications. 

By completing the most material benchmarks and indices 
throughout the year, we allow our stakeholders to track our 
progress consistently, and to assess our performance in 
accordance with global and national standards.

Collaboration
We can’t achieve all that we do in isolation and we acknowledge 
the opportunity to be a catalyst for change across the sector, 
as well as develop shared solutions to shared challenges. 
We take an active role in a number of industry groups and 
engage with government bodies to implement policies and 
action for a sustainable future. See page 54 for further detail.

Building sustainable
homes for the future

With 40% of the UK’s carbon emissions coming from households, the 
residential sector has a critical role to play in meeting the nation’s 
climate goals. New build homes are already demonstrating their worth 
with 84% in England rated with an EPC of A or B compared to only 4% of 
existing housing stock.1

Zero carbon ready homes require fundamentally rethinking the 
design as well as the way we build. Solutions must meet the 
challenge practically, and the risks associated with innovating 
quickly and at scale across the country must be managed. 
Barratt has a clear roadmap to zero carbon in the homes we 
build, working with our supply chain and partners, to ensure we 
deliver high quality, sustainable homes that our customers love. 

Our roadmap is phased and we are currently trialling new 
technologies as part of our ongoing research and development 
programmes – more recently through eHome2 and the Zed 
House – to help refine our design and technology decisions. 
See page 34 for further detail. We have begun to incorporate 
some “zero carbon ready” technologies, for example at 
Delamere Park, our first gas-free development. 

Our “fabric-first” approach means making sure the building 
envelope maximises its insulation performance and is as 
airtight as possible whilst maintaining good indoor air quality 
which saves carbon an energy without the need for upgrading 
technology. Focusing efforts on the comparatively long-lived 
building fabric helps to “future proof” homes meaning they will 
be less likely to require difficult and expensive refurbishment 
upgrades at a later date.

Designing for nature
Most of our homes have their own 
private gardens. We have worked 
with the RSPB to maximise the 
potential of the gardens we create 
by installing gardens into our show 
homes that are packed with features 
such as “hedgehog highways”, 
wildlife-friendly planting and bee and 
bug houses to inspire our customers 
to recreate these in their own homes.

Materials
The majority of carbon emissions 
released during the lifecycle of a 
home occur before construction 
phase through materials, including 
extraction, manufacturing and 
transport. We are the only major 
housebuilder to sign up to support 
the proposed Building Regulations 
for limiting embodied carbon (“Part Z”). 
See our transition pathway on page 
91 for further detail on our roadmap 
to net zero across the value chain.

Adaptive homes
We want to ensure the home can 
be more agile to the customer’s 
needs over time. Our homes are 
incorporating smart technology 
that simplifies how customers 
interact with them in order to live 
comfortably and save money. In 
addition we are trialling technology 
to support an ageing population –

Section 172

Section 172 statement

The Board recognises the importance of working and engaging 
with a number of key stakeholders in order to promote the 
long-term success of our business. Such engagement helps us 
to gain a better understanding of what areas our stakeholders 
are interested in or concerned about and how our decisions 
impact them. Healthy engagement with our stakeholders 
underpins our governance framework, which is embedded 

throughout our business and helps to ensure we maintain 
high standards of business conduct. Engagement with 
our stakeholders supports the Board’s regard to the likely 
consequences of any decision in the long term. In accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, the following 
pages set out how the Board acts in a way that promotes the 
long-term success of the Company, whilst considering various 
matters including those set out in s.172(1) of the Act: 

Key matter of which the Board must have regard

Key matter of which the Board must 
have regard

The likely consequences of 
any decision in the long term

How the Board takes each of the matters into consideration

Our business is cyclical in nature and it is therefore imperative that the Board takes a long-term 
approach to its decision making. This supports our ability to deliver our purpose and strategic 
priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders. It also helps prepare 
the business for changes in Government and regulatory policies that impact our industry. For 
example, the introduction of the Future Homes Standard that becomes mandatory in 2025, will 
require all of our homes to produce 75-80% less carbon emissions than they do now. To meet 
these types of requirements within the prescribed timescales we have to act now, details of 
which can be found on page 47.

In addition, the Board regularly assesses emerging risks that may impact the business and the 
way in which it operates in the future. It also reviews its Principal Risks annually to ensure that 
they remain appropriate and that the correct internal controls and mitigations are in place. For 
more information on our approach to risk management see pages 71 to 77. Our approach towards 
climate-related risks and opportunities can be found on pages 78 to 98.

Taking a longer-term view helps the Board to assess the viability of the business over a 
three-year period on an annual basis. Our Viability Statement can be found on page 99. 

The interests of the 
Group’s employees

Details of how we have regard to each of these and our engagement with them can be found 
on pages 35 to 39 and 55 to 56.

The need to foster 
the Group’s business 
relationships with suppliers, 
customers and others

The impact of the Group’s 
operations on the community 
and the environment

The desirability of the Group 
maintaining a reputation 
for high standards of 
business conduct

The need to act fairly as 
between members of 
the Company

Details of how we have regard to each of these and our engagement with them can be found 
on pages 54, 55 and 59 to 61.

Details of how we have regard to each of these and our engagement with them can be found 
on pages 62 to 63.

The Board sets the culture of the business from the top. This culture seeks to promote the right 
behaviours throughout the organisation in line with our values. In addition, all employees are 
required to understand all policies and procedures including those that look to ensure high 
standards of conduct. These include our policies and procedures around Health, Safety and 
Environment; Whistleblowing; Anti-Bribery and Corruption; Human Rights; and Modern Slavery. 
All of our employees participate in training sessions around diversity and inclusion and dignity 
and respect to better understand the behaviours that are acceptable and those that are not. 

We have reviewed our purpose and values during the year to further promote high standards of 
business conduct. The new purpose and values will be launched internally later this year and 
will be reported on in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts. For further information on our 
culture and values see page 112. Copies of our conduct policies can be found on our website at 
www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/building-sustainably/our-publications-and-policies/policies. 

The Board is cognisant of the need to act fairly between members of the Company. Regular 
engagement with shareholders takes place throughout the financial year to understand their 
views and act in their best interests. Details can be found on pages 57 to 58. All shareholders 
have equal voting rights with one vote per share. We ensure that information is shared to all 
of our shareholders at the same time via a variety of communication channels such as our 
dedicated investor section on our website, postal mailings, emails and RNS announcements. In 
addition, all shareholders are invited to attend the Company’s AGM, either physically or virtually, 
where they can meet with Board members and ask questions. For those shareholders who are 
unable to attend the AGM, we have set up a dedicated shareholder email address barrattagm@
barrattplc.co.uk for them to submit their questions ahead of the meeting. These are answered via 
a Q&A document that is added to our website after the meeting.

The Board considers each of these factors, amongst others, 
when setting and implementing our strategy. In addition, as 
part of its decision making process it considers the current and 
emerging risks (both financial and non-financial) and the impact 
that they may have on the long-term success of the Company 
and the Group’s Principal Risks. The Company’s approach to 
Risk Management can be found on pages 71 to 77, with climate- 
related risks and opportunities set out on pages 78 to 98.

The following pages set out the engagement that has taken 
place with the following key stakeholders:

 ∙ Customers (see page 54)

 ∙ Employees (see page 55)

 ∙ Shareholders (see page 57)

 ∙ Sub-contractors and supply chain (see page 59)

 ∙ Banks (see page 61)

 ∙ Local communities and the environment (see page 62)

 ∙ Government, opposition parties and regulators (see page 64)

The Board has identified each of these as a key stakeholder 
due to their influence on the success of our business model 
and our strategy and because they represent the key resources 
and relationships that support the generation and preservation 
of value in the Group. Each financial year, the Board reviews 
the stakeholders that it considers to be key to ensure that 
they remain appropriate and to ensure that they have a good 
understanding of their interests and how these may have 
evolved. The Board also looks to identify any new stakeholders 
whose interests may impact the long-term success of the 
Company and therefore need to be taken into account as part of 
the decision making process. For each key stakeholder we have 
set out:

 ∙ Why we engage;

 ∙ How we engage;

 ∙ Metrics – how we measure effectiveness;

 ∙ Interests and concerns;

 ∙ Outcomes of engagement; and

 ∙ The impact on Board decisions.

How the Board makes decisions
Throughout the year, the Board remained mindful of the 
implications that its decisions may have on our stakeholders 
and the potential reputational risk for the Group. This has 
highlighted the continual need for regular, clear and comprehensive 
engagement with our workforce, suppliers, shareholders and 
customers throughout various decision making processes 
to ensure that we continue to do the right thing and mitigate 
against matters that may potentially harm the reputation of 
the Group. Regular updates on the engagement undertaken 
and the outcomes are provided to the Board by the Executive 
Directors and there is an annual agenda that includes deep 
dive discussions on topics such as Diversity and Inclusion, 
ESG, Customers, and Investor Relations. Whenever possible, 
the Board (or members of the Board) will engage directly 
with our stakeholder groups. For example, the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee annually engages with shareholders 
on Executive Directors’ remuneration in person, via video 
calls or through written correspondence. Feedback from this 
engagement is discussed by the Remuneration Committee. 
Any decisions or changes made as a result, are communicated 
to shareholders via this Annual Report and Accounts for them 
to vote on at the AGM (details of this year’s engagement and 
outcomes can be found on page 57). In addition, the Designated 
NED for Workforce Engagement will report back to the Board 
the topics discussed and issues raised at the Workforce Forum 
meetings and how these are going to be addressed. Actions 
taken as a result of these discussions are communicated back 
to the Workforce Forum and via the Group’s intranet in the form 
of a “You said, we did” notification. 

The Board appreciates that there may be situations where 
conflicts will arise between different stakeholder groups. 
In such circumstances, the Board will seek to understand 
the needs and priorities of each stakeholder group during 
its discussions and as part of its decision making process. 
It manages such conflicts by assessing shareholder and 
stakeholder interests from the perspective of the long-term 
sustainable success of the business, as is illustrated in the 
significant decisions examples set out on pages 52 to 53. Such 
actions and decisions by the Board also seek to align with the 
Group’s culture of customer focus, resilience and adaptability. 
In addition, the Board ensures that our culture encourages our 
wider workforce to take pride in what we do, and to do the right 
thing when in contact with customers, members of the local 
communities in which we operate, and other stakeholders.

Significant decisions
The main activities and decisions of the Board are set out 
on page 111. The following are just a couple of examples 
of significant decisions made by the Board, how they were 
made and, where applicable, how conflicts between different 
stakeholders were managed. Other significant decisions 
made by the Board are set out in the main activities section 
on page 111.

Section 172 continued

Stakeholders considered:
 ∙ Customers;

 ∙ Employees;

 ∙ Shareholders;

 ∙ Sub-contractors and supply chain; and

 ∙ Local communities.

How the Board made its decision:
Management undertook a number of conversations with a variety 
of stakeholders ranging from employees to local authorities and 
the supply chain. This highlighted the importance of environmental 
and social sustainability to our key stakeholder groups. Five 
possible territories focusing on sustainability and the environment 
were presented to the Executive Committee for consideration, 
who reduced them to three. These were presented to a sub-group 
comprising of representatives from the Executive Committee, 
Group Communications and Group HR who proposed three 
definitions for a new purpose and values to the Chief Executive. 

The agreed purpose and values were then presented to the Board 
together with the narrative that will accompany each, in terms of 
the importance of each element for the Group and the alignment 
with shareholder expectations of the business. The Board also 
considered the proposed plan to launch and embed the new 
purpose and values throughout the business. The key risk identified 
by the Board was ensuring buy-in from the business to the new 
purpose and values. The Board suggested ways of supporting this 
for example using real live examples to better illustrate the values 
and including the purpose and values in the induction process for 
all employees to ensure clarity as to what is expected.

The Board was mindful of the work and cost that the launch 
and embedding of a new purpose and values would incur on 
employees but was confident that Management would monitor 
the level of resource required and adjust as required. In addition, 
it was noted that the cost of this would utilise cash that could 
potentially be used to increase the returns to shareholders. The 
Board was however satisfied that the new purpose and values 
would promote the long-term success of the Company as it will 
help drive positive behaviours and result in a more inclusive and 
engaged workforce who are able to fully articulate what the 
business stands for. Accordingly, the Board approved the 
purpose and values and the proposed launch plan.

New purpose and values
At its meeting in March 2023, the Board considered a new 
purpose and values for the Group together with a potential 
launch plan. The aim of this process is to deliver a fresh, 
memorable, distinctive and forward-looking purpose, together 
with a set of core values and associated behaviours that will 
help us deliver against it. When embedded and activated 
through decision making, the purpose and values will help 
position the Group for the next decade and will:

(i) 

 Support the Company’s ambition to continue to be 
recognised and understood as a leader, differentiated from 
others within the sector;

(ii)   Enable leaders and employees to articulate with consistency 

what we stand for, and be clear about the behaviours 
required to enable delivery against the purpose; and

(iii)  Help to build trust, engagement and reappraisal across our 

internal and external stakeholder groups.

Protecting the Group’s resilience
In August 2022, the Board considered various levers it could 
pull to protect the Group’s resilience and to mitigate against 
the challenging market conditions that the business was facing 
as it moved into the final quarter of 2022.

Share Buyback Programme
During the financial year the Board kept under review 
opportunities for further investment in the business and 
prevailing equity market conditions with a view to returning 
excess capital to its shareholders at the appropriate time.

Stakeholders considered:
 ∙ Employees; and

 ∙ Shareholders.

How the Board made its decision:
Management updated the Board on the Group’s capital 
structure to enable the Board to assess the balance between 
the capital requirements of the business and returning excess 
capital to shareholders, and continuing to maintain balance 
sheet strength and flexibility. In line with its Dividend Policy, the 
Board agreed to make a final dividend payment to shareholders 
for FY23, but recognised that it had the ability to return 
additional surplus capital to its shareholders.

The Board considered the capital requirements of the business, 
the market backdrop, balance sheet position and shareholder 
expectations as part of its deliberations. The Board also took 
into account the advice from the Group’s corporate brokers, 
Credit Suisse and UBS, who confirmed that in the context of 
historical trading and the Group’s valuation at the time, it was 
economically sensible to participate in a Share Buyback 
programme. Other methods, such as a special dividend, were 
also considered by the Board, who concluded that a share 
buyback programme would benefit shareholders, specifically 
through the opportunity for increased future dividends per 
share on the remaining shares and would also result in an 
increase in earnings per share. In addition, given that many of 
our employees are also shareholders, they too would benefit 
from future dividends opportunity.

Accordingly, the Board approved a share buyback programme 
to return up to £200m of surplus cash to shareholders during 
the course of FY23. 

Stakeholders considered:
 ∙ Customers;

 ∙  Employees;

 ∙ Shareholders;

 ∙ Sub-contractors and supply chain;

 ∙ Local communities; and

 ∙ Government, opposition parties and regulators.

How the Board made its decision:
At its meeting in August 2022, the Board received a trading 
update from Management which signalled a possible slowdown 
in the market. Given the cyclicality of the business, the Board 
were cautious about taking any immediate action and agreed to 
monitor activity on a month by month basis. During this period, 
the Board considered actions taken during previous downturns 
to see if any were relevant to the current circumstances, 
compared our recruitment headcount plans against our target 
operating model to ensure that we continued to have the right 
organisational structure and levels of resource in place and 
assessed our business plan against developments in 
the market.

As the uncertainty in market conditions continued, Management 
recommended the following actions to the Board: 

 ∙ to restrict the acquisition of land to those divisions without a 

sufficient land bank, where there was a commitment 
to buy the land and paused new investments; 

 ∙ to introduce a recruitment freeze other than for critical roles;

 ∙ to reviewed both overhead and non-overhead costs to identify 

potential savings;

 ∙ to increase focus on driving leads and appointments through 

higher incentive levels and more specific marketing activity; and 

 ∙ to slow down the build rate to align it with the sales rate to 

avoid having too much work-in progress.

The Board were at all times aware of the potential impact that 
their decisions would have on various stakeholders. For example 
existing employees would need to undertake roles for colleagues 
who were not being replaced; sub-contractors and the supply 
chain would be losing out on work and orders respectively. The 
Board was however satisfied that the actions they were taking 
would promote the long-term success of the Company. Less 
expenditure on land would help preserve the Group’s cash 
balance and the increased marketing activity and incentives 
would hopefully appeal to more customers and drive sales. 
Accordingly, the Board agreed to implement each of the actions 
recommended by Management.

Stakeholder engagement

Engaging with our stakeholders

Stakeholder engagement is an important part of our operations. 
The Board is appraised of the feedback received and takes this into 
account when making decisions that may impact our stakeholders 
either collectively or individually.

Customers
Why we engage
Customers are at the heart of everything we do. Without them 
there is no business for us to operate. It is imperative that we 
understand their needs and adapt our business processes and 
product accordingly.

 For value for our customers see page 30.

How we engage
We utilise different channels of engagement with our customers 
depending on the information that we are trying to gain or provide.

Company engagement
We ask for regular feedback from our customers directly 
through Trustpilot, and both the 8 week and 9 month National 
New Homes Customer Satisfaction surveys to help us make 
improvements to our service and their home buying journey. 
We have continued to engage with our customers on cladding 
and fire-safety to address any of their issues and concerns. 
We continuously update our website with up-to-date information 
about Barratt: where we are building, our key credentials (such 
as sustainability and energy efficiency) and ways in which 
we support our customers in their search for one of our high 
quality homes. We also provide customers with guidance on 
home and garden maintenance. 

Social media community management and social listening 
provides two-way engagement across a range of channels. 
We monitor key social media platforms and review sites to 
identify comments of both positive and negative sentiment. 
We engage where appropriate to develop a positive social 
community, address customer issues and advocate our brands.

We have an established customer and insight programme 
that helps us stay engaged with our customers and deliver 
action led insights. We involve our customers and those in the 
market to buy a new home in research to understand their 
perceptions and preferences on matters such as the cost of 
living crisis, how they search for their new home, our brand 
positioning, our product, and their living preferences. We also 
review the specification of future homes to aid decision making 
and future business planning. We collect insight to understand 
customer awareness of sustainability within housebuilding, 
specifically around energy and water efficiency and changing 
legislation, and how this impacts their buying decisions. This is 
done through the use of quantitative and qualitative research 
methods reaching thousands of customers in any one year.

We know from our research that expectation from low carbon 
homes is high. Three quarters of those in market expect 

new build properties to include features that make them as 
energy efficient as possible, and the desire for this technology 
remains high. For example, we are collecting insights on 
our our first gas-free site, Delamare Park, to gain direct 
feedback from customers living with the technology required 
to meet The Future Homes Standard, as well as detailed 
technical monitoring, which will continue to feed into our 
design and planning decisions. Through engagement with our 
customers we have determined new ways of helping them 
better understand the cost savings they can achieve through 
purchasing a new build home (see page 31 for further details) 
and introduced new incentives and selling schemes to help them 
with affordability challenges (see page 30). 

Board level engagement
The Group Customer and Change Director, Jeremy Hipkiss, 
updates the Board annually on actions taken to engage with 
customers and the outcomes of such engagement, as well as 
providing insight on what else could or should be done. During 
the year, Katie Bickerstaffe, one of our Non-Executive Directors, 
continued to support the review and enhancement of the 
customer journey by bringing insight from her Executive role.

Metrics – How we measure effectiveness
The following metrics are reported to the Board by the Chief 
Executive and/or the Group Customer and Change Director 
to enable it to consider and agree what, if any, changes to make 
in how and when we engage with our customers:

 ∙ 8-week HBF National New Homes Customer Satisfaction 

rating – we achieved, 5 Star rating for the 14th consecutive 
year, meaning that 90% or more of our customers are willing 
to recommend us to a friend.

 ∙ 9-month NHBC National New Homes Survey rating measures 

the satisfaction of our customers after being in their new 
home for a period of nine months. This is included as a metric 
in the annual bonus scheme.

 ∙ Defect resolution – measures the number of open defects 

and time taken to resolve.

 ∙  Complaint resolution – looks at the formal complaint volumes 

and resolution timescales.

 ∙ Trustpilot scores – provides genuine feedback from 

customers about their buying and service experiences – 
for FY23 we were 4.4 for Barratt and 4.3 for David Wilson 
Homes (FY22: 4.3 for both brands).

 ∙ Open rate for our seasonal newsletter emails to customers 

was 29.9% with click through rate at 7.65%.

 ∙ Customer research and insight.

54

Interests and concerns
During FY23, the key interests and concerns of our customers 
remained focused on the cost of living, particularly running 
costs, energy efficiency and removing financial barriers to 
entering the market. Access to green open space remained 
a priority, as well as an appetite for sustainable homes. 

Outcomes from engagement
We constantly look to improve in response to any feedback or 
information from our customers. During FY23 our marketing 
plans focused on communicating the benefits of our homes to 
our customers, focusing on the cost savings associated with 
our energy efficient homes, how we are designing homes to 
support flexible living and the changes being made due to the 
requirements of the Future Homes Standard. 

We continued to engage with lenders to encourage mortgage 
product innovation to support affordability challenges and improve 
mortgage products, process and criteria for our customers.

Effect of engagement with customers on Board decisions
The Executive Committee continued to drive defect and 
complaint resolution across the divisions and issued revised 
policies and procedures to ensure compliance following our 
activation with the New Homes Quality Board for reservations 
from November 2022. They also closely monitored build stage 
movements to ensure customers received handover of their 
new home within agreed timescales and agreed action plans 
to support those sites not selling in line with build. 

With interest rates rising sharply and inflation continuing to 
outstrip wages, affordability is a challenge for many prospective 
customers. In order to support customers with the challenge of 
affordability, particularly after the closure of Help to Buy to new 
business on 31st October, we have, for example:

 ∙ Continued to support Deposit Unlock which allows 95% 

lending on new build homes.

 ∙ Worked with lenders to promote the launch of Green 

Mortgages which take into account the savings from energy 
efficiency in affordability assessments.

 ∙ Reviewed the digital options available to us to engage with our 
customers at the earliest opportunity to establish affordability 
and support them on their home ownership journey.

Employees
Why we engage
Without our employees we would not be able to build the high 
quality sustainable homes that our customers need. It is due 
to their hard work and commitment that we are strong, both 
operationally and financially. We must therefore attract, recruit 
and retain the best people. To do this we need to understand 
what matters most to them and ensure we have the right 
policies, processes and procedures, remuneration, as well as 
progression, training and development opportunities in place 
to support them. Engagement with our employees enables 
the Board to better understand the issues that are important 
to them and helps nurture a mutual understanding between 
senior management and their teams.

 For the value to our employees see page 35.

How we engage
We use a variety of channels of engagement which enable 
two-way interaction with employees and allow them to voice 
their concerns or thoughts either directly or anonymously. 

Company engagement
Our Workforce Forum is developing into an important tool for 
providing insight to the thoughts and opinions of our employees 
and what matters most to them. In FY23 the Workforce Forum 
met three times, twice virtually and once in-person. We also 
arranged a site visit for the workforce to see the Insight House 
and understand the role it plays in supporting local schools to 
see the sustainable elements we build into our current homes. 
Topics discussed included hybrid working, sustainability 
(renewable energy and waste), the cost of living, training, 
development and progression, the results of our engagement 
survey, health and wellbeing and Executive Director and employee 
remuneration strategies. An overview of our Diversity and 
Inclusion strategy was also shared with the forum and feedback 
was taken on how to better reach the differing office and site 
teams on this topic.

Employees can directly contact the Designated NED for Workforce 
Engagement on any matters relating to the workplace, on a 
confidential basis through a dedicated email address. 

We regularly send out emails (to Barratt or personal email 
addresses), newsletters, webinars and video messages to 
update our employees on issues that may be of interest to them, 
such as benefits, training, health and safety, hybrid working, 
sustainability and charitable giving. We have begun a programme 
of site visits by the HR team, to support those who spend less 
of their role online to ensure they are able to sign up to and 
receive the range of benefits available. We have established five 
employee networks (see page 37 for more details) and collectively 
they deliver an annual plan of key events and religious festivals, 
from webinars, book clubs and lead discussions, allowing our 
people to develop a wider insight and understanding of the 
business as well as develop a network that they can rely on. 

Our annual engagement survey provided great insight into the 
issues that matter most to our employees. Local action plans 
were put in place with individual functions and teams to either 
improve or enhance the engagement that they undertake with 
their teams. The Executive Committee received an analysis 
of the verbatim comments received to consider and address 
as appropriate. In 2023 we also ran a dignity and respect 
survey, to understand the specific issues, the results of which 
were shared with the leadership teams and action plans are 
in development.

Company engagement continued
We also surveyed all employees as part of our materiality 
assessment to understand which issues are of most importance 
to them. The findings will be critical to the advance of our 
sustainability strategy during FY24.

Board level engagement
During FY23, the Board received regular updates from Sharon 
White, the Designated NED of Workforce Engagement on the 
activities and discussions of the Workforce Forum, the Chief 
Executive on the topics discussed and decisions made by the 
Sustainability Committee, the SHE and Construction Director on 
health and safety matters, the HR Director on people strategy 
and diversity and inclusion, and from the Trustees of the Barratt 
Foundation. These updates include what engagement has taken 
place with our employees, the outcomes and the actions to be taken. 

The Board has this year reinstated its physical site visits, visiting 
the London and Central regions in March and May respectively. 
Board members received a regional update from the senior 
management team and met site and sales employees.

Following the success of the Town Hall event in 2022, the Chief 
Executive, David Thomas, the Chief Operating Officer, Steven 
Boyes and the Chief Financial Officer, Mike Scott, held our 
second one in January 2023. Colleagues across the Group were 
able to hear directly from them and on behalf of the Board on 
topics such as current market conditions, the cost of living 
crisis, and progression and development. Employees had the 
opportunity to suggest, in advance, any topics they wanted to 
hear about and to ask questions on the day. These included 
hybrid working, bonuses, our plans for the future, incentives 
for our customers to the importance of our employee networks, 
our plans for offices and the performance of our share price. 
A full Q&A document was issued afterwards and the event was 
recorded for those who were not able to join on the day. 

Health and safety remains a fundamental priority for the 
business. The Chair of the SHE Committee, Chris Weston, now 
attends all SHE Operations Committee meetings and can make 
suggestions for improvement and hear first-hand the issues 
and challenges being faced by the teams. The membership of 
the SHE Operations Committee has been extended to include 
representatives from site. For more information on the SHE 
Committee see pages 133 to 136.

The Board entered into a rolling three-year funding agreement 
with the Barratt Foundation to further engage employees 
with charitable giving and enable the Foundation to enter into 
multi-year partnerships, which employees can support and 
take advantage of the volunteering opportunities available.

Metrics – How we measure effectiveness
The following information is reported to the Board by the Chief 
Executive to enable it to consider and agree what, if any changes 
to make in how and when we engage with our employees:

 ∙ Employee engagement scores – provides a quantified 

measurement of engagement.

 ∙ Employee turnover – provides insight into the number of 

colleagues leaving the business and enables benchmarking 
across the industry.

 ∙ IIR – measures the Company’s safety performance against 
the national average for the same industry and provides 
an insight into areas of improvement to lower the rate 
to increase the level of safety of our employees.

 ∙ Diversity – helps us monitor the diversity of our workforce 

and inclusivity of our working environment.

 ∙ Gender and ethnicity pay gap – helps us ensure equality 

in remuneration across the organisation.

 ∙ Reports to the whistleblowing line – helps us ensure that we 
continue to do the right thing and tackle any issues in a timely 
and efficient manner.

Interests and concerns
Throughout FY23, the key interests and concerns of our 
employees related to remuneration, resource, training, 
development and progression, health and wellbeing, flexible 
working, the cost of living, and their own and the Group’s carbon 
footprint and it’s impact on the environment.

Outcomes from engagement
The engagement with our employees has seen significant 
positive movement on employee wellbeing, open 
communication, and reward and recognition, reflected in 
higher scores in these areas. We have also been able to better 
understand our employees  areas of focus; collaboration and 
communication, equal and fair treatment, and customer focus.

Supporting collaboration and communication has seen changes 
to the way we share Group information, with a number of 
webinars and videos to link teams throughout the business. 
We have extended our family policies, to ensure both parents 
and carers feel supported at key life stages, and reviewed our 
mental health first aider’s support following feedback from the 
Workforce forum.

As part of our Diversity and Inclusion strategy we have 
established a network for our ethnic minority colleagues, 
to better understand different perspectives and created a 
programme of informative sessions to increase understanding 
of different cultures and religious beliefs. 

We have also updated our Diversity and Inclusion policy and 
established a zero tolerance approach, supported by dignity 
and respect training for our existing and new employees.

We launched an energy efficiency campaign on our intranet site, 
sharing easy ways to save energy at home and in the office. The 
blog posts advice and tips from the Energy Saving Trust on how to 
improve energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions and save money.

Effect of engagement with employees on Board decisions
The cost of living crisis has had a significant impact on our 
employees. Accordingly, the Board agreed to extend salary 
supplement payment of £1,000 for a further six months 
to June 2023. The payment was made in equal monthly 
instalments to each employee below our senior leadership team 
(95% of our employees) (see page 138). 

 ∙ The amount of fundraising by employees – provides an insight 
into the level of engagement with Barratt Foundation initiatives.

Other benefit improvements included the extension of our 
maternity and paternity leave and paid leave for carers. 

The Board continue to provide funding to the Barratt Foundation 
to support the work that it is undertaking with the divisions 
across the business and charitable partners to further 
engage employees to participate in charitable giving and 
volunteering opportunities.

 See page 35

Link to strategy  

Shareholders
Why we engage
Shareholders own the Company. It is therefore imperative that 
we listen to what they have to say and operate the business in 
a way that delivers long-term value growth and sustainable 
returns. The Company’s reputation could be damaged and it 
could be prevented from attracting new investments without 
the full understanding and support of its shareholders.

 For value for our shareholders see page 11.

How we engage
Investors and retail shareholders appreciate contact, and whilst 
virtual meetings dominated during the year, we increased in-person 
meetings with a number of shareholders. We intend to offer 
both virtual and in-person meetings in the future.

Company engagement:
The Executive Directors and the Group Investor Relations Director 
follow a comprehensive programme of investor meetings and 
calls to discuss investors’ questions and areas of concern, 
particularly following the release of annual and half year results 
and trading updates. These included a combination of in person 
and virtual investor roadshows with shareholders in the UK, 
Europe and North America, following the Group’s final FY22 and 
interim FY23 results, and ad-hoc one-to-one meetings (including 
in-person and virtual conferences and fireside chat events) and 
Group investor meetings at a number of conferences during the 
year. The use of virtual meetings has again helped to improve 
our engagement with smaller institutions, regional pension 
funds and private wealth managers on results and non-results 
cycle roadshows.

We continue to engage actively on our sustainability strategy. 
The Group Investor Relations Director and the Group Sustainability 
Director attended various ESG conferences and meetings and 
responded to incoming queries from analysts to provide insight 
into the Group’s activities. Key areas of shareholder focus 
included the Future Homes Standard and the changes this will 
require in the homes we build; our value chain carbon footprint 
and our response to the impacts of climate change; our 
approach to expanding our use of timber frame construction 
and modern methods of construction; diversity and inclusion, 
and modern slavery benchmarking studies. 

During the year two visits were arranged to see the Group’s future 
home development activities at the University of Salford. These 
visits involved presentations and tours of the Zed House and 
eHome2 by members of the Group Design & Technical team and 
were attended by more than 60 analysts, investors and advisers. 

We issue regular trading updates via the London Stock Exchange 
Regulatory News Service. These are normally published in May, 
July and October with our half and full year announcements 
in February and September respectively. Reflecting the 
challenging trading conditions in the final quarter of calendar 
2022, we issued an additional trading update in early January, 
ahead of our interim results announcement, to update our 
investors and the analysts in a timely manner. During the year 
we also issued specific announcements with respect to the 
progress of the share buyback programme (see page 53), the 
signing of the Self-Remediation Terms and Contract, as well 
as, the Scottish Safer Building Accord, addressing necessary 
fire-safety issues on all our buildings of 11 metres and above, 
built in the last 30 years (see page 24). Finally, at the end of 
June, we also announced a portfolio sale of 604 future homes 
to Citra Living (see page 26).

Our website is a valuable engagement tool and is continuously 
updated to reflect current information on matters such as 
sustainability, governance and building safety.

The Company Secretarial team, together with the Company’s 
Registrars, have engaged with various retail shareholders and 
dealt with enquiries relating to their shareholdings or other 
information requests. The Company Secretary normally notifies 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive of any areas of concern or 
importance raised by retail shareholders. No such queries were 
raised during the year.

We continue to encourage retail shareholders to request 
digital communications, in support of our work to enhance our 
sustainability credentials and reduce our carbon footprint as 
well as setting up dividend mandates, to enable them to receive 
their dividends faster and more securely. 

Board level engagement:
The Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s brokers and the 
Group Investor Relations Director update the Board on a regular 
basis on the Company’s investor relations activities and shareholder 
and analyst feedback on the Group’s trading updates and 
interim and full year results as well as ad hoc announcements, 
to ensure that all Directors are aware of, and have a clear 
understanding of, the views of our major shareholders.

All Board members are available at the AGM to answer questions 
submitted in advance (by post or via email to agmquestions@

person or via a live webcast. The Chief Executive also updates 
shareholders on the Group’s performance and activities during 
the year. The Notice of AGM is circulated to all shareholders at 
least 20 business days prior to the meeting. All resolutions are 
voted on by way of a poll.

In May 2023, the Remuneration Committee Chair consulted with 
major shareholders and proxy voting agencies on the Group’s 
FY23 remuneration outcomes, the Remuneration Policy and 
its implementation in FY24 (see page 138). The Chairman, the 
Senior Independent Director and other Non-Executive Directors 
are available to attend meetings with major shareholders to 
gain an understanding of any issues and concerns.

Following her appointment on 1 June 2023, Caroline Silver, our 
newly appointed Chair, met with a number of our shareholders 
to gain a better understanding of their interests and concerns.

Metrics – How we measure effectiveness
The following information is reported to the Board by the Chief 
Executive and the Group Investor Relations Director to enable it 
to consider and agree what, if any, changes to make in how and 
when we engage with our shareholders:

 ∙ Share register movements – provides insight into the number 

of shareholders buying or selling shares in the Company.

 ∙ Results of qualitative investor feedback – helps to improve 

engagement and understanding of key interests and concerns.

 ∙ The number of meetings attended – shows the level of 
engagement led by the Company. In FY23 the Executive 
Directors, supported by Senior Management, attended 
169 investor meetings (FY22: 155), 131 one-to-one 
meetings (FY22: 137) and 38 Group meetings (FY22: 18) 
engaging with around 46.6% (FY21: 45.6%) of shareholders 
(by shareholding value).

Interests and concerns
The key areas of interest and concern for our 
shareholders included: 

The impact of significant changes in homebuyer demand due to 
inward migration, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living and 
mortgage rates on the private reservation rate during the year.

On capital allocation, shareholders have sought to understand 
more, both with respect to the Group’s future dividend policy in 
combination with the potential, over the short but also medium 
term, to return additional surplus capital. 

Sustainability matters, notably, the potential impact of the 
Future Homes Standard, the Zed House and eHome2 projects 
and details around our value chain emissions and our strategy 
to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Our approach to human rights and Modern Slavery, our developing 
diversity and inclusion strategy, the gender and ethnicity pay 
gaps, and our commitment to paying the real Living Wage. 

Increased understanding as to the speed with which we can 
deliver new product innovation into the homes we build; the 
ability for customers to pay a premium for such improvements; 
and the lessons being learnt on the incremental costs looking 
to the Future Homes Standard changes in 2025.

The impact of signing the remediation terms in England on 
legacy properties on the financial position of the Group.

Outcomes from engagement
Shareholders have been kept informed through timely and clear 
disclosure of the private reservation rate, as well as the transparent 
detailing of the contribution from alternative sales channels. 

Our engagement also gave investors the opportunity to share 
their views on the relative merits of ordinary dividends and 
potential returns of surplus capital either by way of special 
dividends or through buybacks.

The visits to the Zed House and eHome2 projects allowed 
investors and analysts to see the prototypes and the new 
technologies being tested as well as ask questions of the 
Group Design & Technical team.

The Group enhanced its regular investor presentation materials 
to include additional details around our sustainability actions 
and targets and the various issues on which shareholders and 
wider stakeholders wished to increase their understanding.

Effect of engagement with shareholders on 
Board decisions
The Board gained further understanding of shareholder 
expectations in respect of ESG matters, particularly climate 
change risks and opportunities, following our publication of 
TCFD disclosures in the FY22 Annual Report. 

Reflecting additional shareholder feedback, the Board has 
included further development around our TCFD disclosures in 
this Annual Report and Accounts (see pages 78 to 98 inclusive), 
as well as reaffirming its commitment to developing future 
investor communications which increasingly integrate ESG 
related issues with financial and operational performance. 

The Board periodically reviewed the Group’s ordinary dividend 
policy in combination with potential returns of surplus capital, 
following on from the £200m buyback effected during FY23. 
In principle, the Board continues to believe that excess capital 
should be returned to shareholders when it is appropriate to do 
so. Whilst the Company remains in a strong financial position, 
the UK housing market remains difficult and the outlook 
remains uncertain. We have therefore agreed that whilst our 
reduction in dividend cover to 1.75 times will apply from FY24 as 
planned, there will be no further share buybacks at this stage.

Sub-contractors and supply chain
Why we engage
Without our sub-contractors and supply chain we would not be 
able to build high quality, sustainable products at the volume 
expected by the market. It is therefore important for us to build 
relationships with them to secure continuity of supply of materials, 
support our productivity levels, manage costs of materials 
and sourcing alternative suppliers and avoid undue delays in 
construction. We must have a good understanding of what they 
expect from the Company in return for their continued support.

 For value for our sub-contractors and supply chain see page 46.

How we engage
The following methods of engagement give us the opportunity 
to speak to sub-contractors and our supply chain as a group 
which ensures consistency in the messaging and opportunity 
for networking and sharing ideas and best practice. Individual 
meetings allow us to focus on specific areas or issues relevant 
to that stakeholder.

Company engagement:
We held our annual Supply Chain conference in person in 
March 2023. It was attended by 120 of our key Group suppliers. 
We shared our immediate and medium-term plans and thoughts 
on the role our suppliers can play in helping us to achieve our 
objectives, including the reduction of Scope 3 carbon emissions, 
and gained an understanding of the issues they were facing and 
how we could support them. 

We shared relevant demand forecasting information with all 
key material suppliers to enable them to ensure appropriate 
manufacturing capacity is available to meet our requirements.

We continue to support suppliers in the completion of our 
Supplier Sustainability Maturity Matrix to drive progress and 
develop shared solutions in the priority areas of carbon, waste, 
modern slavery, and governance. This was created with the 
Supply Chain Sustainability School, of which we are a Gold 
member, to inform and shape the provision of targeted learning 
and training resources. 

In support of this, we have built on the waste reduction workshop 
we held with a cross section of suppliers in 2022 and continue 
with one-to-one meetings to discuss the use of alternative 
packaging and fuels such as electricity, HVO and hydrogen.

A key area of focus is working with our highest emitting 
suppliers and sub-contractors to better understand our Scope 
3 emissions and how we might be able to help to reduce them. 
More information was requested from an expanded pool of 
suppliers, including an understanding of their carbon reduction 
strategies. Further information can be found on page 92.

Our divisions held sub-contractor and supplier days to discuss 
local business plans and “Thank you” events to show our 
appreciation for their continued support.

We have had some engagement with our brick suppliers to 
reduce plastic packaging, with initiatives leading to significant 
reductions in waste generated, with longer term strategies now 
being implemented by suppliers. We have also started working 
with a packaging design consultant (Valpak), who will be engaging 
with our supply chain to advise on potential alternatives that 
may reduce waste or improve recyclability.

Board level engagement:
Members of the Board attend the Supplier Conference 
(the Chief Executive, the Chief Operating Officer, and the 
Group Sustainability Director all presented). The Chief 
Operating Officer provided an update on the supply chain and 
sub-contractor performance at each Board meeting The Group 
Procurement Director is invited to attend the Board or the Audit 
Committee to directly answer any queries members may have.

Sub-contractors and supply 
chain continued
Metrics – How we measure effectiveness
The following information is reported to the Board by the Chief 
Operating Officer and/or the Group Procurement Director to 
enable it to consider and agree what, if any, changes with our 
sub-contractors and supply chain:

 ∙ Feedback received from a survey following the annual 

conference to help improve the conference in the following year.

 ∙ Availability of materials and services to support our build 
delivery programme despite shortages and/or challenges 
in the industry.

 ∙ Supplier performance data, captured via our Supplier 

Relationship Management Portal and Quarterly Divisional 
supplier performance feedback process.

 ∙ We maintain a dynamic supplier risk management 

assessment matrix to identify potential future issues and plan 
mitigating action.

 ∙ Supply Chain Sustainability School Membership – assesses 
the number of our sub-contractors and suppliers signing 
up as members to show their commitment to upskilling 
their employees in areas such as sustainability and diversity 
and inclusion. 

Interests and concerns
The key interests and concerns of our sub-contractors and 
supply chain related to the health and safety of their employees 
whilst working on our sites, modern slavery, living wage and 
our actions and progress in respect of our sustainability and 
carbon reduction strategies and initiatives. Given the current 
cost of living crisis, it is not surprising that our sub-contractors 
and supply chain are concerned with being paid in a timely 
manner. Details of our prompt payment practices can be found 
on our website. In addition, our sub-contractors are concerned 
with the availability of materials given the rise in build cost 
inflation. No materials will mean no work for them on our sites. 

Outcomes from engagement
We have received positive feedback regarding our leadership 
on sustainability issues ranging from carbon and waste to 
our commitments on modern slavery and the real Living Wage. 
We closely monitor our prompt payment performance to ensure 
we are supporting our partners. We have established long-term 
relationships with our sub-contractors and suppliers which 

have helped to ensure delivery and performance standards 
are mutually understood and have also enabled us to secure 
materials to support build requirements during a period of 
shortage of certain components. It has also helped us gain a 
better understanding on the availability of carbon emission 
data, and the challenges associated with reporting this data. 
The majority of our suppliers have now completed the Supplier 
Sustainability Maturity matrix with 87% of suppliers completing 
the assessment and 52% of target badges having been met. 

Suppliers completed the Supplier 
Sustainability Maturity Matrix

87%

Effect of engagement with the supply chain on 
Board decisions
Engagement with sub-contractors and the supply has given 
the Board a better understanding of the challenges they are 
facing in respect of collating the emissions data to enable 
our business to better measure our scope 3 emissions. The 
Board therefore agreed with the Remuneration Committee 
that to allow our sub-contractors and the supply chain more 
time to implement and embed their processes to collect the 
relevant data, scope 3 emissions should not be included in the 
sustainability metric for the 2023 LTPP. The Board, guided by 
the Remuneration Committee, will reconsider this for the 2024 
LTPP. In addition, hearing that the uncertain market conditions 
were causing a number of sub-contractor and supply chain 
firms to cease trading, the Board requested Management 
to ensure that those that support us are paid promptly.

Interests and concerns
The key interests and concerns of our banks identified related 
to our progress with our sustainability strategy in particular 
energy efficient homes, the potential for a sustainability linked 
RCF, and the viability for green mortgage products and new 
high loan to value lending products for our customers.

Outcomes from engagement
Engagement with our banks has given us the opportunity to 
discuss the market environment and recent trends as well as 
our latest results. It has also enabled the banks to broaden 
their understanding of our business and how we operate, 
as well as the sustainability and environmental challenges, 
particularly around climate risk and carbon mitigation, facing 
the business, what we are doing to address these and what 
they can do to support us and our customers. This engagement 
enabled us to agree the sustainability linked performance 
measures in the RCF with the banks. We have engaged with 
a broader range of mortgage lenders, allowing customers 
to access mortgage products that are most suitable for their 
needs. Both parties have gained a greater understanding of 
each other’s priorities and agreed overlapping objectives, with a 
view to evolving improved lending terms for energy efficient homes.

The strong engagement with Lloyds Bank has enabled strategic 
partnership to be created with Citra Living, a subsidiary of 
Lloyds, with Barratt selling a portfolio of homes to Citra, where 
they will retain ownership of the homes and rent them out 
acting as a corporate landlord. 

Effect of engagement with banks on Board decisions
The Board was mindful that with the impending end of Help to 
Buy, large numbers of our customers may struggle to gain the 
financial support that they need to purchase their new home. 
The Board therefore agreed to support the launch of Deposit 
Unlock (see page 30) and explore alternatives to Help to Buy.

 See page 31

Link to strategy  

Banks
Why we engage
We need sufficient finance and working capital to settle liabilities, 
manage working capital, respond to changes in the economic 
environment, and take advantage of appropriate land buying and 
operational opportunities to deliver strategic priorities. In addition, 
it is important to understand the banks’ views on the market and 
their risk appetite for lending as well as identifying ways in which 
the parties can collaborate to support mutual customers.

How we engage
The following methods of engagement are effective in ensuring 
continued mutual understanding of our respective businesses and 
of the services the banks can provide to us and to our customers. 

Company engagement:
The Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer regularly 
engage with each of the banks in the RCF and USPP investors, 
including calls after each trading update and two site visits each 
year. Additional calls and meetings were held as appropriate 
throughout the year. We worked closely with the Banks to 
amend our existing RCF to a Sustainability Linked Loan which 
includes sustainability linked performance measures, aligned 
with our Building Sustainably strategy. The Head of Treasury 
has a schedule of regular diarised calls on a one to one 
basis with the Relationship Director of each of the banks who 
participate in the RCF.

Our Head of Mortgage Lender Relations held regular meetings 
with the top 10 mortgage lenders, some of which are supported 
by the Executive Directors.

In order to support customers with the challenge of 
affordability, particularly after the closure of Help to Buy to 
new business on 31 October, we have, amongst other things:

 ∙ continued to support Deposit Unlock which supports 95% 

lending on new Build homes;

 ∙ worked with lenders to promote the launch of Green 

Mortgages which take into account the savings from energy 
efficiency in affordability assessments – reviewed the digital 
options available to us to engage with our customers at the 
earliest opportunity to establish affordability and support 
them on their home ownership journey; and 

 ∙ convened an industry forum for the top five surveying firms, 

supported by the HBF and the Future Homes Hub, to collaborate 
regarding changes required by the Future Homes Standard. 

Board level engagement:
During the year, key meetings with members of the RCF and 
USPP investors were supported by the Executive Directors 
and members of the Executive Committee and have included 
site visits and other face to face meetings. The Chief Financial 
Officer and the Chief Executive provide regular updates to 
the Board on engagement activities with the RCF banks and 
mortgage lenders and on any actions being taken as a result 
of the information received.

Metrics – How we measure effectiveness
The banks’ willingness to engage with us and discuss new 
opportunities to support us and our customers is the key metric 
that is reported to the Board by the Chief Financial Officer to 
enable it to consider and agree what, if any, changes to make 
in how and when we engage with our banks.

Stakeholder engagement continued

We work closely with local schools, to emphasise the 
importance of site safety and to keep everyone safe. This also 
teaches children about the construction process, the careers 
available, and the initiatives that we have implemented to create 
sustainable homes and places to live, such as through the 
interactive Insight House on our Heritage Grange development 
in Warwickshire (see page 55).

Those that we engaged with can provide feedback through 
a multitude of channels both online and offline. A dedicated 
project website is often set up to provide information and 
updates for local residents and interested parties. 

We write to inform the local community of upcoming works 
that have the potential to cause disruption, such as highway 
and infrastructure works. On many sites we distribute 
a quarterly newsletter update on development progress 
so the local community can see what is happening in more 
detail and have forewarning about any disruptions.

We use signage in and around our sites to demonstrate our 
credentials and the value that our activities bring to local 
communities. We highlight the number of jobs and businesses 
supported, amount of green space created and retained, and 
section 106 contributions to local infrastructure and services. 
New developments are publicised in the local press, as are 
positive news stories about our beneficial activities and impacts 
of our developments. We have a network of seven PR agencies 
promoting the business to national, regional and local media. 
We promote the resilience and sustainability credentials of 
our homes to the wider community to demonstrate the reduced 
impact they have on the natural environment at a local and a 
global level. 

The Barratt Foundation continues to grow, increasing its 
charitable activity by entering into a number of partnership 
agreements (see page 25 for more details). The Barratt 
Foundation team have been engaging with our divisions to 
support them with their charitable giving and creating volunteering 
opportunities with its national partners for our employees. 

Board level engagement:
The Chief Executive and the Chief Operating Officer keep the 
Board appraised of any local issues that have been identified 
and have the potential to escalate into a wider matter that may 
impact the business as a whole. There are also two updates a 
year from the Group Construction and SHE Director as well as 
regular updates from the Sustainability Committee. The Board 
also receives an update from the Barratt Foundation twice 
a year including the impact our donations are having on our 
local communities and the protection of the environment.

Metrics – How we measure effectiveness
The following information is reported to the Board by the Chief 
Executive and/or Chief Operating Officer to enable it to consider 

Continued support for Deposit Unlock, 
supporting 95% lending on new homes

95%

Local communities 
and environment
Why we engage
It is important for us to engage with the local communities in 
which we build to ensure that we are responding to local needs 
and are able to create value whilst considering the impact 
that our business has on the local environment and the use 
of natural resources in our build process. We need to protect 
habitats and resources as we focus on creating sustainable 
homes. Regular and open engagement helps ease the whole 
build process, in particular planning, as it mitigates against 
objections from members of the community which could lead 
to undue delay and increased costs. 

How we engage
We use a range of engagement methods to enable the local 
communities to better understand how we can benefit them 
and how we will protect the local environment around them. 
Details of how we engage with each of our key stakeholders on 
the environment and other sustainability matters can be found 
in the respective sections on pages 54 to 65. 

Company engagement:
To ensure that community needs and considerations, including 
impact on the local environment, are taken into account at the 
earliest stage of the development process, we hold meetings 
and site specific consultations which all local residents are 
welcome to attend. We also hold in-person and virtual public 
exhibitions as well as regular meetings with other national and 
local organisations who are key to enhancing our environmental 
impact. These include parish/town councils, local planning 
authorities, environmental regulators, Local Water Authorities 
and Natural England. At these meetings we consult and seek 
views on our plans and look to incorporate the feedback we 
receive. We pay particular attention to residents’ concerns 
about how our activities might impact the natural environment. 

We frequently share the contact details of site managers with 
relevant figures at the local parish council, to allow them to be 
contacted quickly and any issues with construction to be rectified. 

“ This is one of the most helpful 
companies I've ever dealt with, the 
staff are absolutely lovely and are 
really thorough and invested at 
getting you the best deal.”

Jasmine and Kim,
Barratt customers

and agree what, if any, changes to make in how and when we 
engage with our local communities: 

 ∙ The extent of local opposition to our developments.

 ∙ The level of planning appeals – 95% of the units we build are 

approved at a local level and do not require a planning appeal.

 ∙ The amount donated to, and the feedback from, charities that 

we have supported and the impact we had.

Interests and concerns
The key interests and concerns of our communities relate to 
our local, regional and national socio-economic footprints, our 
impact on the environment and the availability of green spaces, 
disruption during construction of our developments including 
noise and air pollution, the safety and protection of members 
of the community around our developments, the impact of 
development on the local population, and the potential for 
knock-on pressures on the supporting infrastructure and the 
impact of the development on the environmental resilience of 
the landscape, including on biodiversity, public green space 
and flood resistance.

Outcomes from engagement
Our engagement with the local communities in which we 
operate has enabled us to better understand their needs and 
to develop a positive legacy from building great places to live, 
with the facilities that will help the local community thrive. It 
has allowed us to connect with local schools and families to 
share key messages such as how we keep people safe and how 
they can protect themselves. We evaluated the actions that our 
supply chain undertakes on environmental matters and how 
we can positively partner with them to drive improvements. 
We have set internal targets to reduce waste from our construction 
process and are considering alternative fuels to diesel for plant 
and other equipment with our supply chain.

The protection of the environment is a key area of concern for 
the local communities in which we operate. We therefore aim 
to be mindful of our impact on the environment in everything 
that we do and have put in place steps to support this. We are 
accredited to ISO 14001 which demonstrates that we have 
robust policies and procedures for environmental management. 
We are also externally audited across all our business units. 
Our comprehensive Impacts and Aspects Register enables 
us to consider any areas where improvements can be made.

All our Safety, Health and Environmental team are individual 
members of the Institution of Environmental Management and 
Assessment and provide support and guidance to our Divisional 
teams in managing site based environmental aspects and 
impacts. We have a team of sustainability practitioners who 
assist with considering our wider business environmental and 
carbon impacts and drive improvements across our business.

We have put in place environmental and surface water 
management plans for all our developments which are 
monitored by our Divisional Management teams and SHE 
Managers. We expect our construction teams to continually 
assess the controls and ensure that we focus on these and the 
use of resource. Our SHE Managers record levels of compliance 
as part of their regular reviews. We have a specific monthly 
monitoring process which focuses on the environmental 
impacts on site and, in particular, controls to prevent 
contamination of any adjacent watercourse. 

We have set stringent science-based targets for carbon 
emissions and have a target in place for all homes to be 
zero carbon in use (regulated energy) by 2030. We are also 
committed to enhancing biodiversity on every site and have a 
target in place to demonstrate a minimum biodiversity net gain 
of 10% across all development designs submitted for planning 
from 2023.

During FY23, each of our divisions donated £1,500 per month 
to a different charity that supports the local community 
within the areas in which we operate. In addition, divisions are 
encouraged to raise funding for local charities and utilise the 
match funding available from the Barratt Foundation. During 
FY23, our colleagues and divisions raised over £1.3m for good 
causes, the most raised in any one financial year. The number 
of volunteering days utilised also increased in FY23, with 892 
employees supporting local charities through various activities 
ranging from painting schools to tidying up gardens and 
cleaning beaches. 

Effect of engagement with local communities and 
the environment on Board decisions
We monitor and report our impact publicly across a range 
of environmental indicators, including carbon emissions, 
water usage, waste generation, environmental incidents and 
prosecutions. The Board, through its Remuneration Committee, 
utilises this information to determine appropriate non-financial 
metrics for both our short- and long-term incentive schemes. 

The Board are keen to ensure that the Group continues to 
support and enhance the local communities in which it operates 
(and that we support them as much as we can). The Board 
entered into a three-year rolling funding agreement with 
the Barratt Foundation enabling it to engage in multi-year 
charitable partnerships and have a real positive impact on 
the communities in which we operate.

Memberships
Many of these meetings are organised by various organisations 
of which we are a member, or workstreams to which we 
contribute. We were invited to join the Government’s Energy 
Efficiency Taskforce, Net Zero Council and Green Jobs Delivery 
Group, were members of Climate Change Committee’s 
Business Advisory Board and contributed to the Rt Hon Chris 
Skidmore MP’s review of net zero. The Group supports the 
Energy Efficiency Taskforce on policy development, including 
the creation of a long-term cross sector roadmap to net zero 
with clarity on targets and standards, growing consumer 
confidence, a green finance framework and net zero skills.

We also continue to inform Government on sustainability issues 
as well as providing leadership and expertise to the Future 
Homes Hub, a joint industry and Government initiative, designed 
to deliver a whole industry transition to net zero. David Thomas, 
our Chief Executive, was appointed as chairman of the Future 
Homes Hub and our Group Head of Biodiversity is Chair of the 
Future Homes Hub’s Biodiversity Net Gain working group. 

Our Group Sustainability Director sits on the Climate Change 
Committee’s Advisory Group on Business – a group convened to 
share the different ways in which UK businesses can accelerate 
progress towards net zero. The group has published a new 
report which looks at how we successfully transition to a net 
zero economy. At the centrepiece of this is a recommendation 
that a partnership with Government is urgently needed to meet 
the UK’s commitment to be net zero by 2050.

Housebuilding is suffering from a severe skills shortage. The 
CITB estimates that almost 200,000 extra workers1 are required 
to build the homes the country needs between now and 2027. 
Many EU workers have left the UK in the wake of Brexit and the 
pandemic. As part of our role on the Green Skills Taskforce 
and through our membership of the Future Homes Hub, we 
are working with Government to ensure that the necessary 
skills and workforce are available as we scale up to building 
zero carbon homes at scale. A key area is to provide support 
to those currently working in high carbon industries, enabling 
them to retrain into a high quality, long-term green career, as 
a key component of a just transition. We are also working with 
manufacturers and our trades to ensure that specialist training 
is in place so that we are in a position to scale-up delivery of 
new technologies such as solar panels.

Conferences
Key to our engagement is the party conference seasons in the 
autumn. This year, David Thomas attended panel events hosted 
by the RSPB and the NHBC, alongside the then-Housing 
Minister Lee Rowley. At the Labour Conference, Bukky Bird, 
Group Sustainability Director, attended a series of meetings, 
including the Labour Business Forum events. At both 
conferences representatives from the Corporate Affairs team 
and other business functions held further meetings with party 
representatives.

Site visits
Site visits are an important strand of our stakeholder 
engagement, as they enable us to demonstrate the quality of 
our developments first-hand. During the year we welcomed the 
Leader and Deputy Leader of the Labour party to our Centurion 
Village development near Preston. We also hosted a number of 
stakeholders to the Zed House and Energy House 2.0 projects, 
including the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, and 
the author of the independent review of net zero, Chris Skidmore. 

1  Construction Skills Network Outlook 2023 – 2027.

Government, opposition parties 
and regulators
Why we engage
The government is responsible for creating the legislative 
environment in which we operate, which is enforced by 
regulators. Opposition parties can influence this environment 
through their scrutiny of government and by proposing 
alternative approaches. They may also form the next 
government. We engage with these stakeholders so that they 
understand the challenges facing the business, and the likely 
implications of any current or proposed policies, and so that 
we understand what future policy is likely to be and how it will 
be implemented. We also emphasise our positive credentials and 
build positive relationships to ensure we are well-regarded by 
these stakeholders and are able to contribute constructively to 
policy development.

How we engage
We engage with ministers, MPs and regulators through a range 
of channels.

Company engagement:
Meetings
Senior representatives from the business regularly meet with 
political stakeholders. During the year David Thomas met with 
the Chancellor to discuss the economy, the Secretary of State 
for the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities 
(DLUHC) to discuss the impact of planning reform, and a 
number of Housing Ministers. We also hold regular meetings 
with key representatives from DLUHC and other government 
departments like the Treasury, Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs, Department for Energy Security and Net 
Zero and the Department for Business and Trade. We have also 
engaged in ongoing discussion with policy representatives from 
the Labour party, with the Chair and Chief Executive attending 
meetings with the Leader of the Opposition, Shadow Chancellor 
and other relevant Shadow Ministers. We have also provided 
evidence to the House of Lords Built Environment Committee.

We continue to raise concerns with Government and opposition 
parties on the disproportionate impact of nutrient neutrality 
policies on new housebuilding. The housebuilding industry is 
engaging positively with Government to find a solution, including 
credit schemes and other approaches to mitigation, to unlock 
housebuilding in areas where water treatment works may not 
be upgraded until 2030.

Letters
We also regularly write to our political stakeholders, to showcase 
our positive credentials and to directly explain our positions 
on certain issues. We wrote to 81 MPs who had one of our 98 
Pride in the Job-winning site managers in their constituencies, 
resulting in nine site visits. We also wrote introductory letters to 
each of the four new housing ministers and three Secretaries of 
State we saw during the year, as well as other new ministers.

Complaints
On the rare occasion that customer complaints are elevated to 
the point that they feel the need to contact their MP, the relevant 
Regional Managing Director will investigate the issue and prepare 
a response with the assistance of the Corporate Affairs team. 
Oversight of any such issues is maintained by the Group and used 
to inform the ongoing stakeholder engagement strategy. 

Consultations
Much of our contribution to policy development comes in the 
form of responses to government consultations, which are 
prepared by the relevant Group functions with assistance 
from the Corporate Affairs team. This year Government 
consultations responded to by the Group included those on 
the forthcoming Building Safety Levy, changes to the National 
Planning Policy Framework, the requirement for two staircases 
in new high-rise buildings, increases in planning fees, and the 
Infrastructure Levy.

CMA
We continue to co-operate with the Competition and Markets 
Authority’s study into the housebuilding market. 

Board level engagement:
At each Board meeting the Chief Executive provides an update 
on engagement with policymakers and regulators, covering 
knowledge gained and any potential impact on the business. 
This information is also regularly provided by the Group 
Corporate Affairs team. 

Metrics – How we measure effectiveness
The following information is reported to the Board by the 
Chief Executive to enable it to consider how we engage with 
government and regulators and what, if any, changes to make: 

 ∙ The business’s political engagement strategy – to ensure 
we are engaging with the right people to fully understand 
any policy changes and effectively communicate our key 
messages in line with our broader strategic aims. 

 ∙ A comprehensive overview of our engagement with key 

political stakeholders, including meetings, site visits, mutual 
attendance at events, correspondence and public statements, 
so that we can track our relationships with our key stakeholders 
and assess the progress of our engagement strategy. 

 ∙  Our responses to Government consultations and emerging 
legislation on relevant policy areas, such as the Building 
Safety Levy, Infrastructure Levy, and draft changes to the 
National Planning Policy Framework. We assess the extent 
to which policy and legislative outcomes accord with our 
representations to policymakers.

Supply and planning – how to reconcile the desire to build 
300,000 homes a year with political opposition and the wider 
levelling up agenda.

Sustainability – how to reduce carbon emissions and protect 
the natural environment while achieving energy security and 
growing the economy.

Inflation – the impact of increases in the cost of living and their 
knock-on impacts on interest rates, mortgage costs, house 
prices, employment and GDP growth.

Quality – making sure new homes are built to the highest quality 
and consumers are protected should things go wrong.

Building safety – addressing defects in historic buildings, 
making sure the costs of doing so are borne by parties across 
the industry, and promoting trust in the new regulatory regime.

Skills – ensuring there are enough workers to build the homes 
the country needs, and that people have access to training to 
build the energy efficient homes of the future.

Outcomes from engagement
Our engagement with government, opposition parties and 
regulators has helped us build positive relationships with 
key figures, so that we can continue to be involved and inform 
conversations about the future of housing policy. Our continued 
positive engagement has meant we are frequently the housebuilder 
of choice for officials seeking a representative of the sector.

It has helped us to understand upcoming policies and the 
broader operating environment, and to influence any proposed 
changes through meetings with key figures and responses to 
government consultations. Meetings with Ministers and MPs 
helped us understand the drivers behind proposed changes 
to government planning policy, while meetings with senior 
opposition ministers saw us emphasise the value of housebuilding 
sector for the economy and the country’s social fabric.

We have also improved our reputation with those key 
stakeholders by showcasing the good work we do, which 
helps ensure our perspective and the impact on the industry 
is understood and taken into account when developing future 
policy. This enables us to explain the challenges facing the 
sector, and the opportunities it can provide, so that future policy 
can support new housebuilding and avoid adverse outcomes. 
Visits by MPs to Pride in the Job award-winning sites enable 
us to demonstrate first-hand the positives of our activities.

Effect of engagement with Government, opposition 
parties and regulators on Board decisions
Engagement with key political stakeholders assists the Board 
in understanding the risks and opportunities presented to the 
business by changes to the operating environment, allowing them 
to make decisions in line with the strategic interests of the business.

The Board signed the Developer Remediation Contract 
following extensive engagement with Government. 

The Board has also gained knowledge of how evolving housing 
policy can impact the housing market at a local and national level, 
and therefore affect land bids which enables it to consider if the 
process and policies in place remain appropriate. 

Interests and concerns
Some of the key areas of interest and concern to Government 
and regulators are:

Chief Financial Officer’s review

Robust performance

The Group is in a very strong position with substantial net cash, 
and an excellent forward sales position and land bank.

Our financial results have reflected the change in market 
demand, triggered by the Fiscal Event in September 2022 and 
subsequent higher interest rate environment. FY23 saw a sharp 
contrast between our first half performance, which reflected 
the strength of our forward order book and robust house prices 
coming into the financial year and the second half, which 
reflected reduced reservation activity, an adjustment in 
achieved home prices and slower construction activity against a 
background of mortgage interest rate uncertainty.

Our performance reflects the flexibility and resilience of our 
operating model which is supported by a strong balance sheet 
and the commitment and dedication of our employees, sub-
contractors and supply chain partners in what has been 
a challenging year.

“ Our performance also reflects 
the flexibility and resilience of our 
operating model which is supported 
by a strong balance sheet and the 
commitment and dedication of our 
employees, sub-contractors and 
supply chain partners in what 
has been a challenging year.”

Results to 30 June 2023

Income Statement
Group revenue was £5,321.4m in FY23 (FY22: £5,267.9m) 
with Group wholly owned completions 4.6% lower at 16,378 
(FY22: 17,162), reflecting weaker completions in the second half 
following the decline in reservation activity seen from September 
through December 2022 and the slower rate of reservations 
from the start of the new calendar year.

Our private average selling prices increased by 7.9% to £367.6k 
(FY22: £340.8k), reflecting underlying house price inflation and 
minor changes in product and geographic mix, as well as the 
dilutive impact of PRS growth. The increase in the average 
selling price of our wholly owned completions was 6.5% to 
£319.6k (FY22: £300.2k). The lower increase reflected a greater 
proportion of affordable homes which accounted for 23.9% 
(FY22: 22.3%) of completions. 

Adjusted gross profit reduced by 13.6% to £1,130.4m 
(FY22: £1,308.1m), with the adjusted gross margin reducing 
by 360 bps to 21.2% (FY22: 24.8%). The reduction in adjusted 
gross margin reflected the impact of build cost inflation during 
the financial year and the dilutive effect of completion volume 
decline, which reduced incremental fixed cost efficiency. In 
FY23 our contribution margin was c. 32% (FY22: c. 34%) after 
land and direct build costs.

Movements in operating margin in FY23

After operating adjusted items, totalling £155.5m (FY22: £408.2m) 
relating to legacy property costs, reported gross profit was 
£974.9m (FY22: £899.9m), and reported gross margin was 
18.3% (FY22: 17.1%).

Administrative expenses in the year were £270.8m (FY22: 
£256.4m). This increase included:

 ∙ the impact of salary increases, as well as additional salary 

supplements of £2,000 for employees below senior 
management levels;

 ∙ incremental costs reflecting expansion in the Group’s Building 

Safety Unit;

 ∙ the full year impact of Gladman Developments’ administrative 

expenses; and

 ∙ a further reduction of £4.5m in sundry income.

After deducting administrative expenses and a modest net gain 
of £3.3m on part exchange activities (FY22: £3.1m), the Group 
delivered an adjusted profit from operations of £862.9m (FY22: 
£1,054.8m), with an adjusted operating margin of 16.2% (FY22: 
20.0%). The 380 bps decline in the adjusted operating margin is 
analysed further below.

Completion 
volumes 
The decline in our wholly

volumes, with a 4.6% 
or 784 homes decrease, 
created a 30 bps negative 
impact (FY22: 10 bps 
positive impact).

Net inflation
Sales price inflation 
relative to higher 
underlying build cost 
inflation produced 
a 170 bps negative 
impact (FY22: 140 bps 
positive impact).

London
A significant increase in 
the share of completions 
from our London 
operations, 8% in FY23 
(FY22: 6%), where 
margins are lower than 
in the regional business, 
resulted in a 20 bps 
negative margin impact.

Completed 
developments 
provision
Reflecting the 
increasingly extended 
time periods being 
experienced in relation 
to the adoption of roads 
and public space by local 
authorities on completed 
developments, an 
increase in this provision 
created at 60 bps 
negative margin impact.

Mix and 
other items
Changes in sales mix, 
increased selling costs, 
abortive costs in relation 
to land transactions no 
longer proceeding and 
other smaller items 
created a 70 bps negative 
impact (FY22: 40 bps 
negative impact).

As detailed above, offset 
by the small increase 
in part-exchange 
income, increased net

Chief Financial Officer’s review continued

Results to 30 June 2023 continued

Income Statement continued
After deducting adjusted items, on a reported basis we delivered 
an increase in profit from operations to £707.4m (FY22: £646.6m) 
and a reported operating margin of 13.3% (FY22: 12.3%).

Net finance charges were £11.1m (FY22: £27.6m) reflecting 
increased interest income on cash balances held throughout 
FY23. The cash component of the finance charge was a credit 
of £13.4m (FY22: £8.3m cost) with non-cash charges of £24.5m 
(FY22: £19.3m). In FY24, finance costs are expected to increase 
to c. £20m reflecting a cash component credit of c. £20m and 
non-cash charges of £40m. The anticipated increase in non-
cash finance charges reflects the impacts of the increase in 
legacy property provisions and the higher discount rate applied 
to these provisions arising from the increase in the gilt rate.

Our JVs delivered adjusted profit for the year of £32.5m 
(FY22: £27.6m). The JV results included adjusted charges for 
JV legacy properties of £23.7m (FY22: £4.3m) with JV reported 
profits being £8.8m (FY22: £23.3m) as a result. 

Consequently, reported profit before tax for the year increased 
to £705.1m (FY22: £642.3m).

The Group’s tax charge for the year increased to £174.8m 
(FY22: £127.1m), which included the final quarter impact of the 
600 bps increase in the rate of corporation tax increasing from 
19% to 25% from 1 April 2023. The tax charge comprised:

 ∙ A corporation tax charge on adjusted profit before tax of 

£188.1m (FY22: £200.8m);

 ∙ A full year impact of the Residential Property Developer 
Tax (RPDT) which equated to a FY23 charge of £26.0m 
(FY22: £8.8m); and

 ∙ Tax credits with respect to adjusted items, which totalled 

£39.3m in FY23 (FY22: £82.5m credit).

Adjusted earnings per share decreased by 18.9% to 67.3 pence 
per share (FY22: 83.0 pence per share). The decline in adjusted 
earnings per share consisted of a 16.2% decline in adjusted 
pre-tax profitability, a further 5.4% impact from increased 
taxation, which was only partially offset by a 2.2% benefit from 
the reduced average count, reflecting the initial FY23 impact 
of the buyback. 

Basic earnings per share increased by 5.1% to 53.2 pence per 
share (FY22: 50.6 pence per share).

Reflecting the decline in adjusted profitability but disciplined 
management of capital employed throughout the year, ROCE 
declined to 22.2% (FY22: 30.0%).

Adjusted items 
Adjusted items recognised in the year related to costs 
associated with legacy properties and totalled £179.2m 
(FY22: £412.5m). Of this total charge £117.7m (FY22: £377.7m) 
related to future commitments in relation to fire safety and 
external wall systems with £51.5m (FY22: £34.8m) relating to 
remedial works arising from the review of reinforced concrete 
frames we announced in July 2020, following the issues we 
discovered at Citiscape. A further c. £10.0m was expensed in 
the second half of the year in relation to two other developments 
where investigations are ongoing. 

Fire safety and external wall systems
In relation to fire safety and external wall systems, the additional 
costs relate to:

 ∙ an increase in the number of buildings within scope, from 223 
at 30 June 2022 and 228 at 1 January 2023, to 278 at year end, 
following the signing of the Self-Remediation Terms and 
Contract in March 2023; and

 ∙ an update to cost estimates across the portfolio, reflecting 
the latest building material and labour cost information.

This resulted in an additional provision of £172.3m prior to 
discounting to present value. The enlarged provision, as well as 
the discount rate applied to the provision, reflecting the 
increase in the UK gilt rate applied at 30 June 2023, resulted in 
a credit of £51.9m and the recognised net charge of £117.7m.

In addition, we signed the Scottish Safer Buildings Accord on 
31 May 2023. Industry negotiations over the legal agreement 
between the Scottish Government and Homes for Scotland are 
ongoing and there remains uncertainty around the extent of 
remediation required in Scotland. Existing provisions for 
Scotland have been made on a consistent basis with England 
& Wales. 

Reinforced concrete frames
In relation to the Citiscape associated review our remediation 
activities continued during the year with the majority of 
developments proceeding in line with plan. During the second 
half of the year we also finalised remediation plans for the one 
remaining development in that review, where work is required 
across five buildings. Finalisation of this remediation plan, as well 
as ongoing remediation activities, resulted in an additional charge 
of £51.5m of which £21.3m related to JV legacy developments.

In addition to this review, we identified two further developments 
where remediation work may be required. In FY23 £10.0m was 
charged to the Income Statement for remediation works at these 
developments, including a JV charge of £2.4m. Of the £10.0m 
charge, £2.4m was spent in the second half with £7.6m in the 
provision at 30 June 2023.

Whilst the charges in respect of legacy properties reflect our 
current best estimates of the extent and future costs of work 
required, as assessments and work progress, estimates may 
have to be updated. 

Cash flow
Net cash decreased to £1,069.4m at 30 June 2023 (30 June 2022: 
£1,138.6m). The main components of the change in net cash 
position were: 

 ∙ a £465.5m net cash inflow from operating activities 

(FY22: £417.6m cash inflow); 

 ∙ a £55.4m net cash inflow from investing activities 

(FY22: outflow of £222.4m), with the reversal reflecting 
increased cash received from joint ventures and the cash 
outflow impact of the Gladman acquisition in FY22; and 

 ∙ a net financing cash outflow of £590.6m (FY22: outflow of 
£378.4m), principally reflecting dividends paid of £360.0m 
(FY22: £337.0m), as well as the £201.3m outflow in respect 
of the £200m share buyback including Stamp Duty and fees 
of £1.3m.

The major drivers of the £465.5 net cash inflow from operating 
activities in the year was our profit from operations, which 
increased to £707.4m (FY22: £646.6m), offset by a net cash 
outflow from working capital and provisions of £64.9m (FY22: £118.2m 
cash outflow) and net interest and tax payments, which 
increased to £196.3m (FY22: £140.2m).

The net £64.9m outflow (FY22: £118.2m outflow) with respect 
to working capital and provisions was largely related to a 
significant decrease of £337.6m (FY22: £10.7m decrease) in 
payables, driven by the reduction in land creditor balances 
as we settled existing commitments, alongside a significant 
reduction in land acquisition and construction activity. This was 
offset by other net inflows in working capital including a £48.9m 
decrease in inventories (FY22: £543.4m increase) which also 
arose from reduced land activity and tighter control of work 
in progress, and a £163.4m net increase in provisions 
(FY22: £415.1m increase) which resulted from additional 
building safety charges during FY23. During FY23 £32.9m was 
spent on the remediation of legacy properties

Balance sheet
The Group’s net assets at 30 June 2023 totalled £5,596.4m 
(30 June 2022: £5,631.3m) after the payment of dividends totalling 
£360.0m (30 June 2022: £337.0m) and the return of surplus 
capital through the buyback totalling £201.3m. The Group bought 
back 48m shares at an average share price of 415 pence during 
the year, with all shares being cancelled.

Net tangible assets were £4,548.6m (467 pence per share) at 
30 June 2023 (30 June 2022: £4,573.0m; 447 pence per share). 
Land, net of land creditors, and work in progress totalled £4,540.3m 
(466 pence per share) at 30 June 2023 (30 June 2022: £4,444.1m; 
435 pence per share).

Goodwill and intangible assets reduced to £1,047.8m (30 June 2022: 
£1,058.3m) reflecting amortisation charges in the year.

At 30 June 2023, the Group held net cash balances of £1,069.4m 
(30 June 2022: £1,138.6m). Whilst we continue to defer payment 
for some land purchases to optimise ROCE, the pause in land 
buying has seen land creditors reduce, whilst remaining within 
our operating framework range. At 30 June 2023, land creditors 
were £506.7m (30 June 2022: £733.6m) and equated to 16.1% 
(30 June 2022: 22.0%) of the owned land bank.

Our minimal year-end total net indebtedness target was 
achieved with a net surplus of £562.7m at 30 June 2023 
(30 June 2022: £405.0m net surplus).

During FY24, £321.5m of land creditors will fall due for 
payment (30 June 2022, during FY23: £498.2m). Land creditors 
due beyond 30 June 2024 totalled £185.2m at 30 June 2023 
(30 June 2022: £235.4m due beyond 30 June 2023).

Capital returns
The Board has reviewed our capital allocation policy in light of 
current market conditions. In principle, the Board continues to 
believe that excess capital should be returned to shareholders 
when it is appropriate to do so. Whilst the Company remains in 
a strong financial position, the UK housing market remains 
difficult and the outlook remains uncertain. We have therefore 
agreed that whilst our reduction in dividend cover to 1.75 times 
will apply from FY24 as planned, there will be no further share 
buybacks at this stage. The Board will continue to review the 
capital allocation policy as market conditions develop.

Operating framework and capital structure
Our operating framework and appropriate capital structure 
continue to serve us well. We continue to target an appropriate 
capital structure as part of our disciplined operating framework 
with shareholders’ funds and land creditors funding the 
longer-term land requirements of our business, and term loans 
and bank debt funding the shorter-term requirements for 
working capital.

Our operating framework remains unchanged, and our performance against targets at 30 June 2023 and 2022 
are summarised below:

Risk management

Results to 30 June 2023 continued 

Treasury
The Board sets and approves the Treasury Policy and senior 
management control day-to-day operations. The Group’s 
Treasury Policy seeks to maintain an appropriate capital 
structure and provide the right platform for the business 
to manage its operating risks.

Cash management and relationships with our banking partners 
are coordinated centrally by the Group Head of Treasury. 
During the year, we extended our £700m revolving credit facility 
to November 2027 with two further one-year extension periods 
through to November 2029, if agreed between the Group and 
its lenders. 

Looking to the future and aligning our credit facilities with our 
Building Sustainably Framework, our revolving credit facility 
has also been amended to include three sustainability linked 
performance measures to be assessed and verified annually. 
The three performance measures are: (1) science-based target 
aligned scope 1 & 2 emissions reductions; (2) waste intensity 
reduction; and (3) improving the sustainability of our homes.

Tax
The Group does not enter into business transactions that are 
for the sole purpose of reducing potential tax liabilities. The 
Group’s tax strategy is to only utilise any available reliefs 
and exemptions, which have been set out in any current tax 
legislation, to minimise the Group’s tax liabilities.

The rate of corporation tax for the year ended 30 June 2023 was 
24.8% (FY22: 19.8%), which was marginally above the standard 
effective rate of tax of 24.5% (inclusive of RPDT) (FY22: 20.0%).

Looking ahead, the Group’s tax charge and effective rate 
of tax is expected to increase, reflecting changes in the rate 
of corporation tax, which increased from 19% to 25% from 
1 April 2023. With the full year impact of the increase in 
corporation tax, the Group’s effective tax rate is expected 
to increase to approximately 29.0% in FY24.

Pensions
Defined contribution pension arrangements are in place for 
current employees. Defined contribution scheme charges with 
respect to qualifying employees totalled £19.1m (FY22: £14.9m). 
Pension contributions are based upon a fixed percentage of 
each qualifying employee’s pay and, once paid, the Group 
has no further obligations under these schemes.

Guidance for FY24
Looking to FY24, our guidance is summarised in the table below:

Completions

c. 13,250 - 14.250 total home 
completions including c. 750 PRS and 
c. 650 from JVs
Affordable mix broadly in line with 
FY23

Average sales outlet 
movement (inc. JVs)

c. 6% decline

Build cost inflation

c. 5%

Administrative 
expenses

Interest cost

Land approvals

c. £290m - £300m (including 
amortisation of intangible asset 
charges of c. £10m)

c. £20m charge
(c. £20m cash credit, 
c. £40m non-cash charge)

Maintain our highly selective 
approach to land buying

Land cash spend

c. £0.5bn - £0.7bn

Year-end net cash

c. £0.7bn-£0.8bn

Taxation

Ordinary 
dividend cover

Effective tax rate of 29% reflecting 
current corporation tax rate at 25% 
and 4% RPDT

1.75x ordinary dividend cover based 
on adjusted EPS

Well positioned for an uncertain outlook in FY24
Despite significant economic headwinds and persistent 
challenges to affordability for our customers, the Group is in 
a strong position. We entered FY24 with substantial net cash, 
a solid forward sales position and an excellent land bank. Our 
operating framework and our strong financial position create 
the platform to focus on delivering high quality, sustainable 
homes and developments throughout the country, as well as 
the flexibility to react to changing market conditions and 
opportunities as they evolve.

In pursuing our strategic priorities to create value for stakeholders, 
we are exposed to risk. The Board is responsible for risk 
management and ensuring the Group maintains the appropriate 
level of risk exposure to achieve its objectives.

The risks which the Group face could have a material adverse 
effect on the implementation of the Group’s strategy, business, 
financial performance, shareholder value and returns, and 
reputation. Changes in the economic or trading environment 
can affect the likelihood and potential impact of risks, and may 
create new and emerging risks. 

Risk management controls are integrated into all levels of our 
business and across all operations, including at site, divisional, 
regional and Group level, and are monitored to ensure controls 
are in line with risks as they evolve. Our risk management 
framework and the roles and responsibilities of the Board, its 
Committees and levels of management in the identification and 
management of risk are summarised below.

Responsibilities
Board and Board Committees 
 ∙ Responsible for corporate strategy, governance, 

performance, internal controls and risk management.

 ∙ Monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 

and internal control systems.

 ∙ Promotes an appropriate culture to support effective and 

embedded risk management throughout the Group. 

 ∙ Set risk appetite, considering the expectations of 
stakeholders, and the macroeconomic context. 

 ∙ Monitor principal and emerging risks. 

 ∙ Assess risks against the Group’s strategy and the interests 
of stakeholders, and gain assurance on their management.

Responsibilities continued
Site management, assessments and valuations
 ∙ Identify and assess operational risks affecting housebuilding 
activity at site level, including construction, sub-contractor 
and SHE risk.

 ∙ Maintain an effective system of site-level risk management 

and internal control.

Risk activities conducted during the year
As part of the Group’s risk management framework all regions 
and key Group functions conducted risk workshops to review and 
identify their current risks and any potential emerging risks. 
These workshops presented a robust challenge to the principal 
risks identified at an executive level. During this process, 
management have reviewed the policies and methodologies 
behind our risk management framework to ensure that our 
procedures suitably allow key risks and the specific events that 
may cause them to materialise are identified, so that the Group 
can focus on mitigating these areas. 

The Group continues to assess the potential impact of both the 
physical impact of climate change and the regulatory and social 
measures that may be adopted to mitigate against it. In line with 
the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Group has disclosed its 
response on pages 78 to 98. Climate-related risk is one of 
several challenges arising from the environment in which the 
Group operates and the Board recognises the business’ 
responsibility to be a sustainable partner and comply with 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) regulation. The 
Board has therefore broadened its principal climate risk to 
cover all ESG issues.

The Board no longer considers the availability of finance and 
working capital to be a principal risk. We continue to have a 
strong balance sheet, with minimum debt financing and a 
strong cash position, and have recently refinanced our 
Revolving Credit Facility to November 2027. In our Viability 
Statement and going concern conclusions, we set out our 
liquidity and viability in the short, medium and long term, 
identifying limited risk. See page 99.

Reputational risk could potentially arise from a number of 
sources including external and internal influences relating to 
the housebuilding sector that, when combined or over a period 
of time, could create a new principal risk. The Group actively 
manages the impact of reputational risk by carefully assessing 
the potential impact of all the principal risks and implementing 
mitigation actions to minimise those risks. Reputational risk is 
therefore covered by the management of each of our individual 
risks and is not presented as a principal risk in its own right.

Risk velocity 
Due to the changing internal and external environment in the 
year and the need to be mindful of the speed at which risks can 
materialise, the Board has this year assessed the velocity of the 
Group’s risks. This will assist the Board in assessing the 
mitigating actions to ensure that responses are sufficiently 
timely. Velocity is categorised as follows:

Rapid: Risk can materialise immediately, or, impact felt within 
one month of occurring.

Moderate: Risk can materialise quickly, or, impact felt between 
1 and 12 months of occurring.

Slow: Risk can materialise slowly, or, impact felt after 12 months 
of occurring.

Principal risks
The Group has identified 11 principal risks that it considers 
to be of material impact and likelihood:

A   Economic environment 

B   Land and planning

C  

 Government regulation and political risk

D   Construction quality and innovation

Overall assessment
The Board has completed its assessment of the Group’s 
principal and emerging risks, including those that could threaten 
its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

E   Supply chain resilience

F   Legacy properties

G   Safety, health and environment

The current risk profile is within our tolerance range as the 
Group is willing to accept a moderate level of operational risk 
to deliver financial returns.

There may be instances where these risks could have a 
moderate adverse impact on the Group – either financially or 
operationally. To ensure the Group’s business model remains 
resilient over the medium and long term, the Group has 
modelled these scenarios alongside achievable mitigating 
actions. The results are presented in the Viability Statement 
on pages 99 to 100.

K   Business resilience and continuity 

The principal risks are detailed on pages 73 to 77, categorised 
by the strategic priorities to which they relate. Risk levels are 
presented net of any mitigation that is in place and the risk appetite 
defines the level of risk that the Board is comfortable with.

Climate-related risks and opportunities

Leading the industry in 
response to climate change

Understanding 
the future

To plan for how the business will operate 
in a future climate, we must first 
understand what that future may be. The 
outcomes from climate change, both the 
physical impacts and the regulatory 
response, are uncertain, so we have 
updated our scenario analysis to 
understand how each possible outcome 
will affect our industry, the homes we 
build and our customers.

  See page 88 for our scenario analysis

   See page 83 for the most significant risks 
and opportunities that will arise from 
these scenarios

  This analysis guides our strategy to ensure 
we continue to provide value to all of our 
stakeholders in the new trading environment

Homes for 
the future

As detailed on page 47, the provision of 
new homes is essential for the nation to 
achieve its net zero targets and our 
customers are increasingly conscious of 
their energy efficiency and the resilience 
of the homes they buy to changes in 
climate. We are meeting these challenges 
by leading the industry in researching 
technologies and developing house 
designs with the future in mind.

   Building regulations, Energy House 
and Zed House – see page 34

   Overheating adjustments – see page 47

   Local weather adaptation – see page 82

Guiding 
our business

Our climate is changing, and so is the 
world in response. We want to be at the 
forefront of the UK’s climate strategy and 
make sure our business is well 
positioned for the future.

  Page 80 shows how the response to climate 
change is governed in our business

   Pages 82 to 87 detail how we assess the risks 
and opportunities that may arise as society 
and the environment evolve

Aligning our operations 
to net zero carbon

Our analysis shows that reducing our greenhouse gas 
emissions is not only important for the planet, but also for 
protecting the profitability of our business. First, we must 
lead by example. We are working to better understand our 
carbon footprint (through the data monitoring improvements 
highlighted on page 94) and working towards our science-based 
targets (see page 98).

Our greatest impact, and our greatest opportunity to affect 
change, is within our supply chain. We are working with our 
partners to understand and reduce their emissions. 

A sustainable business 
model

The business has a duty to its stakeholders to ensure that it can 
operate sustainably over the long- term. Our scenario analysis 
allows us to stress-test the resilience of our business model to 
climate change.

   Page 89 shows the financial effect on the business and on page 90 we 
conclude that our planning has made us resilient to all outcomes

  However, we want to do more and our pathway to transition to a more 
sustainable business is shown on page 91

Helping our 
customers

Families are already feeling the effect of 
rising energy costs and higher interest 
rates on mortgages. Energy efficient 
homes can reduce costs and unlock 
access to green mortgages for 
our customers.

  Our work with lenders on green mortgage 
opportunities is discussed on page 31

  Our home energy efficiency targets, and 
progress against them, are on page 47

The Group aims to be the leading national sustainable 
housebuilder and our TCFD programme is a reflection 
of that intent. 

Our strategy and approach to risk management includes 
scenario analyses and assessing the potential financial impacts 
of climate change risks and opportunities on the business. 
As we have worked through our assessment, the Group has 
used internal subject matter experts, as well as external 
advisers to support robust and thorough analysis. Our 
established targets and metrics are shown in this report, 
though we expect these to continue to develop over time as 
our understanding of climate change risk evolves.

related financial disclosures consistent with 11 out of 11 TCFD 
recommendations and recommended disclosures.

Assurance
Deloitte has provided independent third-party limited 
assurance in accordance with the International Standard for 
Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) and Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (ISAE 3410) 
issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards

metrics on page 96. Deloitte’s full unqualified assurance 
opinion, which includes details of the selected metrics assured, 
can be found at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/building-
sustainably/our-publications-and-policies/publications.

CLIMATE GOVERNANCE
Leading the business in its climate response
The Board has ultimate responsibility for overseeing our 
response to climate change. The Chief Executive is the Board 
member who holds individual responsibility.

The Sustainability Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive, 
is the Board sub-committee responsible for debating, reviewing 
and scrutinising our sustainability and climate change strategy, 
monitoring its implementation and the approval of plans to mitigate 
risks and leverage opportunities. 

Implementing strategy
The Sustainability Committee approves and oversees initiatives 
to react to the climate-related risks and opportunities and 
assists the wider Board in integrating climate thinking into 
the Group’s wider strategy. Actions taken in the year included:

 ∙ approval of the net zero transition pathway (page 91);

 ∙ oversight of improvements to climate data collection 

and monitoring (page 98);

 ∙ review by the Chief Financial Officer of the climate-related 

scenario (pages 88 to 89) analysis;

 ∙ advising on the appropriate metrics and targets to monitor 

and drive the achievement of our climate goals; and

 ∙ monitoring performance in those metrics (pages 96 to 98).

Other climate-related responsibilities delegated to sub-
committees of the Board include:

 ∙ design of incentives to achieve our climate targets 

(Remuneration Committee, page 137);

 ∙ SHE-related risk and compliance (SHE Committee, page 133); and

 ∙ integrity of disclosure (Audit Committee, page 124).

Remuneration Committee 
(page 137)
Designs the Group’s remuneration 
policy to incentivise performance 
against climate-related targets, 
as detailed on page 96.

Monitors performance against 
targets and approves 
remuneration accordingly.

SHE Committee  
(page 133)
Monitors the effect of climate-related 
SHE risks, such as the impact of 
weather patterns on our workforce, 
and compliance with certain site-
based environmental initiatives, such 
as waste reduction.

Audit Committee  
(page 124)
Monitors the integrity of climate-
related disclosures and data 
reporting through internal and 
external assurance of the reporting of 
climate-related metrics and ensures 
compliance with external climate-
related reporting requirements. 

Risk Committee
Evaluates the Group’s internal control policies and procedures over  
the identification, assessment, and reporting of climate-related risks.

Reviews the Group’s overall risk profile, examining climate-related risks in the context  
of the Group’s other principal risks and its significance to strategy.

The structure of the Group’s governance is shown in detail on page 114.

Staying informed
Climate understanding and the world’s response to it continue 
to evolve. To ensure that the Group’s short-, medium-, and 
long-term strategies are responsive to climate change risks, 
the sub-committee aims to stay up to date with evolving 
climate change developments. During the year, the 
Sustainability Committee received the following updates 
relating to climate change:

 ∙ The Chair of the Energy Transitions Commission delivered 
a presentation on environmental economics, the potential 
impact of carbon pricing, and the difficulties in transition 
to net zero for hard to abate sectors. 

 ∙ The Group Sustainability team took the committee through 
a number of working sessions advising on the available 
approaches to managing the Group’s emissions. This included 
analyses of various elements of the net zero transition pathway, 
international best practice examples, internal carbon pricing 
and carbon offsetting.

The Committee also continues to be attended by an independent 
expert. During the climate risk assessment process, and on 
an ongoing basis through the Sustainable Operations Group, 
senior management also receive updates on the current and 
emerging climate understanding to ensure the organisation is 
well briefed when developing responses to climate challenges.

CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
The outcome of climate change is uncertain and will depend on 
the world’s success in limiting the rise in global temperatures, 
as well as the specific regulatory responses where we and our 
supply chain operate. The effects will be wide ranging, including 
the physical impacts of new weather patterns (physical risks) and 
the regulatory, social, and economic effects of transitioning to a 
low carbon economy (transition risks). Opportunities may also 
arise as the country looks to industry leaders to drive sustainable 
developments and provide homes fit for the future.

As the climate changes, Barratt will need to adapt to ensure we 
can continue to deliver the homes our customers need within the 
changing environment. These changes offer both opportunities 
and risks to Barratt, which overall the Group identifies as a 
principal risk built into its risk management process detailed on 
page 83. 

Climate-related risks relevant to each region or function are 
considered in individual bottom-up risk assessments. These 
include climate-related legislation or regulations that are 
applicable to their field, for example the Future Homes Standard 
for building regulations.

In addition, all climate risks and opportunities are considered 
together as part of the assessment of Group-level risks. A review 
of all the potential effects of climate outcomes on our business 
requires an understanding of the climate predictions and the 
collective knowledge of our business experts. We therefore 
undertake a thorough annual risk and opportunities assessment 
in addition to our risk management process, as detailed here:

Risk assessment criteria
The likelihood and potential impact of each risk are rated in line 
with the Group’s risk assessment process, shown in the Risk 
assessment criteria table on pages 84 to 87.

The impact assessment reflects the estimated profit impact of a 
risk/opportunity within the financial year and climate scenario in 
which the financial impact is likely to be most severe. Where the 
profit impact of a long-term obligation would be recognised up 
front, the financial impact is spread over the period that it will be 
realised for this purpose. Our definition of a substantial financial 
impact of over £50m is within the range set by our statutory 
auditor over recent years for Group financial materiality.

This assessment considers short-term (2025), medium-term 
(2030), and long-term (2040-2050) time horizons. This range of 
time horizons considers a longer period than our usual 
operational cycle and has been selected to align to our existing 
science-based emissions reduction targets, whilst capturing 
transitional and physical risks that manifest over the longer 
term. The short-term timeframe aligns with our owned land 
bank, while the medium- to long-term encompasses our 
strategic land options and promotion agreements.

Climate risk and opportunities assessment process

Identify
We identify the possible outcomes of climate change by considering varying 
levels of global response and resultant change in weather patterns. 
The scenarios considered are shown on page 83.

Consider Impact
The possible climate outcomes are shared with business leaders and local 
management, who are asked to consider the impact of these circumstances 
on the business. All risks are included in a climate risk register.

Review
The risks and opportunities identified are discussed in workshops of internal 
subject matter experts, local and Group senior management and external 
climate experts, using the benefit of our housebuilding experience to 
determine which risks and opportunities are most likely to manifest and have 
the highest potential impact. In FY23 we were able to call upon the strategic 
land expertise of Gladman for the first time.

The most relevant risks and opportunities are listed on pages 84 to 87. These 
are reported to the Risk Committee.

Highest potential impact 
risks and opportunities

Emerging risks and 
opportunities

After further consultation with 
business experts, we identify the 
underlying data and assumptions 
required to estimate the financial 
impact of the risks and opportunities.

We estimate the unmitigated financial 
impact under each climate outcome 
in the short, medium and long term. 
The financial effects are considered 
individually and in aggregate 
through our climate-related risk & 
opportunities register and scenario 
analysis on pages 84 to 87 and 89 
respectively.

Low impact 
risks and 
opportunities 
are subject to 
a high-level 
assessment to 
consider those 
that should be 
subject to future 
monitoring.

External 
experts are 
also engaged 
to highlight any 
emerging risks 
that have not 
been identified, 
including any 
new or potential 
regulations.

We consider 
whether 
any should 
be subject 
to detailed 
modelling in 
the next cycle.

The results of the risk assessment are reviewed by senior management 
and the Sustainability Committee to inform Group strategy going forward, 
as detailed on page 90.

Climate outcome scenarios
The potential climate outcomes considered this year when reviewing climate risks and opportunities ranged from a sustainable 
transition scenario that limits global warming to 1.5°C, to an adaptation scenario where emissions continue on the current pathway, 
which leads to around 4°C warming, such that they cover both high physical and high transition risks. Qualitative assessments for each of 
these climate scenarios are outlined below. Together with the quantitative analyses summarised on page 89, these narratives provide a 
holistic view on the potential impacts to Barratt in each of these climate outcomes.

1.5°C
Sustainable transition
We have used the IEA’s “Net Zero Emissions by 
2050” (NZE2050) to model a long-term orderly 
transition to a low carbon economy occurring 
over the long term as sufficient regulatory 
action is taken to limit the global temperature 
rise to the Paris goal of 1.5°C by 2100, resulting 
in significant transition risks, while minimising 
physical risks.

2.0°C
Disorderly transition
We have developed a bespoke scenario, 
adjusting IEA’s “Net Zero Emissions by 
2050” model such that it reflects a disorderly 
transition, whereby limited regulation is in place 
until 2030, requiring extreme policies to be 
introduced from this date to limit warming to 
2°C by 2100. This sudden, disorderly transition 
to a low carbon economy, occurring over the 
medium term, results in maximum transition 
risk, while limiting physical risks to a low level.

4.0°C
Adaptation
Global policy shifts away from prevention and 
towards adapting to a new climate, leading to a 
global temperature rise of 4°C by 2100, giving 
rise to maximum physical risks.

Velocity of regulatory environment

Significant

Delayed then significant

Low

Increasingly stringent building regulations go 
beyond the Future Homes Standard, placing 
greater emphasis on reducing embodied 
carbon and resource intensity within the 
home. Additionally, local planning authorities 
increasingly require developments to exceed 
building regulations, placing greater emphasis 
on sustainable communities. 

The Future Homes Standard is introduced as 
planned, but building and planning regulations 
steeply increase sustainability requirements 
from 2030. 

While regulations such as the Future Homes 
Standard still come in as planned, the demand 
for sustainable developments from planning 
authorities eases and carbon pricing reduces. 

Customer engagement with climate action

Proactive

There is increased customer demand for green 
homes, which is supported by the availability of 
green mortgage products, enabling customers 
to benefit from the improved affordability 
of energy efficient new homes. 

Reactive
Until 2030 customer demand and the availability 
of green finance for low carbon homes remain 
at current levels, but these also increase 
sharply from 2030 onwards.

Inactive
Consumers typically continue to lead energy 
intensive lifestyles with little demand for 
resource efficiency measures in new homes.

Supply chain engagement with climate

The transition to net zero is supported by supply 
chains, which offer innovative low carbon 
solutions, encouraged by high carbon prices 
associated with carbon intensive materials/
processes. Technological progress is fast, 
though may require additional upskilling for 
employees and sub-contractors.

To discourage the use of high carbon materials, 
significant increases in carbon prices are 
implemented from 2030 onwards. Similarly, the 
increased demand for sustainable materials 
and technologies also drive steep increases in 
costs from 2030.

Supply chain action to reduce emissions is 
minimal, with limited innovation in low carbon 
alternatives to existing materials. Global supply 
chains are also susceptible to severe weather 
resulting in risk of delays, as well as indirectly 
driving up prices as demand for raw materials 
increases from less affected areas.

of damage as well as delays. Increased risks of 
flooding and water scarcity drive up demand for 
land in relatively less affected areas of the UK, 
raising land prices in these areas. Additional 
cooling solutions are required in homes at risk 
of overheating in the worst affected areas.

We continue to engage Government at ministerial level on a range of critical 
sustainability issues, as well as directly with relevant senior officials, via the UK Net 
Zero Buildings Council. We also support the Net Zero All Party Parliamentary Group 
and input into conversations around supply chain challenges to meet future energy 
demand for energy efficiency measures.

We were the first national housebuilder to implement science-based targets for our 
scope 1 and 2 and scope 3 emissions, allowing us to take a leadership role in driving 
down emissions. We have commissioned a carbon price exposure analysis to establish 
its potential impact and have identified opportunities for mitigation through our net 
zero transition pathway on page 91.

Through market research, product testing, university and research partnership, 
prototype test houses, and grant endorsed trials, we examine low carbon products, 
systems and processes for our housing types. We have accelerated these 
programmes through the Zed House and Energy House 2.0 to ensure a full view of 
available technology.

Our specialised divisional land teams, as well as the Gladman team, possess extensive 
local knowledge and strong relationships with landowners which are vital to ensure 
we remain the developer of choice. To support further engagement and ensure our 
sustainability credentials are recognised when we bid for land, we have developed a 
sustainability toolkit for use by our land and planning teams. This includes detailed 
information on our approach to the Future Homes Standard, zero carbon homes, 
biodiversity and socio-economic outcomes.

We are aware of the growing significance of water scarcity in the UK, which has 
resulted in a new climate-related risk. We are constantly communicating internally 
with our innovation, utilities and infrastructure teams performing water scarcity scenario 
analysis on land and regions that will be affected across the UK. Water recovery systems 
and net water consumption are important mitigating variables in our response.

Barratt has created an industry-leading project that will test the effects of climate 
change and look at ways that the homes of the future can withstand more extreme 
weather conditions. Known as Energy House 2.0, the specially-built climate chamber 
recreates temperatures ranging from -20˚C to +40˚C, as well as simulating wind, rain, 
snow and solar radiation. This research will inform us of how various overheating 
adaptation technologies perform.

Flood risk assessments are a key part of our land appraisals. We are proactively 
mitigating this risk through ongoing programmes of work, continual horizon scanning 
and engaging with key stakeholders to conduct extensive research through highly 
skilled internal and external experts.

We closely monitor weather forecasts to ensure worker safety and prepare or adjust 
build schedules as appropriate. A crisis management plan is in place for extreme 
weather events. Modern Methods of Construction (MMC), such as timber frame, allow 
for parts of the construction process to occur offsite, increasing build speed and 
reducing exposure to the elements before it is sealed. Mitigation is largely through 
MMC, building efficiency and supply chain engagement.

We regularly engage with our suppliers on availability of materials and sustainable 
sourcing both directly and through our Supply Chain Sustainability School. We purchase 
99.84% of our timber from FSC or PEFC certified sources and consider supply 
sustainability at tender and contract renewal stage. The management of sustainability and 
climate change risks and opportunities in the supply chain is intrinsic to our operations and 
procurement framework.

We are working directly with mortgage lenders to develop enhanced mortgage 
products that recognise the advantages of our new build homes. During FY23, we 
collaborated with The Leeds Building Society to support the launch of a new green 
mortgage product which recognised the advantages inherent in our new homes and 
has the potential to unlock up to a 10% uplift in lending. Moreover, through Government 
engagement and notably through the Future Homes Hub, Barratt’s Head of Mortgage 
Lender Relations chairs the “Valuation Group”, which is considering how the value of 
sustainable benefits of new homes can be recognised in the mortgage 
valuation process. 

We engage with landowners regularly via our land and planning and dedicated public 
land function. In the past year, we have seen increased direct engagement with 
landowners on sustainability, with the Group Sustainability Director attending three 
presentations with national and regional landowners to spotlight on sustainability.

Within our Building Sustainably Framework, we outline our commitment to “unlocking 
green lending and finance”, including “exploring the potential of new green finance 
products for our business”. We have linked our Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) to 
sustainability performance through a sustainability-linked loan mechanism – see page 45.

We previously conducted detailed comparative studies of timber waste in partnership 
with our timber frame company, Oregon Timber Frame and other key suppliers. This 
involved a close examination of the origin of the waste created in the building lifecycle, 
the type of waste and wood type.

Next steps

Physical risks in the wider supply chain
The Group currently considers the impact of climate change 
on supply chain disruption in timber. However, working with 
others, we are investigating the potential physical impact of 
climate change on  our supply chain, expanding our existing 
coverage to other key materials. The findings of this assessment 
are expected to be shared later in FY24.

Standing water flooding
The Group’s current assessment of physical risk considers 
potential increases in both river and coastal flooding at 
a development level. However, at the time of modelling, 
projections for standing water flooding to the required 
granularity were not available. These projections are 
expected to be available for FY24, allowing the Group to 
update its viability assessment. This will allow the Group 
to ensure its current flood risk assessment procedures 
will remain appropriate in the medium and long-term.

Land viability
The variance maps below illustrate our assumed ability to pass 
climate-related costs onto land vendors through land prices. 
Under the “Adaptation” scenario, our limited exposure 
to transition risk and proactive measures to minimise physical 
risk suggest that land viability would not be significantly 
impacted within the modelled timeframes.

However, the maps for the “Sustainable transition” and 
“Disorderly transition” scenarios highlight regions, such as 
the North East, where residential land prices are less resilient. 
Without taking action to reduce our exposure to transition risks, 
we may face limitations in passing through land costs in these 
areas, which could potentially result in lower margins. It is 
important to note that this assessment does not account for 
any mitigating actions taken or consider the impact of the UK 
Government’s “levelling up” agenda.

CLIMATE SCENARIO ANALYSIS
Modelling methodology
The Group’s extended forecasts (as considered in its viability 
review and impairment assessments) are based on the 
International Energy Agency’s “Stated Policies” model, whereby 
global climate commitments are met in full and on time, leading 
to a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by 2100, giving rise to both 
physical and transition risks. For the UK, this includes the Ten 
Point Plan, the 2020 Energy White Paper and achievement of the 
2021 net zero transition targets. This forms the basis of our 
financial planning, as discussed on page 82.

We conducted an assessment of climate-related risks by 
analysing a sample of our existing land bank and supply chain 
sites. We utilised local climate data, obtained at a resolution of 
90m2, based on the latest IPCC CMIP6 global climate models. 
This enabled us to project potential impacts under each of our 
time horizons and climate scenarios (defined on pages 82 and 
83 respectively), considering indicators such as cold, flood, 
heat, precipitation, and wind.

The projections obtained were utilised to evaluate the potential 
unmitigated impact on our divisions and supply chain under each 
climate scenario. We considered the specific vulnerabilities and 
risks associated with our business model, including the capacity 
to pass on industry-wide development costs to land vendors. As 
such, we assumed that the land price paid for a site could be 
reduced up to the extent it remained above the price that a 
landowner could achieve for an alternative use, assumed to be 
the land cost per acre for industrial use, as estimated by the 
Valuation Office Agency.

This comprehensive assessment provides us with valuable 
insights into the potential risks and impacts that our divisions 
and supply chain may face due to climate change. By integrating 
this information into our strategic decision-making processes, 
we are better positioned to address climate-related risks and 
identify opportunities for sustainable development. The 
unmitigated financial impact and scenario sensitivities for each 
of the key climate-related risk and opportunities are presented 
in the risk table on page 84.

While quantitative climate scenario analysis is a valuable risk 
management tool, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of 
climate-related risks and opportunities, we have complemented 
quantitative analysis with qualitative assessments of each 
climate scenario. Page 83 provides an overview of the wider 
impact of each scenario.

WHAT IT MEANS
Strategic impact
Our analysis indicates that whilst climate change will come at a 
cost under all scenarios and timeframes, our business model is 
expected to remain profitable in each case. This holds true even 
when assuming we take no additional mitigating actions beyond 
those already incorporated into our business plan.

While undesirable, the adaptation scenario is shown to have the 
lowest financial impact on the Group. The physical impacts of 
climate change on the Group are manageable, testament to the 
proactive measures we are already taking such as design 
changes to prevent overheating, and conducting flood risk 
assessments prior to bidding for land.

A sustainable transition, though better for the climate, brings 
higher transition costs. However, due to its potential opportunities, 
this scenario is likely to be more advantageous than if climate 
policies continue as currently planned.

Due to its disruptive nature, the Group faces its greatest impact under 
a disorderly transition, particularly through steep carbon pricing 
hikes from 2030 onwards. However, our analysis indicates our 
business remains profitable even under this worst-case scenario.

In order to be best positioned to thrive in whichever climate 
scenario we face, this analysis highlights key areas in which 
we must continue to progress.

Impact on the Financial Statements
Our scenario analysis shows that the financial impact of 
climate change will increase over time as physical changes or 
transitionary regulation intensify. Its financial relevance is not 
limited to the future; climate change is already a factor in our 
financial planning and our future forecast, both of which affect 
the financial information we are reporting today.

Going concern and long-term viability
In preparing these Annual Report and Accounts, we must 
assess whether there are any material uncertainties over the 
ability of the business to continue to operate as a going concern 
(see note 1 to the Financial Statements on page 188. We must 
also assess the prospects of the business over the longer term 
for disclosure in our Viability Statement (see page 99).

To do this, we stress-tested our financial forecasts for the 
impact of our principal risks manifesting to a severe but 
plausible level over the three-year period to 30 June 2026. 
As part of this, we assumed that the Group would experience 
climate-related transition risk in line with the Sustainable 
transition scenario, including the effects of the Future Homes 
Standard and carbon pricing. It was determined that, even 
when climate risk manifests alongside our other high-impact 
principal risks, the Group remains able to meet its 
commitments and continue trading over the review period.

Site profitability
The expected costs of compliance with Parts F and L of the 
Building Regulations, applicable from 15 June 2022, and 
design changes required to mitigate overheating in homes 
have been factored into the estimated costs to complete of 
developments in line with the accounting policy described in 
note 3 to the Financial Statements on page 191. These costs 
are reflected in the carrying values of inventories and the 
margins recognised for developments for which future 
completions will be affected.

Given our supply chain accounts for 67% of our value chain 
emissions (see pages 92 to 93 for more detail), the Group’s 
greatest exposure to climate-related risk is through rising 
carbon prices. It is imperative for us to work with our supply 
chain to reduce embodied carbon in the materials and services 
we procure, mitigating the impact of carbon prices. See detail 
on our progress to date in our transition pathway on page 91.

Increasingly stringent building regulations associated 
with reducing emissions and improving resilience to rising 
temperatures is another key risk, which will require us to 
update home designs and construction techniques. Examples 
of how we are responding to this risk are showcased in our 
concept eHome2 on page 34 and detail of how we are adapting 
house designs is provided on page 34.

Recent rises in energy costs and the increasing importance of 
sustainable living to our customers mean that we must leverage 
our sustainability expertise to provide energy-efficient homes 
on green developments at affordable prices. We are proactively 
promoting green mortgages with our lender partners to ensure 
that mortgage terms reflect the energy savings from living in our 
homes (see page 31).

In order to monitor and assess progress towards reducing 
our exposure to climate-related risks and maximising our 
opportunities we have identified several metrics and targets, 
detailed on page 96.

The Group operates under a three-year forecasting cycle. 
All known material climate-related impacts are factored 
into the forecast and site-specific climate considerations 
are reflected in our assessments of site profitability.

In preparing the Financial Statements for the year, the financial 
impact of climate change has been reflected as follows:

Land acquisitions
The Group uses the latest flood risk assessments when 
reviewing potential land acquisitions or options for 
strategic sites. If any sites require additional flooding 
mitigation, this is factored into our viability assessments, 
tender offers and forecast margins for those sites.

The carrying value of land and work in progress is assessed 
at the year end as described in note 16 to the Financial 
Statements on page 207. Our assessment of changes in 
flood risk under our climate scenarios has not identified any 
sites within our current portfolio for which the cost of 
enhanced flood defences would result in an impairment.

Goodwill and intangible assets
Each year, we review the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life held on the 
balance sheet. To do this, we calculate the present value of 
forecast future cash flows, as described in note 10 to the 
Financial Statements on page 200. The cash flows forecast 
for years three to five reflect the likely outcome of announced 
policies, as modelled in the Group’s climate scenario analysis 
for FY25, and extrapolated to perpetuity, thereby reflecting 
the short to medium-term effect of climate change in 
the valuation.

TRANSITION PATHWAY
99% of our value chain emissions arise upstream and 
downstream of our operations. We have a science-based target 
to reduce our scope 3 emissions intensity by 24% by 2030 
compared to 2018 levels and an ambition to be net zero across 
our full value chain by 2040. 

Our carbon transition programme is fundamental to achieving 
this ambition. The programme describes the co-ordinated 
activity designed to ensure we achieve our targets and how 
we see our business decarbonising over time. 

Achieving our targets will greatly reduce our exposure to 
climate-related risks in high-transition-risk scenarios and 
maximise our potential to take advantage of climate-related 
opportunities. Reducing both direct and indirect emissions will 
minimise our exposure to the potentially significant carbon 
pricing increases that are anticipated if global temperature 
rises are to be limited to sustainable levels.

For a further breakdown of our greenhouse gas emissions 
and commentary of performance in the year see page 97.

Our direct operations 
We are empowering divisional teams to understand and take 
action to reduce their carbon emissions. See page 98 for 
detail on how we are using carbon and energy dashboards 
to achieve this.

To date this has contributed to the reduction of 23.7% of our 
absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2018, against a target of 
29%. Whilst our direct operations represent only 1% of our full 
value chain emissions, we continue to show sector leadership 
in driving emissions reductions through efficiency programmes 
and the targeting of lower emission energy sources. 

70%

of telehandlers with Stage V engines at 30 June
Ensuring all plant on Barratt sites is the most fuel efficient we 
can obtain. We lease construction machinery (telehandlers) 
with the latest energy efficient diesel engines, upgraded as 
leases are renewed; and monitor telehandler usage to prevent 
idling and to promote efficient use.

87%

of electricity on REGO-backed renewable tariffs
Connecting sites to the grid using renewable electricity 
contracts, and where diesel generators are unavoidable, 
reducing the amount of time these are used on sites; and 
continuing to apply best practice energy efficiency at plots, 
show homes and offices. 

16%

of total site fuel consumed was HVO
Expanding the use of HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) in our 
on-site plant as part of the transition to alternatives such as 
the use of electric plant. 

32%

of generators were hybrids at 30 June
In trials conducted by Barratt, using hybrid generators was 
found to save over 20% of fuel compared to a 
conventional generator.

66%

of company car fleet vehicles were EVs or plug-in hybrids 
at 30 June
We have a target in place for 100% of company car fleet free 
of diesel and petrol cars by 2030 with no further diesel cars 
offered from the end of June 2022 and no petrol cars offered 
from end of June 2024. By 2028, owing to the natural cycle of 
fleet replacement, there will be no petrol fleet cars at Barratt.

For a detailed overview of our scope 1 and 2 decarbonisation programme see 
our website.

HVO is synthesised from 100% renewable materials such 
as vegetable and animal oils, reducing net greenhouse gas 
emissions by up to 90%. Our decision to expand its use 
followed a comprehensive best practice review, covering 
environmental, social and ethical impacts, and a detailed 
viability assessment as an alternative to conventional 
diesel. Our rigorous due diligence includes sourcing from 
ISCC-certified waste palm oil as well as RFAS-verified 
feedstocks, ensuring best practices. We remain vigilant, 
continuously monitoring complex supply chains for 
emerging sourcing risks to adjust our HVO purchasing 
strategy accordingly.

TRANSITION PATHWAY continued

Decarbonising the value chain
With scope 3 emissions representing 99% of our value chain 
emissions, the key to finding solutions is through genuine 
collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and insights 
between us and our suppliers, as well as sector-wide groups 
we lead or participate in. Alignment with the Future Homes 
Standard will play a significant role in decarbonising our 
downstream emissions and the choices that the Group can 
make in respect of materials choices (see page 34) for detail 
sustainable homes of the future case study.

We have analysed our full value chain and developed a transition 
pathway. However, we recognise there are uncertainties around 
reductions of scope 3 emissions including: measurement of 
supply chain emissions, sectoral commitments, national policy, 
and technological advancements.

Going forward, we will continue to work through these issues 
with our partners and will update our transition pathway as 
needed. Future work will be underpinned by the ongoing 
development of models and tools that allow us to continue to 
factor in underlying assumptions such as sector decarbonisation, 
identification of priority initiatives for action, and increasing 
direct measurement of supply chain partners emissions.

Value Chain – assessing our impacts
We have assessed and reported our value chain impacts using 
the Environmentally Extended Input Output Methodology (EEIO), 
which is recognised in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol technical 
guidance for calculating scope 3 emissions published by the 
World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development. EEIO is based on the amount spent 
on products and services, multiplying this by a greenhouse gas 
factor for each individual product or service. For more detail on 
our methodology, please refer to our website www.
barrattdevelopments.co.uk/building-sustainably/our-
publications-and-policies/publications. 

We currently use EEIO (as above) but recognise the opportunity to 
improve on the accuracy of this and have over the last two years 
developed a programme to begin the transition to a hybrid 
methodology to determine our scope 3 emissions. We’re making 
good progress – to date, we have engaged with 11 subcontractors 
and 20 suppliers covering groundworks and several of the critical 
sectors referred to in the table below, representing an estimated 
20% of our total value chain emissions.

We also recognise the importance of national policy on our 
decarbonisation pathway for example we currently assume 
a proportion of our reductions will come from the decarbonisation 
of the grid. We therefore engage with central government on 
a regular basis to share our insights (see page 64).

Climate-related risks and opportunities continued

TRANSITION PATHWAY continued
Improving supply chain data and information
During the year we have continued to collaborate with our supply 
chain to improve the quality of specific supplier emissions data 
so that we can capture our scope 3 performance more accurately. 
This has allowed us to develop a greater understanding of 
supplier carbon reduction strategies, which is proving 
invaluable in driving action where it is needed most. 

A key area of focus going forward is therefore to drive a more 
granular understanding of our supply chain emissions, using 
data collected directly from our partners.

Our analysis to date gives us a clear view of where we need to focus 
our efforts: 75% of supplier-related emissions in our value chain 
arise from around 70 suppliers; whilst 50% of subcontractor-
related emissions are estimated to arise from a similar number.

The contribution of key sectors to the  
Group transition pathway
We recognise that some partners in our value chain, by the very 
nature of the products they manufacture, have higher emissions 
associated with their activities. The decarbonisation of these 
critical sectors is a fundamental part of our carbon reduction 
pathway for scope 3. During the year we therefore analysed the 
wider commitments of relevant sectors, to identify specific 
activities our own transition pathway is reliant on and to 
facilitate a more direct engagement programme in the coming 
years. This will allow us to track and monitor the most important 
emissions pathways, and to encourage action where needed. 

Grid decarbonisation
The UK government has committed to a decarbonised grid by 
2035. This, tied in with future building standards, the cessation 
of gas boilers in new homes, and the Group having homes that 
can be zero carbon in use from 2030 would see a significant 
reduction in our downstream carbon emissions. This would 
require government to deliver on its goals by deploying 
sufficient solar and wind, along with other low or zero carbon 
energy sources, and driving overall grid efficiencies.

Future home standards (FHS) and building techniques
From 2025, the FHS will require new homes to produce at least 
75% less carbon emissions from homes compared with 2013 
building regulations. This contributes a reduction of around a 
third of total value chain emissions from 2030 because of the 
stringent energy efficiency requirements. 

We continually work to improve the energy efficiency of our 
homes and are adapting our home designs in response to 
current regulations and the subsequent changes within the 
Future Homes Standard. In FY23, 99.2% (FY22: 98.8%) of our 
home completions were EPC rated A or B.

For more detail see pages 46 to 47.

Additionally, a key element to both our MMC and carbon 
reduction strategy is the delivery of an increased share of 
timber frame homes. Timber frame provides an efficient 
method of construction with lower levels of embodied carbon, 
and we delivered 5,578 homes using MMC equating to 32% of 
our total home completions (see page 33 for further details).

Alternative fuels during groundworks  
and site preparation
Our groundworks supplier partners utilise diesel-powered 
equipment. As with our own approach to plant on site, we 
anticipate that heavier plant used in site preparation will 
continue to move to the most efficient engines available, use 
HVO as a transition fuel in the short term, and, over the longer 
term beyond 2030, move to the use of batteries. Beyond this, 
some manufacturers are investigating hydrogen fuel cells, 
though this is still a nascent technology. 

Materials choices 
Investigations into low carbon building materials has continued 
this year, for example we have trialled bricks with lower 
material volumes in our Kent Division, which in turn lowers 
the embodied carbon content. This is an illustration of the 
opportunities that could be scaled through supply chain 
engagement. We continue to investigate materials which 
contribute to lowering the embodied carbon of our homes. 

Supply Shocks and Uncertainties
Recent significant events such as the arrival of COVID-19 
or the invasion of Ukraine have been of macroeconomic 
significance and had a significant impact on supply chains 
globally, with the Group seeing rapid inflation in the price 
of materials and the cost of energy for example. Due to the 
spend-based nature of the EEIO methodology, this naturally 
has an impact on the calculated size of our value chain 
emissions and is another driver for moving to a hybrid 
model incorporating direct measurement.

Agile management of our transition pathway will be vital 
in the coming years to allow us to respond to supply shocks 
and balance out shortfalls in one area with additional 
reductions driven through other sectors.

Supply chain actions under investigation

Critical sectors

Key carbon reduction levers

Concrete and cement  
(including mortars)

 ∙ Move to renewables and lower carbon products.

 ∙ Waste management and circularity, decreasing use of virgin materials and lowering 

energy required in production.

 ∙ Modern methods of construction (MMC) and innovative products to reduce volumes required.

Bricks and blocks 

 ∙ Reduced volume and higher recycled content bricks.

 ∙ Kilns fired with renewable energy, including hydrogen and syngas.

Lime and gypsum  
(plasterboard)

Ceramics  
(including roof tiles  
for example)

 ∙ Increased use of renewable energy.

 ∙ Increased use of recycled materials and reduction in volume of virgin materials.

 ∙ Increased use of gasification of biomass, industrial heat pumps, hybrid drying, 
and extended tunnel kilns. Hydrogen as an alternative to gas and heat recovery. 

 ∙ Increased recycled content and reuse of “waste” materials to avoid use of virgin products 

and lower embodied carbon.

Plastics  
(including pipework  
and windows for example)

 ∙ Recycling of plastic and encourage large scale adoption of green plastics and bioplastics.

 ∙ Promote usage of waste plastic in innovative products, e.g. plastic concrete.

Timber 

 ∙ Waste management and circularity, decreasing use of virgin materials and lowering 

energy required.

 ∙ Alternative building materials e.g. cross-laminated timber elements where appropriate.

Ferrous metals  
(including steel)

 ∙ Updated production such as direct reduced iron and smelting reduction.

 ∙ Move towards hydrogen-based steel making.

 ∙ Promote usage of green steel.

Main Contractors  
– direct purchase of materials

Additional materials across  
our operations

 ∙ Identification of products with lower embodied carbon. Adoption of products with 

Environmental Product Declarations.

 ∙ All the above initiatives will likely contribute, especially where products are made 

from multiple materials.

METRICS AND TARGETS
To monitor progress of our response to risks and opportunities, management monitor several indicative performance metrics.

We are focused on reducing the emissions of the homes we build, to offer our customers even better energy efficiency as well as 
resilience to climate change. We acknowledge the current obstacles to effectively reducing value chain emissions, including the lack 
of data, and inconsistent standards, and we therefore anticipate greater progress will be made over the medium- to long-term. Whilst 
we face headwinds in the short term, our immediate plans for improvements in data collection and stakeholder engagement will drive 
our performance towards these goals.

Carbon pricing

Description As per our “Disorderly 

Transition” scenario 
(outlined on page 83), 
external carbon prices 
could reach up to $291 per 
tCO2e by 2050. The Group 
monitors its exposure to 
carbon pricing through 
its direct and indirect 
greenhouse gas emissions, 
as its energy usage and 
emissions of suppliers 
act as indicators of the 
activity that may be subject 
to future increases in 
regulatory costs.

To ensure we achieve 
emissions reductions in 
line with a 1.5°C transition, 
we have committed to 
SBTi approved targets 
across our value chain, 
measuring direct and 
indirect emissions against 
the baseline year of 2018. 
Details of how we will 
achieve these targets are 
presented in the transition 
pathway on pages 91 to 95.

Housing regulations; 
Demand for and 
affordability of 
green homes

With over a fifth of UK 
emissions coming from 
its homes, reducing 
emissions from residential 
buildings is a priority for 
the UK’s decarbonisation 
strategy. This includes 
reducing the emissions 
generated in new build 
homes, which is reflected 
in building regulations 
such as the Future Homes 
Standard, which will 
require a reduction in 
the Dwelling Emissions 
Rate (DER) of 75-80% 
compared to 2013 building 
regulations.

Modern methods of 
construction utilising 
offsite production reduce 
build time and increase 
resilience to severe 
weather. In FY22 we 
accelerated our ambition 
and updated our 2025 
target to apply offsite-
based products and 
systems to 30% of homes.

Low running costs 
associated with energy 
efficiency of new homes is 
an important consideration 
for homebuyers, with 
the average new Barratt 
home unlocking savings 
of up to £2,200 per 
annum compared with 
older homes. Therefore, 
maintaining at least 99% 
of our homes at an EPC 
A or B rating will support 
us in benefiting from the 
opportunities available 
for energy-efficient 
new homes.

As per the climate risk register presented on page 84, our greatest exposure to climate change is through transition risks, 
particularly those related to building regulations and carbon pricing. All our residential properties are subject to incoming building 
regulations, but we are investigating means to monitor adherence to building regulations further. We are also investigating the 
implementation of internal carbon pricing to allow future emissions to inform decision making. 

Relatively few of our assets or business activities are vulnerable to physical risks since our land appraisal process already 
considers physical risks such as flooding. Therefore, rather than applying an overall percentage of business activities subject 
to physical risks, we deem it more appropriate to monitor exposure to physical risks through risk-specific metrics. To that end, 
we are looking to implement monitoring of overheating and weather disruption over the next 12 months.

Further industry-wide metrics are included within our SASB disclosure on our website and cross-industry metrics are included 
in the five-year record on page 239.

The estimation of scope 3 emissions from our supply chain 
applies industry-specific Environmentally Extended Input 
Output (EEIO) factors against supplier spend. These factors are 
updated annually based on macroeconomic indicators. During 
the year, The World Bank issued retrospective updates to these 
macroeconomic indicators affecting 2022, 2021 and 2020. As 
such, the EEIO factors for these years have been updated, with 
the impacts outlined in the table above.

For information and progress on our scope 1 & 2 and scope 3 
carbon reduction initiatives and how we plan to decarbonise across 
our operations and value chain, see our transition plan on page 91. 

How we are building our climate data framework
The Group has set out a roadmap for further ESG reporting 
improvements, which includes the monitoring of climate-related 
metrics. To support this, we have identified three ESG data 
strategy priorities to (i) automate data collection; (ii) enhance 
controls over ESG data; and (iii) provide actionable insights 
through dashboard reporting. 

To support action to achieve emissions-related remuneration 
targets (detailed on page 158), local management now receive 
regular data on emissions performance, benchmarking their 
divisions against other regions and allowing for the 
identification of high and low performing sites. We are currently 
developing further data reporting that will show the impact of 
specific equipment usage at the site level to further drive 
energy-efficient behaviours. This will also allow for the 
monitoring of initiatives detailed in our transition pathway, 
leading the path towards net zero.

Our data priorities will be embedded across the Sustainability 
Framework by the end of FY24. This is a rapidly evolving area 
and our roadmap to automated and actionable ESG data 
reporting will be updated periodically to take into consideration 
new priorities for data collection as they become clearer 
through regulatory drivers or voluntary targets.

Driving performance
Performance against the Group’s climate-related targets is reported 
to the Sustainability Committee, a sub-committee of the Board.

In January 2023 we converted our £700m revolving credit facility 
to a sustainability-linked loan. The performance measures are 
(1) science-based target aligned scope 1 & 2 emissions 
reductions; (2) waste intensity reduction; and (3) improving the 
sustainability of our homes by reducing the average Dwelling 
Emission Rate.

To drive the implementation of our climate-related targets, 
scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas reduction is included as a 
performance measure for the LTPP awarded to Executive 
Directors and senior managers, accounting for 15% of the 
award. Full details of the 2022 award to Executive Directors 
are presented in the Remuneration Report on pages 137 to 168. 

Our scope 1 & 2 (market-based) absolute emissions decreased 
by 0.7% in the year, representing an overall decrease of 23.7% 
compared to our 2018 baseline, reflecting steady progress 
towards our science-based target of a 29% reduction by 2025. 
However, scope 1 & 2 (market-based) intensity increased by 
4.4% in the year, primarily due to timing differences between 
what was built versus handed over. 

Despite reductions achieved in scope 1 & 2 (market-based) 
emissions, we are mindful that our direct energy consumption 
has increased by 9.0% in the year.  While our efforts on initiatives 
such as substitution of diesel with HVO and adoption of renewable 
electricity tariffs have resulted in significant emissions savings, 
underlying energy requirements have increased. In response, we 
are prioritising energy reduction activities and are supporting 
this with enhanced carbon emissions reporting to local divisions, 
providing greater visibility of energy usage on sites to enable 
them to drive a reduction in energy consumption and cost. 

Scope 3 absolute emissions decreased by 2.6% in the year, 
primarily driven by a reduction in upstream emissions from 
purchased goods & services, which we calculate using a spend-
based method, particularly susceptible to high price inflation in 
some carbon-intensive sectors of the supply chain.  See page 94 
for a summary of how we are working with key suppliers to obtain 
quantity-based emissions data that is more representative of the 
materials we source from them. Like scopes 1 & 2, the lower 
volume of properties handed over in the year also had an impact, 
and therefore scope 3 intensity increased by 2.3% in the year.

Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the 
Financial Statements, the Directors are required to consider 
whether the Group can continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. After making enquiries and having 
considered forecasts and appropriate sensitivities, the Directors 
have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the Financial 
Statements, that there is reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue to operate for the 
foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date of 
signing of these Financial Statements. (More information on the 
going concern judgement can be found in note 1 to the Financial 
Statements.) Therefore, the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in the preparation of these Financial Statements.

Viability statement 
In accordance with the Code, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects and financial viability of the Group over the longer 
term, considering both its current position and circumstances, 
and the potential impact of its principal risks. The Group’s 
business model is presented on pages 14 to 15 and its future 
prospects are primarily monitored through the risk 
management processes detailed on page 71.

Assessment period
For the long-term Viability Statement, the Directors consider 
that a three year review period is appropriate. This period is 
aligned to our operating framework of a 3.5 years owned land 
bank, and the time frame over which the majority of our risks 

have the potential to manifest. Additionally, the Group’s 
bottom-up planning and forecasting cycle, which considers 
a wide range of information relating to present and future 
business conditions, including those which impact on expected 
profitability, cash flows and funding requirements, covers three 
years.

As environmental and climate change risks become more 
significant, the potential for moving towards five year review 
period will be considered for future viability assessments.

The Group’s business plan reflects the anticipated effects of the 
current economic environment. The Group is forecast to remain 
profitable and in compliance with its financial covenants 
throughout the forecast period.

Principal risks
The Group continues to be subject to its principal risks, which 
are detailed on pages 73 to 77. This Viability Statement considers 
the impact that these risks might have on its ability to meet its 
targets in current market conditions over the review period.

The current economic environment presents significant 
macroeconomic uncertainties, most notably around interest 
rates and their consequent impacts on UK economic growth 
and housing affordability, as well as consumer confidence and 
spending. The risks that were considered relevant, for which 
the impacts were applied in aggregate, were as follows:

followed by a 3% recovery in FY26, 
and a fall in sales volumes of 25% 
in FY24 followed by a 5% recovery 
in FY25 and FY26.

A further increase in material 
and labour costs of 3% arising 
from shortfalls in supply and 
inflationary pressures.

A Building Safety Levy of £1,500 per 
private plot for potential additional 
safety costs that could be imposed 
by the UK Government.

Climate-related transition risk will 
manifest to a greater degree than 
forecast, consistent with a 1.5oC 
global temperature rise, including 
early implementation of the Future 
Homes Standard and increased 
carbon pricing, with the impact 
being seen from FY25. 
An additional cost per plot of £5,500 
has been included.

Group resilience to risk impact 
modelled

Geographic and product 
diversity allows for 
flexibility in response to 
market conditions whilst 
the diverse land bank 
allows for selective 
development of 
future sites.

Key supplier audit 
programme, centralised 
procurement and 
long-standing 
relationships ensure 
continuity of supply. 
Robust cost control 
through well-monitored 
build programmes.

Strong balance sheet and 
net cash position along 
with good cost control 
through well monitored 
build programmes.

Mitigating actions to risk impact modelled

In response to lower volumes, 
a reduction in uncommitted land 
investment combined with a reduction 
in the level of production and therefore 
work in progress, as well as a 
reduction in overhead base.

Redesign of developments to 
emphasise cost savings. Central 
procurement review of supply 
agreements with significant 
agreements fixed in advance.

As an industry-wide cost, any such levy 
will likely be factored into future land 
bids over the medium term.

Continuous investment 
in new technologies and 
engagement with the 
wider supply chain, 
ensuring responsibly 
sourced materials.

For further details regarding climate 
change risks, refer to the TCFD 
disclosures on pages 78 to 98. For the 
transition pathway to achieve net zero 
by 2040 and mitigating exposure to 
carbon pricing, see page 91.

Outcome of assessment 
To assess the Group’s resilience to adverse outcomes, its 
forecast performance over the three-year period was sensitised 
to reflect a series of scenarios based on the Group’s principal 
risks and the downside prospects for the UK economy and 
housing market presented in the latest external economic 
forecasts. This assessment included a reasonable worst case 
scenario in which the Group’s principal risks manifest to a 
severe but plausible level. 

Under the described scenario, the Group is able to operate 
within its current facilities, meet its liabilities as they fall due, 
and remain in compliance with its financial covenants in the 
assessed period. The Group has a policy of maintaining a £150m 
headroom on its available facilities and would remain in compliance 
with this policy throughout the viability review period.

Under the scenario, the Group would undertake mitigating 
actions in response to the challenging circumstances modelled. 
This would primarily involve a reduction in investment in land and 
work in progress in line with the fall in expected sales, and would 
not compromise the Group’s ability to grow over the long term.

The Directors have also carried out reverse stress testing to 
determine the market conditions in which the Group would 
cease to be able to operate under its current facilities within 
the three-year review period. 

The Group’s base forecast was sensitised to an immediate 
reduction in average selling prices from 1 July 2023 by a set 
percentage up to the point at which the Group breached its 
covenants or headroom policy. A second stress test was 
performed in which the base forecast was sensitised to an 
immediate reduction in sales volumes from 1 July 2023 by a set 
percentage up to the point at which the Group breached its 
covenants or headroom policy. A reduction in uncommitted land 
spend of 50% was included as a mitigating action in both stress 
tests. It was determined that a reduction in average selling 
price of c. 31% or a reduction in sales volumes of c. 74% would 
result in a breach. The Directors consider such sustained falls 
in average selling price or sales volumes to be extremely unlikely.

Mitigations
Furthermore, in such challenging economic circumstances, 
additional options would be available to ensure that the Group 
would retain the flexibility to react to further risks or 
opportunities, including:

(i)  further reductions in uncommitted land spend;

(ii)  redesign of developments to emphasise cost savings;

(iii) suspension of discretionary bonus payments;

(iv)  reduction or suspension of dividend payments;

(v)  disposal of interests in joint ventures to partners; and

(vi)  sale of land or unsold stock at discounted value.

As these actions could affect the long-term solvency and growth 
prospects of the Group, they would only be used to meet immediate 
requirements. Nonetheless, their availability in addition to the 
actions modelled demonstrates that the Group has further flexibility 
to respond to challenges as they arise.

Based on this review, the Directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period of their assessment.

Over the longer term, climate change will present an increasing 
risk to the Group. In response to this, and in line with the 
recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures, the Board has undertaken a review of the climate-
related risks and opportunities that may affect the business out 
to 2050, including the modelling of the Group’s resilience under 
several climate-related scenarios. The results of this review, as 
well as the action being undertaken to ensure the business is 
well positioned to thrive in the new physical, socio-economic 
and regulatory environment, are set out on pages 78 to 98. 

Looking forward, significant macro-economic challenges, 
most notably persistent inflation and a higher interest rate 
environment, will impact the housebuilding sector in 
the medium term. The Directors consider that the Group can 
demonstrate its resilience to these challenges with its well-
capitalised balance sheet, strong net cash balance and a solid 
forward sales position going into FY24.

Board leadership and company purpose

Culture in the workplace 

The Board sets the culture and tone from the top. It is responsible for ensuring that the right culture is embedded throughout the 
business, including in our dealings with stakeholders. It derives from our Vision and Purpose, which has been undergoing a review 
with the outcome due to be announced later in FY24. A strong culture that furthers our purpose, and is firmly embedded across the 
workforce, underpins our success through the following values agreed by the Board.

Our culture

Do the right thing
Ensure what we do is in line with 
our policies and procedures, and 
in the interests of our stakeholders.

Customer focus
Strive to meet the expectations 
and needs of our customers, 
both internal and external. 

Resilience and adaptability
Look for innovative ways to 
improve efficiencies across the 
organisation and recognise there 
is always room for improvement. 
Be willing to change the way we do 
things to meet the requirements 
of stakeholders and those set by 
legislation or regulation. 

Pride in what we do
Aim to operate in a way that 
satisfies the expectations of 
our stakeholders particularly 
in terms of quality and service. 

Culture in action: We have always believed leaseholders should not have to pay for necessary 
remediation to fix building safety issues, caused by the design, construction or refurbishment 
of their buildings. Following our signing last year of the Building Safety Pledge, we joined the 
first wave of developers to sign the Scottish Safer Buildings Accord developer commitment 
letter, further details of which can be found on pages 68 and 221. We have developed a model 
with the government to support the resettlement of Afghan refugees with 19 homes identified in 
tranche 1, and tranche 2 launched since the end of FY23. We are discussing ways to encourage 
other housebuilders to participate in the model. Further information on how we look after the 
interests of our stakeholders can be found on pages 57 and 58.

Culture in action: During FY23, we continued to monitor the impact of rising mortgage rates 
on our customers. Consequently, we adjusted the level of incentives on offer in order to better 
serve customers facing cost of living challenges. We also relaunched the Key Worker Deposit 
Contribution scheme, which was due to come to an end this year. We continue to engage with 
mortgage providers on Green mortgages, which would reward customers for purchasing our 
houses which are all EPC rated B or above. We have recently announced an agreement with 
Citra to develop a further 604 much needed high quality sustainable homes for private rental 
Further details can be found on page 26.

Culture in action: Customer demand for housing declined during FY23, and after satisfying 
the forward order book in the first half of the year, our teams switched their focus to carefully 
managing build cost inflation and maintaining disciplined investment in work in progress 
to match the fall in market demand. 

Culture in action: We have won multiple awards throughout FY23 for quality and service, 
including an HBF 5 star rating for the 14th consecutive year, and 96 NHBC Pride in the Job 
awards. These are detailed on page 15. We are particularly proud to be leading the industry 
in sustainability, including participation in the eHome2 project researching and testing new 
methods of construction to sustainably mitigate the effects of climate change.

How the Board measures and assesses culture
The Board measures and assesses culture using both 
internal and external KPIs, as follows:

 ∙ Safety, health and the environment – there is zero tolerance 
towards breaches relating to the health and safety of our 
employees, suppliers, sub-contractors and the general public. 
The Group is also conscious of the impact that its operations 
have on the environment. The Board is updated regularly on 
health, safety and environmental matters, and on any new or 
ongoing investigations and their outcomes. The SHE Audit 
compliance KPI, which underpins the quality and service annual 
bonus performance measure, is set out on page 17, and other 
environmental and safety targets are detailed on pages 16 and 
17. 

 ∙ Customer satisfaction – this is assessed using customer care 
survey responses and recommendation scores (KPIs can 
be found on page 16), which form part of the annual bonus 
performance measures for Executive Directors, and awards 
such as the HBF 5 star rating and NHBC Pride in the Job 
awards (details of which can be found on page 15), all of 
which are regularly reported to the Board. 

 ∙ Employee engagement survey – a survey is conducted annually 
to assess how the business is meeting the expectations of its 
employees. It also contains several culture-related questions, 
to monitor and assess how well the culture is embedded. The 
results of the survey are reviewed by the Executive Committee 
and Senior Management team, as well as by the local teams, 
with key findings reported to the Board. The outcome of our 
latest employee engagement survey is detailed on page 35.

 ∙ Employee retention – our employees are our greatest asset. 

It is important that we do everything that we can to retain them, 
and this is one of the pillars of our people strategy. The Board 
monitors employee leaver numbers and reasons, and the steps 
being taken to attract, recruit and retain employees. 

 ∙ Policies and procedures compliance – core governance 

policies are reviewed annually by the Board with employees 
required to regularly complete a variety of e-learning modules. 
Completion levels are reported to the Board. Business policies, 
processes and procedures are reviewed regularly. Our internal 
audit team conduct regular reviews of compliance with policies, 
processes and procedures, and test that they remain up to date. 
The team’s findings are reported to the Audit Committee and 
ultimately to the Board. The internal audit team also provides 
updates to the Audit Committee on any matters raised via the 
Group’s whistleblowing procedure (see page 130).

Board independence
All of our Non-Executive Directors were independent in 
character and judgement during the financial year, which is 
vital for them in carrying out their respective roles effectively. 
Caroline Silver was considered to be independent on 
appointment to the Board and on taking the role of Chair. 

This year’s review of Directors’ conflicts of interest confirmed 
that none of the Non-Executive Directors have any business or 
other relationship with the Group (or other outside interests) 
that might influence their independence or judgement. None of 
the Non-Executive Directors, or the Chair, has been an employee 
of any Group company or had a material business relationship 
with them. None of them has close family ties with any of the 
Company’s advisers, Directors or senior employees, or holds 
cross-directorships or has significant links with other 
Directors. None of them represents a significant shareholder. 

The Board meets the Code requirement for at least half the Board 
(excluding the Chair), to be independent (as defined by the Code) 
Non-Executive Directors. A breakdown of the independence of 
the Board members is shown on page 109.

The Chair and each of the Non-Executive Directors have 
demonstrated their commitment to the business during the 
year, through their attendance at several unscheduled Board 
calls convened at short notice to discuss a variety of issues 
requiring decisions outside the normal scheduled meetings. 
The Chair and the Non-Executive Directors meet regularly 
without the Executive Directors being present, usually prior 
to or immediately following Committee meetings, and five 
of these meetings have been held during the financial year.

Internal controls and risk management
The Board monitors and regularly reviews the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems, 
including controls related to the material financial, operational 
and compliance performance (see the Audit Committee Report 
on pages 124 to 132). 

The internal audit team has developed a risk framework for 
all business functions, which has been approved by the Audit 
Committee. This framework forms the basis of the internal 
control audit plan for the year ahead, which tests if key controls 
are being applied effectively in each operating division. Material 
issues identified during internal audits and follow-up action 
plans are reviewed by the Executive Directors and by the Board. 
Any necessary actions are immediately taken to remedy any 
significant failings in the internal control system. Further 
details of the work undertaken by internal audit can be found 
on page 130.

The Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage 
risks that may impede the achievement of the Group’s business 
objectives, and identify and appropriately manage activities 
where there is a high risk of corruption (including bribery) 
amongst employees, partners or intermediaries, rather than 
to eliminate those risks entirely. The system of internal control 
therefore provides only reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The system of internal 
control does, however, provide reasonable assurance that 
potential issues can be identified promptly and appropriate 
remedial action taken. Further details can be found in the risk 
management section of the Strategic Report (pages 71 to 100). 

The Group operates internal controls to ensure that the Group’s 
Financial Statements are reconciled to the underlying financial 
ledgers. A review of the consolidated accounts and Financial 
Statements is completed by management to ensure that the 
financial position and results of the Group are 
appropriately reflected.

The Board has not identified, nor been advised of, any failings or 
weaknesses that it has determined to be significant. Therefore, 
a confirmation of necessary actions has not been 
considered appropriate. 

Fair, balanced and understandable
The Board has considered and reflected on whether the Annual 
Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and understandable. 
As part of its considerations, the Board has:

 ∙ reflected on the feedback shareholders provided on our 

2022 Annual Report and Accounts;

 ∙ set aside adequate time to review and discuss significant 
areas of the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts, assessing 
its tone, balance and language, while being mindful of the 
requirements of the Code and the need for consistency 
between the narrative section of the Annual Report and 
the Financial Statements; and

 ∙ considered the recommendation from the Audit Committee 
that the report was “fair, balanced and understandable”. The 
process undertaken by the Audit Committee to support the 
Board’s assessment can be found on page 129.

The Board endorses the recommendation of the Audit Committee 
that the FY23 Annual Report and Accounts are fair, balanced 
and understandable, and its formal statement on this is 
contained within the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on 
page 171.

Focus in the reporting year

 ∙ Undertook a robust recruitment process for the 

appointments of both Jasi Halai and Caroline Silver. 

 ∙ Assessed the skills and diversity on the Board 

and its Committees.

 ∙ Reviewed the succession plans for the Executive Directors 

and Senior Management.

Priorities for FY24

 ∙ To further assess the composition (including size and 

diversity) of the Board and its Committees. 

 ∙ Ensure completion of Caroline Silver’s induction process.

1   Caroline Silver joined the Board and the Committee on 1 June 2023 

and took over as Chair of the Committee with effect from 30 June 2023, 
and no Committee meetings have taken place since then.

2   John Allan did not attend any meetings or parts thereof where his 

succession was being discussed.

3   Jasi Halai (who was appointed on 1 January 2023) and Chris Weston were 
unable to attend the January meeting due to a prior commitment. Prior to 
the meeting, Jasi and Chris provided their views on the meeting agenda 
which were shared with the other Committee members during the 
meeting. Following the meeting they were briefed on the business of the 
meeting and any decisions taken.

 4   Nina Bibby did not offer herself for re-election and stepped down from 

the Board at the AGM in October 2022.

5   Sharon White stepped down from the Board on 30 June 2023.

Statement from the Chair of 
the Nomination Committee
I am pleased to present my first Nomination Committee Report 
having taken over as Chair from John Allan on 30 June 2023. 
It has been a busy year for the Nomination Committee with a 
number of changes taking place with the composition of the 
Board. I would like to thank John Allan and Jock Lennox for 
steering the Committee through each of these. Full details 
of the recruitment processes can be found on pages 119 
and are summarised below.

The Nomination Committee has throughout FY23 acted 
in accordance with its Terms of Reference (see page 118) 
as delegated to it by the Board. The responsibilities of the 
Nomination Committee are summarised on page 118. 

Board changes and succession planning
Following a thorough recruitment process the Nomination 
Committee appointed Jasi Halai as a Non-Executive Director 
with effect from 1 January 2023. Jasi succeeds Nina Bibby who, 
having completed nine years of service, stepped down from the 
Board at the AGM in October 2022. In addition, the Nomination 
Committee undertook a robust recruitment process to appoint 
me as a Non-Executive Director and Chair to take over from 
John Allan, who stepped down from the Board on 30 June 2023. 
This search was led by Jock Lennox, and John Allan did not 
attend any meetings whilst his succession was being discussed.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Jock for chairing 
the additional meetings held to discuss and come to a decision 
on the acceleration of the planned Chair’s succession and for 
guiding Board members through the process seamlessly.

As announced in January 2023, Sharon White stepped down earlier 
than expected as a Non-Executive Director on 30 June 2023, in 
order to reduce her non-executive commitments. Sharon made a 
significant contribution to the Board during her five years with us, 
including in the last few years as the Designated Non-Executive 
Director for Workforce Engagement. I will be taking over as the 
Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement. 

We are pleased that Nigel Webb has agreed to join the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 October 2023. Nigel 
brings a wealth of experience and knowledge in property, 
construction and land which complement the existing skills on the 
Board and address some of the skills gaps identified.

The Nomination Committee will continue to undertake detailed 
work on succession planning at Board, Senior Management and 
junior levels to ensure we have a sufficiently diverse pipeline 
and the right skills and experience to drive our strategy forward.

Skills and experience of the Board 
As part of the recruitment process for the new Non-Executive 
Director and the new Chair, the Nomination Committee reviewed 
the composition, skills, experience and diversity of the Board 
and its Committees. This highlighted the need to identify candidates 
with skills in, amongst other areas, financial experience to 
support the Chair of the Audit Committee, which both Jasi Halai 
and I possess. A further review of skills was carried out during 
FY23, and it was agreed that any further recruitment would 
focus on land/construction, which will be addressed with the 
appointment of Nigel Webb. 

and experience but also female and ethnic representation. 
The Nomination Committee and the Board were therefore 
disappointed when more than 20% percent of votes were cast 
against the re-election of John Allan at the 2022 AGM. Having 
engaged with those shareholders who voted against, it was evident 
that this was due to the fall in the level of female representation on 
the Board following Nina Bibby’s departure. They did however 
acknowledge that had they been aware of the recruitment process 
ongoing at the time, the shortlist for which consisted entirely of 
female candidates, they would have voted in favour of the resolution. 

As set out earlier in my statement, since the October 2022 AGM, 
various changes have been made to the composition of the 
Board. With my appointment as Chair and of Jasi Halai as a 
Non-Executive Director, we meet the recommendations to have 
a woman in a senior Board position (Chair, CEO, CFO or SID) 
and to have at least one member on the Board from a minority 
ethnic background (as defined by the FTSE Women Leaders 
Review and the Parker Review). Our female representation 
reached 40% on 1 June 2023, when I joined the Board. As a 
result of the early departures of Sharon White and John Allan, 
our female representation on the Board is currently at 37.5%. 
At the point of making an offer to Nigel Webb to join as a Non-
Executive Director, the Nomination Committee was conscious 
that female representation on the Board would fall to 33.33%. The 
Nomination Committee, and subsequently the Board, decided 
that Nigel was the best candidate for the role given that he 
possesses the skills, knowledge and experience in property, 
construction and land which complement those of the existing 
Board members. We are however fully committed to meeting 
the recommendation to have at least 40% female representation 
on the Board by the end of 2025. This is a key priority for the 
Nomination Committee and the Board. 

Information on the Board’s diversity targets as required by the 
UK Listing Rules, together with accompanying numerical data, 
is set out on page 120. In addition, the Nomination Committee 
has reviewed its Board diversity policy, which applies to the 
Board and its committees, to ensure it remains fit for purpose. 

The Nomination Committee also ensured that the Board 
considered whether diversity and inclusion across the wider 
business was being progressed satisfactorily. This review included 
talent succession and attraction, and the business’ credentials as 
a diverse and inclusive employer. Further information on the 
Company’s progress on diversity and inclusion initiatives can be 
found on pages 120 and 121 and in the Strategic Report on pages 35  
and 36.

FY24 priorities
Our key priorities for FY24 are the continued focus on succession 
planning and training, particularly given the recent changes 
to the Board. From FY24 onwards, it has been agreed that 
diversity and inclusion at all levels across the business will be a 
matter for the Board to monitor directly rather than through the 
Nomination Committee. The respective Terms of Reference 
have been updated accordingly.

Further details of the work undertaken by the Nomination 
Committee during the year are set out on the following pages.

Diversity and inclusion
The Nomination Committee fully understands the importance 
of having diversity on the Board, not only in terms of skills

Nomination Committee role and activity FY23
Membership and attendance at meetings 
The membership of the Nomination Committee and the attendance at each of its scheduled meetings is set out on page 116. 
The majority of Committee members are considered independent by the Company and in accordance with the Code. Their 
biographies and qualifications are shown on pages 104 and 105.

Role and main activities undertaken by the Committee during the financial year
The Nomination Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its Terms of Reference, which can be found on the Company’s website 
at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors/corporate-governance. In addition to its annual tasks, such as the review of its 
Terms of Reference, effectiveness and approval of this report, the Committee carried out the following work during the year:

Priorities

Governance

Work carried out and outcomes

Reviewed the need for training and development in areas identified by Board members including, 
but not limited to, digital security and technology, Government relations, ESG/Climate. 

Composition and Succession Considered candidates and proposed the appointment of an additional Non-Executive Director 

and Chair designate.

Considered succession plans for Non-Executive Directors, Executive Directors, Executive 
Committee and Regional Managing Directors, taking into account the need for diversity. 
Further information can be found above.

Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Board has authorised the Nomination Committee to oversee 
the process for reviewing and making recommendations to the 
Board concerning any actual or potential conflicts of interest 
that may arise for any Board member, including details of any 
terms and conditions that it deems necessary to impose on any 
authorisation given. Throughout FY23, the Company Secretary 
maintained a register of Directors’ conflicts of interest. A 
summary of this register was reviewed at each Board meeting 
so that it continues to remain accurate and current. The full 
register is reviewed annually by the Nomination Committee, and 
recommendations are made to the Board regarding any changes 
to the authorisations that may be required. The Board, when 
authorising any conflict or possible conflict of interest, does 
not count in the quorum the Director whose conflict or possible 
conflict is being discussed and reserves the right to exclude a 
Director from a meeting whilst a conflict or possible conflict 
is being considered. The Board may revoke or vary any 
authorisation at any time. The procedures have operated 
effectively during the year.

Board changes and succession planning 
Succession planning is a live topic at Board and Nomination 
Committee meetings. All appointments and succession plans 
are objective, based on merit and the need to promote diversity.

For Non-Executive Directors, the Nomination Committee annually 
reviews the length of service for each, to determine if a new 
appointment needs to be made. The Nomination Committee 
takes into account the cyclicality of the business, as lessons 
gained through one property cycle can be useful during the next. 

For Executive Directors, the Nomination Committee will 
annually discuss the succession plans for the other Executive 
Directors and Senior Management below Board level with 
the Chief Executive. This process helps to identify suitable 
individuals who could be able to fill senior managerial or Board 
positions in the future and to determine and address their 
development needs. As part of their development, senior 
managers are invited to attend part of a Board meeting to 
present on their specialist area. This also enables the Board 
to assess the quality of internal talent, and the individual to 
get a greater understanding of the workings of the Board. 

Succession plans are in place across the business for the wider 
workforce and our work on developing our employees is set out 
in the Strategic Report on pages 35 to 39. When considering 
succession plans, the Board remains cognisant of the need to 
ensure that there is a diverse range of individuals included in 
the plan. The business continues to promote diversity and 
inclusion from within, and further details of the work that has 
been undertaken in this area can be found on pages 35 to 39.

Board appointment process

Stage 1 

Stage 2 

Stage 3 

Stage 4 

Stage 5 

The Nomination Committee 
reviewed the length of tenure 
of each Non-Executive Director, 
determined the gaps in experience 
and considered the existing 
balance of gender, ethnicity and 
social backgrounds on the Board 
to help identify the need to recruit. 
With Nina Bibby stepping down in 
October 2022 and John Allan due 
to complete nine years’ service 
in August 2023, the Nomination 
Committee agreed to continue the 
process to identify and appoint at 
least one Non-Executive Director 
and a new Chair. 

The Nomination Committee 
reviewed and approved 
an outline brief and role 
specification, and appointed 
Russell Reynolds1, to 
identify suitable candidates 
from a diverse pool of 
individuals. The Nomination 
Committee delegated 
authority to two sub-
committees to select 
candidates for a shortlist. 
The first was led by John 
Allan (for the Non-Executive 
Director) and the second by 
Jock Lennox (for the Chair).

The short-listed 
candidates met 
with the respective 
sub-committee of 
the Nomination 
Committee, with the 
preferred candidates 
going on to meet the 
remaining members 
of the Board. 

The Nomination 
Committee agreed 
the preferred 
candidates for each 
position, based on 
the range of skills, 
experience and 
knowledge that 
complemented 
those of the existing 
Board members and 
recommended the 
same to the Board.

The Board considered 
each candidate 
on their merits 
and approved the 
appointment of Jasi 
Halai as a Non-
Executive Director 
with effect from 
1 January 2023 and 
Caroline Silver as a 
Non-Executive Director 
and Chair Designate 
with effect from 
1 June 2023. 

1   Russell Reynolds Associates are occasionally requested to assist the Company with searches for senior management positions. They have no other 
connection with the individual Directors or the Company. Russell Reynolds Associates is accredited by the Enhanced Voluntary Code of Conduct for 
Executive Firms for its support to FTSE 350 Boards in increasing gender diversity. It is also a Co-Founder of The 30% Club, an advocate for improved 
gender balance on boards. Specific guidance was given to Russell Reynolds Associates to ensure diversity within the candidate long and short lists 
whilst identifying candidates who had the relevant skills and experience required on the Board. 

Induction 
Jasi Halai has been through a detailed 
induction process and Caroline Silver is 
part way through hers. The induction 
process was designed to give each of 
them a good understanding of the 
business and how it operates to help 
them fulfil their respective roles 
effectively. As part of this, they received 
a comprehensive induction pack, and 
had meetings with each of: 

 ∙ the other Board members; 

 ∙ the Company Secretary;

 ∙ members of the Executive Committee;

 ∙ the Regional Managing Directors and 

teams (at the Regional offices); 

 ∙ heads of key Group functions; 

 ∙ key external corporate advisers; and 

 ∙ the external auditor. 

Their inductions also included site visits, 
and details of other opportunities available 
as part of the induction process. John 
Allan met with Jasi Halai to listen to her 
views and feedback on the induction 
process, which was seen to be 
comprehensive and well structured. Jock 
Lennox and/or the Company Secretary will 
meet with Caroline Silver to gain her views 
on her induction process once completed. 

Q&A with Caroline Silver - Chair and Jasi Halai - Non-Executive Director
We asked both Caroline Silver and Jasi Halai about their experience of joining Barratt. 

What skills and experience do you 
bring to the role?
Caroline: I have considerable experience 
in chairing boards to obtain the best 
from colleagues, working together in 
a challenging yet supportive way. I am 
experienced in helping shape strategy 
and vision and my financial background 
is helpful. I bring lots of experience in 
working with investors.

Jasi: I bring particular expertise in finance 
and accounting, with financial planning 
and analysis to the role. 

How have you found the 
induction process?
Caroline: It is well organised. I am 
spending time with every member of 
the leadership team and am enjoying 
getting out and about across the 
business, meeting colleagues and better 
understanding the culture of the business 
and the challenges they face. 

Jasi: Extremely welcoming, insightful and 
effective. I have been pleasantly surprised 
by how Barratt delivers. Its people take 
pride in what they do and this has been 
very evident not only through the Board 
and Committee meetings I have attended 
but also through the site visits I have conducted.

What were your first impressions 
of the business when you were 
approached?
Caroline: When I was first approached 
for the role, I knew very little about 
housebuilders. As I looked, I saw a 
company that leads the industry, in terms 
of quality, customer and sustainability and 
is operationally and financially strong.

Jasi: I was impressed by Barratt’s 60-
year history, and its focus on innovation 
in construction. I was also interested 
in Barratt’s commitment to building 
sustainably for people, nature and places, 
whilst providing sustainable financial returns 
for shareholders.

What made you decide to join 
the business?
Caroline: I was impressed with the 
diversity of background and experience on 
the Board and the Non-Executive Directors’ 
understanding and involvement. It was 
clear the executive team are professional, 
experienced, purpose driven with high 
integrity and committed to the long-term 
success of the Company. This was key 
for me. The key advisers I met endorsed 
the impression I had of a financially and 
operationally sound company, with a great 
team and plenty of ambition. 

Jasi: Barratt’s vision and impact, its 
contribution to the UK economy and the 
communities in which it operates. Barratt 
creates great places to live, leaving a 
legacy in every project it delivers, and its 
regeneration projects are commendable.

Nomination Committee Report continued

Reappointment and re-election of Directors 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board for up to 
three three-year terms subject to annual shareholder re-election 
and a particularly rigorous review prior to a third term being 
agreed. Non-Executive Directors will normally step down from 
their position on the Board and its Committees at the AGM 
following their ninth anniversary. The length of tenure of Board 
members is shown on page 109. Each of the Directors has been 
subject to a formal performance evaluation process during the 
year, as set out on page 123. The Nomination Committee and 
the Board are satisfied that each Director continues to be 
effective in, and demonstrates commitment to, their respective 
roles. All Directors will be standing for election or re-election at 
the forthcoming AGM. Biographical details of each of the 
Directors are set out on pages 104 to 105 of this report, along 
with reasons why their contribution is, and continues to be, 
valuable to the Company’s long-term sustainable success, and 
can also be found in the Notice of the 2023 AGM. 

Diversity and inclusion
Board diversity 
During the year, the Board reviewed its policy on diversity and 
inclusion. The objective of the policy is to ensure that diversity 
is reflected within the composition of the Board and throughout 
the business in its broadest sense, including gender, ethnicity, 
age, disability, religious belief, sexuality, social class, education 

experience and ways of thinking. The policy aims for continuous 
improvement at Board and Senior Management level on all 
these elements of diversity and to identify the most suitable 
candidate to join the Board having regard to the individual’s 
skills, experience and knowledge. It also seeks to ensure that, 
in managing any senior appointment and in succession planning 
more broadly, the Nomination Committee has regard to the 
recommendations of the Parker and the McGregor-Smith 
reviews on ethnicity and race and the benefits of diversity, 
including gender, ethnicity, social background and cognitive 
and personal strengths. A copy of our Board diversity policy can 
be found at: www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/sustainability/
our-policies. 

A full explanation of the diversity on the Board and the steps 
being taken to improve our position are set out in the Nomination 
Committee Chair’s report on page 117. In accordance with the 
Listing Rules, the following tables detail the diversity profile of 
the Board and the Executive Committee as at 30 June 2023. 
This data was collated from our HR database which has been 
populated using information provided by each individual 
employee, including Non-Executive Directors. Individuals are 
asked to select from a series of options on both sex/gender and 
ethnicity including the below options. Diversity information for 
employees below the Executive Committee can be found on 
pages 35 to 39.

Diversity and inclusion throughout the business 
The Nomination Committee and the Board recognise the importance of a diverse workforce, at all levels of seniority. Promoting 
diversity at Senior Management level, and more generally across the workforce, remains an objective for David Thomas, our 
Chief Executive. David, together with the new Group HR Director, will continue to support the Group Head of Diversity and Inclusion, 
to drive the agenda forward in this area and undertake a full review of the overall strategy for 2025. The Group’s aim is for its 
employee profile to mirror that of the communities in which it operates and provide an inclusive culture, where everyone can thrive. 
Further information on the Group’s progress on diversity and inclusion can be found on pages 35 to 39. The main objectives, how 
they are implemented and progress towards them are set out below.

Objectives

Implementation

Progress

Talent: HR processes that 
support a wide range of 
skills and backgrounds 

Ensure we have a detailed 
understanding of our people

Review the HR lifecycle 
activity and ensure it 
is inclusive

Tailored support 
programmes and 
early careers

Leadership: Role 
models & allies – 
leading the change

Leading inclusivity 
workshops

Support difference – 
Employee network 
sponsorship 

Reverse mentoring 

A deep dive of data has been undertaken to identify our levels of 
representation by grade, role and function for all divisions and Group 
Service Centre teams. This is reported monthly and reviewed in a 
quarterly scorecard to track change. We also review HR lifecycle data 
by gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability, from application 
through employee engagement and exit interview data, to ensure a full 
understanding of the employee experience for all.

Across the HR lifecycle we have made changes to ensure a more 
inclusive approach, including a review of our preferred supplier list 
for resourcing agencies, embedding Dignity & Respect into all our 
talent and early career programmes, a review and update of family 
friendly policies and externally delivered exit interviews.

Catalyst, a female support programme, has run for another successful 
year and has been joined by Spotlight our support programme for ethnic 
minority colleagues. Employees are encouraged to self nominate and 
the sessions are externally facilitated. 

All Regional and Managing Directors have received face-to-face 
workshops, with external facilitation on creating Dignity and 
Respect for all and how they create psychological safety.

Each of our Employee Networks has an Executive Committee 
member as their sponsor, who supports the activities and 
objectives of the respective group.

Both our gender and ethnicity support programmes include 
mentoring, which is an opportunity for both our leadership mentors 
and the programme mentees to share and learn.

We were delighted to take part in the inaugural 30% Club, Change 
the Race Ratio programme, which includes cross-organisational 
mentoring for high potential talent by the Chief Executive.

Shift attitudes: 
Support our people’s 
understanding to create 
the right experience 
for all

Hear the employee voice

Role models and celebrations

Zero tolerance on lack 
of dignity & respect 

We have five Employee Network groups, offering a range of 
activities from webinars, leading discussions, marking of key 
events and signposting support – Gender, Ethnicity & Religion, 
Disability, Families (including Carers) and LGBT+. Each network 
is sponsored by a member of the Executive Committee.

We have updated our policy, embedding zero tolerance and shared 
this through the business via a range of communication channels. 

Please refer to pages 51 and 55 to 56 for more information on the 
workforce forum.

Nomination Committee Report continued

Board and Committee evaluation 
Each year, the Board undertakes a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees and 
individual Directors. Every three years, the Board undertakes an externally facilitated evaluation. The last one was carried out in 
2022. This year’s evaluation was carried out internally by the Company Secretary. The next external evaluation is scheduled to be 
carried out for FY25.

Progress on FY22 evaluation
Progress made against the outcomes of the internal Board evaluation undertaken in FY22 is set out below:

To hold a strategy day for Directors.  To further embed Diversity 

and Inclusion throughout 
the organisation.

To further shorten and standardise 
papers for Board and 
Committee meetings.

Progress 
made in FY23

The format for a strategy day has 
been agreed. However, due to the 
change in Chair this will take place 
in FY24.

Agreed our Diversity and Inclusion 
strategy to 2025, and supported its 
rollout across the Group. Requested 
annual updates on the progress 
being made as well as regular 
review of the strategy to ensure it 
remains fit for purpose. 

The Company Secretary, with 
support from the Chief Executive 
and the Chair, has worked with paper 
authors to streamline content and 
make better use of Executive 
summaries. This process will 
continue to evolve during FY24.

FY23 Board effectiveness evaluation outcomes
Overall, the results of the evaluation were positive and showed that the Board continues to be run effectively. It is seen as being 
cohesive and comprising the appropriate balance of experience, skills and knowledge to implement the Group’s strategy over the 
short term. Board meetings operate in a spirit of openness, fostered by the Chairman, in which Directors are able to challenge 
and discuss openly ideas of importance to the Group, its strategy and risk.

Succession for all Directors, but in 
particular the Executive Directors, 
and members of Senior Management 
remains a key priority.

Progress 
made in FY23

Established an action plan 
and allocated more time to 
succession planning.

Consider increasing the number of 
Audit Committee meetings held 
during the year.

Consider increasing the number of 
private meetings with the Chief 
Financial Officer (who is relatively 
new to the business and whose 
agenda is evolving), and with the 
Head of Internal Audit due to the 
increased level work being undertaken 
around internal controls and 
assurance in readiness for the 
implementation of the audit reform 
recommendations.

Kept under review the time allocated 
to agenda items to ensure that the 
Committee had adequate time to 
consider and discuss each item 
appropriately.

Increased the number of private 
meetings with each of the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Head of 
Internal Audit to two per financial year.

Consider if there are any ways 
in which the Committee could 
change their overall approach to 
remuneration to better support 
the long-term sustainability of 
the business.

During the year, with support from 
PwC, the Committee has continually 
considered how to improve its 
approach to remuneration, in 
particular, how it can best support 
and retain employees within this 
cyclical business.

Board and Committee evaluation process for FY23 

Online questionnaires issued to Board and Committee members, and also to those who attend Committee meetings 
on a regular basis. 

The Company Secretary reviewed the responses received and prepared a consolidated report for each of the Board 
and its Committees to consider.

The reports were shared with each of the respective chairs.

Results were presented and discussed at the June or August Board and Committee meetings.

Actions for improvement were agreed for the next financial year, as set out below.

Stage 1

Stage 2

Stage 3

Stage 4

Stage 5

122

To hold additional deep dive and 
training sessions to support the 
Committee’s understanding of 
current and emerging topics, 
including the impact of potential 
changes to the various governance 
and audit landscape.

To continue to consider the structure 
of meetings to ensure that there is 
sufficient time allocated to address 
changes that may be required to the 
Committee’s remit in response to the 
implementation of any governance and 
audit proposals during FY24 or beyond.

To determine an agenda of deep dive 
and training sessions for FY24.

To review the annual agenda taking 
into account potential changes to the 
Committee’s remit that may be 
required and determine if the current 
structure remains fit for purpose.

Consider ways to streamline the 
metrics used for short and long-
term incentive schemes.

To revisit the rationale for including the 
metrics within the short and long-term 
incentive schemes and ensure that they 
continue to align to the Group’s strategy 
and ultimately remain fit for purpose. 
Any changes to the metrics for 
Executive Directors’ incentive schemes 
to be discussed with shareholders and 
voting proxy agencies prior to the 
change being put into effect.

Actions for 
FY24

To continue to assess the skills and 
experience required on the Board 
and its Committees and make 
changes to their composition as 
deemed appropriate, being mindful 
of the requirements for diversity 
on the Board. To continue with the 
succession planning meetings 
with the Chief Executive. 

Evaluation of individual Directors
The evaluation of the effectiveness of John Allan as Chairman was conducted by the Senior Independent Director with assistance 
from the Company Secretary in May 2023. John was seen as being supportive but challenging, managing meetings with professionalism 
and ensuring each Director had the opportunity to express their views. Despite his other commitments, John was seen to be available 
and flexible, maintaining a high level of engagement with the Company, management and members of the Board. During FY23, the 
Chairman held one-to-one meetings with each Director to assess the effectiveness of their contributions, the appropriateness of 
their experience and the effectiveness with which they utilised that experience in furthering the Company’s strategy. Any areas of 
improvement or training and development were agreed. There were no issues of any substance arising from these meetings.

Statement from the Chair of the Audit Committee
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee’s report for the 
year ended 30 June 2023. This sets out our work and how our 
responsibilities in relation to audit, risk and internal control 
have been implemented. In performing our duties, we have 
complied with the requirements of the Code and followed FRC 
best practice guidance. We work closely with our finance and 
internal audit teams, and with Deloitte LLP, our external auditor, 
which helps us to ensure that our internal control processes 
remain robust and continue to adapt, our financial reporting 
remains clear, and our critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty are appropriate.

Areas of focus FY23 
In last year’s report, I set out our priorities for this year and 
I am pleased to update these as follows:

Risk management and internal control 
During the year, the Committee continued to support the Chief 
Financial Officer, Mike Scott, in embedding the Group’s risk 
management strategy, including a reassessment of the Group’s 
principal risks, details of which can be found on pages 71 to 77. 

We have continued to monitor the rollout of the Group’s Risk & 
Internal Control framework (BRICk), as well as further projects 
to improve the internal control environment and business 
continuity planning and develop further the risk management 
process. This included updating our Group & Operational 
Finance Policy and BRICk, to further enhance our Internal 
Controls over Financial Reporting (ICoFR). 

The linkage of principal risks with mitigating controls and related 
assurance mapping is now a key foundation to the work of the 
Committee and the reporting undertaken on risk and control.

Restoring Trust in Audit and Corporate Governance
The Committee has continued to monitor the developments in 
the debate around Corporate Reporting and Audit Reform. The 
debate’s progress has been slow, nevertheless we have kept an 
eye on the potential for change and sought to build constructive 
ideas into the reporting and work of the Committee. Our draft 
Audit and Assurance Policy continues to evolve and the 
principles are guiding our approach to assurance on 
sustainability and non-financial statement reporting. The 
potential for further developments will be kept under review.

Legacy Properties
At each meeting management has updated the Committee on its 
assessment of the Group’s exposure to the risks derived from 
both fire safety relating to external wall systems (EWS) and the 
remediation required to reinforced concrete frames. In 
particular, careful consideration was given to whether any of the 
increased costs recorded in the year should have been 
recognised in the prior year, following which the Committee 
concluded that they all related to FY23.  Further, in view of the 
identification of new developments requiring investigation relating 
to reinforced concrete frames, the Committee received a report 
from management on the associated cause and costs. The 
Committee agreed the scope of an assessment of the controls in 
this area to be undertaken in the coming months. Estimating the 
cost to remediate EWS and reinforced concrete frames continues 
to be a highly judgemental and complex area as the Group undertakes 
to fulfil its commitment to do the right thing. The Committee’s 
priority is to ensure that the level and use of the relevant 
provisions and the related disclosures, including being classified 
as adjusted items, remain appropriate. 

Key areas of focus for FY24
We will continue to monitor and assess the potential impact 
of the changes for Governance and Audit emanating from the 
Audit Reform debate. We welcome the consultation on the changes 
proposed to the UK Corporate Governance Code and will be 
considering the cost of implementing these as we comment. 

We will continue to assess the provisions for legacy properties, 
in particular the judgements underpinning the provisions and 
their utilisation. We will receive the report from management 
on their further assessment of controls relating to reinforced 
concrete frames and consider any recommendations for 
improvement.

In light of the continuing increase in reporting and scrutiny over 
reporting on financial performance, risk, controls and, 
sustainability, we will review the annual cycle of the Committee 
and consider whether any enhancements or adaptations would 
be beneficial.

Audit Committee Report continued

Role and activity of the Audit Committee 
Membership and attendance at meetings 
Details of the members and attendance at each of the 
Committee’s scheduled meetings is shown on page 124, and the 
biographies and qualifications of the members are shown on 
pages 104 and 105. In compliance with the Code, the Committee 
is comprised exclusively of Non-Executive Directors, and each 
member is considered to be independent by the Company. 
The Chairman of the Board is not a member of the Audit 
Committee. The Board is satisfied that Jock Lennox and Jasi 
Halai have recent and relevant financial experience. Jock is a 
Chartered Accountant who has previously chaired several other 
listed companies’ audit committees. He has also been the Chair 
of the Audit Committee Chairs’ Independent Forum since 2016. 
Jasi Halai, Chief Operating Officer and an Executive Director at 
3i Group plc, whom we have recently welcomed to the Audit 
Committee, is a Chartered Management Accountant and has 
held a variety of posts at 3i, most recently as Group Financial 
Controller. She was also a NED and Chair of the Audit 
Committee at Porvair plc. As part of the effectiveness review, 
details of which can be found on page 123, the Nomination 
Committee was satisfied that the Audit Committee has the 
appropriate skills and experience relevant to the sector in which 
the Group operates. 

In addition, the Company Secretary, Head of Internal Audit, Group 
Director of Finance, Chair of the Board, Chief Executive, Chief 
Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and representatives 
from our external auditor, attended each of the Committee 
meetings. Other Executives and senior managers attended 
when appropriate for specific agenda items.

After each meeting, the Chair of the Committee reported to the 
Board on the business undertaken by the Committee and made 
recommendations to the Board as appropriate. The Committee 
met the Chief Financial Officer, the Head of Internal Audit and the 
external auditor separately and independently of management. 
In addition, the Chair of the Committee separately meets with the 
external auditor and key management and senior financial 
managers outside formal meetings.

Role and main activities undertaken by the Committee 
during the financial year 
The main role of the Committee is to assist the Board in 
fulfilling its governance obligations relating to the Group’s 
financial and non-financial reporting practices and its internal 
control and risk management framework. It follows an annual 
work programme to ensure that its roles and responsibilities 
are completed throughout the year. In agreeing the annual 
programme, the Committee considers the external 
environment, internal operation of the business and regulatory 
changes to ensure that all the main priorities are included. 

The Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its Terms of 
Reference, which can be found on the Company’s website at  
www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors/corporate-
governance. In addition to the tasks it carries out annually, the 
Committee carried out the following work during the year:

Priorities

Work carried out and outcomes

Integrity of 
Financial 
Statements and 
announcements

Considered management’s analysis of the costs associated with legacy properties and their presentation in the 
Financial Statements, concluding that they remain appropriately provided and disclosed. This included matters 
in relation to EWS; in England following the signing of the LFA in March 2023, in Scotland following the signing 
of Scottish Accord in May 2023, and also our commitments in Wales, each with differing commitments affecting 
their presentation in the accounts. In addition, matters in relation to the reinforced concrete frame review were 
considered and scrutinised. Particular consideration was given to management’s analysis that the increased 
costs appropriately relate to the current year, with which the Committee agreed.

Considered the carrying value of goodwill and concluded that no impairment was required.

Reviewed the level of third party assurance over the Group’s non-financial published information, including 
TCFD and certain climate-related information, and confirmed that it was appropriate. 

Reviewed the Annual Report and Accounts to ensure it appropriately messages the performance of the 
business. Ensured the style and messaging is an appropriate evolution from the prior Financial Statements 
and announcements, whilst being in line with the wider Board strategies & communications and the Group’s 
statutory requirements. 

Considered the use of APMs to ensure they properly reflected the underlying trading performance of the Group 
during the year and concluded that the APMs and the associated disclosures were appropriate.

Risk 
management 
and Internal 
control systems

Monitored improvements to the Group’s Risk Management Framework to strengthen the Risk Committee. 
This included the reassessment of the Group’s Principal Risks as set out on pages 71 to 77.

Monitored the progress of a Controls Optimisation Project to optimise, rationalise and improve our internal 
control framework and key internal controls across the business. 

Considered the new Group & Operational Finance Policy and BRICk and the ongoing programme of work 
to develop and enhance our Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICoFR). 

Received a report from management on the cause and cost of the recent experience related to reinforced 
concrete frames and agreed the scope of an assessment of the controls in this area to be undertaken in the 
coming months.

In light of uncertainties in the housing market during FY23, reviewed sensitivity analyses on a range of possible 
outcomes, including in sales rates and average selling prices and their impacts on the business as a going 
concern, its viability, and reviews of goodwill, land and work in progress for potential impairment.

Internal audit

Following the IIA assessment last year, the Committee reviewed progress against the recommendations, and 
reviewed the internal quality self-assessment carried out by the internal audit function against IIA standards 
for FY23, and concluded that the internal audit function continues to be effective. 

Challenged how the methodology for delivering significant business change projects should be assessed and 
how it was being applied, resulting in a review of the broader business change strategy and relevant roles and 
responsibilities. 

Approved the annual review and updates to the Risk Assurance Map setting out the assurance provided by each 
of the three lines of defence over the effective management of the Group’s principal risks. Reviewed the output 
of the annual fraud risk assessment including management controls in place to mitigate the risks identified.

External audit

Reviewed the outcome of the Group’s external audit quality indicator assessment. 

Oversaw the induction of the new Deloitte lead audit partner.

The Chair of the Audit Committee met with the Deloitte audit team to discuss their audit plan and risk 
assessment. 

Governance

Reviewed an update to the finance strategy presented by the Chief Financial Officer, advising on improvement 
options. The Committee will continue to monitor the finance strategy as it evolves.

Reviewed the new Document Retention Policy, including piloting the implementation of software to facilitate 
the identification of data which could be at risk of being outside policy.

FY23 Financial Statements 
Significant issues considered during the financial year 
The issues considered by the Committee to be the most significant (due to their potential impact on the performance of the Group’s 
activities) in relation to the Financial Statements during the financial year are set out below.

3. Financial reporting
The Committee reviewed the integrity of the Financial Statements 
of the Group and the Company, and all formal announcements 
relating to the Group and Company’s financial performance. 
This process included the assessment of the following primary 
areas of judgement and took into account the views of our 
external auditor. 

Significant issues considered by the Committee relating to the Financial Statements for FY23 comprise:

Issue

External auditor challenge  Management response

The external auditor 
attended valuation 
meetings, performed 
Group-level analytical 
reviews, and undertook 
other audit procedures 
to challenge the margin 
recognised for the year. 

Margin recognition
Development costs are 
allocated, on a site by site 
basis, between homes built in 
the current and future years. 
The Group’s site valuation 
process determines the profit 
margin for each site. This 
requires the estimation of 
future sales prices and costs 
to complete. Further detail is 
given in note 3 on page 191. 

The Committee considered: 

 ∙ feedback from senior management regarding 
their attendance at valuation meetings and 
their assurances on the efficiency and 
consistency of the approach on valuation 
throughout the business;

 ∙ management’s assumptions and estimates 
in the assessment of margin recognition 
based on site performance, in particular, 
sales prices and build cost, given the 
dynamic inflationary environment;

 ∙ ongoing enhancements made to the 

valuation internal control process following 
completion of the rollout of the new 
commercial valuation system and also 
BRICk internal controls framework; and

 ∙ the results of the Group’s internal audit 

reviews across the business.

Audit Committee comments

Based on this, the 
Committee was 
comfortable with the 
process and controls 
adopted by management 
around the estimation of 
future income and costs 
to complete, and thus the 
process by which the 
Group’s inventory is 
valued and the 
margin recognised.

Costs associated with 
legacy properties 
Estimations of cost provisions 
relating to remedial work 
associated with EWS and 
reinforced concrete frames, 
on legacy buildings, have been 
appropriately provided for 
and disclosed.

This is against the backdrop 
of Government guidance, 
industry regulation, and 
interpretation thereof, 
continuing to evolve, requiring 
the Group to adjust its 
response, similarly as the 
Group’s experience of the 
scope and cost of remediation 
also evolves. 

Further detail is given in note 4 
on page 192 and note 20 on 
pages 212 to 214.

128

The external auditor 
challenged the 
completeness of the 
basis for the estimated 
costs, the scope of 
buildings, contingency, 
assumptions relating to 
cost inflation, estimated 
timing of spend and 
discount rate.

Following the inclusion of further costs 
associated with EWS legacy properties as an 
adjusted item in the FY23 Income Statement, 
the Committee has reviewed and challenged 
the provision, assessing its utilisation and 
continued adequacy, and has agreed that 
the increase has been appropriately judged, 
recorded in the correct period, and that 
accompanying financial and contingent 
liability disclosures fairly reflect the 
associated risks and opportunities.

Based on this, the 
Committee was 
comfortable with the 
process and controls 
adopted by management 
around the disclosures 
and estimation of costs 
and provisions associated 
with legacy properties.

The Managing Director of the Building Safety 
Unit attended the Audit Committee at both 
half and full year end to further appraise the 
Committee, whilst also allowing the Committee 
to question and scrutinise as necessary.

Following the recognition of further reinforced 
concrete costs, the Committee considered the 
appropriateness of the costs recognised and 
the related disclosure, and whether such 
costs had been recognised in the appropriate 
financial year.

Fair, balanced and understandable considerations 
and conclusions
The Committee received a draft of the Annual Report and Accounts 
prior to its August 2023 meeting, together with supporting 
material from management and the external auditor. At the 
meeting, it considered and assessed the process undertaken 
in drafting the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts to determine 
whether it was fair, balanced and understandable.

 ∙ financial and management reporting systems under which 
financial and operating performance is planned on a three-
year basis and budgeted annually. Financial and operating 
performance is consistently reviewed against budget and 
forecasts at divisional, regional and Group levels on a monthly 
basis, variances are explored and, where appropriate, changes 
made; and the information is used in the preparation of the 
Annual Report and Accounts;

Considerations 
 ∙ Feedback provided by shareholders on the FY22 Annual 

Report and Accounts.

 ∙ Assurances provided in respect of the financial and non-financial 

management information. 

 ∙ The balance between statutory and adjusted performance 

measures. 

 ∙ The internal processes underpinning the Group’s reporting 
governance framework and the reviews and findings of the 
Group’s external legal advisers and external auditor. 

 ∙ A report from the Company Secretary, which confirmed that: 
i) the process involved collaboration between various parts 
of the Group, including the Group Finance team, Company 
Secretariat, Group Communications, Investor Relations and 
the Sustainability team; ii) the Annual Report and Accounts 
had been reviewed by the Executive Directors; and iii) the 
Company had received confirmation from its external 
advisers that the Annual Report and Accounts adhered to the 
requirements of the Companies Act, the Code, the Listing 
Rules and other relevant regulations and guidance.

Conclusions 
The Committee concluded that the  Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 June 2023:

 ∙ clearly, comprehensively and accurately reflect the Group and 

Company’s performance in the year under review; 

 ∙ contain an accurate description of the business model;

 ∙ appropriately reflect the Group and Company’s purpose, 

strategy and culture;

 ∙ includes consistent messaging and clear linkage between 

each of its sections; and

 ∙ includes KPIs, which are consistent with the business plan 

and remuneration strategy. 

Accordingly, the Committee recommended to the Board that 
the FY23 Annual Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable. The Board’s formal statement on the Annual 
Report and Accounts being fair, balanced and understandable 
is contained within the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
on page 171.

Internal controls and the risk management process 
The Committee monitors the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems, including their effectiveness, on 
behalf of the Board. The key aspects are as follows:

 ∙ a clear organisational structure with defined levels of 

authority and responsibility at all levels of the business;

 ∙ identification and review of principal operational risk areas to 
ensure they are embedded in the Group’s monthly management 
reporting system as routine aspects of managerial responsibility. 
Details of the risk management system and the principal 
risks are set out on pages 71 to 77; 

 ∙ assessment of compliance with internal control and risk 

management systems, including a consideration of controls 
over non-financial risks. This assessment is supported by the 
Group’s internal audit team, which is responsible for undertaking 
a risk-assessed annual audit plan, ad hoc audits and reporting 
to the Committee, and, if necessary, the Board, on the operation 
and effectiveness of those systems and any material failings. 
Following the recognition of additional reinforced concrete 
frame provisions, the Committee will review the control 
environment over complex building design in FY24;

 ∙ mapping of assurance procedures to the Group’s principal 
risks, to ensure that the mitigating controls are sufficiently 
robust; and

 ∙ consideration and approval of the Group’s tax position 

and strategy.

The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to 
a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in 
borrowing and debt profiles, Government policy, market prices, 
credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. There is a regular, 
detailed system for the reporting of daily cash balances and 
forecast cash flows from operations to Senior Management, 
including Executive Directors, to ensure that risks are promptly 
identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken. These 
forecasts are further stress tested at a Group level on a regular 
basis. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management 
programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other 
risks on its financial performance, for example limiting its 
exposure to institutions with high credit ratings. Financing 
activities are delegated by the Board to a centralised Treasury 
Operating Committee. Group Treasury operates according to 
treasury policies that are approved by the Board and the 
Treasury Operating Committee.

Development of an Audit and Assurance Policy
The Committee and the Board support the publication of an 
Audit and Assurance Policy in order to bring greater transparency to 
the assurance it receives in order to gain comfort over the 
Group’s management of risks, and over the accuracy of its 
reporting of both financial and non-financial information. 

During the year, the Committee reviewed a number of items 
which support our Audit and Assurance Policy. These included:

 ∙ a risk assurance map setting out assurance already in place, 
using the three lines of defence model, to identify any gaps or 
areas where improvement in assurance is required;

Audit Committee Report continued

Development of an Audit and Assurance Policy 
continued
 ∙ assurance mapping over the Group’s published financial and 
non-financial information which was reviewed and updated 
during the year. The Board made the decision to again appoint 
Deloitte to provide additional independent assurance over 
certain aspects of the Group’s climate-related disclosures, 
including TCFD and certain other non-financial information; and

 ∙ the completion of the annual detailed fraud risk assessment 
exercise to identify, consider, and assess fraud risks in place 
across the Group and the associated controls and assurance 
in place to mitigate and manage these. 

The Committee will continue to monitor the development and 
formalisation of the assurance in place across the Group’s risks, 
key internal controls over financial reporting and financial and 
non-financial published information, with the view to publishing the 
Audit and Assurance policy in due course. 

Whistleblowing 
The Group has a clear whistleblowing policy and procedure, 
which is communicated to the workforce. Concerns can be 
raised by employees with managers, or can be reported by 
anyone, anonymously if necessary, to a confidential and 
independent hotline. The hotline is available 24 hours a day, 
with any matters raised being notified to internal audit 
immediately by email. Matters requiring urgent attention 
(including corruption, human rights abuse and personal safety) 
are notified to the Head of Internal Audit by phone immediately, 
including outside business hours. The Head of Internal Audit 
reviews matters raised, and ensures each matter is investigated 
or refers them to other relevant functions across the business, 
such as the Safety, Health and Environment or HR teams, to 
investigate as appropriate. Any substantive issues are raised 
with the Chair of the Audit Committee as they arise. The Head 
of Internal Audit also updates the Committee on all significant 
whistleblowing incidents at each of its meetings. The 
Committee reviews the overall procedure, investigations and 
outcomes, as well as the availability and frequency of use of the 
whistleblowing hotline. The Chair of the Committee updates the 
Board on whistleblowing reports and investigations on a 
regular basis, and the Board reviews the whistleblowing 
arrangements and discusses the most significant issues 
as appropriate.

Internal audit 
Information regarding internal audit matters considered by 
the Committee are set out in the table of work carried out 
on page 127.

During the year, the Head of Internal Audit completed all 
recommendations and improvements from the IIA EQA which 
was undertaken during the previous year. This included the pilot 
of a guest auditor programme which allowed individuals from 
across the business to support the internal audit team with 
specialist technical knowledge and expertise in auditing certain 
areas of the business. The trial of the programme was successful, 
providing additional insight and knowledge to support assurance, 
and the programme will therefore continue to operate for the 
next year. The Head of Internal Audit conducted a self-assessment 
during the year in order to assess the effectiveness of the 
function against the required IIA standards and governance 
requirements and reported the results to the Committee, who 
concluded that the function continued to operate effectively.

The Committee again considered the reporting line of the Head 
of Internal Audit, and confirmed that it continued to be 
comfortable with the existing reporting line to the Chief 
Financial Officer given that the Head of Internal Audit had 
regular formal meetings with the Chief Executive and any 
issues are reported to the Chief Executive in a timely manner. 
They were also comfortable with the independent relationship 
between the Head of Internal Audit, the Chair of the Committee 
and the wider Committee. The Committee confirmed that they 
would continue to keep this reporting line under review.

External audit 
Audit performance and effectiveness
The Committee annually reviews the external audit plan and 
process. This year it again approved the audit of key risk areas 
earlier in the year to reduce pressure on the busy financial 
reporting period after year end. 

In FY22 Deloitte was appointed, after a thorough tender and 
interview process, to provide assurance over our TCFD and 
certain non-financial disclosures. The appointment and fees 
associated with this work are in accordance with our Auditor 
Independence and Non-Audit Fees Policy.

In forming its conclusion on performance and effectiveness of 
the external audit, the Committee reviewed amongst other 
matters:

Feedback from all stakeholders on the external audit. 

The external auditor’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan 
for FY23.

Reports highlighting the material issues and critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty that arose during the conduct of the audit. 

The external auditor’s objectivity and independence during 
the process, including its own representation about its 
internal independence processes.

The challenges raised by the external auditor during 
the audit.

The Chair of the Committee met with the leaders of the external 
audit team to assess their experience and understanding of 
Barratt, which were considered appropriate.

In assessing the effectiveness and performance of the external 
auditor, the Committee also approved the Group’s approach to 
assessing audit quality. As in FY22, a questionnaire was 
circulated covering five significant audit areas. A wide range of 
internal stakeholders were included across the Group’s senior 
leadership. All areas were rated as good, with some challenges 
identified in project management. The Deloitte team expect to 
address the highlighted areas of focus in FY24. 

During the audit, the external auditor challenged management’s 
judgements and assertions on the following matters in particular: 

 ∙ margin recognition;

 ∙ valuation and completeness of provisions related to legacy 
developments (EWS and reinforced concrete frames); and

 ∙ valuation and completeness of completed development provisions.

The Committee’s response to these can be found in the relevant 
section of the table of significant issues considered by the Committee 
relating to the Financial Statements on page 128.

The FY21 audit was subject to an Audit Quality Review, the 
progress of which was regularly reported to the Chair of the 
Committee, and has now been completed. The Chair of the 
Committee received a full copy of the findings of the AQR team 
and has discussed these with Deloitte. Some matters were 
identified as requiring improvement and the Committee has 
agreed an action plan with Deloitte to ensure these have been 
addressed in the audit of the Company’s FY23 Financial 
Statements.

The Committee concluded that the external audit process as a 
whole had been conducted robustly, the external audit team 
selected to undertake the audit had done so thoroughly and 
professionally, and the external auditor had applied sufficient 
experience and understanding of the housebuilding industry, 
consulted with experts as necessary, and is of sufficient size 
to conduct the audit. Deloitte’s performance as external auditor 
to the Group during FY23 was therefore considered to be 
satisfactory.

In addition, the Committee was satisfied that management had 
provided the external auditor with appropriate access to 
Barratt’s own people, systems, records and supporting 
information, whilst acting professionally and with appropriate 
challenge, enabling the audit to be conducted effectively.

Auditor independence and non-audit fees 
The Company’s Policy on auditor independence and non-audit 
fees is available at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors/
corporate-governance. With effect from 1 July 2021, the policy 
caps non-audit fees at 70% of the average audit fees over the 
previous three years. The Committee continually monitors the 
ratio of non-audit to audit fees to ensure that it does not exceed 
this cap. For FY23, non-audit fees (including audit-related 
assurance services) for the Company and its subsidiaries and 
JV’s were £230k, representing 24.3% of the total audit fee. 
Non-audit fees based on the average of the previous three 
years’ audit fees were 26.5%. Further details of the audit and 
non-audit fees incurred by the Group can be found in note 3 
on page 192. The non-audit fees were for work undertaken by 
the external auditor for the review of the half year report and 

also assurance provided over TCFD and certain non-financial 
disclosures included in our FY23 results.

This Policy also sets out the duties of the Committee relating to 
the protection of the objectivity and independence of the external 
auditor. The pre-approval levels and conditions required for 
different non-audit services that might be required from the 
external auditor, together with prohibited services, are detailed 
in the Policy. It also sets out restrictions on the recruitment of 
employees from the external auditor. The Policy was reviewed 
and updated in 2023, and is in line with the auditor 
independence rules of the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard 2019 
and includes the FRC’s whitelist of permitted non-audit 
services. There are no conflicts of interest between the 
members of the Committee and the external auditor.

The Committee requires written confirmation annually from 
the external auditor that it remains independent. For FY23, 
the external auditor provided a comprehensive report to the 
Committee verifying that it had performed its audit and 
audit-related services in line with independence requirements 
and explaining why it believed that it remained independent 
within the requirements of the applicable regulations and its 
own professional standards. The report also explained why the 
ratio of audit to non-audit fees, and the extent and type of 
non-audit services provided, was appropriate. The Committee 
conducted its own review and endorsed the external auditor’s 
conclusions on compliance with the Policy and independence 
of the external auditor.

Accordingly, the Committee was satisfied that both the work 
performed by the external auditor, given its knowledge of 
the Group, and the level of non-audit fees paid to it, were 
appropriate and did not raise any concerns in terms of 
our external auditor’s independence.

External audit continued
External audit tender 
Deloitte was first appointed as external auditor to the Group in 
2007, and was reappointed following a competitive tender in FY17. 
The Company has therefore complied with the provisions of the 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and 
Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 issued by the CMA on 
26 September 2014. Jacqueline Holden replaced Claire Faulkner 
as lead audit partner with effect from the FY23 audit following a 
period of transition. Jacqueline was selected after an interview 
process involving the Chair of the Committee, supported by the 
then acting Chief Financial Officer. The external audit team’s 
second audit partner was rotated for the FY20 audit and remains 
in place.

Under current regulations, the Company is not due to re-tender 
its audit until 2027. Given the continuing effectiveness of 
Deloitte in its role as external auditor, the Committee currently 
believes it is in the best interests of shareholders for Deloitte to 
remain in role and for a competitive tender process to be 
completed in time for the FY27 audit. The Committee will, 
however, continue to monitor Deloitte’s performance as 
external auditor and make recommendations accordingly. 

The Group has appointed UHY Hacker Young LLP as the auditor 
for certain of its subsidiaries and JVs with effect from the FY23 
audit. This appointment followed a rigorous tender process. The 
timing of this audit work follows completion of the Group audit 
and therefore has no bearing on the scope of Deloitte’s audit. As 

well as realising some efficiency, this step provides the 
opportunity for one of the so called challenger audit firms to 
gain experience.

Assessment of the external auditor

Having considered the external auditor’s performance, the 
Committee recommended to the Board that the external auditor 
remains independent, objective and effective in its role and 
therefore should be reappointed for a further year. On the 
recommendation of the Committee, the Board is putting 
forward a resolution at this year’s AGM to reappoint Deloitte as 
external auditor for a further year. The recommendation of 
reappointment of Deloitte is free from influence by a third party 
and no contractual term of the kind mentioned in Article 16(6) of 
the Audit Regulation has been imposed on the Company 
whereby there would be a restriction on the choice to certain 
categories or lists of auditors.

Safety, Health and Environment Committee Report continued

insufficient pedestrian/plant segregation being available at the 
location where the incident occurred. We were fined £8,000 and 
the sub-contractor £32,000. We took immediate action after the 
incident to address the circumstances that led to the breaches 
identified, including reinforcing our policy on site induction, and 
ensuring that contractors take appropriate steps to segregate 
workers from their plant movements. We continue to monitor 
these on a regular basis.

We recognise the importance of ensuring all who work on 
our sites have an effective induction and hold the relevant 
competencies for the role they are undertaking. Therefore 
this year we have further developed our successful Induction 
Manager App to enhance the process. This has proved effective 
in ensuring all individuals attending our sites are clear on what 
we will provide and do, and what is expected from them. We 
have also continued with our positive engagement with key 
members of our supply chain in reviewing safe systems of work 
and developing enhanced controls for their work activities.

During FY23 we further assessed the SHE culture within 
our business via a SHE Climate survey sent to employees, 
sub-contractors and suppliers, which was created by the 
Health and Safety Laboratories for the purposes of benchmarking 
Health and Safety culture in comparison with organisations 
across a number of sectors. The overall results were encouraging. 
We scored above the benchmark (compared with 130 companies 
in all sectors) in all eight categories, which placed us in the top 
5% of comparator companies. A particular strength that was 
noted, was health and safety communication and Management’s 
commitment to always act on safety concerns which is very 
encouraging. Detailed action plans are now being developed 
across the business to address those areas where there is 
room for further improvement with progress being monitored 
by the Committee. We intend to repeat the survey bi-annually 
going forward, and will endeavour to increase the participation 
from our supply chain in further surveys.

FY24 key priorities
Injury prevention remains a key area of focus for the business, 
with the aim of improving our IIR. There are further changes 
that we will be looking to make in terms of mental wellbeing and 
managing occupational health, and we are working with the HR 
team to improve business knowledge and awareness. The new 
Building Safety Act encompasses wide-ranging statutory 
requirements for high risk buildings and other elements of the 
built environment and we are looking closely at the detailed 
competency requirements included already and those arising 
from the anticipated secondary legislation. We are also 
committed to minimise the risks to the environment and so in 
FY24 a key focus area will be continuing to review and enhance 
our silt water management controls to ensure that 
contamination events are prevented.

I would like to thank the SHE team, our employees and 
sub-contractors for the great work that they undertake 
each day to keep our people safe.

Chris Weston
Chair of the SHE Committee

Role and activities of the SHE Committee
Membership and attendance at SHE Committee meetings
The membership of the SHE Committee and the attendance at each of its scheduled meetings is set out on page 133.

Only members of the SHE Committee have the right to attend meetings, however, other individuals may be invited, at the request 
of the Chair, to attend all or part of any meeting where it is deemed appropriate.

Role and main activities undertaken by the Committee during the financial year
The SHE Committee’s activities continue to remain focused on the prevention and mitigation of the key operational risks relating to 
health and safety, and the protection of the environment. By receiving reports and challenging those tasked with SHE performance 
where necessary, the SHE Committee helps the business to improve its SHE standards. It supports and oversees the direction and 
implementation of SHE Policy and procedures which encourage efficient working practices, prevention of injury and illness, and 
support our continuous improvement strategy and ongoing sustainability of the Group. 

The SHE Committee continues to work closely with the SHE Operations Committee, which is responsible for the implementation and 
oversight of the Group’s overall SHE improvement strategy on a day-to-day basis. The SHE Operations Committee reports directly 
to the SHE Committee. The Group Construction and SHE Director presents SHE update reports to each of these Committees and to 
the Board. The SHE Committee has at least one joint meeting with the SHE Operations Committee each financial year. In addition, 
the SHE Committee Chair is now invited to attend all SHE Operations Committee meetings. This enables the Committee and its Chair 
to enhance its understanding of the operational issues faced by the workforce, and to discuss them, and ways to improve them, 
directly with those responsible for day-to-day SHE management. 

The SHE Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its Terms of Reference, which can be found on the Company’s website at 
www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors/corporate-governance. In addition to the tasks carried out annually, such as a review 
of its Terms of Reference and approval of this report, the SHE Committee carried out the following work during the year: 

Priorities

Work carried out and outcomes

IIR

Continued to monitor SHE performance targets, key performance indicators and IIR, all of which are available 
on pages 17 and 24. 

Launched the campaign for increased Near Miss reporting in January 2023, to enable the business to have 
greater depth of insight into emerging risks and trends.

Considered, developed and launched a new SHE campaign to focus on slip, trip and fall incidents.

SHE training 
and compliance

Reviewed the outcome of a benchmarking exercise with HBF members on our Drugs and Alcohol Policy and 
approach to testing, which showed our Policy was robust compared to others in the industry, and agreed 
a number of changes on testing.

Considered and approved the detailed plan of work for the integration of Oregon and Gladman into Barratt 
SHE management.

Considered the outcome of the HSE Safety Climate survey, and agreed the actions arising from it.

Reviewed the new Health and Wellbeing strategy and requested a review of how to measure its effectiveness.

Considered and agreed a new policy on the arrangements in place for the security and protection of our 
construction sites.

Sponsored a review of the documentation site managers are required to complete during the lifecycle 
of a project and agreed a number of efficiencies which were implemented in FY23.

SHE management system
Our SHE management system continues to be accredited to the 
international standards ISO 14001 and 45001. We have reviewed 
the processes which site management are required to 
undertake and have received considerable feedback from site 
teams. Where possible, we have either enhanced the practical 
use of apps or amended forms. 

We are focused on having an effective process for near miss 
reporting. It is essential in our view to consider incidents that 
may not have caused injury or damage but had the potential to 
do so. This helps us to ensure that mitigations are in place to try 
and prevent these incidents from occurring again and from 
becoming an injury or causing damage.

Health and Safety Climate survey
The Health and Safety Climate survey was undertaken during 
the year with over 1,600 surveys completed and over 8,000 
individual comments captured. Our health and safety culture 
in particular was considered to be very strong, with positive 
comments regarding health and safety leadership and the 
strength of poster campaigns on site. Areas for improvement 
included simplifying the format and presentation of our SHE 
procedures and control forms, and ensuring that all members 
of the workforce pay enough attention to health and safety 
matters. Additional actions arising from the survey included 
reviewing our pre-start processes to ensure health and safety 
continues to be embedded from commencement and that we 
continue to learn from incidents through an effective 
communications process. Specific Regional action plans are 
also being developed and progress is being tracked through 
the SHE Operations Committee.

Statement from the Chair of the SHE Committee
I am pleased to present this report as Chair of the SHE Committee. 
The health and safety of our workforce, customers and the 
public, and the protection of the environment around our 
developments, remain a fundamental priority for the Group and 
is embedded within the day-to-day operations of the business. 
Overall, our site teams continue to be recognised for achieving 
high standards of health and safety. Our culture and approach 
has been further verified by achieving champion status as part 
of an assessment by Building Safer Futures, a non-profit 
organisation set up as part of the drive for improvements 
to building safety in the construction industry.

FY23 areas of focus
Injury and ill health prevention has remained a key area of focus 
for the business throughout the year. Following the reduction in 
the Group IIR in FY22, and despite the ongoing action plan for 
continuous improvement, the IIR has unfortunately increased 
this year from 262 per 100,000 persons in FY22 to 289 in FY23. 
Our analysis indicates that the primary contributing factor is 
slips and trips, which is reflected industry wide, and a further 
campaign has been put in place which is described below.

We have continued to review all working practices and 
considered enhancements to existing safe systems of work, 
especially around working at height and those activities 
involving ground workers. With effect from 1 July 2022, all 
ride-on dumpers of six tonnes or more operating on our sites 
were required to have an enclosed cab to protect the operator. 
We have worked closely with our sub-contractors to ensure that 
this new requirement can be adhered to.

During the year, a hearing took place in relation to an incident 
involving an employee of one of our sub-contractors that occurred 
within our West Scotland division in 2017. A dumper collided at 
low speed with the sub-contractor’s employee. The sub-contractor 
had not presented their employee to our site team for an induction 
on their first day, but based on strict liability and the fact the 
individual had not been inducted, we accepted responsibility as 
the Principal Contractor for this technical breach. In addition, 
both Barratt and the sub-contractor pleaded guilty to

Integration of Oregon and Gladman
Having consistent Health and Safety Standards across all of our 
Group Companies is very important. We have therefore worked 
with both the Oregon and Gladman teams on their Health and 
Safety integration which was completed for both organisations 
in FY23. Both organisations have now implemented SHE 
training requirements which are consistent with the rest of 
Group; they are capturing incident and near miss information 
using the incident app and are also being audited through the 
annual Divisional audit programme. They also both took part 
in the recent Safety Climate Survey.

Health and Safety training
We continue to develop our e-learning packages to support our 
existing training provision. The number of slips and trips has 
been a primary contributing factor to the IIR and a number of 
these have involved employees in sales roles. We have therefore, 
this year, launched a Sales e-learning module to ensure new 
sales team colleagues are familiar with our controls and that 
the sales environment is safe for colleagues and customers. 
The majority of slip incidents continue to be in construction. In 
co-ordination with other housebuilders, we are introducing a 
campaign on prevention of slip/trip injuries given that there has 
been an industry-wide trend in an increase in these types of 
incidents and therefore a common goal to improve.

Induction is a key control, and it is a mandatory requirement for 
individuals to complete the induction process and for a record 
to be maintained on our platform. Based on feedback from our 
site teams, we launched a new two-stage site induction process, 
requiring site workers to review a video highlighting our 
expectations of them and what they should expect from us. 
Competency cards are increasingly using smart technology, 
verifiable against the scheme database. Accessibility to the 
assessment at the end of the induction has been increased 
through the use of sub-titles and translations for those whose 
primary language is not English.

A full programme of Board visits and site visits by individual 
Board Directors has recommenced, with two sites visited by the 
full Board. The aim is for each Director to visit at least one site 
a year.

It is also important to us that we are engaging with our high risk 
contractors. Ongoing work with groundworkers includes SHE 
seminars in each division every six months, and we have now 
extended this to include our scaffolding contractors.

Occupational health and wellbeing 
The Group continues to promote occupational and mental health 
for all employees and others working on our sites. With support 
from the Group HR team, employees were given access to a 
variety of webinars, e-learning modules and newsletters, all of 
which contained guidance on staying healthy both physically and 
mentally. Further details of our health and wellbeing initiatives 
are given on page 38.

Environmental protection
We have a management system in place that is compliant with 
environmental standards. Prior to commencing on site, we 
undertake an assessment of the local environment and put 
plans in place to prevent contamination of any adjacent watercourses. 
These plans and controls are reviewed monthly and action is 
taken where enhancements or maintenance of the controls are 
required. We are also committed to further minimise the risks 
to the environment and so a key focus area will be to enhance 
our policies and procedures, in particular our surface water 
management plans, whilst continuing to ensure that they are 
effective and are closely monitored by our Operational teams.

Remuneration Report continued
Annual Statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee continued

Statement from the Chair of the Committee
I am pleased to present my report to you as Chair of 
the Committee. 

When considering the FY24 remuneration outcomes for the 
Executive Directors and in considering the targets for FY24, 
the Committee took into account, amongst other factors, the 
performance of the Group in FY23 and the market conditions in 
which the Group has operated (as explained in the Chief Executive’s 
Statement on page 23, and the Marketplace section on pages 20 
and 21).

Remuneration Policy 
Our existing remuneration policy was approved for a period of 
three years at our 2020 AGM and expires this year. As such, we will 
be presenting a slightly revised policy to shareholders for approval 
at our 2023 AGM. During the year, the Committee undertook an 
in-depth review of the current policy considering a number of 
factors including the expected economic environment over the 
next policy period, our strategy, and our experience with the 
current policy. Following discussions, the Committee believes that 
overall the policy remains broadly fit for purpose. It is therefore 
proposing that the only significant change to the policy, as 
previously communicated, will be with regards to bonus deferral 
for Executive Directors and Senior Management.

Currently, under the rules of the existing DBP, any bonus earned in 
excess of 100% of salary is deferred into shares. To bring the policy 
in line with shareholder expectations and best practice we will, 
from the date of the 2023 AGM, defer a fixed percentage of any 
bonus earned. Accordingly, for FY24, we have agreed that 
one-third of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares. This is 
in line with current arrangements under which an individual who is 
able to earn a bonus equivalent to 150% of salary defers one-third 
of their bonus at maximum. Our proposal therefore ensures that 
the same proportion of the annual bonus continues to be deferred 
when maximum opportunity is achieved, but also ensures that 
one-third of any bonus earned will be deferred for achievement 
below maximum. The rules of a new DBP which will be used 
to implement this new approach to deferral will be presented 
to shareholders at the 2023 AGM for approval.

Other minor amendments have been made to the policy to provide 
further clarity in respect of potential performance metrics used 
within the annual bonus and to ensure that the policy remains in 
line with best practice.

We believe that with these changes, the Remuneration Policy is fit 
for purpose and aligns the interests of our Executive Directors with 
those of our shareholders and with our business strategy. It also 
continues to drive appropriate behaviours for the long-term 
success of the Company. Details of these changes can be found 
on page 142.

FY23 performance and reward
The business has continued to deliver a strong operational and a 
good financial performance throughout the year. In particular, we 
achieved 17,206 total home completions (FY22: 17,908), despite the 
challenges posed by the increase in interest and mortgage rates 
and the continuing significant cost of living pressures faced by our 
customers. The Board is extremely grateful for the hard work and 
dedication of our teams and partners over the past year, despite 
these challenges. The outcome for the FY23 annual bonus scheme 
was 40.1% of maximum, with no bonus earned in respect of the 
adjusted PBT performance target. The 2020 LTPP award will vest 
at 19.6%. Further details can be found on page 161. 

The Committee carefully considered the incentive outcomes within 
the context of the underlying performance of the business, and 
ultimately decided that the outcomes were reflective of business 
performance. As a result, the Committee has not used any 
discretion to determine these outcomes and it has not adjusted any 
of the performance targets during the year.

2022 LTPP 
As highlighted in last year’s report, the Committee was mindful 
of the view of shareholders and proxy voting agencies that 
remuneration committees should seek to reduce the number of 
shares granted under a long-term performance award, where the 
Company’s share price has fallen substantially since the previous 
grant, to avoid potential windfall gains for Executive Directors. As 
such, at the time of grant of the 2022 LTPP, the Committee agreed 
to apply a reduction of 15% to the normal level of the award to avoid 
windfall gains given the decline in the Company’s share price since 
the previous grant in October 2021.

Pensions
With effect from 1 January 2023 the cash supplements in lieu of 
pension paid to David Thomas and Steven Boyes were reduced 
from 25% of base salary to a level equivalent to the wider 
workforce (currently 10% of base salary), in line with our 
previous commitments and the guidance from the IA. Mike Scott’s 
cash supplement was set at 10% of base salary from the date 
of his appointment.

FY24 remuneration
Cost of living support
We remain conscious that the cost of living continues to be high 
and is impacting our employees. In January 2023, we decided to 
pay a further £1,000 salary supplement, in equal monthly 
instalments to each of our employees below our senior leadership 
team (95% of our employees) for the six months to 30 June 2023. 
With effect from 1 July 2023, we ceased the salary supplement but 
applied a 4% inflationary increase for all employees below Board 
level, with a tiered additional increase, up to 6%, for those who 
received the salary supplement, meaning that on average a 5.3% 
salary increase was awarded to the wider workforce.

FY24 salary 
Having regard to the changes implemented for employees as set 
out above, and to the benchmarking data provided by PwC, the 
Committee decided to increase Executive Directors’ salaries by 
4%, which is lower than the average increase of 5.3% awarded to 
the wider workforce. The Committee believes that this increase 
is justified given the continued strength of our operational and 
financial performance, the ongoing competitive landscape we 
face across the sector, and to ensure alignment between the 
Executive Directors and the wider workforce. The Committee 
further believes that this level of increase is appropriate given 
the current economic circumstances in which we are operating. 
Furthermore, the Committee is comfortable that salary levels 
remain in line with peers. 

During the year, a committee of the Board comprising the 
Chair and the Executive Directors reviewed the Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees and concluded that an increase of 4% should 
also apply to the Non-Executive Directors’ base fee, and to their 
fees as members and chairs of the relevant committees. An 
increase of 4% was also applied to Caroline Silver’s fee as Chair 
to reflect that she took over as Chair earlier than anticipated 
and to ensure that her fee remained in line with that of John 
Allan’s. These increases are in line with those made to the base 
salaries of the Executive Directors and below that applied to the 
base salaries of the wider workforce.

FY24 annual bonus and 2023 LTPP
The performance measures for the FY24 annual bonus scheme 
are set out on page 156 together with the rationale for selecting 
them. The key change is the introduction of a Diversity & Inclusion 
target to reflect our business focus in this area. This target replaces 
the Trading Outlets measure. The Committee is of the view that the 
actual targets for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and 
will therefore disclose these with performance against them, in 
the FY24 Remuneration Report, in line with market practice.

The 2023 LTPP will be awarded to all eligible participants, 
including the Executive Directors, later this year. Under our 
Remuneration Policy, the Committee can make awards of up to 
200% of salary to Executive Directors. The Committee continues 
to believe that TSR, Absolute Adjusted EPS, Underlying ROCE and 
GHG Emissions Reduction remain the most appropriate measures 
to align the Group’s performance with strategy and the interests 
of stakeholders. Due to the continued uncertainty in market 
conditions at the time of approving this Remuneration Report, the 
Committee has not been able to finalise the financial targets for its 
incentive schemes. We anticipate that the financial targets will be 
agreed by no later than the end of November 2023. The details of 
the non-financial targets for the 2023 LTPP can be found on page 157 
and the strategic KPIs for each can be found on pages 16 to 17. 

The rules of the LTPP are due to expire in November 2023 having 
been in place for a period of ten years. A new set of rules will 
therefore be presented for shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM.

Shareholder engagement 
I wrote to our 20 largest institutional investors and the proxy voting 
agencies in May 2023 to gain feedback on the proposed changes to 
the Remuneration Policy, the remuneration outcomes for FY23 and 
our proposals for FY24. We received feedback from shareholders 
representing 10.3% of our issued share capital. 

The key topic of discussion was the introduction of the Diversity 
and Inclusion targets, whereby shareholders recommended that 
we ensure that these targets are measurable and aligned to the 
Group’s strategy in this area. The Committee confirms that this 
feedback has been taken into account when setting the specific 
Diversity and Inclusion targets and in determining how performance 
will be assessed. All shareholders who responded were very 
supportive of the FY23 outcomes, the FY24 remuneration proposals 
and the changes proposed to the Policy.

Employees and remuneration
Our 2022 Gender Pay Gap report was published in December 2022, 
along with our first Ethnicity Pay Gap report which we chose to 
publish voluntarily as part of our commitment to becoming a more 
diverse and inclusive business. Details of the reports, where to 
find them on our website and our work on improving diversity and 
reducing these pay gaps can be found on pages 37 to 39. 

We continue to seek the views of our Workforce Forum on our 
approach to pay for employees and Executive Directors during the 
year. Further details on the Workforce Forum and the matters it 
discussed during the year can be found on page 55. We continue 
to make an annual award of Barratt shares to employees below 
Senior Management to recognise their dedication, commitment 
and loyalty. Further details can be found on page 37. 

Reporting
Our Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 2023 
comprises three parts: this Annual Statement, our full 
Remuneration Policy, and the Annual Report on remuneration. 
Details of how we have applied the relevant requirements of the 
Code can be found throughout this Remuneration Report. 

Conclusion
Throughout the year, the Remuneration Policy operated as 
intended in terms of Company performance and quantum, 
and in line with the Code.

The Committee believes that the decisions it has taken in respect 
of FY23 pay outcomes and its proposed approach to remuneration 
for FY24 are in the best interests of its shareholders, align with the 
Group’s strategy, reflect the wider business and economic 
environment and are fair, reasonable and appropriate. I therefore 
hope that you will support the updated Remuneration Policy and 
the Annual Report on Remuneration, which will be proposed at the 
AGM in October 2023. On behalf of the Committee and the Board, 
I would like to thank you for your continued support of our 
remuneration framework.

Our remuneration strategy 
It is the motivation and engagement of our employees which 
makes our business operationally and financially strong. It is 
therefore imperative that our remuneration strategy appropriately 
rewards our employees for their performance against the Group’s 
key performance indicators, whilst delivering sustainable 
shareholder value. Our Remuneration Policy therefore aims to:

 ∙ promote the long-term sustainable success of the Company 

and be fully aligned with the performance and strategic objectives 
of the Group to enhance shareholder value; 

 ∙ attract, retain, motivate and competitively reward Executive 

Directors and Senior Management with the requisite experience, 
skills and ability to support the achievement of the Group’s key 
strategic objectives in any financial year;

 ∙ take account of pay and employment conditions of employees 

across the Group whilst reflecting the interests and expectations 
of shareholders and other stakeholders;

 ∙ reward the delivery of profit and the achievement of the return on 
capital employed target, whilst ensuring that Executive Directors 
and Senior Management adopt a level of risk which is in line with 
the risk profile of the business as approved by the Board;

 ∙ ensure that there is no reward for failure and that termination 

payments (if any) are limited to those that the Executive Director 
(or member of Senior Management) is legally entitled to; and 

 ∙ ensure that in exercising its discretion, the Committee robustly 

applies the aims above.

In developing its Remuneration Policy, the Committee has regard to:

 ∙ the Group’s purpose and strategic priorities, and ensuring that 

targets support the achievement of these;

 ∙ the performance, roles and responsibilities of each Executive 

Director and members of Senior Management;

 ∙ arrangements that apply across the wider workforce, including 

average base salary increases and pension contributions;

 ∙ information and surveys from internal and independent sources; 

and

 ∙ the economic environment and underlying financial 

performance of the Group.

Notes:

Minimum pay is fixed pay only (i.e. salary + benefits + pension). 

On-target pay includes fixed pay, 50% of the maximum bonus (equal to 75% of salary) and 50% vesting of the LTPP awards (with grant levels of 200% of salary).

Maximum pay includes fixed pay and assumes 100% vesting of both the annual bonus and the LTPP awards.

Maximum pay plus 50% share price growth is the same as maximum pay for fixed pay and annual bonus but assumes a 50% increase in the share price over 
the performance period for the LTPP.

All amounts have been rounded to the nearest £1,000. Salary levels (which are the base on which other elements of the package are calculated) are based on 
salaries as at 1 July 2023. The value of taxable benefits is the cost of providing those benefits in the year ended 30 June 2023. The Executive Directors are also 
permitted to participate in HMRC tax advantaged all-employee share plans, on the same terms as other eligible employees, but they have been excluded from 
the above graph for simplicity. The LTPP awards allow participants to receive dividend equivalents but these are excluded from the scenario chart, other than 
for the single figure bar.

The CFO’s replacement LTPP awards that are due to vest in October 2023 are included as LTPP in the FY23 remuneration. Dividend equivalents have been 
included for the LTPP single figure bar.

Remuneration Report continued
Directors’ Remuneration Policy

The Company’s current Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the “2020 Policy”), was approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM. 
A new Remuneration Policy will therefore be presented for approval by shareholders at the AGM in October 2023 (the “2023 
Policy”). We consulted with our major shareholders and the main institutional voting agencies on the proposed minor changes to 
our Remuneration Policy and its proposed implementation for FY24. If approved by shareholders, the 2023 Policy will take effect 
from the date of the 2023 AGM and remain in force for three years unless changes are required. 

The full version of the 2020 Policy can be found on pages 127 to 130 of the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts, which is available on 
our website at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors. A description of how the Company implemented the 2020 Policy in FY23 
can be found on pages 159 to 163.

Changes to Remuneration Policy
The Committee is only proposing minor changes to the Remuneration Policy, with all other aspects remaining unchanged. 
The minor amendments are to reflect best practice and governance requirements only. The table below summarises these changes. 

Area of policy

Changes to 2023 Remuneration Policy from the 2020 Remuneration Policy

Annual bonus

Underlying policy is unchanged, however minor drafting changes have been made to provide further clarity 
in respect of potential performance metrics.

DBP

Under the 2020 Policy, bonuses up to 100% of base salary are paid in cash with any bonus earned in excess 
of this (up to a maximum of 50% of base salary) deferred into shares under the DBP. To bring the policy in 
line with shareholder expectations and best practice it is proposed that, with effect from FY24, a fixed 
portion of at least one-third of any bonus earned by Executive Directors will instead be deferred into shares 
for a period of three years.

Shareholding 
requirements

Underlying policy is unchanged, however minor wording changes have been made to bring this policy in line 
with best practice.

Policy table
The proposed 2023 Policy is set out below. Details of how the proposed 2023 Policy will be applied for FY24 are set out on 
pages 156 to 158.

To help promote the 
long-term success of the 
Company.

Normally reviewed annually and fixed for 
12 months with any increases usually 
effective from 1 July.

To reward individuals 
based on the scope of 
the role.

The Committee considers:

 ∙ individual responsibilities, skills, 
experience and performance;

To attract and retain high 
calibre Executive Directors 
to deliver the 
Group’s strategy.

To provide a competitive 
salary relative to 
comparable companies 
in terms of size 
and complexity.

 ∙ the level of pay increases awarded 

across the Group (with the exception 
of promotions);

 ∙ the size and responsibility of the role;

 ∙ economic and market conditions; and

 ∙ the performance of the Group.

The Committee, when setting salaries, 
takes into account salary levels for 
similar positions in the housebuilding 
sector and within companies of a similar 
size to the Group.

The Committee has the discretion to vary 
salaries in the event there are changes 
to any of the above within the 12-month 
period for which salaries have been fixed.

Salaries are paid monthly in arrears.

There is no prescribed maximum 
annual increase. 

N/A

The Committee is guided by the 
general increase for the broader 
UK employee population but on 
occasions may need to recognise 
changes in the role and/or duties 
of a Director; movement in 
comparator salaries; and salary 
progression for newly appointed 
Directors. 

The Committee retains the right 
to approve a higher increase in 
exceptional cases, such as major 
changes to the Executive 
Director’s role/duties; new 
recruits; or internal promotions to 
the position of Executive Director 
whose salary was set lower than 
the market level for such a role 
and a higher increase is justified 
as the individual becomes more 
established in the role. In these 
circumstances a full explanation 
of the increases awarded will be 
provided in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.

Maximum opportunity

Description of performance metrics

The potential annual 
maximum bonus is 150% 
of base salary. 

The level of bonus 
payable at threshold is 
set annually but 
will not exceed 20% of 
potential maximum 
bonus (30% of salary).

50% of the potential 
maximum bonus (75% 
of salary) is payable  
for achievement of 
on-target performance.

Annual bonus

To motivate and 
reward Executive 
Directors for the 
achievement of 
demanding financial 
and non-financial 
objectives and 
key strategic 
measures over the 
financial year.

Variable 
remuneration allows 
the Group to manage 
its cost base by 
giving it the 
flexibility to react 
to changes in the 
market and any 
unforeseen events.

The Committee has absolute discretion as 
to whether or not to award a bonus and as 
to the level of bonus to be awarded up to 
the prescribed maximum.

The Committee annually sets financial 
and non-financial performance targets 
by taking account of the Company’s goals 
and budget for the relevant financial year. 

Group and individual performance against 
these targets is measured at the end of 
the financial year and the level of bonus 
payable is calculated at that point. This 
also takes into account the underlying 
financial and operational performance of 
the business relative to the sector (as 
noted in the column to the right). 

Up to two-thirds of any bonus earned is 
paid in cash and at least one-third of any 
bonus earned is deferred into shares under 
the DBP for a period of three years.

The Committee retains the discretion to 
decide whether or not to pay an annual 
bonus to an Executive Director who has 
handed in their notice and to determine, 
in respect of any employee who is a “good 
leaver”, whether any annual bonus earned 
should be paid in cash and not deferred 
into shares. 

Where the Committee believes that 
performance does not warrant the level of 
bonus determined, it may use its discretion 
to reduce the award (possibly to nil) as it 
deems appropriate. 

No Executive Director has any contractual 
right to receive a bonus. 

Annual bonus is not pensionable. 

The performance targets set are 
stretching whilst having regard to 
the nature and risk profile of the 
Company, its strategy and the 
interests of its shareholders. 

When setting bonus targets, 
the Committee considers the effect of 
corporate performance on ESG risks 
and sustainability issues generally 
to ensure that remuneration 
structures do not inadvertently 
motivate irresponsible behaviour.

The focus of the performance targets 
is to deliver profit growth and to 
ensure that the Company has an 
adequate land bank acquired within 
the constraints of its Balance Sheet 
commitments.

Performance measures may include, 
but are not limited to: 

 ∙ financial items (e.g. profit before 

tax, margin growth, net debt/land 
creditors; and land commitment), 
with a weighting greater than 
or equal to 50%; and

 ∙ non-financial items (e.g. quality 
and service, health and safety, 
diversity and inclusion objectives; 
and personal objectives). 

The Committee has the discretion to:

 ∙ choose appropriate measures for 

each award;

 ∙ vary the elements of each of these 
items, including targets, and the 
weightings of each component 
on an annual basis; and

 ∙ ensure that they remain aligned 

to the strategy of the business and 
to market conditions.

DBP

At least one-third of 
any annual bonus 
earned is deferred 
into shares and held 
in this plan for a 
period of three years 
and is normally 
subject to a continued 
employment 
condition.

The aim is to 
encourage long-term 
focus and to 
further align 
interests with those 
of shareholders and 
discourage excessive 
risk taking.

LTPP

Description of performance metrics

No performance conditions apply to 
the vesting of awards other than a 
continued employment condition.

Deferred shares are normally granted in 
the form of a conditional award (but may 
also be granted as nil or nominal cost 
options or forfeitable awards in 
accordance with the rules of the DBP).

Deferred shares will normally accrue 
dividend equivalents in cash or shares, 
which may be on a reinvestment basis, 
and which are subject to the same terms, 
including vesting date, as the deferred 
share award. 

Malus and clawback can be applied 
in certain circumstances to both the 
cash and deferred element of the bonus. 
For full details see pages 148 and 149.

At least one-third of any 
bonus paid is deferred 
into an award over 
shares under the DBP, 
unless the Committee 
determines otherwise 
in the case of a “good 
leaver”. 

The Committee retains 
the discretion to adjust 
the proportion of bonus 
deferred in exceptional 
circumstances.

In accordance with the 
rules of the LTPP, the 
Committee has the 
discretion to grant an 
award up to 200% of 
base salary to each of 
the Executive Directors 
in respect of any 
financial year of the 
Company.

LTPP awards: 

 ∙ are normally granted annually in the 

form of conditional awards or nil-cost 
options at no cost to the Executive 
Director (but may also be granted as 
nominal cost options or forfeitable 
awards in accordance with the rules 
of the LTPP); 

 ∙ are at the discretion of the Committee, 

taking into account individual 
performance and the overall 
performance of the Group; 

 ∙ are subject to the achievement of 

stretching performance conditions 
measured over three financial years 
with a subsequent two-year post-vesting 
holding period. Awards may therefore 
only be realised on conclusion of the 
five-year combined period; and 

 ∙ may, at the discretion of the Committee, 
accrue dividend equivalents in cash or 
shares, which may be on a reinvestment 
basis, and which are subject to the same 
terms, including vesting date and 
holding period, as the LTPP award. 
Any accrued dividend equivalent will 
be pro-rated, depending on the level 
of award vesting.

Malus and clawback can be applied in 
certain circumstances to the LTPP award. 
For full details see pages 148 and 149.

Any LTPP awards are subject to 
performance conditions, which are 
stretching and aligned with the 
Group’s strategy and the interests 
of shareholders. 

Financial performance conditions 
will have a weighting of at least 50%.

The performance conditions are 
set on the basis that they: 

 ∙ are realistic and attainable; 

 ∙ are for the long-term benefit 

of the Group; and 

 ∙ do not encourage inappropriate 

business risks.

The Committee has the discretion 
to determine the weighting of each 
performance condition on the grant 
of an LTPP award. 

No more than 25% of an award will 
vest at threshold performance (0% 
will vest below the threshold level) 
increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting 
for maximum performance.

Overall, the Committee must be 
satisfied that the underlying financial 
and non-financial performance of the 
Group over the performance period 
warrants the level of vesting 
as determined by applying the 
above targets. 

If the Committee is not of this view, 
then it is empowered to reduce the 
level of vesting (potentially to nil).

To further align the 
interests of 
Executive Directors 
to those

Executive Directors are required to build 
and retain a shareholding equivalent to 
200% of base salary in the Company’s 
shares within five years of the 
shareholding requirement coming into 
force or the Executive Director being 
appointed to the Board, whichever is the 
later. The share price used for the 
purposes of determining the value of the 
shares is that prevailing on 30 June of the 
given year. 

The Committee reserves the right to 
amend the percentage holding required by 
the Chief Executive and the other Executive 
Directors depending on market conditions 
and best practice guidance. 

Executive Directors are also subject to a 
post-cessation shareholding requirement 
of 200% of their salary or their actual level 
of shareholding at cessation of 
employment if lower (based on their salary 
and the share price at the date of cessation 
of employment). The Committee has 
implemented suitable measures to ensure 
continued enforcement of the shareholding 
requirement during the post-cessation 
shareholding period. The Committee 
retains the discretion to waive the post-
cessation shareholding requirement in

The remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors is set by the Board on the 
recommendation of a committee 
comprising the Chair and the 
Executive Directors. 

The Board sets the remuneration of 
the Chair.

Non-Executive Director fees must

Performance conditions and target setting
The Committee annually reviews the performance measures 
and targets taking into consideration a number of factors 
including the performance of the Group throughout the previous 
financial year, internal and external forecasts and consensus 
figures for the performance period and the Group’s strategy. 

The annual bonus scheme is measured against key financial 
(Adjusted PBT and Capital Employed) and non-financial metrics 
(quality and service, health and safety, and diversity and 
inclusion). Both the financial and non-financial measures are 
aligned to our strategy, and allow individuals to focus on the key 
factors that will help drive short and long-term operational and 
financial success of the business. 

The LTPP is assessed against measures that, focus on delivering 
attractive cash returns to our shareholders, align the Group’s 
performance with strategy and the interests of stakeholders and 
encourage efficiency throughout the business. 

Value delivered to shareholders is recognised through relative 
TSR, which is measured against both the 50+/50- FTSE group and 
a housebuilder index. This ensures that strong returns are delivered 
against an appropriate size group of companies and an index of 
our peers. Adjusted EPS and underlying ROCE ensure that we are 
efficiently and effectively managing the business, whilst aligning 
the Executive Directors with the interests of shareholders. GHG 
emissions reduction targets ensure we remain on track to achieve 
our published sustainability commitments.

Targets are set within the context of both internal and external 
forecasts and are designed to be appropriate within the context 
of the Group’s strategic objectives and historical and expected 
performance levels. The performance targets are designed to 
be sufficiently stretching in order to ensure that maximum 
payout is only achieved for delivering exceptional performance.

Guidelines on responsible investment disclosure
In line with the IA’s Guidelines on Responsible Investment 
Disclosure, the Committee is satisfied that the incentive structure 
and targets for Executive Directors do not raise any ESG risks 
by inadvertently motivating irresponsible or reckless behaviour. 
The Committee considers that no element of the remuneration 
package will encourage inappropriate risk taking within 
the Company.

Committee discretion
The areas of the Policy over which the Committee has discretion 
are included in the policy table set out on pages 142 to 147. 
However, we have summarised the key discretions below:

 ∙ amendment of salary or the award of higher increases in 

exceptional circumstances;

 ∙ variation of benefits offered to secure new appointments or 

retain existing Executive Directors;

 ∙ whether or not to make a bonus award and whether payment 
should be made to anyone who has handed in their notice 
to leave the business;

 ∙ what performance conditions should be attached to annual 

bonus and LTPP awards and the weighting of each to be applied;

 ∙ determining the timing of awards and/or payments, including 

grant, vesting or release dates;

 ∙ determining the quantum of awards and/or payments 

(within the limits set out in the policy table on pages 142 to 147);

 ∙ determining the application of dividend equivalents, whether 
they should be issued in shares, including on a re-investment 
basis, or cash and retaining the ability to adjust the amount paid; 

 ∙ determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment of 
performance or such other factors as it considers appropriate;

 ∙ the settlement of any share awards in cash in exceptional 

circumstances;

 ∙ making the appropriate adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. change of control, rights issues, 
corporate restructuring events, and special dividends);

 ∙ determining “good leaver” status for incentive plan purposes 
and applying the appropriate treatment, including the timing 
of any vesting;

 ∙ determining the extent to which malus and/or clawback 

should apply to any award;

 ∙ determining the level of post-cessation shareholding the 

Executive Directors need to hold; and

 ∙ determining the exceptional circumstances under which the 
post-cessation shareholding requirements can be waived.

If an event occurs which results in the annual bonus plan or 
LTPP performance conditions and/or targets being deemed no 
longer appropriate (e.g. a material acquisition, divestment or 
wider market or economic circumstances that the Committee 
deem relevant), then the Committee will have the ability to 
adjust appropriately the measures and/or targets, and/or to 
alter the weighting of the measures. The Committee also has 
the discretion to increase or decrease any annual bonus or 
LTPP awards (potentially reducing them to nil) in the event that 
the formulaic outcome is not reflective of overall Company 
performance or aligned with the underlying financial and/or 
non-financial performance of the Group, or where 
environmental incidents, health and safety incidents or other 
wider economic or market circumstances warrant an adjustment 
to the final outcome in order to determine a reasonable and 
appropriate result. The Committee also retains discretion to 
adjust LTPP vesting outcomes to avoid windfall gains in the 
event the share price has fallen materially before a given award 
is made. Any exercise of discretion will be fully explained 
in the corresponding year’s Remuneration Report.

Malus and clawback 
Malus and clawback is applicable to any annual bonus paid 
or deferred for a period of three years beginning on the date of 
the award and to any share awards granted under the LTPP for 
a period of five years beginning on the date of the award. 

In the case of malus, the Committee may, at any time prior to the 
payment of any bonus or any deferred or LTPP shares becoming 
vested shares, decide to reduce the amount of bonus to be paid 
and/or reduce the number of deferred or LTPP shares (including 
to nil) on such basis as it considers to be fair, reasonable and 
proportionate where, in the opinion of the Committee, there 
are exceptional circumstances.

In the case of clawback, the Committee may decide that the 
individual to whom the payment was made and/or deferred  
and/or LTPP shares were granted shall be subject to clawback, 
on such basis as it considers to be fair, reasonable and 
proportionate, if in relation to the bonus paid and/or the 
deferred or LTPP shares that have vested, in the opinion of 
the Committee there are exceptional circumstances.

148

Exceptional circumstances include (without limitation):

a. 

b. 

c. 

 a material misstatement in the published results of 
the Company or Group or any member of the Group;

 an error in assessing any applicable performance 
conditions or the amount of bonus to be paid and/or the 
number of deferred or LTPP shares subject to an award;

 the assessment of any applicable performance conditions 
and/or the amount of bonus to be paid and/or the number 
of deferred or LTPP shares subject to an award being based 
on inaccurate or misleading information;

d. 

 serious misconduct on the part of an individual(s);

e. 

f.  

 a breach by the individual of any restrictive, confidentiality, or 
non-disparagement covenants or other similar undertakings, 
whether contained in the individual’s employment contract 
and/or settlement agreement and/or any other agreement 
between the individual and any member of the Group;

 where, as a result of an appropriate review of accountability, 
the Committee determines that an individual(s) has caused 
wholly or in part a material financial loss for the Group as 
a result of:

− 

− 

 reckless, negligent or wilful actions or omissions; or

 inappropriate values or behaviour;

g. 

 material breach of health and safety or 
environmental regulations;

h. 

 material failure of risk management;

i. 

j. 

 a member of the Group is censured by a regulatory body 
or suffers, in the Committee’s opinion, a significant 
detrimental impact on its reputation, provided that the 
Committee determines that, following an appropriate review 
of accountability, an individual(s) was responsible for, or had 
management oversight over, the actions, omissions or 
behaviour that gave rise to that censure or detrimental 
impact; or

 the Company or entities representing a material proportion of 
the Group become insolvent or otherwise suffer a corporate 
failure so that ordinary shares in the Company cease to have 
material value, provided that the Committee determines, 
following an appropriate review of accountability, that an 
individual(s) should be held responsible (in whole or in part) 
for that insolvency or failure.

Where clawback is to be applied, the Committee may 
determine that:

 ∙ any bonus will be retrospectively recalculated and, if bonus 
monies have been paid, the relevant individual(s) will be 
required to reimburse the Company for an amount up to the 
total amount of the original net bonus paid less any bonus 
that the Committee determines would have been paid 
regardless of the event in question; 

 ∙ that the number of deferred or LTPP shares be 

retrospectively recalculated. If the deferred or LTPP shares 
have been granted, the number of shares awarded will be 
reduced accordingly. If the deferred or LTPP shares have 
vested and shares have been issued or transferred to the 
individual(s), they will be required to repay the value of the 
relevant number of shares based on the Company’s closing 
share price as at the date the shares were issued; and

 ∙ malus will be applied to an alternative unvested award to 
satisfy a clawback event on a vested/released award.

Recruitment of Executive Directors 
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is 
to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the 
appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role. The 
remuneration package for any new recruit will take into account 
the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for a 
candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the 
relevant individual. Internal pay relativities and the terms and 
conditions of employment of the new and existing Executive 
Directors will be considered to ensure fairness between them. 
The Committee will determine the remuneration for any new 
Executive Directors in accordance with the Remuneration Policy 
then in force and will take into consideration each of the 
following elements:

Salary and benefits – the Committee will take into account 
market data for the scope of the job, the remuneration for the 
relevant role, the salaries of and benefits provided to existing 
Executive Directors, the new Executive Director’s experience, 
location and current base salary and benefits package. In the 
event an Executive Director is recruited at below market levels, 
their base salary may be re-aligned over a period of time (e.g. 
two to three years) subject to their performance in the role. The 
Committee may also agree to cover relocation costs if it 
deems it appropriate. 

Pension – Executive Directors will be auto-enrolled from the 
date of recruitment unless they opt out. If an Executive Director 
chooses to opt out they may elect to receive a pension 
supplement in cash. The Committee has discretion to determine 
the level of pension supplement to be awarded to the Executive 
Director, up to a maximum which is equivalent to the percentage 
normally offered to the wider workforce. Alternatively, the 
Executive Director may choose to join the defined contribution 
money purchase pension plan provided they meet all of the 
eligibility criteria. The Executive Director also has the option to 
receive some of their pension entitlement in cash and have the 
remainder contributed to the defined contribution money 
purchase pension plan, provided this does not, in aggregate, 
exceed the agreed percentage. 

Annual bonus and LTPP – new Executive Directors may be able 
to participate in the annual bonus scheme and the LTPP on 
terms to be considered by the Committee on a case by case 
basis. Any award made to a new Executive Director will usually 
be on the same terms as set out in the policy table on pages 144 
and 145. The level of the award will be no greater than that made to 
existing Executive Directors (150% of salary for the annual 
bonus and 200% of salary for the LTPP) and will be pro-rated 
based on the number of weeks remaining outstanding of the 
relevant performance period. 

Buyout of existing entitlements – the Committee may also 
consider buying out existing entitlements that an individual 
would forfeit on leaving their current employer, again this would 
be reviewed on a case by case basis. In determining any 
potential awards to be granted to a new recruit, the Committee 
will consider the relative levels of certainty and balance of fixed 
to variable compensation in the forfeited package in totality, 
including salary, benefits and other components. The Committee 
would however in all cases seek validation of the value of any 
potential entitlement that is being forfeited and take into 
account the proportion of any performance period remaining 
of the award, the type of award (i.e. cash or shares) and the 
performance achieved (or likely to be achieved). Replacement 
share awards, if any, will seek to reflect (to the extent possible) 
the value, degree of conditionality and form of award of the 
entitlement forgone.

Remuneration Report continued
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued

Recruitment of Executive Directors continued
In structuring any buyouts, existing arrangements will be used 
where possible, however, the Company may also make use of 
the flexibility provided by the UKLA Listing Rules to make 
awards without prior shareholder approval. Buyouts may 
therefore fall outside normal policy maximum levels.

Where an individual is recruited internally to the position 
of Executive Director, the Company will seek to honour any 
pre-existing contractual commitments, taking into account 
the remuneration of the existing Executive Directors.

Executive Directors’ service contracts 
Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are 
included in Table 1 below and their remuneration for FY23 
is shown in Table 7 on page 159. The Company’s policy is for 

Table 1 – Executive Directors’ service contracts

all Executive Directors’ (including new appointments) service 
contracts to be for a rolling 12-month period, which can be 
terminated by 12 months’ notice given by either the Company or 
by the Executive Director at any time. The service contract 
normally entitles an Executive Director to the provision of a 
company car, annual medical screening, permanent health 
insurance, private medical insurance, some telephone costs, 
contributions to the cost of obtaining independent financial 
and tax advice and payment of legal fees on cessation of 
employment. The Committee regularly reviews contractual 
terms for Executive Directors to ensure that they continue 
to reflect best practice.

All Executive Directors’ appointments and subsequent 
reappointments are subject to election and annual re-election 
by shareholders at the Company’s AGM.

The service contracts for Executive Directors are available for inspection by any person at the Company’s registered office during 
normal office hours and on the Company’s website: www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors.

Executive Directors’ policy on payment on loss of office
There are no specific provisions for compensation on early 
termination (except for payment in lieu of holidays accrued but 
untaken) or loss of office due to a change of ownership of the 
Company. The Committee reserves the right to make additional 
payments where such payments are made in good faith: (a) in 
discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages 
for breach of such an obligation); or (b) by way of settlement 
or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the 
termination of an Executive Director’s office or employment. The 
Committee may also provide a contribution towards reasonable 
legal costs and the provision of outplacement services. 
The Committee will apply mitigation against any contractual 
obligations as it deems fair and reasonable and will seek 
legal advice on the Company’s liability to pay compensation. 
The Committee may also seek to reduce the level of any 
compensation payable and will take into account, amongst other 
factors, the individual’s and the Group’s performance; 
the Director’s obligation to mitigate their own loss; and the 
Director’s length of service when calculating termination 
payments. The Committee reserves the right to phase any such 
payments if it deems that it is appropriate to do so. Any amount 
that the Committee decides to pay an Executive Director will be 
based on the main elements of executive remuneration namely, 
base salary, annual bonus and LTPP (subject to the Committee’s 
discretion), benefits and pension. Regarding salary, benefits 
and pension, there will be no compensation in the event of 
termination by the Company due to gross misconduct. In other 
circumstances, Executive Directors may be entitled to receive 
notice pay or payment in lieu of notice. The Committee also 
takes into account the rules of the annual bonus and LTPP 
schemes when determining any payments for loss of office 
as follows: 

Annual bonus – in accordance with the provisions contained 
within the service contracts, Executive Directors are not usually 
entitled to any bonus payments (other than in circumstances 
where they are deemed by the Committee as a “good leaver”, 
which includes, but is not limited to, redundancy, retirement, ill 
health, disability, death or any other circumstances which the 
Committee may decide), unless they remain employed and are 
not under notice as at the payment date. The default position 
will be that such payment will be pro-rated depending on the 
proportion of the bonus period worked by the relevant individual 
unless the Committee decides otherwise. Any bonus payment to 
the leaving Executive Director will normally be paid entirely in 
cash. The Committee retains the ultimate discretion to make 
bonus payments and determine the basis on which they are 
made and their value, taking into account the individual 
circumstances of the departure, the treatment of other 
incentive awards and the performance of the individual.

Deferred bonus – if the Executive Director is deemed to be a 
“good leaver” (as defined above), their deferred share awards 
will vest on the normal vesting dates unless the Committee, in 
its discretion, determines that they will vest on an earlier date 
(other than in the case of death when deferred share awards 
will vest immediately, unless the Committee, in its discretion, 
determines that they will vest on the normal vesting dates). 
In all other cases, the award of deferred shares will lapse 
immediately on the date that the Executive Director’s employment 
with the Company ends and there is no entitlement to any 
compensation for the loss of shares. In the case of vested 
nil-cost options, any leaver, other than an employee who has 
been summarily dismissed) may exercise their option within 
12 months of their cessation date.

 ∙ Executive Directors and some members of Senior 

Management may opt to receive a cash supplement in lieu 
of pension. The cash supplement or employer’s contribution 
rate for all Executive Directors will be at the maximum rate 
of employer’s contribution for the wider workforce, currently 10%; 

 ∙ Executive Directors are able to participate in the LTPP. A number 
of select employees at Senior Management level may also be 
invited to participate in the LTPP at the Committee’s discretion, 
with grants based on a combination of performance share 
awards and restricted share awards; and

 ∙ in July 2023, and over the previous five financial years, 

employees below Senior Management have been awarded 
a smaller number of shares under an employee long-term 
incentive plan. This award was not available to Senior 
Management or Executive Directors.

In general, these differences arise from the development of 
remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the 
various categories of individuals. They also reflect the greater 
emphasis placed on performance-related pay for 
Executive Directors.

Performance scenario charts
Performance scenario charts setting out policy minimum, 
on-target, maximum and maximum plus 50% share price 
growth for FY24, are shown on page 140, along with the single 
figure outcome for FY23. The figures are split by the different 
elements of pay.

Non-Executive directorships 
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted 
to accept one Non-Executive directorship outside the Company 
and retain any fees received from such a position. Board 
approval will not be given for any Non-Executive position where 
such appointment would lead to a material conflict of interest or 
would have an effect on the Director’s ability to perform their 
duties to the Company.

Chair and Non-Executive Directors’ letters 
of appointment
The Chair and each of the Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed for an initial three-year term under terms set out in a 
letter of appointment. Their appointments can be terminated by 
the Board without compensation for loss of office subject to the 
notice periods in their respective letters of appointment. The 
notice periods, applicable from either party, are three months 
for the Chair and one month for each of the Non-Executive 
Directors. The Chair and each of the Non-Executive Directors 
usually serve a second three-year term subject to performance 
review and can serve a further term of three years subject to 
rigorous review by the Chair and the Nomination Committee. 

LTPP – under the rules of the LTPP, unless the Executive Director 
is deemed by the Committee to be a “good leaver” (as defined on 
page 150) any unvested LTPP awards held by them will lapse on 
cessation of their employment. For “good leavers”, the Committee 
would normally pro-rate the number of awards for time, 
measuring performance over the original performance period 
and vesting shares at the end of the vesting period. The Committee 
has discretion to test performance at an earlier date, shorten 
the vesting period and/or disapply time pro-rating. Any exercise 
of discretion would be explained in full to shareholders in the 
following year’s Remuneration Report. Following the vesting of 
each award, the normal post-vesting holding period will apply, 
unless the Committee determines otherwise.

Corporate events
In the event of a change of control of the Company, 
the Committee may determine that:

 ∙ annual bonus awards for the year during which the change of 
control occurred may either continue to be determined on the 
basis of the whole year or may be pro-rated to the date of the 
change of control;

 ∙ unvested deferred bonus awards will vest on the change of 
control, unless the Committee agrees with the acquiring 
company that they will be exchanged or replaced with 
equivalent awards over shares in another company, 
continuing to their normal vesting date; and

 ∙ unvested LTPP awards will vest on the date of the change 

of control, subject to time pro-rating (unless the Committee 
considers it appropriate to disapply time pro-rating) and 
the Committee’s assessment of the extent to which the 
performance conditions have been achieved on such basis as 
it may determine, unless the Committee agrees with the 
acquiring company that they will be exchanged or replaced 
with equivalent awards over shares in another company, 
continuing to their normal vesting date and subject to the 
same or equivalent performance conditions.

In the event of a demerger, distribution (other than an ordinary 
dividend) or other transaction which would affect the current or 
future value of any award, the Committee may allow awards to 
vest on the same basis as for a change of control described 
above. Alternatively, an adjustment may be made to the number 
of shares if considered appropriate.

Differences between Executive Directors’ and 
employees’ remuneration
The following differences exist between the Company’s Policy 
for Executive Directors’ remuneration as set out in the Policy 
table on pages 142 to 147 and its approach to the payment of 
employees generally:

 ∙ a lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity may 

apply to employees other than the Executive Directors. All 
employees, including Executive Directors, are subject to 
similar performance targets; however, the weightings against 
the various targets may vary;

 ∙ for the Executive Directors and some members of Senior 

Management, up to two-thirds of any bonus earned is paid 
in cash and the remainder is deferred into shares under 
the DBP for a period of three years;

Gifts to Directors on leaving employment 
The Committee reserves the discretion to approve gifts to long-serving Directors who are retiring or who are “good leavers” e.g. 
those leaving office for any reason other than dismissal or misconduct. The value of the gift for any one Director shall be limited to 
a maximum of £5,000 (excluding any tax or VAT liability). Where a tax or VAT liability is incurred on such a gift, the Committee has 
the discretion to bear the cost of such liability on behalf of the Director in addition to the maximum limit. 

Legacy arrangements 
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of office (and to exercise any 
discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the 2023 Policy set out 
above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the date the Company’s first remuneration policy came into effect; (ii) 
before the 2023 Policy came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the remuneration policy in 
force at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director and, in the opinion of the 
Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming or having been a Director of the Company. For these 
purposes “payments” includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, 
the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award is granted.

Process for determining the Remuneration Policy
The process used to formulate the remuneration policy was as follows:

Stage 1
Remuneration consultant benchmarks best practice to help the Committee determine areas of focus.

Stage 2
Remuneration consultant and management provide detailed insight into the areas of focus to determine how the policy might 
be amended and implemented annually over its life.

Stage 3
Committee discusses and approves the proposed policy, taking into account the remuneration of the wider workforce.

Stage 4
Chair of the Committee consults with shareholders and main investor representative bodies to obtain their views.

Stage 5
Feedback from the consultation is considered by the Committee and a final updated policy is approved.

Stage 6
Final policy is disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts and presented to shareholders for approval at the AGM.

As part of this process, the Committee considers the budgeted salary increases and other remuneration arrangements 
and employment conditions for all employees when determining remuneration for the Executive Directors.

It is expected that future salary increases for the Executive Directors will be no more than that given to the wider workforce, except 
in exceptional circumstances, such as where a recently appointed Executive Director’s salary is increased to reflect their growth in 
the role over time or where significant additional responsibilities are added to the role.

As a key principle, management provides the Committee with visibility of the potential impact of proposed changes to the Executive 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy on the wider employee population.

How the Committee has addressed the requirements of the Code in determining Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
and practices

Code requirement

Clarity – remuneration arrangements should be transparent 
and promote effective engagement with shareholders and 
the workforce. 

Simplicity – remuneration structures should avoid complexity 
and their rationale and operation should be easy to understand. 

Variable remuneration for any year is set out clearly in the prior 
year’s Annual Report, together with performance targets (unless 
they are deemed to be commercially sensitive). Outcomes are 
aligned with strategic objectives through the use of appropriate 
performance targets, which align them with shareholder 
interests and the Group’s strategy and provide for the long-term 
success of the Company, in the interest of the workforce and 
other stakeholders. 

The Company operates a UK market standard approach to 
remuneration which is familiar to stakeholders. Performance 
targets are readily understandable and published as part of the 
year-end results.

Risk – remuneration arrangements should ensure reputational 
and other risks from excessive rewards, and behavioural risks 
that can arise from target-based incentive plans, are identified 
and mitigated.

The Committee has discretion to ensure that variable pay 
outcomes are in line with Company and individual performance. 
Share awards are subject to post vesting holding periods, and 
malus and clawback as set out on pages 148 and 149.

Predictability – the range of possible values of rewards to 
individual Directors and any other limits or discretions should 
be identified and explained at the time of approving the policy.

Proportionality – the link between individual awards, the 
delivery of strategy and the long-term performance of the 
company should be clear. Outcomes should not reward 
poor performance.

Alignment with culture – incentive schemes should drive 
behaviours consistent with company purpose, values 
and strategy. 

Minimum, on-target and maximum outcomes for Directors are 
shown annually in this report (see page 140). Limits and 
discretions for each type of reward are explained in the policy 
table which can be found on pages 142 to 147. 

The Company’s incentive plans reward the successful 
implementation of strategy through the alignment of 
performance targets with strategic KPIs. The performance 
underpin which applies to both the annual bonus and LTPP 
outcomes ensures that poor performance is not rewarded. The 
Committee also has discretion to override formulaic outcomes.

Our remuneration strategy ensures that performance targets do 
not encourage inappropriate behaviours. The targets that are 
selected help align the interests of the workforce with those of 
the Company’s purpose and strategy as illustrated on page 141. 

Statement of consideration of pay and employment conditions elsewhere across the Group
The level for all employees’ salaries is determined with reference to the rate of inflation, salaries for similar positions throughout 
the industry and general themes and trends in respect of remunerating employees. In determining the Policy for Executive 
Directors’ remuneration, and in determining the annual increase in base salary, the Committee takes into consideration the pay 
and employment conditions of all employees across the Group. While the Company did not explicitly consult with employees when 
drawing up the Policy, during the year, the Workforce Forum discussed remuneration strategy, including executive reward strategy, 
and was asked for feedback for management. 

The Company also operates a Sharesave scheme and makes conditional awards of shares to all employees. This enables all 
employees to become shareholders in the Company, and to comment on the Group’s Policy in the same way as all of our 
other shareholders. 

To build the Committee’s understanding of reward arrangements applicable to the wider workforce, it is provided with data on 
the remuneration structure for senior management levels below the Executive Directors, as well as corresponding comparison 
benchmarking information for each role. In addition, the Group provides a number of ways in which employees can ask questions 
and give feedback on such matters should they so wish. This includes the Employee Communications mailbox, personal 
development reviews, the Workforce Forum, a dedicated Workforce Forum email address and an email address for employees 
to directly contact the Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement. Details of engagement with the workforce, 
including on executive remuneration are provided in the Stakeholder engagement section of the Strategic Report on page 55. The 
Committee reviews this feedback, which provides further context in relation to pay and conditions throughout the organisation. 
These valuable insights were considered when the Committee developed the 2023 Policy.

Remuneration Report continued
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued

Statement of consideration of shareholder views
Each year we update our major shareholders on the Committee’s 
application of the Policy and our performance in advance of the 
publication of our Annual Report and Accounts. The Committee 
takes into account shareholder feedback received from this 
exercise and any additional feedback received during any 
meetings from time to time, as part of the Company’s annual 
review of the Policy. In addition, the Committee will seek to 
engage directly with major shareholders and their representative 
bodies should any material changes be proposed to the Policy. 
In May 2023, we consulted with our major shareholders and 
the main institutional voting agencies over the proposed minor 
changes to the Policy, and no areas of concern were raised. Details 
of the votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s 
Remuneration Report can be found in Table 22 on page 168.

Annual Report on Remuneration

In this section, we provide an overview of the Committee and its advisers, as well as how the proposed Policy will be applied 
in FY24 and how the current Policy has been implemented throughout FY23, together with the resulting payments to Directors. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2023 AGM.

Membership and attendance at Committee meetings
Membership of the Committee comprises all of the Non-Executive Directors, and attendance at each of its scheduled meetings during 
the year is set out on page 137. The Committee is chaired by Katie Bickerstaffe. The Executive Directors are not members of the 
Committee and no Director or senior manager is present at the Committee’s meetings when their own remuneration is being considered.

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
In carrying out its principal responsibilities, the Committee has the authority to obtain the advice of external independent remuneration 
consultants and is solely responsible for their appointment, retention and termination. In line with best practice, the Committee 
assesses annually whether the appointment remains appropriate or if it should be put out to tender. The last such tender took place 
in 2017, resulting in PwC being appointed as the advisers to the Committee with effect from 1 January 2018. PwC is a signatory to 
the Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct. As part of the annual review and reappointment process, the Committee 
satisfied itself that PwC remained objective and independent during the year.
In addition to remuneration advice, PwC also provides taxation, consultancy, corporate finance and internal audit services to the 
Group. PwC is also currently the independent adviser to the Sustainability Committee and advises our Business Safety Unit. PwC 
has no current connections with the Company (save as described in this section) nor with any individual Directors.
During the year, the Committee has taken advice from PwC on best practice in executive remuneration and benchmarking. The Chair 
of the Committee also sought advice from PwC, independent of management, on various matters to be discussed at committee 
meetings particularly regarding the review of Policy. The fees payable to PwC are based on an annual fixed fee for a specified 
service with anything outside this scope being charged on a time and disbursement basis. PwC’s fees for services provided to 
the Committee during the year under review were £189,567 (FY22: £130,200).
The Committee also receives input into its decision making from the Chief Executive, the Company Secretary, and the Group HR 
Director, none of whom were present at any time when their own remuneration was being considered.

Role and main activities undertaken by the Committee during the financial year 
The Committee’s role is to determine and agree the Policy for Executive Directors and Senior Management whilst taking into 
account the remuneration of the wider workforce. It follows an annual work programme which was fully completed during the year. 
The Committee’s responsibilities, as delegated by the Board, are formally set out in its written Terms of Reference, which are 
available from our website at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors/corporate-governance. Details of the annual evaluation 
of the Committee’s performance can be found on page 123 and key activities undertaken in the year are set out in the table below:

Priorities

Work carried out and outcomes

Executive Directors’ 
remuneration

With assistance from its remuneration consultants, the Committee reviewed the Policy approved by 
Shareholders at the 2020 AGM, discussed and agreed a number of proposed changes (see page 142).

Considered salaries of Executive Directors and Senior Management for FY24 in the context of the 
remuneration of the wider workforce. The outcome of this review is set out on page 156.

Considered and agreed amendments to the structure of the bonus scheme for FY24; considered the 
structure of the 2023 LTPP and determined it remained appropriate (see pages 156 to 158 for 
further details).

Discussed future performance measures and targets for both the annual bonus and LTPP plans 
and agreed to introduce a Diversity & Inclusion measure for the FY24 annual bonus. 

Discussed and approved publication of the 2022 Gender and Ethnicity pay gap reports.

Considered whether the Group’s current remuneration structures remained appropriate and support 
the future strategy of the business, including the potential introduction of a restricted share plan, which 
was agreed for Senior Management below Board level. 

Governance

Undertook benchmarking for the new Chair’s fees, prior to her appointment. The Committee revisited 
the new Chair’s fee in June 2023 and agreed an increase (see page 158) to reflect the acceleration of 
her succession to the position of Chair.

Considered severance agreements in relation to a member of senior management.

Remuneration Report continued
Annual Report on Remuneration continued

Statement of implementation of the Remuneration Policy for FY24
Executive Directors’ remuneration for FY24 will be based on the Remuneration Policy to be proposed at the October 2023 AGM, 
subject to approval by shareholders. This is set out on pages 142 to 154. 

Base salary
The Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in June 2023, taking into account their individual performance during the year, 
the annual salary review for other employees in the Group where average salary increases were at 5.3%, and the multiplier effect of an increase 
in base salary on the Directors’ package as a whole. The Committee also took into account the performance of the Company and ensured that 
after any increase the salaries would remain within the range for similar sized companies and the housebuilding sector. Accordingly, the 
Committee believed that it was justified in awarding a salary increase of 4% for each of the Executive Directors, which is below the average 
salary increase awarded to the wider workforce. The Executive Directors’ salaries with effect from 1 July 2023 will therefore be:

Pension
Each of the Executive Directors will continue to receive a pension contribution (or cash supplement) which is in line with the wider 
workforce, currently 10% of base salary.

Annual bonus
Executive Directors and Senior Management will participate in the Group’s annual bonus scheme in accordance with the Policy. 

The Committee has agreed to include a new Diversity & Inclusion measure for FY24. Diversity & Inclusion is a key strategic priority 
for the business. The Committee and the Board recognise the need for the business to reflect the communities within which 
it operates. Whilst steps have been taken to improve diversity & inclusion within the Company, the Committee believes that further 
focus is required to drive this agenda forward. A key area that can help us to do this, is to ensure that we are attracting, and 
recruiting from, a diverse range of candidates. 

The Committee is of the view that the individual annual bonus performance targets are commercially sensitive. Therefore, 
in line with market practice, these will be disclosed, with performance against them, in next year’s Remuneration Report. 

The performance measures, their reasons for selection and the maximum bonus payment against each of them expressed 
as a percentage of salary for FY24 will be:

In addition, any bonus awarded for FY24 will be subject to the malus and clawback provisions set out in detail on pages 148 and 149. 

LTPP
The Committee intends to grant an LTPP award to Executive Directors later this year (“2023 LTPP”). Under the Remuneration Policy 
and the rules of the LTPP, the award can be up to 200% of base salary. The Committee remains mindful of the need to avoid windfall 
gains for Executive Directors, as evidenced by its decision to reduce the quantum of the 2022 LTPP award grant. There has been little 
movement in the share price since October 2022 and therefore the Committee is minded to grant an award of up to 200% of base 
salary. The Committee will however monitor the share price up until the day before the grant to determine the final quantum of the 
2023 LTPP. In addition, the Committee recognises that the 2023 LTPP award should be subject to performance targets which are 
stretching and challenging whilst aligned with the short and long-term performance of the Group and its strategy, as well as the 
interests of shareholders. During the financial year, the Committee agreed the performance conditions and their respective weightings 
for the 2023 LTPP. These are set out in the table below. Having discussed potential target ranges for each of the financial performance 
conditions, the Committee agreed that, due to the continuing uncertain market conditions at the time of approving the Remuneration 
report, it would be prudent to defer the finalisation of the financial targets until later in the year. The Committee anticipates that this 
will be by no later than December 2023. The non-financial targets are set out in the table below. Full details for the targets for each 
performance condition will be announced at the time of granting the 2023 LTPP, and in next year’s Remuneration Report.

period and an overriding Committee discretion, as set out in the Policy table on page 146. The Committee retains discretion to 
adjust the number of shares vesting from the 2023 LTPP award to mitigate against any potential windfall gains. The 2023 LTPP 
will also be subject to the malus and clawback provisions summarised on pages 148 and 149.

Non-Executive Directors’ fees
During the year, a committee of the Board comprising the Chair and the Executive Directors reviewed Non-Executive Directors’ 
fees and concluded that an increase of 4% should apply to all fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors. This increase is in line with 
the salary increase awarded to the Executive Directors and lower than the salary increase awarded to the wider workforce. 
Caroline Silver became Chair on 30 June 2023 on a fee of £350,000, broadly in line with that paid to John Allan at that time, and also 
received a 4% increase from 1 July 2023 to reflect her taking on the role as Chair earlier than previously anticipated. The annual 
fees payable to the Chair and Non-Executive Directors with effect from 1 July 2023 will therefore be:

1  Mike Scott was appointed a Director on 6 December 2021, and his remuneration for 2021/22 therefore reflects only a partial year.

2   Benefits (taxable) include the provision of a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, some telephone costs and contributions towards 

obtaining independent financial and tax advice, and are provided based on market rates. 

3   Annual bonus for 2021/22 includes amounts deferred for David Thomas and Steven Boyes (see Table 10 on page 161). 

4   Performance conditions for the LTPP were tested after 30 June 2023. 19.6% of the award granted to each of the Executive Directors is due to vest in 

October 2023 (see Tables 11 and 12 on pages 161 and 162 for further details). The market price of the shares has been calculated based on an average 
market value over the three months to 30 June 2023 £4.71 per share). None of the value of the award is attributable to share price growth. 

5    In accordance with regulatory requirements, the values in this column have been re-calculated using a share price of £3.56 per share being the market 
value of the shares on the vesting date, 24 October 2022, as opposed to the market price of £4.94 per share calculated based on an average market value 
over the three months to 30 June 2022 disclosed in last year’s Remuneration Report.

6   The Sharesave shares granted in 2016 for David Thomas and 2018 for Steven Boyes, which matured on 1 July 2021, were subject to a continued 

employment condition and completion of a savings contract. There are no performance conditions for Sharesave shares. The value is calculated using the 
difference between the exercise price and the mid-market closing price of a share on the date of maturity. The relevant prices were £4.82 and £6.792 for 
David Thomas’ options, and £4.49 and £7.112 for Steven Boyes’ options.

7    Details of Mike Scott’s Replacement Awards were shown on page 120 of the 2022 Annual Report. The value shown in the Replacement Award column 
relates to the Deferred Bonus shares which vested in December 2022. The value of the replacement LTPP awards vested in October 2022 and vesting 
in October 2023 are included in the relevant LTPP columns.

8   The total remuneration figures in the last three columns of the above table may not add up to the sum of the component parts, due to rounding.

17 October 2022. Their fees therefore reflect a partial year.

3   Benefits (taxable) for 2022/23 for John Allan include £1,068 expenses incurred in attending the Company’s main corporate office and for Nina Bibby relate 

to gifts, including tax payable on them, presented to her on leaving the business.

4   Benefits (taxable) for 2021/22 include expenses incurred in attending the Company’s main corporate office of £1,648 for John Allan.

Remuneration Report continued
Annual Report on Remuneration continued

Directors’ remuneration outcomes for the year ended 30 June 2023 continued
Annual bonus
For FY23, the business was focused on managing costs, with a strong emphasis on building sustainably whilst maintaining high customer 
service levels. The bonus measures were set accordingly. Financial targets were set taking into consideration internal and external 
consensus forecasts. Further information on how we measure progress against the waste reduction target is set out on page 17.

As in previous years, Executive Directors had the potential to earn an annual bonus of up to 150% of base salary based on the attainment of 
Group performance targets which are linked directly to the Group’s strategy, part of which is deferred into shares (see page 161). The Group 
performance targets and performance against them for FY23 are set out in Table 9 below. The Committee considers that the outcome 
reflects a fair, reasonable and appropriate level of reward, and the overall performance of the Group during FY23, and therefore no discretion 
was exercised in relation to the bonus outcomes. It is also aligned to the bonus outcomes for the wider workforce below Senior Management.

Executive Directors’ deferred bonus 
For FY23 there was no bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary there will be no deferral into shares. See Table 10 below for details 
of the FY23 bonus earned. When any bonus is earned in excess of 100% of salary, the number of shares that will be awarded will be 
calculated based on the average closing share price for the first five dealing days following the date on which the Group publishes 
its annual results, and will be announced via the Regulatory Information Service when the shares are awarded. Deferred shares 
are held for a period of three years from the date they are awarded, subject normally to continued employment.

1   The number of conditional shares awarded during the year was calculated at a share price of £4.1802, being the average of the mid-market closing prices 

of the shares for the first five dealing days following the date of the final FY22 results announcement for the Company.

2   For the FY22 bonus, Mike Scott was appointed a Director of the Company part way through the year. Mike’s percentage bonus outcome was 147.5%. 

This was applied to his annual base salary for FY22 and pro-rated to the number of calendar days he was employed in the year. The value of his bonus 
outcome did not exceed 100% of his annual base salary and therefore none of his bonus was deferred into shares.

Long-Term Performance Plans
Vesting of 2020 LTPP (included in FY23 single figure of remuneration)
The 2020 LTPP award was based on a three-year performance period to 30 June 2023 and will vest in October 2023. The award 
is subject to three performance conditions, 20% EPS, 40% ROCE and 40% TSR (half of which is measured against a 50+/50- FTSE 
comparator group and the other half against a housebuilder index). The resulting vesting levels are as follows:

1   The basic EPS of 53.2 pence has been re-based using the same rate of corporation tax and number of shares as was used in setting the 2020 LTPP targets. 

The re-based basic EPS used for the purpose of determining vesting, which is directly comparable to the 2020 targets, is 56.3 pence.

2   The Housebuilder Index comprises: Bellway, Berkeley Homes, Countryside Partnerships, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey 

and Vistry Group. On 11 November 2022, Countryside Partnerships was acquired by Vistry Group. At the time, both companies were members of the 
Housebuilder Index Comparator Group. The TSR performance for Countryside Partnerships has therefore been calculated based on the performance 
of Countryside Partnerships up to the date of the merger and then by tracking Vistry Group’s performance thereafter.

The Committee considered the underlying financial performance of the Group and was satisfied that given the continued strong 
performance in the Group’s financial results, the level of vesting was justified. There was no share price appreciation, and no 
discretion was exercised in relation to the share price. The Committee believes that the vesting level achieved is fair, reasonable 
and appropriate. No Committee discretion was exercised in relation to the LTPP vesting outcome. The 2020 LTPP has accrued 
dividend equivalents in accordance with the rules of the scheme. The amount of dividend equivalent to be paid, in cash, on vesting 
will be pro-rated in line with the number of shares that vest. The gross number of shares to be released to each of the Executive 
Directors and the gross value of the dividend equivalents are as follows:

1   The relevant number of shares will be released to each participant as soon as is practicable following the vesting date. The awards are subject to 

a two-year post-vesting holding period commencing 1 July 2023. 

2   The estimated values of the vested shares and the dividend equivalents are based on the average share price during the three months to 30 June 2023 

(£4.71 per share). There was no share price appreciation from the date the shares were awarded. 

3   The shares granted to Mike Scott were replacement awards, further details of which can be found on page 120 of the FY22 Annual Report and Accounts.

4  The “Total estimated value” figure for David Thomas does not add up to the sum of the component parts due to rounding.

LTPP granted during the year (2022 LTPP) 
During the year, the Committee granted the 2022 LTPP to Executive Directors. The 2022 LTPP, is subject to four performance conditions, 
30% TSR (half of which is measured against a 50+/50- FTSE comparator group and the other half against a Housebuilder Index), 15% 
Adjusted EPS, 40% Underlying ROCE and 15% reduction of GHG emissions. Further information on how GHG emissions and progress 
against this target are measured is given on pages 97 and 98. The levels of vesting against TSR and GHG emissions will be 
measured over a three-year period commencing 1 July 2022, and against EPS and ROCE for the financial year ending 30 June 2025. 
On completion of the performance period, assuming that shares vest, they will be subject to a further two-year holding period. The 
Committee determined to reduce the usual grant size of the awards to avoid windfall gains given the fall in the Company’s share 
price since the previous grant in October 2021. The basis of the awards was reduced from 200% to 170% of salary, representing 
a reduction of 15% of the usual basis of the awards.

1   The comparator group for TSR FTSE is each of the members ranking 50 above and 50 below the Company in the FTSE Index.

2   The housebuilder Index comprises: Bellway, Berkeley Homes, Countryside Partnerships, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and Vistry Group. 

For the TSR, EPS and Underlying ROCE performance targets, vesting is on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum. 
For the GHG performance target, vesting is on a straight-line basis between 20% and 25% reduction for the 2021 award, between 
25% and 30% reduction for both awards, and between 30% and 35% for the 2022 award. The LTPP awards will accrue dividend 
equivalents in accordance with the rules of the scheme. The amount of dividend equivalent to be paid, in cash, on vesting will 
be pro-rated according to the number of shares that vest.

The Committee has the discretion to adjust the number of shares vesting from each LTPP award if it considers that the vesting 
outcome is not sufficiently reflective of the underlying performance of the Company and to mitigate against any potential windfall 
gains for the Executive Directors.

Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and share interests
For the financial year ended 30 June 2023, Executive Directors were required to hold shares in the Company equivalent in value 
to 200% of salary. The Executive Directors are expected to meet this requirement no later than the fifth anniversary of joining 
the Board, with progress being made towards its achievement throughout the period. The share price used for the purposes of 
determining the value of the shares is by reference to the higher of the share price paid on acquisition or vesting and the share 
price at the close of business on the London Stock Exchange on 30 June or the date of leaving, as applicable. Participants who have 
not built up the required level of shareholding by the fifth anniversary of joining the Board, will not be eligible for inclusion in future 
share-based incentive schemes. In addition, they will not be allowed to sell any of the net of tax shares released from incentive 
schemes until they reach the levels specified, unless exceptional circumstances exist in the opinion of the Committee. The Committee 
retains discretion to adjust the length of time in which the required amount of shareholding needs to be accrued in order to adjust 
for events out of the Director’s control. The Committee reserves the right to amend the percentage holding required by the Executive 
Directors depending on market conditions and best practice guidance. At 30 June 2023, David Thomas and Steven Boyes had met 
their shareholding requirements and Mike Scott has until 6 December 2026 to meet his. 

Executive Directors are also subject to a two-year post-cessation shareholding requirement. They must hold the lower of their 
shareholding requirement (currently 200% of salary) or their actual shareholding on the date of leaving. The Committee has agreed 
that to ensure continued enforcement of the post-cessation shareholding requirement, a contractual agreement will be entered 
into by the Company and the relevant Executive Director at the point of leaving employment, under which the individual concerned 
will agree not to dispose of the shares prior to the completion of the post-cessation shareholding period.

The interests of the Directors serving during the financial year and their connected persons in the ordinary share capital of 
the Company at the beginning and end of the year are shown in Table 16. 

No notification has been received of any change in the interests shown during the period 30 June 2023 to 5 September 2023 inclusive.

1   All of these options were unvested at 30 June 2023. 

2   During the year, Steven Boyes was granted 2,593 Sharesave options, exercisable for six months from 1 July 2026 at an option price of £3.47, representing 
a 20% discount on the average share price for the five business days immediately before the invitation to participate in the award (£4.336). The number 
of shares granted was based on the option price and the total savings amount forecast at the end of the respective savings periods. The face value of 
the options based on the average share price above was £11,243. There are no performance targets associated with this Sharesave option.

3   The share price used for the purposes of determining the value of the shares is £4.14 being the mid-market closing price on 30 June 2023. The value 

of DBP shares used is net of income tax and national insurance contributions which the Directors would have to pay on exercise.

All conditional awards and share options are subject to an overriding Committee discretion, in that the Committee must be 
satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period warrants the level of vesting as 
determined by applying the relevant targets. If the Committee is not of this view, it has the authority to reduce the level of vesting, 
including to nil, as it deems appropriate. 

Executive Directors’ pension arrangements 
The Company’s pension policy for Executive Directors is that on joining the Group they will be auto-enrolled unless they choose 
to opt out. On opting out, the Executive Director may choose to receive a cash supplement (which does not count for incentive 
purposes) and/or participate in the Company’s defined contribution money purchase pension plan. Each Executive Director has 
opted to receive a cash supplement in lieu of pension. Until 31 December 2022, David Thomas and Steven Boyes received an 
amount equal to 25% of base salary in line with market practice at the time of their appointment. This reduced to 10% from 
1 January 2023 to be in line with that of the wider workforce. Mike Scott received an amount equal to 10% of base salary 
throughout FY23. Only the base salary element of a Director’s remuneration is pensionable.

Details of cash supplements paid to the Executive Directors during the year can be found in Table 7 on page 159.

Defined benefit section (audited) 
Steven Boyes is a deferred member of the defined benefit section of the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme 
(the Scheme), which was bought out by an insurer during FY21. As a result of the buyout, no employee (including Steven Boyes) has 
any current or prospective defined benefit pension or related benefit payable by the Group.

Payments to former Directors (audited)
Jessica White stepped down as a Director and Chief Financial Officer on 30 June 2021 and left the business on 31 July 2021. The 
Committee determined that, in line with the Policy and the rules of the relevant plans, Jessica would be treated as a good leaver.

As set out in the FY21 Remuneration Report, Jessica held 91,908 shares under the 2019 LTPP. 54,501 of these shares vested 
on 24 October 2022. The awards were valued using a share price of £3.56 per share, being the market price of the shares on 
the vesting date. The value of the shares and dividend equivalents (paid in cash) was £194,024 and £29,214 respectively, such 
that the total value of the award on the vesting date was £223,238. 

No other payments have been made to former Directors during the year.

Payments for loss of office (audited)
John Allan stepped down from the Board with effect from 30 June 2023. He received his Chair fee from 1 July 2022 up to and 
including 30 June 2023 and taxable benefits and these amounts are shown in Table 8 on page 159. He received no pension 
contributions or variable remuneration. In addition, John was paid £52,470 in lieu of the balance of his three-month contractual 
notice period, given that he stepped down earlier than originally anticipated. No other remuneration payments were made by the 
Company to John Allan after he ceased to be a Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Board. No discretion has been exercised 
by the Committee. 

No other payments for loss of office have been made to former Directors during the year.

1   The percentage changes in salary and fees of the Directors for FY21 takes into account a temporary 20% voluntary reduction in base salary in April 

and May 2020 covering the period our construction sites were temporarily closed as a consequence of COVID-19.

2   Mike Scott was appointed as an Executive Director effective 6 December 2021, therefore no percentage change in remuneration is displayed for years prior 

to FY23, and therefore the change in fees reflects the annualised fees that would have been earned for FY22.

3   The changes in fees of the Non-Executive Directors reflect the introduction of additional fees for committee membership, and increases in fees for 

Committee Chairs which took place for FY22, and were set out in detail on page 102 of the FY21 Annual Report and Accounts. 

4   Katie Bickerstaffe and Chris Weston were appointed to the Board part way through FY21, and Jasi Halai and Caroline Silver were appointed to the Board 
part way through FY23. No percentage change in remuneration is displayed for the years they joined, and the changes in fees reflect the annualised fees 
that would have been earned for FY21 and FY23 respectively.

5   Average pay using all employees in the Group is also provided, as a more meaningful figure, as the parent company employs only a very few senior 

employees. The figure represents the mean employee pay.

Chief Executive pay ratio
The table below compares the single total figure of remuneration for the Chief Executive with that of the Group employees who are paid 
at the 25th percentile (lower quartile), 50th percentile (median) and 75th percentile (upper quartile) of its UK employee population.

The remuneration figures for the employee at each quartile were determined with reference to the financial year ending 30 June 2023.

Under Option B of The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the latest available gender pay gap data (i.e. from 
5 April 2023) was used to identify the best equivalent for three Group UK employees whose hourly rates of pay are at the 25th, 50th 
and 75th percentiles for the Group. The Committee is comfortable that this approach provides a fair representation of the Chief 
Executive to employee pay ratios and is appropriate in comparison to alternative methods, balancing the need for statistical accuracy 
with internal operational resource constraints.

A full-time equivalent total pay and benefits figure for the FY23 financial year was then calculated for each of those employees. This 
was also sense checked against a sample of employees with hourly pay rates either side of the identified individuals to ensure that 
the appropriate representative employee is selected. The pay ratios outlined above were then calculated as the ratio of the Chief 
Executive’s single figure to the total pay and benefits of each of these employees. 

Each employee’s pay and benefits were calculated using each element of employee remuneration on a full-time basis, consistent 
with the Chief Executive. No adjustments (other than the approximate up-rating of pay elements to achieve full-time equivalent rates) 
were made, with the exception of annual bonuses where the amount paid during the year for the annual bonus and H2 bonus was 
used (i.e. in respect of FY22) as the FY23 employee figures had not yet been determined at the time this report was produced. No 
components of pay have been omitted.

The table below sets out the salary and total pay and benefits for the three identified quartile point employees:

Table 20 

Salary

£32,739

£38,954

£43,410

£54,158

£63,825

£73,414

The FY23 pay ratios are lower than last year due to a decrease in the Chief Executive’s single figure of remuneration compared to 
FY22 combined with an increase in the total pay and benefits for the P25, P50 and P75 employees. The decrease in CEO pay is a result 
of a lower vesting outcome of the 2020 LTPP award in comparison to the 2019 LTPP award that vested last year. The CEO annual 
bonus payout was also lower in FY23 compared to FY22. The median pay ratio has fluctuated since reporting began. This movement 
has primarily been driven by both changes in CEO pay outcomes and the impact of the pandemic on outcomes in recent years. 

The Committee considers that the median pay ratio is consistent with the relative roles and responsibilities of the Chief Executive 
and the identified employee. Base salaries of all employees, including our Executive Directors, are set with reference to a range 
of factors including market practice, experience and performance in role. The Chief Executive’s remuneration package is weighted 
towards variable pay (including the annual bonus and LTPP) due to the nature of the role. This also means that the ratio is likely to 
fluctuate depending on the outcomes of incentive plans in each year (as illustrated by the ratios to date). 

The Committee also recognises that, due to the nature of the Company’s business and the ways in which we employ our staff, 
the flexibility permitted within the regulations for identifying and calculating the total pay and benefits for employees, as well 
as differences in employment and remuneration models between companies, the ratios reported above may not be comparable 
to those reported by other companies.

Relative importance of spend on pay 
The following table shows the Group’s actual spend on pay (for all employees) relative to dividends and profit from operations:

The figure used is from the Consolidated Income Statement on page 182.

2   For FY22 this includes the interim and final dividends paid in May and November 2022. For FY23, this includes the interim dividend paid in May 2023, and the 
proposed final dividend for payment in November 2023, the value of which has been calculated based on the number of shares in issue as at 30 June 2023.

Dividends 
An interim dividend of 10.2 pence per share was paid on 18 May 2023 
to those shareholders on the register on 11 April 2023 (2022: 
11.2 pence per share). The Directors recommend payment of a 
final dividend of 23.5 pence per share (2022: 25.7 pence per 
share) in respect of FY23. The final dividend will be paid, subject 
to shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM, on 3 November 2023 
to shareholders on the register at close of business on 
29 September 2023. Shareholders who wish to elect for the 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan should do so by 13 October 2023.

If approved, the total dividend for FY23 will be 33.7 pence per 
share (2022: 36.9 pence per share).

Annual General Meeting
The 2023 AGM will be held at the offices of Linklaters LLP, One 
Silk Street, London EC2Y 8HQ on Wednesday 18 October 2023 at 
12 noon. The notice convening the AGM is set out in a separate 
letter to shareholders.

Political donations and expenditure
The Company made no political donations during the year in 
accordance with its policy. In keeping with the Company’s 
approach in prior years, shareholder approval is being sought at 
the 2023 AGM, as a precautionary measure, for donations and/
or expenditure that may be construed as political by the wide 
definition of such terms provided under the Act.

1   Represents the number of voting rights last notified to the Company at 

30 June 2023 by the respective shareholder in accordance with DTR 5.1. 

2   Based on the Total Voting Rights as at the relevant notification dates.

On 4July 2023, Royal Bank of Canada notified us that they no 
longer had a notifiable interest in the Company. At 6 September 
2023, no further change in these holdings had been notified and 
no further notifications had been received. The Total Voting 
Rights of the Company, as announced on 31 August 2023, are 
974,585,796.

Appointment and removal of Directors 
The appointment and removal of Directors is governed by the 
Articles, the Act and related legislation. There shall be (unless 
otherwise determined by an ordinary resolution) no fewer than 
two and no more than 15 Directors appointed to the Board at 
any one time. Directors may be appointed by the Company by 
ordinary resolution or by the Board. In accordance with the 
Code and the Articles, at each AGM, all of the Directors shall 
retire from office at the date of the Notice of AGM and may offer 
themselves for reappointment by members. Directors may be 
removed before the expiration of their term of office by means 
set out in the Act and the Articles, including by special resolution.

Powers of the Directors including in relation to the 
allotment of shares
Subject to the Articles, the Act and any directions given by 
special resolution, the business of the Company is ultimately 
managed by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the 
Company, whether relating to the management of the business of 
the Company or otherwise. In particular, the Board may exercise 
all the powers of the Company to borrow money and to mortgage 
or charge any of its undertakings, property, assets and uncalled 
capital and to issue debentures and other securities and to give 
security for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company to 
any third party. At the AGM held on 17 October 2022, the 
Directors were given authority to allot shares up to an aggregate 
nominal value of £34,085,427 (representing approximately 
one-third of the nominal value of the Company’s issued share 
capital as at 6 September 2022), such authority to remain valid 
until the end of the 2023 AGM or, if earlier, until the close of 
business on 17 January 2024. A resolution to renew this authority 
will be proposed at the 2023 AGM.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities

Directors’ indemnities and insurance
Qualifying third-party indemnity provisions are in place for the 
Directors, former Directors and the Company Secretary, together 
with those who hold or have held these positions as officers of 
other Group companies or of associate or affiliated companies 
and members of the Executive Committee, to the extent permitted 
by law and the Articles, in respect of liabilities incurred in the 
course of performing their duties. In addition, the Company 
maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for each 
Director of the Group and its associated companies. 

Capital structure
The Company has a single class of share capital, which is 
divided into ordinary shares of 10 pence each. All issued shares 
are in registered form and are fully paid. Details of the Company’s 
issued share capital and of the movements in the share capital 
during the year can be found in note 23 on page 216.

Shareholder voting rights and restrictions on transfer 
of shares
All the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company 
have equal voting rights with one vote per share. There are no 
special control rights attaching to them, save that the Trustees 
of the EBT may vote or abstain from voting on shares held in the 
EBT in any way they think fit and in doing so may consider both 
financial and non-financial interests of the beneficiaries of the 
EBT or their dependants. The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities. The rights, including 
full details relating to voting of shareholders and any 
restrictions on transfer relating to the Company’s ordinary 
shares, are set out in the Articles and in the explanatory 
notes that accompany the Notice of the 2023 AGM. These 
documents are available on the Company’s website at  
www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.

Shareholder authority for purchase of own shares 
At the Company’s AGM held on 17 October 2022, shareholders 
authorised the Company to buy back up to an aggregate of 
102,256,281 ordinary shares of 10 pence each (representing 
approximately 10% of the Company’s issued share capital). 
This authority is valid until the end of the 2023 AGM (at which a 
renewal of that authority will be sought) or, if earlier, until the 
close of business on 17 January 2024. Under the authority, there 
is a minimum and maximum price to be paid for such shares. 
Any shares that are bought back may be held as treasury 
shares or, if not so held, will be cancelled immediately upon 
completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the Company’s 
issued share capital. Following the excellent performance of 
the business throughout FY22 and our strong and resilient 
balance sheet, the Board approved a return of capital which 
is beyond the requirements for investment and growth in the 
business of £200m in FY23 through the implementation of a 
share buyback programme to reduce the share capital of the 
Company. 13,581,002 shares of 10 pence each were purchased 
during the year under a similar authority given at the Company’s 
AGM on 13 October 2021. 34,404,291 shares of 10 pence each 
were purchased during the year under the authority given at 
the Company’s AGM on 17 October 2022. All of the purchased 
shares have been cancelled. 

Articles of Association
The Articles may only be amended by a special resolution of 
shareholders. The Articles were last amended at the Company’s 
AGM held on 14 October 2020. 

Approach to tax and tax governance
For all taxes, it is the Group’s aim to ensure it accurately 
calculates and pays the tax that is due at the correct time. 
Whilst the Group does seek to minimise its tax liabilities 
through legitimate routine tax planning, it does not participate 
in aggressive tax planning schemes. The Group also seeks to be 
transparent in its dealings with HMRC and has regular dialogue 
with its representatives to discuss both developments in the 
business and the ongoing tax position. In accordance with UK 
legislation, we have published details of our tax strategy, and 
this can be found at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.

The Chief Financial Officer retains overall responsibility for 
oversight of the tax affairs of the Group. Mike Scott, Chief 
Financial Officer, is the Senior Accounting Officer throughout 
the year ended 30 June 2023. The Senior Accounting Officer 
receives regular updates on tax matters. In addition, tax 
management and strategy are reviewed at least annually by the 
Audit Committee, with no changes proposed for the year ended 
30 June 2023.

Change of control 
The following significant agreements as at 30 June 2023 
contained provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise 
termination and/or other rights in the event of a change of 
control of the Company:

 ∙ an RCF agreement containing change of control provisions 
which provide that, on a change of control of the Company, 
the relevant counterparties may require the Company to 
immediately repay all amounts outstanding and would not 
be obliged to fund any further drawdown of the facility 
(other than rollover loans); and 

 ∙ a note purchase agreement in respect of the Group’s £200m 

privately placed notes containing change of control provisions 
which provide that, on a change of control of the Company, 
the noteholders may require the Company to prepay at par 
all outstanding amounts under the notes.

In addition, the Company’s share plans contain provisions 
relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options 
would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of 
control subject to the satisfaction of any performance 
conditions at that time.

The Company is not aware of any other significant agreements 
to which it is a party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the Company.

The Company does not have any agreements with any Director 
or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office 
or employment resulting from change of control following a 
takeover bid.

Financial Statements and accounting records
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts including the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial 
Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom adopted IAS. The Financial 
Statements also comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB. The 
Directors have also elected to prepare the Parent Company 
Financial Statements under United Kingdom adopted IAS. 

Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the 
Group and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company and the Group for 
that period.

IAS 1 requires that Financial Statements present fairly for each 
ﬁnancial year the relevant entity’s ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial 
performance and cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful representation 
of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the IASB’s 
“Framework for the preparation and presentation of ﬁnancial 
statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation 
will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS.

Directors are also required to:

 ∙ properly select and apply accounting policies;

 ∙ present information, including accounting policies, in a 

manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;

 ∙ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 

speciﬁc requirements in IFRS are insufﬁcient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and 
ﬁnancial performance; and

 ∙ make an assessment of the Company’s and the Group’s 

(as the case may be) ability to continue as a going concern.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
and the Group’s transactions on an individual and consolidated 
basis and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
ﬁnancial position of the Company and the Group and enable them 
to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Act. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Fair, balanced and understandable
The Board considers, on the advice of the Audit Committee, 
that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company and the 
Group’s position, performance, business model and strategy.

Disclosure of information to auditor 
In accordance with Section 418 of the Act, the Directors confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information that has not been brought to the attention of the 
Company’s auditor. Each Director has taken all reasonable 
steps that they ought to have taken in accordance with their duty 
as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to ensure that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.

Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors conﬁrm that, to the best of each person’s 
knowledge:

a. 

 the Group Financial Statements in the Annual Report and 
Accounts, which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 
in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006, and those of the Parent Company, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IAS in conformity with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt 
or loss of the Company and Group taken as a whole; and

b. 

 the Annual Report and Accounts includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties they face.

The Directors of the Company and their functions are listed 
on pages 104 and 105. 

By order of the Board.

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Barratt Developments PLC

Report on the audit of the financial statements

1. Opinion

In our opinion:

 ∙ the financial statements of Barratt Developments PLC (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) give a true and fair 

view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2023 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;

 ∙ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international 

accounting standards; 

 ∙ the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international 

accounting standards and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

 ∙ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the Financial Statements which comprise:

 ∙ the Consolidated Income Statement and  Statement of Comprehensive Income;

 ∙ the Group and Company Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity;

 ∙ the Group and Company Balance Sheets;

 ∙ the Group and Company Cash Flow Statements; and

 ∙ the related notes 1 to 32.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom adopted 
international accounting standards and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 

2. Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of 
our report. 

We are independent of the Group and the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit 
services provided to the Group and Company for the year are disclosed in note 3 to the Financial Statements. We confirm that 
we have not provided any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard to the Group or the Company.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

3. Summary of our audit approach

Key audit matters

The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:

 ∙ Margin recognition; and

 ∙ Costs associated with legacy properties.

Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows:

  Increased level of risk
  Similar level of risk
  Decreased level of risk

Materiality

Scoping

The materiality that we used for the Group Financial Statements was £45 million which 
represents 5.1% of adjusted profit before tax. Adjusted profit before tax is profit before tax and 
adjusted items as disclosed in the table following the Consolidated Income Statement and 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Our scoping focused on the audit work of the two components, being housebuilding and joint 
ventures. All audit work was completed directly by the Group audit engagement team.

Significant changes 
in our approach

There were no significant changes to our audit approach, and it remains consistent with the 
prior year.

4. Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting included:

 ∙ understanding the relevant controls relating to the assessment of the appropriateness of the going concern assumption;

 ∙ assessing the Group’s financing facilities including the nature of the facilities, repayment terms and compliance with 

loan covenants;

 ∙ challenging assumptions used in the going concern model by analysing the current and forecast performance of the Group, 

including working capital requirements by assessing management’s assumptions against market data;

 ∙ assessing the wider macro-economic environment over the going concern period, with respect to increasing interest and 

inflation rates and their impact on house price and build cost assumptions, and whether this has been appropriately reflected 
in the forecasts;

 ∙ evaluating management’s sensitivity analysis;

 ∙ assessing identified potential mitigating actions and the appropriateness of the inclusion of these in the going 

concern assessment;

 ∙ assessing the historical accuracy of forecasts; and

 ∙ assessing the appropriateness of the going concern disclosures in the financial statements.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for 
a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In relation to the reporting on how the Group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add 
or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered 
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections 
of this report.

5. Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

5.1. Margin recognition 

Key audit matter 
description

How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter

Key observations

In FY23, adjusted margin was 21.2% (FY22: 24.8%).

The Group’s valuation and cost allocation framework determines the total profit forecast for each site. 
This allows the land and build costs of a development to be allocated to each individual unit, ensuring 
the forecast margin per unit is equalised across a development. At each year-end, Group management 
considers if an adjustment for house prices and build cost assumptions is required. This cost allocation 
framework drives the recognition of costs, and hence profit, as each unit is sold, which is the key 
estimate in the Income Statement and is where fraud could potentially occur. 

For each development there is estimation uncertainty in:

 ∙ Estimating the inputs included within a site budget, including future revenues and costs to complete, 

in order to determine the level of profit that each unit of the development will deliver;

 ∙ Determining future house price inflation and build cost inflation;

 ∙ Appropriately allocating costs such as shared infrastructure relating to a development so that the 

gross profit margin (in percentage terms) achieved on each individual unit is equal;

 ∙ Recognising site contingencies and their impact on margin; and

 ∙ Recording the variation when a deviation from the initial budget occurs and ensuring such variations 

are appropriately recognised to those units impacted by the deviation.

These estimates impact the carrying value of inventory in the balance sheet and therefore the profit 
recognised on each unit sold which aggregate to form the overall reported margin which is a key 
internal metric for the Group. Accordingly, we consider the recognition of cost per unit and therefore the 
appropriate margin to be a key audit matter.

Refer to page 128 (Audit Committee Report) and notes 1 and 3 (financial statement disclosures including 
the related critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty).

Our work included the following:

 ∙ Tested the relevant controls governing inventory costing which include site valuations, land 

acquisition feasibilities, expenditure and ongoing margin review;

 ∙ Visited a sample of sites and verified the work completed to date. On a sample basis, agreed the cost 

incurred to source documentation to verify work in progress;

 ∙ On a sample of sites, made enquiries with management to support their cost to complete estimates 

and obtained external supporting evidence regarding costs to complete;

 ∙ Evaluated key estimates in the margin calculation, such as the current and forecast macro-economic 

conditions such as future sales volumes, house prices and construction build costs;

 ∙ Analysed margins on a site-by-site and divisional basis to identify material movements in the site 

margins compared to prior year. We evaluated and assessed the material variances through enquiries 
with management and obtaining corroborative evidence; 

 ∙ Used bespoke data analytic techniques to analyse costs to complete. This enabled us to analyse the 

cost category composition for each site and comparing to budgeted positions and Group averages. We 
performed enquiries and obtained corroborative evidence for exceptions identified; 

 ∙ Analysed the cost per square foot of plots sold at a divisional level for the current year and compared 

this to cost per square foot in previous years, to analyse for any unusual trends which required 
corroboration from management; and

 ∙ Made enquiries of management regarding their assessment of the impact of climate change on the 

forecast costs to complete and house prices and assessed the reasonableness of their assumptions.

Based on the procedures performed, we concluded that the Group’s cost allocation framework was 
reasonable for the intended purpose of recognising appropriate margins on plot completion. We concurred 
with the Group’s assessment that, given the current market, no further adjustments for house price and 
build cost assumptions are required to underlying site valuations and margins are materially appropriate.

developments. The Group has recognised a number of provisions in relation to changing building regulations and 
remediation of structural defects identified. The provisions also include the expected cost to address necessary 
fire-safety issues on all buildings of 11 metres and above following the adoption of the UK Government industry 
pledge by Barratt in April 2022 and the signing of the Self-Remediation Terms and Contract in March 2023.

As a result of the evolving regulatory environment, including the signing of the Self-Remediation Terms 
and Contract, we continue to identify an increased level of risk in relation to the Group’s obligations. We 
identified a key audit matter in relation to costs associated with legacy properties as the amount provided 
by the Group could be incomplete or not valued accurately for the remediation required. 

To date, there is limited actual evidence of the costs of remediation and the accounting for these provisions 
involves a number of key assumptions when estimating the future costs, and therefore this is identified as 
an area with a potential for fraud. 

The key judgements are:

 ∙ determining which buildings the Group has an obligation to remediate at the balance sheet date; 

 ∙ the cost of the future works; 

 ∙ the duration over which the costs will be incurred; and

 ∙ the discount and inflation rates applied.

At the end of the financial year the Group holds provisions of £612.3m (2022: £479.5m) in relation to legacy 
properties. During the year, the Group incurred a charge of £258.2m (2022: £448.0m) and utilisation of 
£32.9m (2022: £20.3m) in relation to remediation costs. The additional provisions made have been 
recognised as an adjusted item and excluded from adjusted profit, as explained in note 4. 

Fire-safety regulations continue to evolve and the Group’s internal investigations are ongoing in relation to their 
legacy buildings, required remediation on a building by building basis and potential liabilities. We identified a risk 
around whether the charge for FY23 has been recorded in the appropriate accounting period.

Refer to page 128 (Audit Committee Report) and notes 1, 20 and 29 to the Financial Statements, including 
the disclosures relating to this key source of estimation uncertainty.

Our work included the following:

 ∙ obtained an understanding of controls relevant to the recognition and estimation of costs associated 

with legacy properties;

Key observations

Based on the procedures performed we concluded the provision recorded to be appropriate based on 
information available at 30 June 2023, however we observed a high level of estimation uncertainty in 
the assumptions applied. Accordingly, we are satisfied  with the disclosure of this provision as a key source 
of estimation uncertainty within note 1 of the financial statements potentially subject to future change.

6. Our application of materiality
6.1. Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope 
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows:

Materiality

£45 million (2022: £50 million)

£40.5 million (2022: £45 million)

Group financial statements

Company financial statements

Basis for determining 
materiality

Rationale for the 
benchmark applied

Our determined materiality represents 5.1% 
(2022: 4.7%) of adjusted profit before tax. 
Adjusted profit before tax is profit before tax and 
adjusted items as disclosed in the table following 
the Consolidated Income Statement and 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

We consider adjusted profit before tax to be an 
important benchmark of the performance of the 
Group. Whilst not an IFRS measure, adjusted 
profit before tax is one of the key metrics for the 
Group. It excludes some of the volatility arising 
from adjusted items and accordingly we consider 
it the appropriate basis.  

Our basis for materiality was determined based 
upon 3% (2022: 3%) of the Company’s net assets 
capped at 90% (2022: 90%) of Group materiality.

Net assets was used as the benchmark because 
it provides a stable basis and there are volatile 
earnings between periods.

6.2. Performance materiality
We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected 
and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 

Group financial statements

Company financial statements

 ∙ assessed how the value of the provision has been determined and whether a present obligation to rectify 

Performance materiality

70% (2022: 70%) of Group materiality

70% (2022: 70%) of Company materiality

the properties existed at the balance sheet date;

 ∙ challenged that the increase in estimated costs have been recorded in the appropriate accounting 
period by assessing that all reliable information that could reasonably be expected to have been 
obtained was reflected in the provision recorded in the prior accounting period and that the charge for 
the year is a consequence of new information that became available during FY23;

 ∙ validated a sample of cost estimates to underlying support such as third-party estimates, quotations 

or agreements in order to challenge management’s estimates; and 

 ∙ assessed the associated disclosures, including consideration of costs classified as adjusted items. 

Specifically, in relation to the Self-Remediation Terms and Contract, we performed the following:

 ∙ performed an assessment of the Group’s legal liability through discussions with internal legal counsel 

and the Group’s internal building safety unit;

 ∙ performed an assessment of the application of UK laws in relation to responsibilities of freeholders;

 ∙ analysed buildings with potential legal liability by considering the Group’s portfolio of buildings against 

the commitments made under the Self-Remediation Terms and Contract; 

 ∙ assessed the estimated liability by understanding and challenging management’s assumptions 

regarding the costs of remediation per plot, the number of plots to be remediated, the time period for 
the work to be completed and the discount factor applied to the overall provision; 

 ∙ challenged the completeness of the provision, including the contingency, by testing the key assumptions 
including the number of buildings with potential legal liability and the estimated liability per unit; and

 ∙ assessed the disclosure included within the financial statements in relation to provisions and contingent 
liabilities, including the disclosure of the assumptions and associated sensitivities in relation to the key 
sources of estimation uncertainty.

Basis and rationale 
for determining 
performance  
materiality

In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors: 

 ∙ Our risk assessment, including our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment and 
that we consider it appropriate to rely on controls over a number of business processes; and

 ∙ Our past experience of the audit, which has indicated a low number of corrected and uncorrected 

misstatements identified in prior periods.

6.3. Error reporting threshold
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £2.25 million 
(2022: £2.5 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.

7. An overview of the scope of our audit
7.1. Identification and scoping of components
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. The entire Group is audited by one audit engagement team, led by 
the Senior Statutory Auditor. Controls are common across the Group and there are two identified components, housebuilding and 
joint ventures, which take into consideration all of the Group’s divisions, as well as the head office consolidation. 

Each component was set a specific component materiality, considering its relative size and any component-specific risk factors 
such as internal control findings and history of error. The component materialities applied were in the range £15.75 million to 
£29.93 million (2022: £17.5m to £33.2m). Both components have been subject to a full scope audit

7. An overview of the scope of our audit continued
7.2. Our consideration of the control environment
We obtained an understanding of the relevant internal controls over key audit matters, relating to margin recognition and legacy 
properties. We obtained an understanding of other relevant controls which we would expect in a housebuilder, namely those over 
land and work in progress and those over subcontractor and other expenses.

We assessed entity level controls at a Group level relating to the risk assessment process, monitoring of internal controls and 
information systems. This resulted in a more granular review of management’s whistleblowing policy, code of ethics, HR and culture 
policy and fraud risk assessment.

In the current year, we have tested controls relating to margin recognition, subcontractors, expenditure, land and work in progress. 
Based on our work performed we adopted a controls reliance approach to our testing in these areas.

The Group IT landscape contains a number of IT systems, applications and tools used to support business processes and reporting. 
We enhanced our understanding of the Group’s IT controls and performed testing of General IT Controls (“GITCs”) of three key 
applications that support financial reporting processes, being TM1, COINs and Homebuilder, which included controls surrounding 
user access management and change management. Based on our work performed we adopted a controls reliance approach to 
GITCs of these applications.

7.3. Our consideration of climate-related risks
As part of our audit we have made enquiries of management to understand the process they have adopted to assess the potential 
impact of climate change on the financial statements. As disclosed on page 77 the Group considers climate change to be a 
fundamental component of its environmental, social and governance principal risk within the business which in the medium 
term particularly impacts the Group’s ability to build homes that are considered fit for purpose as well as potentially incurring 
significantly increased costs. In the long term, climate change could cause significant disruption to operations. These risks are 
consistent with those identified through our own risk assessment process. Due to its medium to longer term impact, the Group 
has assessed the impact of climate change on the viability of the business, as disclosed within the Viability Statement on page 99.

As part of our identification of key audit matters, we therefore assessed there to be an element of risk in relation to climate change 
as part of margin recognition. There is a risk that the forecast costs to complete do not include appropriate assumptions relating to 
climate change, for example, additional costs to ensure the homes meet customer and investor expectations. In addition to our 
procedures outlined in section 5.1 above, we have read the climate change related disclosures within the other information 
included in the annual report to consider whether they are materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge  
obtained during the audit. 

8. Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in 
our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives 
rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

9. Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.

In preparing the Financial Statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

10.  Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial 
Statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which 
our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. 

11.1. Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with 
laws and regulations, we considered the following:

 ∙ the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the Group’s 

remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;

 ∙ the Group’s own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error;

 ∙ results of our enquiries of management, internal audit, internal legal counsel, the directors and the Audit Committee about their 

own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities, including those that are specific to the Group’s sector; 

 ∙ any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the Group’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:

 ∙ identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;

 ∙ detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;

 ∙ the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;

 ∙ the matters discussed among the audit engagement team and relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, fraud and IT 

specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.

As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud 
and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: margin recognition and costs associated with legacy 
properties. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to 
the risk of management override.

We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the Group operates in, focusing on provisions of 
those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, Building 
Safety Regulations and tax legislation.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements 
but compliance with which may be fundamental to the Group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included 
environmental and health and safety regulations.

11.2. Audit response to risks identified
As a result of performing the above, we identified margin recognition and costs associated with legacy properties as key audit matters 
related to the potential risk of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations. The key audit matters section of our report explains 
the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters.

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:

 ∙ reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions 

of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the Financial Statements;

 ∙ enquiring of management, the Audit Committee, in-house and external legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation 

and claims;

 ∙ performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material 

misstatement due to fraud;

 ∙ reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports; and

 ∙ in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and 

other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; 
and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members 
including internal specialists, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations 
throughout the audit.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

 ∙ the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 

are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

 ∙ the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and their environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

13. Corporate Governance Statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part 
of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 
Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit: 

 ∙ the directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any 

material uncertainties identified set out on page 99;

 ∙ the directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the Group’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the 

period is appropriate set out on page 99;

 ∙ the directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 171;

 ∙ the board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 72;

 ∙ the section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems 

set out on pages 71 and 72; and

 ∙ the section describing the work of the audit committee set out on page 127.

14. Matters on which we are required to report by exception
14.1. Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

 ∙ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

 ∙ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 

from branches not visited by us; or

 ∙ the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

14.2. Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

15. Other matters which we are required to address
15.1. Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held 
in 2007 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2008 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is 16 years, covering the years ending 
30 June 2008 to 30 June 2023.

15.2. Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit Committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee we are required to provide in accordance with 
ISAs (UK).

16. Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.

As required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.1.14R, these Financial 
Statements form part of the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) prepared Annual Financial Report filed on the National

Notes to the Financial Statements
Year ended 30 June 2023

1.  Basis of preparation
Introduction
The Financial Statements for the Group and Company have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted IAS in conformity with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and in accordance with UK adopted IFRS. The Financial Statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of share-based payments.

 Group accounting policies

The significant Group accounting policies are included within the relevant notes to the Financial Statements on pages 188 to 
234.

 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with UK adopted IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of 
the amounts, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The Directors have made no individual critical accounting 
judgements that have a significant impact upon the Financial Statements, apart from those involving estimations.

The most significant estimates made by the Directors in these Financial Statements, which are the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty that may have a significant risk of causing a material difference to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year, are:

•  Margin recognition — see note 3; and

•  Costs associated with legacy properties — see note 20.

Basis of consolidation
The Group Financial Statements include the results of Barratt Developments PLC (the Company), a public company limited by 
shares and incorporated in the United Kingdom, and all of its subsidiary undertakings, made up to 30 June. The Financial Statements 
of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date that control passes to the Group, and up to the date control ceases. 
Control is achieved when the Group becomes entitled to the variable returns of the subsidiary and becomes exposed to its risks, 
and has the power to affect these risks and returns. Acquired entities are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. 
All transactions with subsidiaries and intercompany profits or losses are eliminated on consolidation.

Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the Financial Statements, the Directors are required to consider whether 
the Group and Company can continue to meet their liabilities and other obligations for the foreseeable future.

The Group’s business activities, together with factors that the Directors consider are likely to affect its development, financial 
performance and financial position, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 100. The material financial and operational 
risks and uncertainties that may affect the Group’s performance and their mitigation are outlined on pages 71 to 77, and financial 
risks including liquidity, market, credit and capital risks are outlined in note 30 to the Financial Statements.

At 30 June 2023, the Group held cash of £1,269.1m and total loans and borrowings of £203.4m, consisting of £3.4m of overdrafts 
repayable on demand and £200.0m Sterling USPP notes maturing in August 2027. These balances, set against pre-paid facility 
fees, comprise the Group’s net cash of £1,069.4m, presented in note 18.

Should further funding be required, the Group has a committed £700.0m RCF, subject to compliance with certain financial 
covenants, that matures in November 2027, with two further one-year extension periods through to November 2029, if agreed 
between the Group and its lenders. 

As such, in consideration of its net current assets of £5,265.9m, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient liquidity 
to meet its current liabilities and working capital requirements.

Whilst the underlying fundamentals of the housing market remain attractive, uncertainty in the current market has increased. This 
has arisen from the ongoing impact of interest rate rises on mortgage affordability, industry-specific challenges such as further 
building safety costs or greenhouse gas emissions legislation along with material cost inflation and supply chain disruption. These, 
and other economic disruptions, could result in flat or negative economic growth, reduced buyer confidence, reduced mortgage 
availability and affordability, falls in house prices or land values and cost increases associated with raw materials, suppliers, 
subcontractors and employees.

The Group’s financial forecasts reflect the outcomes that the Directors consider most likely, based on the information available 
at the date of signing of these Financial Statements. 

1.  Basis of preparation continued
Going concern continued
To assess the Group’s resilience to more adverse outcomes, its forecast performance was sensitised to reflect a series of 
scenarios based on the Group’s principal risks and the downside prospects for the UK economy and housing market presented 
in the latest available external economic forecasts.

This exercise included a reasonable worst-case scenario in which the Group’s principal risks manifest in aggregate to a severe but 
plausible level. This assumed that average selling prices fall by 10%, sales volumes fall by 25% and construction costs increase by 
3% in addition to the base forecasts, in addition to the implementation of a building safety levy and the acceleration of regulatory 
changes to reduce indirect greenhouse gas emissions.

The effects were modelled over the 12 months from the date of signing of these Financial Statements, alongside reasonable 
mitigation that the Group would expect to undertake in such circumstances, primarily a reduction in investment in inventories in 
line with the fall in expected sales and a 50% reduction in uncommitted land spend. In all scenarios, including the reasonable worst 
case, the Group is able to comply with its financial covenants, operate within its current facilities and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due. 

Furthermore, reverse stress testing was performed to determine the market conditions in which the Group would cease to be able 
to operate under its current facilities within 12 months from the date of signing these Financial Statements. Based on past experience 
and current economic forecasts, the Directors consider the possibility of this outcome to be remote and have identified mitigation 
that would be adopted in such circumstances.

Accordingly, the Directors consider there to be no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to 
continue to operate as a going concern. They have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group and 
Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from 
the date of signing of these Financial Statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation 
of these Financial Statements.

Application of accounting standards
During the year ended 30 June 2023, the Group has applied accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those 
applied in the prior year. 

During the year, the Group has adopted the following new and revised standards and interpretations that have had no impact on the 
Financial Statements:

 ∙ Annual improvements 2018 — 2020: Amendments to IFRS 1 permitting a subsidiary as a first time adopter to apply cumulative 
translation differences; amendment to IFRS 9 clarifying fees to include when applying the 10% test in assessing derecognition of 
financial liabilities; amendment to IFRS 16 to resolve confusion over the treatment of leasehold incentives; and the amendment to 
IAS 41 regarding removing the requirement to exclude cash flows for taxation when measuring fair value;

 ∙ Amendment to IAS 37: Specifying which costs to include in calculating the liability, specifically those costs related to fulfilling a contract;

 ∙ Amendments to IFRS 3: Updating a reference to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting; and

 ∙ Amendment to IAS 16: Prohibiting deduction of sales proceeds from the cost of property, plant and equipment.

Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of approval of these Financial Statements, there were a number of standards, amendments and interpretations that have 
been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2023 and later periods. None of these 
are expected to have a material impact on the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation.

2.  Revenue
The Group’s revenue derives principally from the sale of the homes we build.

 Revenue from the sale of residential and commercial properties

Revenue is recognised at legal completion in respect of the total proceeds of building and development. Revenue is measured 
at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for the property, net of 
discounts and VAT.

 Revenue on contracts recognised over time

The Group considers all contracts with commercial customers and registered providers for affordable housing on a contract 
by contract basis and determines the appropriate revenue recognition based on the particular terms of that contract. For the 
majority of such contracts, there is a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognised at a point in time, when 
construction has been completed and control is transferred to the customer. The Group recognises revenue over time in relation 
to certain contracts with registered providers only in circumstances in which control of the associated land is transferred to the 
customer before or during construction. Revenue is only recognised from the point at which control of the associated land is 
transferred, considering the rights to economic benefit as well as legal title. Revenue is recognised because the construction 
activity enhances an asset that is controlled by the customer.

Where the outcome of a contract on which revenue is recognised over time can be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised by 
reference to the stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys of work 
performed to date. The Group is satisfied that it is appropriate to measure performance by reference to surveys of work performed 
to date, because these surveys identify the extent to which benefits have been transferred to the customer. Variations to, and claims 
arising in respect of, such contracts are included in revenue to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer. Where the 
outcome of a contract on which revenue is recognised over time cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised to the extent of 
contract costs incurred. When it is probable that the total costs on a contract will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is 
immediately recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.

 Other revenue

Revenue from separate contracts related to the development of homes is recognised on completion of the performance 
obligation to which it relates and included in other revenue. Revenue from warranties is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the warranty period. Revenue from commercial contract management fees is recognised in the period in which it 
becomes receivable and included within other revenue. Revenue from planning promotion agreements is recognised at 
the point at which contractual obligations are satisfied.

An analysis of the Group’s continuing revenue is as follows:

Revenue from private residential sales
Revenue from affordable residential sales
Revenue from commercial sales
Revenue from planning promotion agreements

1   Residential completions exclude JV completions of 828 homes (2022: 746) in which the Group has an interest.

Included within Group revenue is £192.7m (2022: £75.0m) of revenue from construction contracts on which revenue is recognised 
over time by reference to the stage of completion of work on the contracts (note 21). Of this amount, £4.0m (2022: £5.3m) was 
included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the year.

Revenue includes £274.5m (2022: £171.3m) of revenue generated where the sale has been achieved using part-exchange 
incentives. Proceeds received on the disposal of part-exchange properties are not included in revenue on the basis that they 
are incidental to the main revenue-generating activities of the Group.

3.  Profit from operations
Profit from operations includes all of the revenue and costs derived from the Group’s operating businesses. Profit from operations 
excludes finance costs, finance income, the Group’s share of profits or losses from JVs and tax.

The Group’s principal activity is housebuilding. None of the other business activities undertaken by the Group, individually or in 
aggregate, account for more than 10% of the Group’s revenue, profit or total assets and do not meet the IFRS 8 thresholds for 
disclosure. The operating results of these activities are not presented separately to the Board. Therefore, no segmental 
information is presented in these Financial Statements.

 Margin recognition

In order to determine the profit that the Group is able to recognise on its developments in a specific period, the Group allocates 
site-wide development costs between homes built in the current year and in future years. It also has to estimate costs to 
complete on such developments and make estimates relating to future sales price margins on those developments and 
homes. In making these assessments there is a degree of inherent uncertainty.

The Group’s site valuation process determines the forecast profit margin for each site. The valuation process acts as a method of 
allocating land costs and construction work in progress costs of a development to each individual plot and drives the recognition 
of costs in the Income Statement as each plot is sold. Any changes in the forecast profit margin of a site from changes in sales 
prices or costs to complete are recognised across all homes sold in both the current period and future periods. This ensures that 
the forecast site margin achieved on each individual home is equal for all current year completions and future plots across the 
development.

Management has performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of a change in estimated future costs or forecast 
selling prices for developments on which sales were recognised in the year. A 3% increase in the forecast costs to complete 
would increase site-cost allocation in cost of sales in 2023 by £38.5m, resulting in a reduction in gross margin of 70 bps. A 3% 
increase in forecast private sales prices would reduce site-cost allocation in cost of sales in 2023 by £44.4m, resulting in an 
improvement in gross margin of 80 bps.

 Depreciation of right-of-use assets

Right-of-use assets are depreciated in the Income Statement in equal instalments to the earlier of the end of the lease term 
or the end of the useful life of the asset.

 Part-exchange income and expenses

Income on the sale of a part-exchange property is recognised at legal completion at the fair value of consideration received 
or receivable for the property.

Part-exchange properties are recognised in inventories at the lower of cost, being their fair value at acquisition, and their net 
realisable value. The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value, or reversal of a previous write-down, 
is recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which it occurs.

The carrying amount of a part-exchange property is recognised as an expense in the period in which the related income is recognised. 
Maintenance costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.

Profit from operations is stated after charging/(crediting):

Cost of inventories recognised as an expense in cost of sales

Employee costs (including Directors)

Adjusted items:
Costs associated with legacy properties

Amounts associated with legacy properties recovered from third parties

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment

In determining whether an item should be presented as an adjustment to IFRS measures, the Group considers items that are material 
to the Group in aggregate and have arisen from one-off or unusual circumstances that could not reasonably have been expected to 
arise from normal trading. If an item meets these criteria the Board then exercises judgement as to whether the item should be 
classified as an allowable adjustment to IFRS. Examples of events that may give rise to the classification of items as adjusted are 
charges or credits in respect of legacy properties, the restructuring of existing and newly acquired businesses, and certain 
government grants.

The Directors use these adjusted measures, along with IFRS measures, to assess the operational performance of the Group as 
detailed in the key performance indicators section of the Strategic Report on pages 16 to 19.

Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates several defined contribution pension schemes.

 Defined contribution schemes

The Group’s contributions to the schemes are charged in the Income Statement in the year in which the scheme members 
become entitled to contributions.

The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees, under which it pays contributions 
to independently administered funds. Contributions are based upon a fixed percentage of the employee’s pay and once these have 
been paid, the Group has no further obligations under these schemes.

The current year tax charge has been provided for, by the Group, at a standard effective rate, inclusive of RPDT, of 24.5% (2022: 20.0%) 
and by the Company at a standard effective rate of 20.5% (2022: 19.0%). The closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been 
provided in these Financial Statements at a rate of 20.5% — 29.0% (2022: 19.0% — 29.0%) on the temporary differences giving rise 
to these assets and liabilities.

 Tax

The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have then been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and is charged or credited to the Income Statement, except when it 
relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in other comprehensive income or equity.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries 
and interests in JVs, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they 
relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Tax recognised in the Income Statement 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The deferred tax liability in respect of indefinite life and other brands represents the amount of tax that would become due if the 
brands were sold at their book value. There is no intention to sell the indefinite life brands in the foreseeable future and it is not 
anticipated that any of the deferred tax liability in respect of the indefinite life brands will reverse in the 12 months following the 
balance sheet date. The deferred tax asset in respect of share schemes represents an estimate of the future tax deduction 
available on the exercise or vesting of awards under those schemes.

While it is anticipated that an element of the remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse during the 12 months 
following the balance sheet date, at present it is not possible to accurately quantify the value of all of these reversals.

In addition to the deferred tax liability shown above, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of £9.6m (2022: £2.1m) in respect 
of capital and other losses amounting to £33.3m (2022: £10.0m) because these are not considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the EBT that do not attract 
dividend equivalents and which are treated as cancelled.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share options 
from the start of the year.

During the year, the Company has bought back and cancelled 47,985,293 of its own shares (2022: nil). The impact of this has been 
to increase basic earnings per share by 1.1 pence and diluted earnings per share by 1.2 pence.

Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of adjusted items and any associated net tax amounts.

10.  Goodwill and intangible assets

 Goodwill

Goodwill arising on consolidation (see note 32 for the Group policy on consolidation) represents the excess of the fair value 
of the consideration over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses is capitalised as an asset but reviewed for 
impairment at least annually.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination at acquisition. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested 
for impairment. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.

The Group’s goodwill relating to the acquisition of Wilson Bowden Limited in 2007 has a carrying value of £792.2m and 
goodwill relating to the 2019 acquisition of Oregon Timber Frame Limited has a carrying value of £13.7m, both relating to the 
housebuilding business.

During the prior year, the Group acquired all of the share capital of Gladman Developments Limited. Goodwill of £47.0m arising on 
the acquisition was capitalised and allocated to the Group’s acquired land promotion business. No revision of the acquisition 
accounting for Gladman Developments Limited was necessary in the current year.

10.  Goodwill and intangible assets continued
Other intangible assets 

 Brands

The Group has capitalised, as intangible assets, brands that have been acquired. Acquired brand values are calculated using 
discounted cash flows. Where a brand is considered to have a finite life, it is amortised over its useful life on a straight-line 
basis. Where a brand is capitalised with an indefinite life, it is not amortised. The factors that contribute to the durability of 
brands capitalised are that there are no material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that 
limit the useful life of these intangible assets. Internally generated brands are not capitalised.

The Group carries out an annual impairment review of indefinite life brand as part of the review of the carrying value of 
goodwill, by performing a value in use calculation, using a discount factor based upon the Group’s pre-tax weighted average 
cost of capital.

 Customer contract relationships

The Group has capitalised, as intangible assets, acquired customer contract relationships. Customer contract relationships 
are valued at the present value of future cash flows and are amortised on a straight-line basis over ten years. Internally 
generated customer contract relationships are not capitalised.

 Customer contracts

The Group has capitalised, as intangible assets, acquired customer contracts. Customer contracts are valued at the present 
value of future cash flows less contributory asset charges and are amortised on a straight-line basis in line with contract 
relationships at the acquisition date.

The Group does not amortise the housebuilding brand acquired with Wilson Bowden, being David Wilson Homes, valued at £100.0m, 
as the Directors consider that this brand has an indefinite useful economic life due to the Group intending to hold and support the 
brand for an indefinite period, and there are no factors that would prevent it from doing so.

During the prior year, in its acquisition of Gladman Developments Limited, the Group acquired brands valued at £10.8m and customer 
contracts valued at £98.9m. The customer contracts are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the contracts; the 
brands acquired are amortised on a straight-line basis over a 20-year period.

 Impairment of goodwill and indefinite life brand

Impairment reviews for goodwill and the Group’s indefinite life brand require an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which these assets are allocated. The value in use calculations require an estimate of expected 
future cash flows, including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs, and require the determination of a suitable 
discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows. The financial forecasts used reflect the outcomes that 
management considers most likely, based on the information available at the date of signing of these Financial Statements.

Goodwill and indefinite life brand allocated to housebuilding
An impairment review was performed at 30 April 2023 by comparing the value in use of the housebuilding business to the carrying 
value of its tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill.

The value in use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding business. The cash flows until 30 
June 2025 were determined using the Group’s approved detailed business plan and the cash flows for FY26 to FY28 were based on high 
level management projections based upon expected volumes, selling prices and margins, taking into account available land purchases 
and work in progress levels. The cash flows for subsequent years were extrapolated in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 1%, 
based upon the historical long-term growth rate of the UK economy. 

The key assumptions for the value in use calculation for the housebuilding business were:

 ∙ expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact on operating margin: these are determined on a 

site-by-site basis in the Group’s approved business plan dependent upon local market conditions and product type. For subsequent 
years, these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market, 
considering external market forecasts;

 ∙ sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis in the Group’s approved business plan dependent upon local market 
conditions, land availability and planning permissions. For subsequent years, these have been estimated at a Group level based 
on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market, taking into account external market forecasts;

 ∙ expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis in the Group’s approved business plan 
dependent upon the expected costs of completing all aspects of each individual development. For subsequent years, these have 
been estimated at a Group level based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market, taking into account 
external market forecasts; and

 ∙ discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate reflecting the Group’s target capital structure, risks appropriate to the housebuilding 
business and current market assessments of the time value of money. A rate of 15.0% (2022: 14.9%) is considered by the 
Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax discount rate.

The result of the value in use exercise concluded that the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets allocated to the 
housebuilding business exceeded its carrying value by £1,176.0m (2022: £1,780.4m) and there has been no impairment.

Goodwill allocated to land promotion
An impairment review was performed at 30 June 2023 by comparing the value in use of the land promotion business to the carrying 
value of its tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill.

The value in use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the land promotion business. This is the first full 
year after the land promotion business was acquired by the Group. The operating cycle for the land promotion business extends over 
a longer period than the housebuilding business, with land sales completing at the point in an economic cycle that generates the most 
profit. Inventories held at the current date may generate cash inflows in the medium- to long-term and as a result, management’s 
forecasts extend up to ten years from the reporting date. It is therefore appropriate to consider projections over a longer period in 
the value in use calculation. Cash flows until 30 June 2032 were determined using the business’s approved forecast, dependent upon 
expected site permissions and best estimates for targeted site sales, anticipated spend and overhead inflation. Due to the sensitivity 
of cash flows of the land promotion business to the economic cycle, the cash flows for years subsequent to 2032 were based on an 
average sales receipts from the final five years of the forecast, adjusted for expected increases in cost, extrapolated in perpetuity 
using an estimated growth rate of 1%, based upon the historical long-term growth rate of the UK economy. Value in use assessments 
going forward will be completed over equivalent periods.

The key assumptions for the value in use calculation were the expected sales values achieved under land promotion agreements, based on 
current market values for similar land, costs required to fulfil customer contracts, and the discount rate of 14.3% (2022: 15.0%), being a 
pre-tax rate reflecting the risks appropriate to the land promotion business and current market assessments of the time value of money.

The result of the value in use exercise concluded that the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to the land promotion business 
exceeded its carrying value by £13.1m (2022: £9.6m) and there has been no impairment. An increase in the discount rate of 60 bps 
would reduce the headroom of the recoverable amount over the carrying value to nil.

The Company’s interests in subsidiary undertakings are accounted for at cost less accumulated provision for impairment, 
which is reviewed annually.

Where share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary undertakings by the Company, they are treated 
as a capital contribution to the subsidiary and the Company’s investment in the subsidiary is increased accordingly.

Investments in jointly controlled entities

12. 
A jointly controlled entity (joint venture or “JV”) is an entity, including unincorporated entities such as partnerships, in which the Group 
holds an interest with one or more other parties where a contractual arrangement has established joint control over the entity. 

The Group has no associated entities.

 Jointly controlled entities

Investments in jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

The Group’s share of the profit or loss of jointly controlled entities increases or decreases the carrying amount of the investment 
and long-term interests.

*   JV prepares Financial Statements which are non-coterminous with the Group in order to comply with the terms of their JV agreements and to align with 

the year ends and requirements of our JV partners.

Judgements applied in determining the classification of joint arrangements
1.   The Group’s interests in a number of the entities classified as JVs are held indirectly: Barratt Wates (East Grinstead) No. 2 Limited is a wholly owned 

subsidiary of the Group’s JV, Barratt Wates (East Grinstead) Limited, and is therefore, classified as a JV of the Group. BDWZest Developments LLP, Alie 
Street LLP, Queensland Road LLP, Fulham Wharf LLP and Nine Elms LLP form a group of limited liability partnerships jointly owned (directly or indirectly) 
by BDWZest LLP and ZestBDW LLP, both of which are JVs of the Group. Nine Elms One Limited and Nine Elms Two Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries 
of Nine Elms LLP, and Fulham Wharf One Limited and Fulham Wharf Two Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of Fulham Wharf LLP. All of these entities 
are, therefore, classified as JVs of the Group.

2.   The Group holds four JV investments (Barratt Wates (Horley) Limited, Barratt Metropolitan LLP, Wembley Park Properties LLP and Blackhorse Road 
Properties LLP) not in equal share, and one (Ravenscraig Limited) with more than one other party. However, in each case, the Group has equal voting 
rights and control over the activities of the companies with the other parties. In addition, the Group and the other parties to the agreements only have 
rights to the net assets of these companies through the terms of the contractual arrangements. These entities are therefore classified as JVs.

12. 
The Group has made loans, net of loss allowances, of £66.5m (2022: £94.0m) to its JVs, which are presented within Group investments. 
The loss allowances for Group loans to JVs are equal to 12-month expected credit losses unless there has been a significant increase 
in credit risk since the date of initial recognition, in which case, the loss allowance is equal to the lifetime expected credit loss. 
A significant increase in credit risk is judged to have occurred if a review of available information indicates an increased probability 
of default. At 30 June 2023, the loss allowance is immaterial (2022: immaterial).

Included within the Group’s share of net assets of JVs is a proportion of the loans to the JVs (net of fair value adjustments made 
in one JV), calculated using the Group’s ownership share, of £63.6m (2022: £90.3m).

During the year, the Group entered into a number of transactions with its JVs in respect of funding and development management 
services (with charges made based on the utilisation of these services) in addition to the provision of construction services. Further 
details on these transactions are provided in note 30. The Group and Company have a number of contingent liabilities relating to their 
JVs. Further details on these are provided in note 29.

The transfer of funds from the Group’s JVs to the Group is determined by the terms of the JV agreements, which specify how available 
funds should be applied in repaying loans and capital, and distributing profits to the partners.

Inventories

 Inventories

A right-of-use asset and a lease liability are recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is initially 
measured at cost comprising the initial amount of the lease liability plus payments made before the lease commenced and any 
direct costs less any incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from 
the commencement of the lease to the earlier of the end of the lease term or the end of the useful life of the asset. The right-of-use 
asset is also reduced for impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments at the commencement date discounted 
using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate of between 0% and 7%, and is subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in the future lease payments, and 
a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset.

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of plant and machinery 
with a lease term of 12 months or less, and leases of low value including leases of office equipment. The lease payments 
associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Group and Company lease assets including land and buildings, vehicles, plant and machinery, and office equipment. 
Information about leases for which the Group or Company is a lessee is presented below.

The total Group cash outflow for leases in the current year was £48.4m (Company: £1.3m) (2022: £45.9m (Company £1.1m)), of which 
£13.9m (Company: £1.3m) (2022: £13.8m (Company: £1.1m)) related to the repayment of lease liabilities recognised in the Balance Sheet.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Land held for development, including land in the course of 
development, is initially recorded at cost. Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, the carrying value differs from the 
amount that will ultimately be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in the Income Statement 
over the period of settlement.

Cost of construction work in progress comprises direct materials, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been 
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Overhead costs include, but are not limited to, 
roads and other infrastructure costs required for a site and local contributions and physical works contributions required 
under planning permissions granted for our developments.

Due to the scale of the Group’s developments, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between homes built in the 
current year and in future years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such developments. In making these assessments, 
there is a degree of inherent uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls to assess and review carrying values and the 
appropriateness of estimates made. Further information is included in the margin recognition section of note 3.

Work in progress on promotion agreements comprises direct fees and labour costs incurred in investigating, designing, 
master planning, obtaining planning permission and ultimately securing sales agreements for land on behalf of landowners. 
The satisfaction of promotion agreements is largely dependent upon the grant of planning consent; therefore, management 
assesses the likelihood of attaining these consents when assessing their carrying values.

Nature and carrying value of inventories
The Group’s principal activities are housebuilding and commercial development. The majority of the development activity is not 
contracted prior to the development commencing. Accordingly, the Group has in its Balance Sheet at 30 June 2023 current assets 
that are not covered by a forward sale. The Group’s internal controls are designed to identify any developments where the balance 
sheet value of land and work in progress is more than the projected lower of cost or net realisable value. During the year, the Group 
has conducted six-monthly reviews of the net realisable value of specific sites identified as at high risk of impairment, based upon 
a number of criteria including low site profit margins and sites with no forecast completions. Where the estimated net realisable 
value of a site was less than its current carrying value, the Group has impaired the land and work in progress value.

During the year, due to performance variations, changes in assumptions and changes to viability on individual sites, there were 
gross impairment charges of £16.7m (2022: £2.0m) and gross impairment reversals of £12.0m (2022: £4.2m), resulting in a net 
impairment charge of £4.7m (2022: £2.2m reversal) included within profit from operations.

The key estimates in these reviews are those used to estimate the realisable value of a site, which is determined by forecast sales 
rates, expected sales prices and estimated costs to complete. 

The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature, although the Group’s operational cycle is such that a 
proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months. It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory 
will be realised, as this will be subject to a number of variables such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.

Inventories include £11.0m (2022: £nil) in respect of properties currently occupied under the refugee support scheme.

17.  Trade and other receivables

 Trade and other receivables

17.  Trade and other receivables continued
The carrying values of trade and other receivables are stated after allowance for expected credit losses. The movements in the 
loss allowances for the year were as follows:

Trade and other receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, which 
are classified as non-current assets. Amounts recoverable on certain construction contracts where revenue is recognised over 
time are included in trade receivables and stated at cost plus attributable profit less any foreseeable losses. Payments received 
on account for these construction contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable on these contracts.

Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at their transaction price, being fair value, and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost, being their nominal value less a loss allowance for expected credit losses, which are assessed on the basis 
of an average weighting of the risk of default. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.

For this purpose, a default is determined to have occurred if the Group becomes aware of evidence that it will not receive all 
contractual cash flows that are due or if payment has not been received within 60 days of the due date. After this time, it is 
probable that contractual cash flows will not be fully recovered.

The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

Trade receivables are receivables and contract assets arising from the Group’s contracts with customers. The loss allowance 
is equal to the lifetime expected credit loss, assessed on an individual basis.

The loss allowances for other receivables and amounts due from subsidiary undertakings are equal to 12-month expected 
credit losses unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the date of initial recognition, in which case the 
loss allowance is equal to the lifetime expected credit loss. A significant increase in credit risk is judged to have occurred if a 
review of available information indicates an increased probability of default, or if contractual payments are more than 30 days 
past due.

Where amounts due from subsidiary undertakings can be satisfied by the subsidiaries through the recovery of a debt from 
fellow subsidiaries with strong capacity to meet that debt, the amount is considered to have low credit risk at the reporting 
date and it is therefore assumed that the credit risk has not significantly increased.

Trade and other receivables that are more than two years overdue are deemed to have no reasonable expectation of recovery 
and are written off in the Financial Statements, but are still subject to enforcement activity. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited to the Income Statement.

Movements in loss allowances are principally a result of the derecognition and origination of financial assets in the year. The loss 
allowances written off are equal to the gross carrying amounts of the assets written off in the year. The Directors consider that the 
carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.

The expected credit losses on the Company amounts due from subsidiary undertakings are not material to the Financial 
Statements. The subsidiaries are are able to pay their liabilities as they fall due and the probability of default is insignificant.

Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 22.

 Loans and borrowings

Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, being the amount recorded at recognition plus accrued interest applied to the 
account less any repayments made.

All debt facilities at 30 June 2023 are unsecured.

The principal features of the Group’s committed debt facilities at 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022 were as follows:

19.  Trade and other payables

 Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent measurement is at 
amortised cost.

Trade and other payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of 
acquisition of the asset to which they relate by discounting at prevailing market interest rates at the date of recognition. The 
discount to nominal value, which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, is amortised over the period of 
the credit term and charged to finance costs using the “effective interest rate” method.

Accruals include a social security accrual relating to share-based payments (note 27). Other payables classified as non-current 
liabilities at 30 June 2023 include amounts accrued for payment of the CITB levy and other sundry accruals.

The Group has £244.4m (2022: £365.2m) of payables secured by legal charges on land and buildings included within inventories 
and £nil (2022: £3.1m) supported by promissory notes. Other non-current payables are unsecured and non-interest bearing.

 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of 
the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material.

Costs in relation to completed developments
Following the legal completion and handover to customers of all units on a site, the Group may retain obligations which are not 
settled for a number of years. These include costs in relation to the adoption of roads or public open space by local authorities, 
other contractual obligations to third parties and, in certain cases, the costs of remedial works where defects have been identified.

Whilst a proportion of this cost will not be realised within 12 months, the Group has an obligation to complete the works 
immediately should it be requested to do so. The balance in total is therefore considered to be current in nature. All outstanding 
issues on completed developments are resolved as soon as is practicable.

 Costs associated with legacy properties

External wall systems and associated review
On 13 March 2023, the Group signed the Self-Remediation Terms and Contract, codifying the commitments previously made 
under the Building Safety Pledge to undertake or to fund remediation or mitigation works on external wall systems (EWS) on 
all buildings of 11 metres or above in England and Wales that it has developed or refurbished in the 30 years preceding the date 
of the Building Safety Pledge, and to reimburse the Government’s Building Safety fund wherever they have contributed to such 
activities. The Group has provided for the cost of fulfilling this commitment, as well as assisting with remedial work identified 
at a limited number of other legacy properties where it has a legal liability to do so, where relevant build issues have been 
identified, or it is considered probable that such build issues exist.

The Group is undertaking a review of all of its current and legacy buildings where it has used EWS or cladding solutions and 
continues to assess the action required in line with the latest updates to Government guidance, as it applies, to multi-storey 
and multi-occupied residential buildings. All our buildings, including those incorporating EWS or cladding solutions, were 
signed off by approved inspectors as compliant with the relevant Building Regulations at the time of completion.

This is a complex area requiring significant estimates with respect to the estimates for the number of buildings affected, the 
individual remediation requirements of each building and the costs associated with that remediation (see also note 29). During 
the year, following the identification of further buildings requiring remediation and the receipt of more detailed cost estimates 
on buildings for which a full assessment of the work required has been completed, an additional £213.4m has been provided 
for the remediation of external wall systems. For buildings on which a detailed cost assessment has yet to be performed, this 
assumes an updated cost per plot of c. £23,000 (2022: c. £21,000), plus an estimate of future cost price inflation over the 
expected period until the remediation is completed. The new buildings came into scope during the year because buildings 
which held valid EWS1 certificates at 30 June 2022 were found to require remediation, or because of new contact from, or 
information supplied by, building owners. All building owners were contacted again following the signing of the Self-
Remediation Terms on 13 March 2023, which led to an increase in contact from building owners during the year. An additional 
contingency was also allowed to reflect further buildings being identified as within the scope of the Self-Remediation Terms 
and Contract and for unforeseen remediation costs beyond management’s current knowledge. Provisions of £41.1m (2022: 
£12.8m) were released in respect of buildings that were found to either require less remediation than expected or for which no 
remediation is required. 

It has been assumed that the majority of the work will be completed over the next five years. This depends on a number of 
factors including timely engagement by building owners and remediation work being completed in line with our estimated 
timings. Accordingly, the provision has been discounted to its present value at the reporting date, resulting in a credit to cost of 
sales of £51.9m (2022: £nil) due to an increase in the discount rate in the period from 1.9% to 4.7% driven by higher gilt rates 
at the year end.

The investigation of the works required at many of the buildings is at an early stage and therefore it is possible that these 
estimates will change over time or if government legislation and regulation further evolves. In relation to the Scottish Safer 
Buildings Accord, signed on 31 May 2023, the external wall provision is recorded on the basis that the standard of remediation 
required in Scotland is consistent with England and Wales. This will be confirmed when the final contract with the Scottish 
government is signed.

The estimates are based on key assumptions that will be updated as work and time progresses. The sensitivity of the 
provision held at the balance sheet date to the following possible movements in key assumptions is shown below, assuming 
that the contingency is not utilised:

Sensitivity
10% increase in estimated cost per plot
10% increase in the number of buildings on which a detailed cost assessment has yet to be performed

Reinforced concrete frames 
As announced in July 2020, we took the decision to pay for required remedial action on the reinforced concrete frame at 
the Citiscape development in Croydon and undertook an associated review of 27 other developments designed by the same 
engineering firm or its associated companies. This review is substantially complete and remediation work is ongoing. During 
the period, a net additional £37.2m was recognised in respect of increases in the estimated remediation costs on certain 
properties under this review, including £18.6m incurred on one development on which remediation plans have now been 
finalised. The estimates are based on key assumptions that will be updated as work and time progresses.

It is now anticipated that remediation on these buildings will extend beyond one year from the balance sheet date. Accordingly, 
the provision has been discounted to its present value using a rate of 4.7%, consistent with the EWS provision.

 Classification and measurement

Reinforced concrete frames continued
In addition to this review, structural issues have been separately found at two developments where reinforced concrete frames 
were designed for us by a different engineering firm to that employed at Citiscape. The full extent of the remediation work 
required is not yet known, however, £7.6m has been provided at the balance sheet date. The buildings affected are still being 
assessed and therefore this provision may need to be increased in future periods (see note 29)

Management have made estimates as to the future costs, extent of the remedial works required and the costs of providing 
alternative accommodation to any residents affected by the remedial works. The Financial Statements have been prepared 
based on currently available information, including known costs and quotations where possible. However, the extent, cost 
and timing of remedial work may change as work progresses.

All non-derivative financial assets are classified in accordance with IFRS 9 as “subsequently measured at amortised cost”. 

All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as “subsequently measured at amortised cost”.

Financial assets and liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair value determined based on 
discounted cash flow analysis using current market rates for similar instruments. They are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the “effective interest rate” method. Financial assets are also measured after recognition of any impairment, which 
is included within administrative expenses in the Income Statement.

Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

21.  Contract assets and liabilities
Contract assets relate to amounts due from customers primarily for construction work completed but not invoiced at the balance 
sheet date in relation to contracts where revenue is recognised over time. These amounts are included in trade and other receivables. 
The Group has taken advantage of the practical expedient in paragraph 94 of IFRS 15 to immediately expense the incremental costs 
of obtaining contracts where the amortisation period of the assets would have been one year or less.

Contract liabilities relate to payments received from the customer on the contract, and/or amounts invoiced to the customer in 
advance of the Group performing its obligations on contracts where revenue is recognised either over time or at a point in time. 
These amounts are included within trade and other payables.

Significant changes in contract assets and liabilities are as follows:

At 1 July:
Amounts included within trade and other payables

Amounts included within trade and other receivables

Movements in the year:
Performance obligations satisfied in the year

Amounts invoiced in the year

Cash received for performance obligations not yet satisfied

At 30 June

Analysed as:

Further revenue of £104.3m (2022: £118.8m) is expected to be recognised in future years in respect of contracts on which revenue 
is recognised over time, of which 86.8% (2022: 16.9%) is expected to be recognised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

The Company had no contract assets or liabilities in either year.

22.  Financial instruments

 Recognition

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet in accordance with IFRS 9 when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.

The Group derecognises a financial liability only when the Group’s obligations are discharged or cancelled or they expire.

 Impairment

A loss allowance is recognised for expected credit losses on financial assets as described in note 17. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.

to the EBT. The EBT disposed of 3,254,817 (2022: 3,355,729) shares which were used to satisfy the vesting of ELTIP, LTPP and DBP 
awards. A further 18,101 shares were used in the year in settlement of exercises under Sharesave schemes (2022: none). 

27.  Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.

 Share-based payments

Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. Fair value is 
measured either using Black Scholes or Monte Carlo models depending on the characteristics of the scheme. Valuations have 
also been adjusted for any post-vesting holding period with the adjustment calculated using a Finnerty and Chaffe model. 

The fair value is expensed in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest where non-market vesting conditions apply. Non-vesting conditions are taken into 
account in the estimate of the fair value of the equity instruments.

27.  Share-based payments continued
Further information relating to the share-based payment schemes 
Sharesave 
Under the Sharesave, participants are required to make monthly contributions to an HMRC approved savings contract with a bank 
or building society for a period of three or five years. On entering into the savings contract, participants are granted an option to 
acquire ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price determined under the rules of the Sharesave. The Sharesave is open 
to all eligible employees as determined by the Board and is not subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions.

LTPP
The grant of awards under the LTPP is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee taking into account individual performance 
and overall performance of the Group. Vesting under this scheme is dependent upon performance conditions including TSR, EPS 
and ROCE. Further details can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 157 and 158.

DBP
Deferred shares are held in accordance with the DBP as approved by the shareholders at the 2015 AGM. The DBP is currently utilised 
to hold shares awarded in respect of any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary. Further details can be found on page 161.

ELTIP
The Board approved the 2022 Award in July 2022 and the 2021 Award in July 2021 under the ELTIP. The Awards were made to all 
eligible employees employed as at 15 July 2022 and 15 July 2021 respectively. Participants will be entitled to receive shares in the 
Company when the 2021 Award vests on 1 July 2023, and participants of the 2022 Award will be entitled to receive shares in the 
Company when the Award vests on 1 July 2024. Senior management is not eligible to participate in the ELTIP. The Awards are not 
subject to the satisfaction of any performance condition other than that participants remain employed by the Group and have not 
resigned before the end of the vesting period.

Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over a period consistent with 
the expected life of the options. The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on the Directors’ best estimate, for 
the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Group to access or use assets and settle liabilities. Detailed arrangements 
for each subsidiary are laid out in the relevant shareholder and partnership agreements.

29.  Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities related to subsidiaries
The Company has guaranteed certain bank borrowings of its subsidiary undertakings.

In the normal course of business, the Group has given counter-indemnities in respect of performance bonds and financial guarantees. 
Management estimates that the bonds and guarantees amount to £412.7m (2022: £420.7m) and confirms that, at the date of 
these Financial Statements, the possibility of cash outflow is considered minimal and no provision is required.

External wall systems and associated review
As disclosed in note 20, on 13 March 2023, the Group signed the Self-Remediation Terms and Contract, codifying the commitments 
previously made under the Building Safety Pledge. The Group is currently undertaking a review of all of its current and legacy 
buildings where it has used EWS or cladding solutions. Approved inspectors signed off all of our buildings, including the EWS or 
cladding used, as compliant with the relevant building regulations at the time of completion.

At 30 June 2023, the Group held provisions of £535.9m (2022: £434.6m) in relation to EWS and associated reviews, based on 
management’s best estimate of the cost and timing of remediation of in-scope buildings. It is possible that as remediation work 
proceeds, additional remedial works are required which do not relate to EWS or cladding solutions. Such works may not have been 
identified from the reviews and physical inspections undertaken to date and may only be identified when detailed remediation work 
is in progress. Therefore, the nature, timing and extent of any such costs was unknown at the balance sheet date.

It is also possible that the number of buildings requiring remediation may increase. This could occur because buildings which hold 
valid EWS1 certificates are found to require remediation or because investigatory works identify remediation not previously 
identified. 

In addition, we recognise that the retrospective review of building materials and fire-safety matters continues to evolve. The 
Financial Statements have been prepared based on currently available information and regulatory guidance. However, these 
estimates may be updated if government legislation and regulation further evolves.

On 31 May 2023 the Group signed the Scottish Safer Buildings Accord, committing to resolve life critical fire safety defects in 
multi-occupancy residential domestic or part-domestic buildings, over 11 metres, built by us as a developer in the period of 30 years 
to 1 June 2022. This Accord is not legally binding, but we are committed to working in good faith with the Scottish Government to agree 
a legal form contract. The Group is already undertaking remedial work at all multi-occupancy buildings over 11 metres in Scotland at 
which fire safety defects have been identified and the Group’s EWS provision at 30 June 2023 includes the estimated cost of this work. 
These estimates are based on the assumption that the standard of remediation required in Scotland is consistent with that in England 
and Wales and therefore depend on the final form of the contract agreed with the Scottish Government.

Reinforced concrete frames
As disclosed in note 20, following the issues identified at Citiscape, the Group is conducting a review of developments designed 
by the same engineering firm or its associated companies. The Financial Statements have been prepared based on currently 
available information; however, the detailed review is ongoing and the extent and cost of any remedial work may change as this 
work progresses.

Separately, during the year structural issues have been found at two developments where reinforced concrete frames were 
designed for us by a particular engineering firm. Investigatory work is proceeding to identify the remediation works required and 
associated cost. It is possible that further costs or additional buildings are identified as part of this review, the nature, timing and 
extent of which were unknown at the balance sheet date.

29.  Contingent liabilities continued
Contingent liabilities related to JVs 
The Group has given counter-indemnities in respect of performance bonds and financial guarantees to its JVs totalling £9.5m 
at 30 June 2023 (2022: £2.2m).

The Group has also given a number of performance guarantees in respect of the obligations of its JVs, requiring the Group to complete 
development agreement contractual obligations in the event that the JVs do not perform as required under the terms of the related 
contracts. At 30 June 2023, the probability of any loss to the Group resulting from these guarantees is considered to be remote.

Contingent liabilities related to legal claims
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimates of all known material legal claims and all legal actions in progress. The Group 
takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made (other than for legal costs) where 
the Directors consider, based on such advice, that claims or actions are unlikely to succeed, or a sufficiently reliable estimate 
of the potential obligations cannot be made.

31.  Financial risk management
The Group’s approach to risk management and the principal operational risks of the business are detailed on pages 71 to 77. The 
Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in note 22.

The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks, of which the most material are: liquidity risk, 
the availability of funding at reasonable margins, credit risk and interest rates. There is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and 
forecasting of cash flows from operations to senior management including Executive Directors to ensure that liquidity risks are promptly 
identified and appropriate mitigating actions are taken by the Treasury department. These forecasts are further stress-tested at a 
Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained. In addition, 
the Group has a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance.

The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury 
Operating Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board. The Treasury department implements guidelines that are 
established by the Board and the Treasury Operating Committee.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Group actively maintains a mixture of 
long-term and medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations. 

The Group’s borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April to May, and October to November of each 
year, due to seasonal trends in income. Accordingly, the Group maintains sufficient facility headroom to cover these requirements. 
On a normal operating basis, the Group has a policy of maintaining a minimum headroom of £150.0m. The Group identifies and takes 
appropriate actions based on its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations. The 
Group’s drawn debt, excluding fees, represented 22.6% (2022: 24.1%) of available committed facilities at 30 June 2023. In addition, 
the Group had £1,269.1m (2022: £1,352.7m) of cash and cash equivalents.

The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2023. The Group’s resilience to its principal risks has been 
modelled, together with possible mitigating actions, over a three-year period. At the date of approval of the Financial Statements, 
the Group’s internal forecasts indicate that it will be able to operate within its current facilities and remain in compliance with 
these covenants for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date of signing these Financial Statements.

One of the Group’s objectives is to minimise refinancing risk. The Group has a policy that the average maturity of its committed 
bank facilities and private placement notes is a minimum of two years with a target of two to three years. At 30 June 2023, the 
average maturity of the Group’s committed facilities was 4.4 years (2022: 3.8 years).

The Group maintains certain committed floating rate facilities with banks to ensure sufficient liquidity for its operations. The 
undrawn committed facilities available to the Group, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were as follows:

In addition, the Group had undrawn, uncommitted overdraft facilities available at 30 June 2023 of £37.0m (2022: £37.0m).

The Company had no derivative financial instruments at 30 June 2023 or 30 June 2022.

Market risk (price risk) 
Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow 
interest rate risk, and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.

The Group has a conservative treasury risk management strategy and the Group’s interest rates are set using fixed rate debt instruments.

Due to the level of the Group’s interest cover ratio, and in accordance with the Group’s policy to hedge a proportion of the forecast 
RCF drawings based on the Group’s three-year plan, no interest rate hedges are currently required.

The exposure of the Group’s financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows:

The Group retained a strong cash position throughout the year and, therefore, the Group did not draw on its RCF during the year 
and the use of other facilities was minimal. No interest was paid by the Group on floating rate borrowings in 2023 or 2022.

Sterling USPP notes of £200.0m were issued on 22 August 2017 with a fixed coupon of 2.77% and a ten-year maturity. These fixed 
rate notes expose the Group and Company to fair value interest rate risk.

1    In the prior year, interest-bearing loans from Group undertakings of £310.0m were disclosed as non-interest-bearing financial liabilities. These have been 

reclassified to floating rate financial liabilities.

31.  Financial risk management continued
Market risk (price risk) continued
Interest rate risk continued
The Company’s floating rate financial liabilities comprise interest-bearing loans from other Group undertakings, on which interest 
was charged at a rate of 4.0% throughout the year (2022: 4.0%).

Sensitivity analysis
In the year ended 30 June 2023, if UK interest rates had been 1.0% higher (considered to be a reasonably possible change based on 
forecast peak Bank of England interest rates) and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s pre-tax profit would increase 
by £9.6m, the Group’s post-tax profit would increase by £7.2m and, as such, the Group’s equity would increase by £7.2m.

Credit risk
In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash on legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from registered 
providers for affordable housing. The Group has £1,269.1m (2022: £1,352.7m) on deposit or in current accounts with 14 (2022: 14) financial 
institutions. Other than this, neither the Group nor the Company has a significant concentration of credit risk, as their exposure is spread 
over a large number of counterparties and customers.

The Group manages credit risk through its credit policy. This limits its exposure to financial institutions with high credit ratings, 
as set by international credit rating agencies, and determines the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty.

The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2023 was £181.3m (2022: £190.0m) of cash on deposit with a financial 
institution. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, net of any allowance for losses, 
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.

As at 30 June 2023, the Company was exposed to £79.0m (2022: £79.2m) of credit risk in relation to intercompany loans, which 
are considered to be of low credit risk and fully recoverable, as well as financial guarantees, performance bonds and the bank 
borrowings of subsidiary undertakings. Further details are provided in notes 29 and 30.

Capital risk management (cash flow risk)
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due while maintaining an appropriate capital structure.

The Group manages its share capital as equity, as set out in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, and its bank borrowings 
(being overdrafts and bank loans) and its private placement notes as other financial liabilities, as set out in note 22. The Group is subject 
to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the quantum of the Group’s earnings is dependent upon the level of UK house prices. 
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, 
mortgage availability and competitor pricing. The Group’s approach to the management of the principal operational risks of the business 
is detailed on pages 71 and 72.

Other methods by which the Group can manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include: adjusting the level of dividend 
payments to shareholders (assuming the Company is paying a dividend); issuing new share capital; arranging debt to meet liability 
payments; and selling assets to reduce debt.

32.  Business combinations and Group subsidiary undertakings

 Consolidation

The Financial Statements of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date when control passes to the Group, as 
defined in IFRS 3, using the acquisition method of accounting up to the date control ceases. All of the subsidiaries’ identifiable 
assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, existing at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values. All 
changes to those assets and liabilities, and the resulting gains and losses that arise after the Group has gained control of the 
subsidiary are included in the Income Statement. All intra-Group transactions and intercompany profits or losses are 
eliminated on consolidation.

During the prior year, the Group acquired all of the share capital of Gladman Developments Limited. No revision of the acquisition 
accounting for Gladman Developments Limited was necessary in the current year, and no new acquisitions have been made.

The entities listed below, and on the following pages, are subsidiaries of the Company or Group. All are registered in England and 
Wales or Scotland, with the exception of SQ Holdings Limited, which is registered in Guernsey. Unless otherwise stated, the results 
of these entities are consolidated within these Financial Statements.

pages 16 to 19. These APMs may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies and they 
are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures. Definitions and reconciliations of the financial APMs used to 
IFRS measures, are included below:

Gross margin is defined as gross profit divided by revenue:

Revenue per Consolidated Income Statement (£m)

Gross profit per Consolidated Income Statement (£m)

Adjusted gross margin is defined as adjusted gross profit divided by revenue:

Reporting approach
Our integrated report is primarily 
prepared for our shareholders; however, 
through our activities we create value for 
a range of other stakeholders.

Reporting frameworks
Our integrated reporting is guided by 
various codes and standards outlined 
in the table here.

Report scope and boundary
Our Integrated Report covers the 
performance of Barratt Developments 
PLC for the financial year ended June 2023.

The report extends beyond financial 
reporting and includes non-financial 
performance, opportunities and risks 
that may have a significant influence on 
our ability to create value.

Integrated reporting framework 
The primary purpose of an integrated 
report is to explain to providers of 
financial capital how an organisation 
creates value over time. An integrated 
report benefits all interested 
stakeholders including employees, 
customers, suppliers, business partners, 
local communities, legislators, 
regulators and policy-makers.

The IIRC’s vision is to align capital allocation 
and corporate behaviour to wider goals 
of financial stability and sustainable 
development through the cycle of 
integrated reporting and thinking.

Sustainability frameworks

Legal requirements

Framework
The International Integrated Reporting 
Council’s Integrated Reporting 

Framework
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS)

Purpose
Framework that is focused on articulating 
the value creation of an entity over time.

Purpose
Global framework for how 
companies prepare and disclose 
their financial statements.

Framework
Companies Act 2006

Purpose
Company law in the UK.

Framework
UK Corporate Governance Code

Purpose
The standards of good practice for listed 
companies on board composition and 
development, remuneration, shareholder 
relations, accountability and audit.

Framework
Streamline Energy and Carbon 
Reporting (SECR)

Purpose
Disclosures required by the UK Government 
on a company’s energy consumption and 
greenhouse gas emissions.

Framework
United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals

Purpose
Outward-looking framework that covers 
the areas of the UN’s 2030 Agenda 
focused on people, planet and prosperity.

The 17 UN SDGs define global sustainable 
development priorities and aspirations for 
2030 and seek to mobilise global efforts 
around a common set of goals and targets.

The UN SDGs call for worldwide action 
among governments, business and civil 
society to end poverty and create a life of 
dignity and opportunity for all, within the 
boundaries of the planet. The UN SDGs 
were launched in 2015 by the UN.

Framework
Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations

Purpose
Recommendations for disclosing clear, 
comparable and consistent information 
about the risks and opportunities 
presented by climate change.

Our primary disclosures aligning with 
TCFD recommendations as we continue 
on our journey towards full alignment, 
are made through the CDP Climate survey, 
which we submit on an annual basis. In 
2018 the CDP Climate Survey format was 
aligned to TCFD recommendations. Other 
TCFD related disclosures can be found 
within the content of this integrated 
report, and on the sustainability section 
of our corporate website.
