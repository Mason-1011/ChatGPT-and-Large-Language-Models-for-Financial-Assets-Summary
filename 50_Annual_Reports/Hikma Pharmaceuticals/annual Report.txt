within the Others segment. 503B compounding business’ 2022 revenue of $1 million and operating loss of $9 million have therefore been reclassified to the Others segment.

Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Strategic report 
Executive Chairman’s statement

Hikma was founded over 45 years ago with the 
mission to make high-quality medicines accessible 
to those who need them. This has been our focus 
every day since, and now, with new leadership and 
a refreshed, ambitious strategic focus, we are well 
placed for our next chapter of growth.

Said Darwazah
Executive Chairman

Evolving our leadership
I was delighted that the Board appointed 
my long-standing colleague, Riad Mishlawi, 
as Hikma’s new Chief Executive Officer in 
September 2023. Having worked closely 
with Riad for three decades, I have seen the 
impact of his leadership and strong focus on 
execution and delivery. Riad knows Hikma 
extremely well, having led our US 
manufacturing operations in the 1990s, 
and then in Europe during the early 2000s. 
High-quality manufacturing is instrumental 
to success and Riad has been an entrusted 
steward of this. Riad was President of 
Injectables for the past 11 years where he 
has overseen significant expansion in the US, 
Europe and MENA, delivering compound 
annual growth for Injectables of 12% since 
2011. Riad has already brought a fresh 
perspective to Hikma’s strategy and I have 
no doubt that he will apply his extensive 
expertise to drive growth across the 
Hikma Group.

Following a year as Chief Executive Officer, I 
will continue to serve as Executive Chairman, 
working closely with Riad and the Executive 
Committee. On behalf of the Board, I would 
like to congratulate Riad and I know he will 
continue to bring success to Hikma, our 
stakeholders and our employees over 
the coming years.

We have had a year of excellent financial 
and strategic progress and I am excited 
for the opportunities ahead.”

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Committed to our purpose
Hikma was founded to reliably supply its 
customers with the vital, and often life-saving 
medications they need. We have never 
strayed from this purpose and I am proud 
that our 9,100 people at Hikma are guided 
by it every day. This purpose also informs our 
strategy and drives our growth, which further 
enables us to put better health within reach, 
every day. We are doing that across the US 
and Europe, regularly stepping up to address 
drug shortages and enabling hospitals to 
provide essential medicines to their patients. 
In MENA, where we have recently become the 
second largest pharmaceutical company by 
sales1, we provide essential medicines, 
including to lower and middle-income 
countries where patients might not otherwise 
have access to them. As we grow, driven by 
our purpose, we are having an ever-increasing 
positive impact on society.

There is increasing uncertainty in the world, 
with conflicts, economic and political factors 
influencing the geopolitical environment. 
Irrespective of this, there is always a vital 
need for medicines and we will continue 
to focus on making them more accessible. 
Where we can act in a more humanitarian 
capacity, we will, and you can find more 
information on our medicine donations in 
the sustainability section of this report on 
page 45. 

Generating returns
The Group delivered an excellent set 
of results in 2023, ahead of our original 
expectations, with Group core operating 
profit increasing by 19% and core basic 
earnings per share up 23%.

This is also reflected in the recent returns 
generated for our shareholders. As of 31 
December 2023, our shares were up 18% 
over the previous twelve months, and had 
delivered a total shareholder return of 76% 
over the past ten years. This compares with 
the FTSE 100 of 68% and the FTSE 350 
Pharmaceuticals index of 147%. We returned 
to the FTSE 100 during 2023, and we are 
committed to remaining an important 
constituent of the London market.

Mindful of all our stakeholders
We are focused on delivering for all our 
stakeholders, including shareholders, 
customers and our talented employees 
around the world and this is embedded in 
our Acting Responsibly framework. Our 
people are essential to our success, and at 
Hikma we believe cultivating and nurturing a 
culture of progress and belonging is central 
to delivering on our strategy. This culture is 
driven by our three core values. We’re 
innovative – embracing new perspectives 
to find a better way and inspire each other. 
We’re caring – taking time to build 
relationships that are grounded in 
understanding, fairness and respect. 
And we’re collaborative, never losing sight 
of the shared goal that unites us and drives 
us forward. It has been my privilege to meet 
with many employees across the business 
this year, and I have been impressed not only 
by their deep expertise but, even more so, 
by their commitment to our purpose. 

We also continue to build and strengthen 
relationships with healthcare professionals, 
regulators and governments, as well as our 
suppliers and the patients and communities 
we serve. You can find descriptions of how 
we approach these stakeholder relationships 
in the stakeholder section of this report, on 
pages 20 to 25.

Environmental sustainability continues to be 
front of mind for us and I am pleased with 
the progress we are making against our 
environmental targets.

Corporate governance 
and our strong Board
I am pleased to lead a strong, diverse and 
impactful Board of Directors. The Board 
worked hard this year to successfully 
complete the search process for our new 
CEO. This thorough exercise unanimously 
concluded Riad was the person best suited 
for the job and has put Hikma on a strong 
platform for continued growth. 

As announced at the 2023 AGM, our former 
Senior Independent Director Patrick Butler 
will step down from Hikma’s Board on  
29 Feburary 2024. On behalf of the Board I 
would like to thank Pat for his leadership and 
thoughtful counsel during his time at Hikma. 
You can find out more about the Board’s 
activities, make-up and the work of the 
Committees in the corporate governance 
section of this report from page 82.

Looking ahead
We are well placed for the future. We have a 
strategy which focuses on our strengths while 
also ensuring we are identifying and taking 
opportunities to diversify and differentiate, 
leveraging new technologies and driving 
efficiencies. We have the leadership team in 
place to ensure Hikma’s success will continue 
and, most importantly, that our customers 
and their patients have access to the 
medicines they need.

CEO Statement

I am honoured to have been appointed CEO of 
Hikma. I have worked at this wonderful company 
for over 30 years and I am hugely passionate about 
what we do. I am excited to work with my colleagues 
across the globe to take Hikma forward on its next 
phase of growth.

Riad Mishlawi
Chief Executive Officer

With our outstanding manufacturing 
capabilities, skilled people and extensive 
portfolio and pipeline, I am excited for 
the future.”

Having been announced as Hikma’s new 
Chief Executive Officer in April 2023, a role 
that I officially started in September, I have 
spent much of my time travelling to our sites, 
meeting with our people, and working with 
the wider leadership team on our growth 
plans. The potential I see for the whole 
Group in the years ahead is even greater 
than I first thought. While there will be no 
material changes to our proven strategy, 
I will be focusing on further strengthening 
our execution and leveraging our talent, 
resources and new technologies to capture 
new opportunities and on driving increased 
efficiencies across the Group.

I have held several leadership roles during 
my time at Hikma, most recently leading our 
largest division, the Injectables business. 
Becoming CEO is a huge honour for me 
personally, and also a great opportunity 
to play a key role in continuing Hikma’s 
growth trajectory.

2023 – a year of good growth and 
progression in all our businesses
2023 was a great year for Hikma, with all 
three businesses contributing to the Group’s 
growth. Revenue grew 14% and core Group 
operating profit was up an impressive 19%.

Injectables revenue grew 6% and core 
operating profit 2%. We are the third largest 
generic injectable company by volume in the 
US2 and have a portfolio of over 150 products. 
Our operating margins are industry leading 
and our strategy to focus on our portfolio and 
pipeline makeup, high-quality manufacturing 
capabilities, and the needs of our customers, 
will continue to underpin our growth in the 
years ahead. We continued to launch new 
products across our markets, and were able 
to supply into shortage situations in the US 
and key European markets, leveraging the 
breadth of our portfolio. Some supply 
constraints in the third quarter were resolved 
when new high speed lines in New Jersey 
and Portugal became fully operational, 
strengthening our ability to capture growth 
opportunities going forward. We recently 
appointed Dr Bill Larkins to run our 
Injectables business. I have known Bill for

many years and he is an outstanding operator 
in the injectables space. I am excited about 
the impact he will have on this important part 
of our business.

Branded, our MENA-based business, is very 
well positioned to capture future growth at 
good margins. Our 2023 performance 
demonstrates this, with revenue growth of 
3%, core operating profit up 16% and core 
operating margin of 23.8%. These impressive 
results were achieved despite the difficult 
decision to halt our operations in Sudan in 
April due to the ongoing conflict. We also 
faced some currency headwinds due to the 
devaluation of the Egyptian Pound. Excluding 
this, on a constant currency basis, Branded 
revenue growth was 6%. The strong margin 
reflects the improvement in product mix as 
we launch and grow products used to treat 
chronic illnesses. We have many 
opportunities for growth in MENA and I am 
confident that Branded will be a key 
contributor to Hikma’s future success.

Generics had an exceptional year, with 
revenue up 39% and core operating profit 
up 86%. Our performance, particularly at the 
profit level, was driven by sodium oxybate, 
which we launched at the start of the year 
and benefitted from six months of exclusivity.

We were also pleased to see a broader 
recovery across the wider portfolio after a 
challenging 2022. We continue to invest in 
our specialty portfolio and in 2023 saw good 
momentum for Kloxxado®, our 8mg naloxone 
nasal spray. I have spent time with the team 
at our manufacturing facility in Columbus, 
Ohio and I am excited by the potential to 
leverage this site for additional contract 
manufacturing opportunities, while also 
gradually expanding our portfolio over time. 

During the year, we completed an acquisition 
as part of the Akorn bankruptcy process in 
July for $98 million, including manufacturing 
equipment and portfolio and pipeline 
products that will support our US businesses.

and Becton Dickinson

On 1 February 2024, the Group reached 
an agreement in principle to resolve the 
opioid related cases brought against Hikma 
Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. by US states, their 
subdivisions, and tribal nations. These cases 
represent the vast majority of cases brought 
against Hikma related to the manufacture 
and sale of prescription opioid medications. 
The agreed upon settlement is not an 
admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. The 
Group booked a total provision of $129 million 
to cover the expected settlement amount for 
all related cases in North America.

Evolving our existing strategy
I have had significant input into developing 
and implementing Hikma’s strategy for many 
years. Our strong track record confirms my 
belief that we are on the right path. Following 
my appointment as CEO, I have worked with 
the leadership team to evolve this strategy to 
ensure we are making the most of available 
opportunities and maximising our ability 
to profitably grow and operate as efficiently 
as possible. In addition, to accurately track 
progress against our strategy, we have 
evolved our KPIs and aligned them to 
management’s incentive plans. Our strategic 
focus is centred around three core pillars:

Strive for excellence
We already have a broad product portfolio, 
strong commercial capabilities, high-quality 
manufacturing facilities and an extensive 
network of global partners. We want to 
leverage these strengths to make sure we are 
capturing all the opportunities available to us, 
while ensuring we are operating as efficiently 
as possible. In the year ahead we will continue 
to expand our manufacturing capabilities, 
optimise operational efficiencies and invest 
in new technologies. We will also leverage our 
capacity for contract manufacturing. We will 
maximise the potential of our products 
by deploying a more targeted commercial 
approach with customers to ensure we 
make full use of our world class portfolio.

Diversify and differentiate
Expanding our portfolio across our 
businesses and global markets continues to 
be a fundamental priority. Although generic

medicine prices erode as competition 
increases, our pipeline of new products 
enables us to mitigate this while also 
benefitting our customers. We are expanding 
our R&D capabilities and investing in new 
projects to ensure that our pipeline reflects 
the future needs of our customers. This is 
complemented by strategic partnerships and 
acquisitions that bring complex products we 
are not able to develop in-house, and enable 
us to partner with others to bring novel 
products to market. We also see potential to 
expand selectively into adjacent markets 
and businesses, for example via our sterile 
compounding business in the US, or portfolio 
expansion in Canada and new countries 
in Europe.

People and responsibility
From my many years’ experience at Hikma,  
I know the skill, experience, commitment and 
determination of our people. They are the 
cornerstone of our company and without 
them, our products wouldn’t be developed 
and launched, our plants wouldn’t run and 
our customers wouldn’t receive the vital 
medicines they need. As such, the growth

Establishing a leadership council
In September 2023, we established a Leadership Council (LC), 
comprising 13 senior Hikma employees, to support our Executive 
Committee (EC). The main objective of the LC is to significantly 
improve communications among leaders at every level of our 
organisation. The LC will serve as a platform for the free flow of 
ideas, experience and knowledge, to continuously improve the 
way we work and enhance our ability to seize new opportunities.

The LC members are now attending EC meetings on a scheduled 
rotational basis and as required.

and development of Hikma employees is fundamental to our strategy 
and success. Our culture is one of progress and belonging and I want 
to ensure we cultivate this to help empower our people to find the 
best way of bringing success to Hikma and fulfilling the needs of our 
customers. From recruiting and retaining the best talent, to providing 
the best training we can, and fostering a workplace where everyone 
feels included and can perform at their best, our people will remain  
a central strength of Hikma.

Our broader Acting Responsibly framework will now be embedded 
within our corporate strategy. While we have always been guided by 
responsibility, this should go hand-in-hand with how we go to market. 
Access to medicine, for example, is a material sustainability topic, and 
is reflected in our purpose. Managing our use of energy and water is 
important for minimising our impact on the environment, but can also 
ensure we are operating as efficiently as possible. Finally, our focus on 
trust and quality is central to being a reliable supplier and minimising 
the risks around us.

Long-term growth that will benefit our patients
I am truly excited about this wonderful company and the numerous 
opportunities that lie ahead. We have a strong team, an impressive 
history and an important purpose. I look forward to working with our 
teams to leverage what we have achieved so far, and to continue 
serving the needs of health care providers and the millions of 
patients who rely on our medicines for better health every day.

I would like to thank the Board, and in particular the Chairman and 
Vice Chairman, Said and Mazen Darwazah, for entrusting me to 
lead Hikma forward.

1.  During 2023, the Group has revised its Injectables operating segment. Previously, the 
503B compounding business was reported under the Injectables segment and is now 
included within the Others segment. 503B compounding business’ 2022 revenue of 
$1 million and operating loss of $9 million have therefore been reclassified to the 
Others segment

2.  Canada is now included in North America (previously in Europe and rest of the world). 
Canada’s 2022 sales of $18 million have therefore been reclassified to North America
3.  Core EBTIDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairment 

charges and unwinding of acquisition related inventory step-up, adjusted for exceptional 
items and other adjustments. Core EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, see page 36 for

Our markets

Understanding global healthcare 
in an evolving world.

A growing pharmaceutical sector 
The global pharmaceutical market continues to grow and 
is expected to reach $1.9 trillion in 2027, growing at between 
3% and 6% per annum1. Long-term demographic trends, 
changing lifestyles and the impact of climate change 
are continuing to drive increased demand for 
healthcare globally. 

Where we operate
Our commitment to our vision of shaping 
a healthier world is as important as ever 
to the millions of people we serve. We 
operate across three geographies – 
North America, Middle East and 
North Africa (MENA) and Europe.

The US is our largest market. The US 
pharmaceutical market is growing at a 
slower pace compared with historic trends 
due to rising competition and pricing 
pressure2. However, it remains the largest 
generics market in the world3, with generics 
and biosimilars representing 90% of 
prescriptions filled and accounting for 
only 17.5% of prescription drug spending4, 
demonstrating the cost-savings of these 
vital medicines. Generic uptake is being 
driven by patent expiries and governments’ 
focus on affordable healthcare. 

MENA is our second largest region. 
Growth continues to be underpinned 
by demographic trends, including a 
fast growing and ageing population, and 
increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. 
To keep pace, governments and 
businesses across the MENA region are 
increasing investments in healthcare. 
We have a long track record of achieving 
good growth in our MENA markets.

In Europe, where we are gradually growing 
our presence and entering new markets, 
generic medicines uptake is increasing, 
particularly as governments look to 
maintain more sustainable healthcare 
budgets. Generic medicines have helped 
to increase patients’ access. Today, 67% 
of dispensed medicines in the region are 
generic, accounting for less than 30% of 
pharmaceutical spending5.

Impact of 
changing 
demographics 
and climate 
change

Scientific advances and improved access to 
healthcare, with more preventative treatments, 
are contributing to a rise in life expectancy and 
an expanding ageing population6. According to the 
United Nations’ projections, the world’s population 
is expected to increase by 2 billion people by 20507, 
with the number of people aged 60 or over 
expected to double to reach 2.1 billion8. 

In addition, changes in lifestyles and climate 
change are contributing to a rise in chronic 
diseases, particularly cancer, respiratory and 
cardiovascular diseases9,10. Climate change in the 
form of extreme weather conditions, rising sea 
levels and declining biodiversity is also having a 
significant impact on health globally and quality of 
life. As a result, demand for long-term care is rising. 

9.7 billion

estimated global population in 2050, 
two billion higher than today7

Strategic response

As a pharmaceutical company with a purpose to 
put better health within reach, every day, we are 
committed to improving patients’ access to 
high-quality affordable healthcare. Our strategy 
aligns with market trends, such as in MENA, where 
there is an increase in prevalence of lifestyle 
diseases. Over the last few years, we have been 
rapidly developing our product portfolio for MENA 
in the fast-growing chronic disease areas. Today, 
chronic medications make up 60% of our Branded 
portfolio. 

Refer to the access to medicines section on page 44 
for more information on our efforts to make 
medicines more affordable and accessible across 
our geographies, and to the Task Force for 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures section

economic and 
geopolitical 
uncertainty 

The impact of 
a competitive 
environment 
on pricing 
and access

An evolving 
regulatory 
environment

According to the IMF, global economic recovery 
remains slow – growth is forecast to slow down from 
3.5% in 2022 to 3.0% in 2023 and 2.9% in 202411. 
Rising healthcare costs due to increased demand 
for high-quality medicines, tightening financial 
conditions and geopolitical tension around the 
world is contributing to this slowdown. As a result, 
the need for more cost-effective healthcare is 
driving an increase in generic penetration. 

The generic pharmaceutical market is becoming 
increasingly competitive. In the US, particularly in 
the non-injectable market, there has been a higher 
number of competitors and an acceleration in the 
FDA’s generic drug approval process over the last 
decade. This has resulted in more persistent price 
erosion and a higher rate of commoditisation across 
individual molecules. For example, in 2013, the FDA 
approved 518 Abbreviated New Drug Applications 
(ANDAs), 106 (20%) of which were first-time generic 
approvals. In 2023, the FDA is on track to approve 
c.1,000 ANDAs, with only ~60 (6%) first-time 
generic approvals12. 

The need for more cost-effective healthcare is 
driving legislative and regulatory changes that are 
impacting the pharmaceutical market. In the US, 
Congress approved the Inflation Reduction Act 
(IRA) in August 2022. It aims to curb inflation by 
implementing various cost-containment measures, 
one of which is lowering the cost of prescription 
drugs. It does so by limiting above-inflation annual 
drug price rises and allows for price negotiations, 
constrained by mandatory minimum discounts, 
around the costliest Medicare drugs. IRA only 
targets products without generic competition13. 
The full impact from IRA remains uncertain. 

We are also seeing increased competition in the 
MENA region, particularly from Indian and Russian 
players, which is putting some pressures on pricing. 
At the same time, big pharma and multinational 
companies are deprioritising the region, opting 
to partner with strong local players instead. As a 
result, patients in MENA do not always have 
access to the latest treatments available.

In addition, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act in 
the US, a federal law enacted in 2013 to enhance 
the security and traceability of pharmaceutical 
products, is expected to be fully implemented in 
November 2024. As a result, manufacturers need 
to be ready to ship fully aggregated products.

In MENA, many countries are promoting local 
production through incentives and import 
restrictions. Some governments are also shifting 
towards unifying procurement to reduce cost and 
improve patient access.

Strategic response

Strategic response

In a cost-conscious environment, we are well 
positioned to meet patients’ needs as one of 
the largest suppliers of high-quality, affordable 
medicines across our markets. Generic medicines 
play an important role in increasing patients’ access 
worldwide to more affordable treatments. We are 
committed to our purpose of bringing better health 
within reach, every day, and in 2023 we launched 
157 products across our markets. 

Our focus on operational and commercial 
excellence, as well as launching a steady stream 
of new products across our markets, enables us 
to be resilient in a competitive environment. 
To ensure continued growth, we are increasingly 
focusing our development activities on complex 
generic products that require advanced 
manufacturing technologies. 

In MENA, our broad geographic presence, deep 
knowledge of local market gaps and long-standing 
reputation in the region makes us uniquely positioned 
to capture market opportunities. We see it is as our 
duty and responsibility to bring new treatments, 
access and innovative drugs into the region. We 
also engage with partners early on, proactively 
seeking out innovative drugs and therapies to 
ensure our patients across MENA have fair access.

We have deep-rooted expertise in all the markets 
where we operate, enabling us to keep pace with 
the evolving pharmaceutical regulations. In the US, 
where we have a broad portfolio and pipeline, we do 
not expect a significant impact from IRA. We will 
continue to work to understand IRA implications, 
if any. In addition, our sites are well-positioned 
to ship fully aggregated products, ahead of the 
Drug Supply Chain Security Act deadline.

In MENA, we are an established player with global 
expertise and a local presence. We have an 
extensive local manufacturing footprint and 
are investing in expanding our capacity.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Patients and healthcare  
professionals

Our purpose is to put better health within reach, every day for 
healthcare professionals (HCPs) and their patients. We engage 
with doctors, clinicians and pharmacists to better understand 
their needs, helping them treat the patients they serve.

Why is it important to engage with this group and what do they 
expect from us?

Patients and HCPs need us to:

 – consistently provide a broad portfolio of products
 – improve access to high-quality, affordable medicines

It is essential that we align our commercial activities, operations and 
R&D efforts to the changing needs of patients and HCPs.

How we engage across the Group

 – Our commercial teams meet regularly with doctors and hospital 

clinicians to better understand their needs and keep them informed 
about our products

 – In MENA, we run regular forums bringing together key opinion leaders, 
doctors and global research institutes to share knowledge and raise 
awareness of healthcare trends and disease management
 – We meet with patient advocacy groups for diseases such as 

multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disease and diabetes

How we engage at Board level

 – The Compliance, Responsibility and Ethics Committee is responsible 

for direct oversight of the Group’s approach to ethical issues associated 
with HCPs

 – Our management teams present to the Board at least once per year, 
providing updates on how we are addressing the needs of patients 
and healthcare providers across our markets

Outcomes and actions

 – Hosted our fifth annual MENA Cancer Network in collaboration with 
MD Anderson Cancer Center, where experts presented updates on 
clinical practice and cutting-edge cancer research

 – Signed agreements with companies including Celltrion, Junshi 

Biosciences, Rakuten Medical and SK Biopharmaceuticals in order to 
be able to expand patients’ access in MENA to new medicines and 
technologies previously unavailable

 – Through our Hikma Community HealthTM initiative, we partnered with 
state governments, non-profits and harm reduction organisations 
across the US to expand access to the opioid overdose reversal 
medicine naloxone

 – Hosted our second annual Biotech Forum in Istanbul, designed to 
tackle the latest advancements in gastroenterology, dermatology, 
rheumatology and oncology

Increasing access  
to life saving medicine

Stakeholders considered
We are proud of the important role we play in manufacturing and 
providing affordable, high-quality medicines to treat a growing 
number of illnesses and conditions. Our customers, healthcare 
professionals (HCPs) and patients look to us to meet their 
evolving needs and ensure reliable access to medicines. 

We supply a range of opioid-based pain medicines, including 
those used in hospitals and surgical procedures. Unfortunately 
in the US there is an increasing prevalence of misuse of opioid 
based products. The CDC reported that approximately 80,000 
Americans died from an opioid-involved drug overdose in 20221. 

Recently, an incident in Alaska made it clear that our outreach 
efforts and our products are saving lives.

In April 2023, a group of five high school students used a 
substance off campus, returned to school, and all experienced 
fentanyl overdoses. Thanks to the quick action of the school’s 
nurse – who had six doses of Kloxxado® (naloxone HCl) Nasal 
Spray 8 mg on hand – all five students were successfully revived. 

Following the incident, the Anchorage School District made 
emergency overdose kits containing Kloxxado®, which is 
manufactured and tested by teams in our Columbus, Ohio 
facility, available in every school and held trainings for principals 
on how to properly administer Kloxxado®. The emergency kits are 
available thanks to a partnership between Hikma and the State of 
Alaska, making Kloxxado® the opioid-overdose reversal medicine 
available state-wide.

Long-term implications
By continuously adding products, strengthening our pipeline and 
building relationships with our customers, we are able to better 
serve the growing needs of hospitals, healthcare professionals 
and patients. Through our Hikma Community HealthTM initiative, 
we have partnered with state governments, non-profits and harm 
reduction organisations across the US to expand access to the 
opioid overdose reversal medicine Kloxxado®.

our performance and culture

 – We have an active internal communications programme to keep 
employees engaged and informed on Group strategy, progress, 
culture, values and sustainability 

How we engage at Board level

engagement. She reports on employee issues as required during 
Board or Committee business

Building a strong culture

Board employee engagement 
The Board recognises that having a strong and unified culture 
that supports our purpose and enables our strategy is critical 
to achieving long-term success. It is key for our employees to 
feel empowered and enabled to do their best work. As a result, 
members of our Board seek to engage with our colleagues, both 
directly and indirectly, throughout the year. By continuously 
listening to the views of our employees, we can protect what 
works and improve on what doesn’t.

In 2023, members of our Board had a comprehensive agenda 
of employee engagement. This included:

 – a visit to our corporate headquarters in Jordan and tour of 

our manufacturing facilities, where Non-Executive Directors 
spent time with employees, including members of our women’s 
network, and developed their understanding of our MENA 
business and markets 

 – a tour of our facilities, including injectables plants in the 

US and Portugal, our non-injectables plant in the US and  
our compounding plant in the US, where they met with local 
management teams and learned more about our 
manufacturing processes and safety procedures 

 – a meeting with Injectables and Generics management teams 
to learn about our growth initiatives for each business and 
challenge the team where necessary

Outcomes and long-term implications
Members of the Board had the chance to proactively engage with 
our employees across the business. The Board recognises the 
importance of investing in the development of our employees. As 
a result, a key priority the Board has outlined for 2024 is to review 
our succession plans for senior management roles, ensuring that 
we are empowering our employees by providing them with the 
right tools to progress in their careers. In addition, the safety and 
wellbeing of our employees is one of our top priorities. The Board 
supported Riad in the creation of an Executive Committee 
level role with responsibility for quality and health and safety, 
underlining our commitment to maintaining the 
highest standards.

confidence in the long-term growth prospects for the Group 

Growth in all three businesses

 – Injectables4: revenue up 6% reflecting growth in all three 

geographies. Injectables core operating profit increased by 2% 
with a core operating margin of 36.9% (2022: 38.3%). Revenue 
and operating losses in our 503B compounding business are

Group revenue in 2022, as a result of the ongoing conflict in the 
country. This resulted in $83 million of impairment and costs

$700 million

Group
Group revenue was up 14% reflecting growth in all three business. 
Group gross margin declined slightly primarily driven by shifting 
product and geographic mix in the Injectables business.

Group operating expenses were $1,023 million (2022: $956 million). 
Excluding adjustments related to the amortisation of intangible 
assets (other than software) of $88 million (2022: $92 million)  
and exceptional items and other adjustments of $235 million  
(2022: $195 million), Group core operating expenses were  
$700 million (2022: $669 million).

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $767 million 
(2022: $615 million). This includes a provision of $129 million related 
to an agreement in principle and provisions to resolve outstanding 
opioid-related cases in North America, which is considered an 
exceptional item. Core SG&A expenses were $544 million (2022: 
$509 million), up 7%, primarily reflecting investment in sales and 
marketing in the US and MENA.

Research and development (R&D) expenses were $149 million  
(2022: $144 million), representing 5% of Group core revenue  
(2022: 6%), as we continue to invest in adding more complex and 
differentiated products to our pipeline and expanding our portfolios 
across our markets.

Other net operating expenses were $75 million (2022: $192 million) 
primarily reflecting the impairment charge related to halting our 
operations in Sudan. Core other net operating expenses were 
$4 million (2022: $11 million), primarily comprising foreign 
exchange-related costs.

The increase in core operating profit by 19% and core operating 
margin to 24.6% were driven by the strong performance of both 
Generics and Branded. Reported operating profit grew 30%, 
reflecting lower reported operating profit in 2022 resulting from 
higher 2022 impairment charges, but after including the 2023 impact 
of a $129 million provision to cover the expected settlement amount 
for all opioid related cases in North America.

1.  Constant currency numbers in 2023 represent reported 2023 numbers translated 

using 2022 exchange rates, excluding price increases in the business resulting from 
the devaluation of the Egyptian and Sudanese pound and excluding the impact from 
hyperinflation accounting.

2.  Core results throughout the document are presented to show the underlying 

performance of the Group, excluding the exceptional items and other adjustments set 
out in Note 6 of this report. Core results are a non-IFRS measure and a reconciliation to

4.  During 2023, the Group has revised its injectables operating segment. Previously, the 
503B compounding business was reported under the Injectables segment and is now 
included within the Others segment. 503B compounding business’ 2022 revenue of 
$1 million and operating loss of $9 million have therefore been reclassified to the Others 
segment. 2023 Others revenue was $21 million (2022: $14 million) with an operating loss 
of $9 million (2022: $6 million loss).

Injectables revenue grew 6% in 2023, 
reflecting good growth in all three 
geographies, benefitting from the breadth 
of our global portfolio and advanced 
manufacturing capabilities. This helped 
to fully offset loss of sales from halting 
our operations in Sudan. 

In North America2 we are benefiting 
from good demand for our broad product 
portfolio, including for products in short 
supply, recent launches and a full 
contribution from the acquisitions of 
Custopharm and Teligent’s Canadian 
assets. This more than offset increased 
competition on certain products. 

In Europe and rest of the world (ROW) we

portfolio of products as well as our short 
supply chain and lead times, enabling us 
to respond to shortages in Germany. We 
continue to make progress in new markets 
including France, Spain and the UK. 

In MENA we achieved strong growth driven 
by good demand for our portfolio across 
most of our markets, including for our 
biosimilar products as we continue 
to launch into new markets.

Core gross profit grew 1% to $657 million 
and core gross margin was 54.6%, reflecting 
changes in geographic and product mix and 
some inflationary pressure.

Injectables operating profit, which includes 
a $14 million impairment charge and costs 
related to halting our operations in Sudan, 
grew 1%. Injectables core operating profit 
grew 2% and core operating margin was 
36.9%. This reflects the change in gross 
profit, offset by good control of costs. 

During the year, the Injectables business had 
28 launches in North America, 25 in MENA 
and 67 in Europe and ROW. We submitted 
55 filings to regulatory authorities across all 
markets. We further developed our portfolio 
through new licensing agreements.

Outlook for 2024
In 2024, we expect Injectables revenue to 
grow in the range of 6% to 8%. We expect 
core operating margin to be in the range 
of 36% to 37%.

Strong positioning across 
our three geographies is 
helping drive consistent 
growth.”

1.  During 2023, the Group has revised its Injectables 

operating segment. Previously, the 503B compounding 
business was reported under the Injectables segment

Our Branded business grew revenue 3% on a 
reported basis and 6% in constant currency. 
This reflects a good performance across 
most of our markets, enabling us to fully 
offset the loss of sales resulting from halting 
our operations in Sudan. We also saw strong 
demand for medicines focused on chronic 
illnesses, particularly our growing oral 
oncology portfolio. 

Core gross profit grew and core gross 
margin improved to 51.3%, reflecting an 
improvement in product mix, driven by our 
focus on building a portfolio of treatments 
for chronic illnesses.

We are launching new

new partnerships, and 
this is driving increasingly 
profitable growth.”

Reported operating profit, which includes a 
$69 million impairment charge and cost in 
relation to halting our operations in Sudan, 
declined 30%. Core operating profit grew 
16% and core operating margin expanded 
to 23.8%. This reflects the improvement in 
core gross profit, which more than offset the 
negative foreign exchange impact related 
to the currency devaluation in Egypt. On a 
reported basis, operating profit was down 
due to the impairment we took on our 
Sudanese business where we are unable 
to operate due to the ongoing conflict.

During the year, the Branded business 
had 32 launches and submitted 47 filings 
to regulatory authorities. Revenue from 
in-licensed products represented 29% 
of Branded revenue (2022: 29%)1.

Outlook for 2024
We expect Branded revenue in 2024 to grow 
in the mid to high single-digits in constant 
currency, or low-single digits on a reported 
basis, and for reported core operating profit 
to be broadly in line with 2023.

Revenue in our Generics business grew 
39% in 2023, driven by good volume growth 
in our base business, an improved pricing 
environment, and an exceptionally strong 
contribution from the launch of the 
authorised generic of sodium oxybate.

The increase in Generics core gross profit 
and margin expansion to 41.3% was primarily 
a result of improved product mix and the 
strong profitability of the authorised generic 
of sodium oxybate in the first six months of 
the year. Royalties payable on this product 
increased in the second half due to the 
terms of our settlement agreement. 

Generics core operating profit was up 86%, 
reflecting growth in gross profit. This strong 
profit contribution enabled us to invest back 
into this business, particularly in sales and 
marketing, as we continue to build our 
specialty business, and in R&D. Core 
operating margin was 20.5%. 

In 2023, the Generics business launched 
five products and submitted five filings 
to regulatory authorities. 

Outlook for 2024
In 2024, we expect Generics revenue to 
grow in the range of 3% to 5%. We expect 
core operating margin to be in the mid-teens.

An exceptionally strong 
year, with a key new 
launch as well as strong 
performance across the 
base business.”

Other businesses
Other businesses, which now includes our 503B compounding 
business, as well as Arab Medical Containers (AMC), a manufacturer 
of plastic specialised medicinal sterile containers, and International 
Pharmaceuticals Research Centre (IPRC), which conducts bio-
equivalency studies, contributed revenue of $21 million in 2023 
(2022: $14 million1) with an operating loss of $9 million (2022: $6 
million loss). The loss reflects our ongoing investment into 
developing our compounding business. We are making good progress 
in growing our compounding business and continue to invest in 
building our manufacturing and commercial capabilities.

Research and development
Our investment in R&D and business development enables us to 
continue expanding the Group’s product portfolio. During 2023, 
we had 157 new launches and received 128 approvals. To ensure the 
continuous development of our product pipeline, we submitted 107 
regulatory filings.

Profit before tax
Reported profit before tax increased to $281 million (2022: $233 
million), primarily due to the good growth in all three businesses, 
partially offset by the opioid legal settlement provision. Excluding 
exceptional items and other adjustments, core profit before tax was 
$626 million (2022: $520 million), up 20%.

Tax
The Group incurred a reported tax expense of $89 million (2022: 
$42 million) and a reported effective tax rate of 31.7% (2022: 18.0%). 
Excluding exceptional items and other adjustments, Group core tax 
expense was $131 million (2022: $111 million). The core effective tax 
rate was 20.9% (2022: 21.3%).

We expect the Group core effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% 
to 23% in 2024.

Profit attributable to shareholders
Profit attributable to shareholders was $190 million (2022:  
$188 million). Core profit attributable to shareholders increased

Core net finance expense increased to $83 million (2022: $74 million), 
reflecting the increase in interest rates during 2023.

We expect core net finance expense to be around $91 million in 20243.

1.  During 2023, the Group has revised its Others operating segment. Previously, the 503B 

compounding business was reported under the Injectables segment and is now included 
within the Others segment. 503B compounding business’ 2022 revenue of $1 million and 
operating loss of $9 million have therefore been reclassified to the Others segment.

2.  Pipeline projects submitted, approved and launched by country in 2023. 
3.  Based on the composition of the Group’s net debt portfolio as at 31 December 2023,  
a one percentage point increase/decrease in interest rates would result in $3 million 
decrease/increase in net finance cost per year (2022: $4 million increase/decrease).

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 47 cents per share 
(2022: 37 cents per share) bringing the total dividend for the full 
year to 72 cents per share (2022: 56 cents per share). This equates to a 
payout ratio of around 32%, which is above our historical range of 20% 
to 30%. We intend to progressively increase our dividend, with a 
payout ratio in the range of 30% to 40%, reflecting the Board’s 
confidence in the long-term growth prospects for the Group. The 
proposed dividend will be paid on 3 May 2024 to eligible shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 22 March 2024, subject to 
approval at the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2024.

Net cash flow, working capital and net debt
The Group generated operating cash flow of $608 million (2022: 
$530 million). This change primarily reflects the increase in 
operating profit.

Group working capital days were 243 at 31 December 2023. Compared 
to the position on 31 December 2022, Group working capital days 
decreased by 8 days from 251 days, due primarily to an improvement 
in receivable days.

Capital expenditure was $169 million (2022: $138 million). In the US, 
$46 million was spent on upgrades, new technologies and capacity 
expansion across our Cherry Hill, Dayton, and Columbus sites. In 
MENA, $96 million was spent strengthening and expanding 
manufacturing capabilities, including two ongoing greenfield 
Injectables production sites in Algeria and Morocco, expanding our 
site in Algeria and a new land purchase in Saudi Arabia. In Europe, we 
spent $27 million enhancing our manufacturing capabilities, including 
new filling lines in Portugal and Italy and adding lyophilisation capacity 
in Portugal. We expect Group capital expenditure to be in the range 
of $160 million to $180 million in 2024.

The Group’s total debt was $1,191 million at 31 December 2023 
(31 December 2022: $1,283 million).

The Group’s cash balance at 31 December 2023 was $215 million 
(31 December 2022: $270 million).

The Group’s net debt (excluding co-development agreements 
and contingent liabilities) was $976 million at 31 December 2023 
(31 December 2022: $1,013 million). We continue to have a healthy 
balance sheet, with a net debt to core EBITDA ratio of 1.2x 
(31 December 2022: 1.5x).

Balance sheet
Net assets at 31 December 2023 were $2,209 million (31 December 
2022: $2,148 million). Net current assets were $761 million 
(31 December 2022: $922 million).

Definitions
We use a number of non-IFRS measures to report and monitor the 
performance of our business. Management uses these adjusted 
numbers internally to measure our progress and for setting 
performance targets. We also present these numbers, alongside our 
reported results, to external audiences to help them understand the 
underlying performance of our business. Our core numbers may be 
calculated differently to other companies.

Adjusted measures are not substitutable for IFRS results and 
should not be considered superior to results presented in 
accordance with IFRS.

Core results
Reported results represent the Group’s overall performance. 
However, these results can include one-off or non-cash items 
which are excluded when assessing the underlying performance 
of the Group. Our core results exclude the exceptional items and 
other adjustments set out in Note 6 in this report.

Constant currency
As the majority of our business is conducted in the US, we present our 
results in US dollars. For both our Branded and Injectable businesses, 
a proportion of their sales are denominated in a currency other than 
the US dollar. In order to illustrate the underlying performance of 
these businesses, we include information on our results in 
constant currency.

Constant currency numbers in 2023 represent reported 2023 
numbers translated using 2022 exchange rates, excluding price 
increases in the business resulting from the devaluation of the 
Egyptian and Sudanese pound and excluding the impact from 
hyperinflation accounting.

We believe Group working capital days provides a useful measure of 
the Group’s working capital management and liquidity. Group working 
capital days are calculated as Group receivable days plus Group 
inventory days, less Group payable days. Group receivable days are 
calculated as Group trade receivables x 365, divided by 12 months 
Group revenue. Group inventory days are calculated as Group 
inventory x 365, divided by 12 months Group cost of sales. Group 
payable days are calculated as Group trade payables x 365, 
divided by 12 months Group cost of sales.

Acting responsibly at Hikma

Being a responsible organisation and advancing our 
sustainability agenda is integral to how we do business.

Pursuing strong environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) 
programmes creates long-term 
value for both Hikma and our 
stakeholders and helps us deliver 
on our purpose to provide better 
health within reach, every day. 

We are focused on the ESG 
issues that are most material to 
our business and stakeholders. 
These material issues form the 
basis of our sustainability 
framework and strategy and 
we align our business with 
these priorities.

 – We advance health and 

wellbeing

 – We empower our people
 – We protect the environment
 – We build trust through quality

This section outlines how we 
address our most material ESG 
issues and highlights some of the 
major activities, milestones and 
achievements made throughout 
the year. More information on 
sustainability and ESG will be 
provided in our upcoming

Focus on health at COP28
The Conference of the Parties (COP28) 
convention held in 2023 in Dubai, United 
Arab Emirates included a landmark 
recognition of the urgency for governments 
and organisations to address health 
impacts related to ongoing climate change. 
The declaration made on Health Day of the 
COP included a commitment to proactively 
address both the direct and indirect 
climate-related health impacts and  
was endorsed by 124 countries.

Climate change is currently among the most 
significant health threats globally. Climate 
change is expected to create both direct 
health impacts through heat waves, 

droughts and other extreme weather 
events, as well as indirect health impacts 
such as increased prevalence of vector-
borne and airways diseases, food and 
water insecurity, undernutrition, and 
forced displacements.

As a manufacturer of generic medicines,  
we recognise our role in mitigating the 
health-related impacts of global climate 
change. We do so by prioritising the 
availability and access of medicines, 
addressing and anticipating national health 
priorities and evolving patient needs, and 
working within our markets to launch more 
products and strengthen the resilience  
of healthcare systems.

Prioritising the right issues

The ESG issues we have prioritised as a 
business are those that create shared value 
for our business and stakeholders, mitigate 
business risks and ensure we continue to 
do business responsibly and ethically. 

Our sustainability framework was developed 
through an internal materiality assessment that 
integrated both current and expected legislative 
requirements and best practice. We have also 
considered global sustainability standards such 
as GRI, sector-specific standards as outlined by 
SASB, as well as ratings frameworks including 
MSCI, Sustainalytics, and the FTSE4Good –  
all of which help us fully understand material 
issues from an external perspective.

We also take into account investor 
considerations around ESG matters, and all 
our other key stakeholders, including patients 
and healthcare professionals, employees, 
customers, communities, government, 
regulators and suppliers.

Going forward, our aim is to develop more 
comprehensive materiality analyses through 
further engagement with our stakeholders and 
within our business. We also intend to align our 
materiality assessment methodology to that 
required under CSRD, including use of 
‘double materiality’ analyses.

Sustainability reporting readiness

We are proactive in assessing and ensuring 
our preparedness with evolving regulations, 
obligations and best practices around the 
management and reporting of ESG issues. 
There are several regulatory developments 
that we have identified that will impact 
our reporting in future years. 

Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD)
In 2023, the CSRD entered into force and 
established a harmonised ESG reporting 
regime for companies operating in the 
European Union. Companies that are within 
the scope of CSRD will have to report against 
the European Sustainability Reporting 
Standards (ESRS) for material ESG matters 
and comply with the EU Taxonomy Directive.

Hikma is preparing to report in alignment with 
CSRD and evaluating reporting timelines. To 
align with CSRD requirements, in 2024 we will 
focus on developing a double materiality 
assessment and increase our preparedness 
in obtaining external limited assurance for 
externally disclosed ESG metrics.

UK Sustainability Disclosure Standards 
(SDS) and IFRS Sustainability 
Disclosure Standards
The UK SDS is expected to be published in 
2024 and will set out corporate disclosures 
on the sustainability-related themes for 
UK-based companies. SDS disclosures will 
form the basis for companies to report on 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities. 
SDS is using the International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) Sustainability 
Disclosure Standards as a baseline to 
develop their standards, which our teams 
have considered or have been considering 
when developing our ESG reporting.

Legislation in the US 
around climate reporting
In the US, evolving regulations that relate 
to public disclosure of ESG-related issues 
have been identified to be relevant to Hikma. 
These include bills SB-253 Climate Corporate 
Data Accountability Act, SB-261 Greenhouse 
gases: climate-related financial risk, and 
AB-1305 Voluntary carbon market 
disclosures, all issued in California. In 2024 
our aim is to assess our alignment with these 
bills, and to continue assessing the US 
legislative landscape.

Our alignment with evolving 
stakeholder expectations
Expectations around ESG reporting among 
investors and other stakeholders continue 
to expand and evolve. Sector-based 
standards, such as those developed by the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB), which has now been folded into the 
International Sustainability Standards Board 
(ISSB), define material topics as those that 
“are reasonably likely to significantly impact 
the financial condition, operating 
performance, or risk profile of the company.” 
We align our reporting with these and other 
relevant standards to facilitate the 
comparability of our ESG performance with 
those of our industry peers. We also report 
our climate-related disclosures in alignment 
with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, 
and will ensure that our GHG accounting 
maintains alignment following its expected 
2025 Corporate Standard update.

MENA
We operate 20 manufacturing plants in MENA 
and are constructing new injectable plants in 
Algeria and Morocco. We are now the second 
largest1 pharmaceutical company by sales 
(up from third in 2022) and we continue to 
expand our local manufacturing capacity 
to ensure patients have access to critical 
medicine throughout the region. 

Across the region, our areas of focus align 
closely with national healthcare priorities 
and disease burdens, and we work with the 
relevant stakeholders to strengthen national 
healthcare systems. Our commercial teams 
meet and collaborate with doctors, clinicians, 
and pharmacists regularly to improve disease 
awareness, healthcare standards and access 
to quality medical care in the region.

North America
In the US, we are a top 10 generic medicines 
manufacturer2. We supply a broad range of 
injectable and non-injectable products to 
patients in the US and, more recently, in 
Canada. We operate manufacturing, R&D 
and distribution facilities across New Jersey 
and Ohio and are a leading provider of oral 
solid, liquid and nasal generic medicines 
distributed to patients through pharmacies, 
hospitals, health benefits programmes and 
other customers.

We are also a top three manufacturer of 
injectable medicines by volume3 and operate 
a sterile compounding business focused on 
providing high quality, ready-to-administer 
injectable medications that are customised 
to the specific needs of hospital patients in 
the US.

Our work also involves coordination with 
policy makers to better address persistent 
drug shortages and to align our domestic 
production with the needs of patients and 
medicine availability. During 2023, we 
continued our membership in the Association 
for Accessible Medicines to advocate for 
national and local policies, legislation and 
regulation aimed at supporting and 
strengthening Hikma’s ability to supply the 
U.S. healthcare system and its patients with 
a steady supply of essential medicines, 
especially certain medicines that are often 
in shortage. 

Access to medicines
At Hikma, we are dedicated to improving 
people’s lives by providing access to 
affordable, high-quality medicines to patients 
in need. This is embodied in our corporate 
purpose: putting better health within reach, 
every day. 

To fulfill this purpose, we continually develop 
and launch products at competitive prices 
across our markets and expand the 
availability of our existing product portfolio 
by entering new markets or expanding 
manufacturing capabilities in our 
existing markets. 

We are also working with stakeholders 
including healthcare professionals and policy 
makers to ensure better support for patient 
needs and stronger local healthcare 
ecosystems, and with non-governmental 
organisations to continue expanding our 
medicine donation programme.

Generic pharmaceutical companies play a 
pivotal role in enhancing global access to 
medicines. The manufacture and availability 
of generic medicines help to improve the 
affordability and reliability of supply for 
essential medications, thereby alleviating 
global disease burdens and healthcare 
disparities.

Governance
In 2022, we established an Access to 
Medicine Committee chaired by two 
members of the Executive Committee, one 
of whom sits on the Board of Directors – the 
Executive Vice Chairman and President of 
MENA, and the EVP, Corporate Development 
and M&A. The aim of the Committee is to 
strengthen collaboration across our business 
in promoting equitable access and improving 
the patient journey. 

During the year, coordination within the 
Committee took place to identify and 
establish meaningful metrics that measure 
patient impacts and outcomes, and to 
enhance disclosure and reporting around 
accessibility. The latter is reflected in higher 
scores that were achieved by Hikma for ESG 
ratings agencies including MSCI and 
Sustainalytics, due largely to enhanced 
disclosure of Hikma’s efforts to advance 
health equity and access to medicines.

Medicine donations and 
other support programmes
We partner with local and international NGOs 
to donate medicines to patients in need and 
to support aid and relief to those impacted by 
natural disasters and conflicts. Through our 
programmes, we are able to divert urgent 
care to underserved population segments, 
such as low-income groups, displaced 
persons and those lacking sufficient 
medical coverage. 

In the US, our collaboration with the Global 
Smile Foundation over the last three years 
has enabled a group of volunteers to perform 
thousands of critical surgeries globally. In

Supporting the UN Refugee 
Agency scholarship programme 
in MENA
In 2020, we began our partnership with the United 
Nations Refugee Agency’s (UNHCR) Albert Einstein 
German Academic Refugee Initiative (DAFI) scholarship 
programme to provide scholarships to 40 displaced 
students residing in Algeria, Egypt and Jordan. Displaced 
persons and refugees often face barriers to receiving 
quality education and securing employment. 

Since its inception in 1992, the DAFI programme has 
extended scholarships to more than 24,000 displaced 
students globally, helping to provide them with 
opportunities to pursue higher education. 

In 2023, we undertook several activities in support of 
the DAFI Programme:

 – Organised site visits for 29 students to visit our 

manufacturing plants in Algeria, Egypt and Jordan 

 – Provided internship opportunities to several 

programme participants in Jordan 

 – Enabled DAFI participants to join our internal 
Innovation Camp platform in Jordan, which is 
dedicated to cultivating innovative thinking

Helping people in need

Supporting local food banks across the US
Since 2020, all of our locations in the US have partnered with local food banks 
or food pantries to help provide meals to community members in need. As 
communities struggled with the pandemic, job security and a recent rise in 
inflation, providing free meals is increasingly vital for those in need within 
our communities. In this spirit, we continue to provide financial donations to 
each partner, but also adapt our programmes to their needs. This includes 
organising volunteer activities, fundraisers, and in-kind donations.

Employee health and safety
We continue to prioritise the health and 
safety of our people. Our Group 
Environmental Health and Safety policy 
statement, updated in 2024, strengthened 
and standardised our approach to ensuring 
the wellbeing of our employees globally.

We are continuously taking steps to improve 
the accuracy of health and safety-related 
performance metrics as well as how we 
govern the issue at the Group level. In 2024, 
we are appointing Julie Hill as the Senior Vice 
President of Corporate Quality Compliance 
and Health and Safety to improve how we 
govern health and safety and to standardize 
our methodology and ambitions around 
the issue. 

Employee wellbeing
We are committed to continuously engaging 
with our people to ensure that the employee 
experience improves over time and the 
feedback of our people is consistently taken 
into consideration. 

Our recent Hikma’s People Voice Survey, 
completed in early February 2024, measured 
employee sentiment across a range of issues 
and will enable us to improve the employee 
experience at Hikma.. This is one of the many 
engagement tools that we are using to ensure 
an open-feedback culture among our people. 

At Hikma, we deliver high quality instructor-
led programmes to our employees globally. 
Feedback has been very positive from 
both employees and managers on the 
effectiveness, quality, design and practicality 
of these programmes. In 2023, we received 
feedback from a total of more than 1,400 
learners and managers, achieving a 
favourability score of more than 
95% from both segments.

Empowering 
our people

Shaping an inclusive culture

Pay increases  
for employees
In our unwavering commitment to the 
wellbeing and long-term retention of our 
employees and recognising the global 
surge in inflation rates impacting our team 
members, Hikma is providing a targeted 
higher pay increase percentage in 2024 
than in previous years. 

This approach is specifically directed 
towards employees who are 
disproportionately impacted by higher 
inflation rates, which is the group from 
the first level of management and below 
these employees will receive a minimum 
guaranteed increase aligned with their 
country-base inflation rates.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Investing in our  
future leaders
In 2023, we launched both the Multipliers 
and Blanchard leadership programmes 
to cultivate leadership potential among 
high-performing employees. The focus 
of the programmes is on developing 
leadership skills and enabling employees 
to maximise the potential of their 
respective teams. The programmes 
involved 265 employees and included 
360-degree feedback assessments 
and development plans for our people 
to continue to nurture their skills and 
grow within the Company. 

We also continued to provide scholarship 
opportunities to employees through our 
global Continuing Education Programme. 

In 2023, we offered scholarships to 22 
employees, an increase of five over the 
previous year. Since its inception, the 
programme has supported 150 employees, 
including undergraduate and masters level 
scholarships, enabling our people to 
continue their education in fields 
valuable to the Group. 

Learning and development
We continue to focus on learning and 
development to improve the capabilities 
of our employees and strengthen their 
career growth potential. We are continually 
expanding our online resources and 
introducing structured curricula that are 
tailored to the needs of specific business 
functions. We are also improving accessibility 
and inclusivity of training programmes, 
offering training digitally and in various 
languages.

Diversity, equity and inclusion
Promoting diversity, equity and inclusion 
among our employees is a key ESG focus area 
that we feel strengthens the effectiveness of 
our workforce and promotes better employee 
satisfaction and retention. 

We remain committed to promoting a culture 
of progress and belonging that provides all 
employees with opportunities for personal 
and professional growth. We believe in 
fostering an inclusive workplace where all 
employees feel they belong, and as they 
grow and develop, so does Hikma.

We continue building our network of 
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) by 
strengthening our Black Employees Advisory 
Board and Hikma Women’s Network. 

We continue to focus on 
learning and development 
to improve the capabilities 
and growth potential of 
our people.”

On track

Partially achieved

We are committed to 
making our operations 
greener and to improving 
our environmental 
performance
In 2023, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions (market- 
based) measured 123,638 tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), achieving a 15% 
emissions decrease from our 2020 base year. 

During the year, we enhanced capacity for 
solar energy generation in Portugal and 
Jordan and completed equipment and 
machinery upgrades across our sites to 
improve energy efficiency. Investments in 
energy efficiency, cleaner technologies and 
renewable energy generation enabled us to 
maintain a stable emissions footprint during 
the year, despite significant site expansions 
and increases in production in multiple 
manufacturing facilities. 

Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
reduction target
In 2021, we put in place a target to reduce 
our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25% 
by 2030, using a 2020 baseline and market- 
based calculations. The target was developed 
using the absolute contraction approach and 
is in line with the Paris Climate Agreement’s 
well-below 2°C scenario.

We are making significant progress 
towards achieving our target. Compared to 
our base year (2020), our 2023 Scope 1 and 2 
emissions have decreased by 15%.

These reductions were achieved largely 
through the expansion of green electricity 
procurement in all of our European facilities 
and through investments in renewable 
energy infrastructure and other initiatives 
to improve energy efficiency across our 
sites. Although emissions increased by 
3% between 2022 and 2023, largely due to 
growth in the business, we continue to invest 
in efficiency while pursuing long-term, 
feasible opportunities to reduce our 
emissions footprint.

1.  Emissions for 2022 have been restated by -3% as we continue to improve our monitoring and analysis 

of environmental metrics

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Methodology and assurance
We quantify and report our organisational 
GHG emissions in alignment with the 
World Resources Institute’s Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard and in alignment 
with the Scope 2 Guidance.

We consolidate our organisational boundary 
according to the operational control 
approach, as described in the GHG Protocol 
Reporting Standard. This includes all our 
facilities and locations where we have 
operational control.

The GHG sources that constituted our 
operational boundary for Scope 1 and 2 are:

Scope 1:
 – Natural gas combustion
 – Diesel combustion
 – Petrol combustion
 – LPG/Propane combustion
 – Vehicle emissions
 – Fugitive emissions

Scope 2 (market-based and location-based):
 – Purchased electricity – standard
 – Purchased electricity – renewable

For reporting in this Annual Report, we 
have used data from January to September 
of 2023 and conducted an uplifting exercise 
to estimate quantities for October to 

GHG emissions (tCO2e)

December 2023. More information on this 
methodology can be found on our website. 
Our Sustainability Report, published later in 
2024, will contain updated emissions and 
environmental data for full-year 2023.

We continue to refine and improve how we 
monitor and manage our emissions. In this 
context, we engaged an external assurance 
provider to undertake private, independent 
limited assurance, through which we 
identified misstatements in 2022 energy 
and emissions calculations that are now 
accounted for and have subsequently 
lowered our stated 2022 GHG emissions 
by 3%. The misstatements occurred due 
to errors when recording natural gas 
consumption in our Columbus, Portugal and 
Egypt facilities. All references to 2022 energy 
and emissions profile in this report refer to 
the restated amounts. 

We have internal sustainability reporting 
criteria for key metrics which guide our 
sustainability reporting. The criteria define 
our reporting boundary and conditions for 
restatements, and establish a unified 
hierarchy for estimating consumption where 
actual data are not available. Our emissions 
calculation contains no material omissions, as 
determined by our reporting criteria and the 
reasonable level of assurance received on 
these data.

UK Emissions
The Group operates one location within the 
United Kingdom, where we are listed, which is 
an office building that is managed by a third 
party. During the year, the UK site consumed 
167 MWh of energy, which is equivalent to 
61 tCO2e.

The energy consumption is measured by 
meter readings provided by the managing 
agent and relates to electricity and gas used 
for heating, cooling and general office power. 
Reported fuel use between 2020 and 2022 
for the UK was an estimate that was 
developed based on employee headcount. 
The 2023 disclosure is based on actual 
data for which there was negligible 
reported fuel consumption. 

The Group does not provide transport within 
the UK other than via private hire vehicles for 
which consumption data is not available.

GHG emissions: Scope 3
We began measuring our indirect, Scope 3 
emissions in 2021, prioritising the oversight of 
emissions most relevant to our business. We 
continue to refine the quality of our emissions 
measurements and engage with our suppliers 
to better understand their commitments to 
emission reductions. 

In 2023, emissions from purchased goods 
and services increased compared to the 
previous year, reflecting the significant 
growth in production across our businesses. 
The increase in business travel emissions is 
attributable to an increase in travel spend 
after COVID-19 measures were removed. 
For employee commuting, which we began 
to measure in 2022, we continue to improve 
our mapping and classification of spend data 
to measure emissions from this source. 

Several categories were determined to be 
‘not relevant’ after we conducted an analysis 
of Scope 3 categories. Hikma does not have 
sufficient upstream or downstream leased 
assets to constitute a relevant emissions 
source. End of life treatment of our sold 
products also does not generate a significant 
emissions footprint. Lastly, Hikma does 
not maintain any franchises and no 
corresponding emissions footprint. More 
information about the rationale for categories 
that are determined to be ‘not relevant,’ is 
available in our 2023 CDP response. For 
categories that are ‘relevant but not yet 
calculated,’ we aim to consider their inclusion 
progressively over time. We have significantly 
improved our CO2 emissions calculations by 
further fine-tuning our classification, resulting 
in adjustments across greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions categories. In addition, a thorough 
review and modification of the mapping 
process was undertaken, with a deliberate 
focus on moving to a quantitative rather than 
a monetary mapping methodology.

Assurance of emissions data
EcoAct was engaged by Hikma to provide 
independent third-party reasonable 
verification of its direct (Scope 1) and indirect 
(Scope 2 and selected Scope 3) GHG 
emissions, as detailed in this report. Based 
on the data and information provided by 
Hikma and the processes and procedures 
followed, it is EcoAct’s verification opinion 
that the following GHG emissions totals are 
fairly stated and free from material error.

Verified emissions by EcoAct include:
 – Scope 1 emissions 
 – Combustion of gaseous fuels (natural gas, 

diesel, petrol and LPG) 

 – Fugitive emissions
 – Scope 2 emissions – Purchased electricity 
consumption (location and market-based)

 – Scope 3 emissions – Emissions including 

Scope 3 Category 3: Fuel & Energy Related 
Activities not included in Scope 1 or Scope 
2 (FERA), Category 5: Waste generated in 
operations (including water), and Category 
7: Employee commuting

For external assurance of the remaining 
Scope 3 categories (Category 1: Purchase 
of goods and services, Category 2: Capital 
goods, Category 4: Upstream transportation 
and distribution, and Category 6: Business 
Travel), we worked with an external third 
party, Sievo Oy, to assess our carbon 
footprint for these categories. Sievo has 
contracted Ernst & Young (EY) under a 
‘limited assurance engagement’, as defined 
by International Standards on Assurance 
Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) to report 
on the methodology and the emission 
factors used behind the ‘CO2 Analytics’ 
tool (the Tool) as of 2023.

The full verification statements can be found 
here: www.hikma.com/sustainability.

Sustainable supply chain
We remain dedicated to addressing the 
most critical social and environmental 
sustainability concerns throughout our 
value chain. Our Supplier Code of Conduct, 
introduced in 2022, articulates our core 
values and principles, defining our values 
and standards for ourselves, partners, 
and suppliers. This Code serves as the 
cornerstone of our ongoing efforts to fortify 
relationships, foster collaboration, and 
cultivate trust among all stakeholders, 
ultimately driving enhanced performance 
across our value chain. 

The Code reinforces standards we 
deem essential, such as safeguarding 
human rights, upholding ethical conduct, 
combatting modern slavery, and addressing 
environmental issues. The Code is available 
on our website. 

In collaboration with EcoVadis, we are 
advancing our understanding of the 
sustainability maturity of our suppliers, 
covering around 49% of our annual spend. 
Throughout the year, we actively engaged 
with our procurement community and 
key suppliers to elevate awareness of 
our suppliers’ sustainability maturity levels. 
Our outreach extended to primary materials 
suppliers through various supplier 
engagements covering suppliers who make 
up around 45% of Hikma’s Scope 3 footprint. 
Through this outreach we are better able to 
understand their aspirations for reducing 
their carbon footprint, transitioning to 
renewable energy and their aspirations for 
reducing carbon footprint, transitioning to 
renewable energy, and enhancing energy 
efficiency in production. 

Our objective is to expand the screening of 
sustainability criteria to a greater proportion 
of our major spend suppliers through 
collaboration with EcoVadis as well as utilising 
Hikma’s own sustainability questionnaire sent 
to selected suppliers. This commitment 
underscores our continuous pursuit of 
sustainable practices and responsible 
business conduct throughout our 
supply chain.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Water and waste management
The use of water and the management of 
waste are critical for the pharmaceutical 
manufacturing process and we have policies 
and practices in place to ensure we manage 
both effectively and in compliance with laws 
and regulations.

Following our assessment of water-related 
risks across all of our locations in 2021, we 
began a deep dive analysis of our facilities 
located in water-scarce areas. In order to 

address water scarcity in our locations 
of operation, we are improving water 
management systems and identified 
opportunities and gaps to conserve and use 
water more effiently. We also incorporated 
water as part of the Executive Director’s 
long-term incentive plan in 2023 and annual 
bonus in 2024 with an aim to set water 
management targets for all MENA sites by the 
end of 2025. More information about water 
and waste management will be included in 
our 2023 Sustainability Report.

We conducted a 
deep-dive analysis of 
water consumption for 
sites located in water-
stressed areas.”

we do

Upholding ethical standards 
and acting with integrity

We are committed to 
upholding the highest 
ethical standards in the 
conduct of our global 
business operations.”

54

Ethics and Compliance 
We are committed to upholding the highest 
ethical standards in the conduct of our global 
business operations. This is grounded in our 
values: innovative, caring, and collaborative. 
These values serve as the foundation for our 
strong governance framework. Our Code of 
Conduct (Code) sets out behaviours we 
expect from our employees as we conduct 
our business, and provides an overview of our 
legal, regulatory, and ethical requirements.

Our Code provides guidance to our 
employees and partners on the ethics of 
Hikma’s business activities through the 
identification and discussion of various 
risks associated with our business. Hikma 
employees, officers and directors are 
trained on the Code of Conduct as part of 
their orientation and are provided refresher 
training on a periodic basis. In 2023, the Code 
of Conduct training completion rate was 98%.

In addition to our Code, we have also 
developed policies and procedures designed 
to help employees and third parties put these 
behaviours into practice. Through our global 
compliance programme, we have adopted 
internal controls and management processes 
to ensure the responsible and ethical 
conduct of our business. This includes 
compliance with all relevant global and local 
laws, codes and regulations wherever we 
operate. We believe in transparency and 
promote a culture that encourages 
employees to raise any concerns about 
potential violation of laws and regulations, 
or any other behaviours or incidents that 
do not comply with our Code of Conduct. 

In addition, our speak up line provides 
both internal and external stakeholders the 
ability to raise concerns about suspected 
misconduct confidentially. All cases received 
are reviewed by our Legal and Compliance 
teams, and investigated, as appropriate, by 
Legal and Compliance personnel. 
Substantiated violations of our Code of 
Conduct or other policies and procedures 
are addressed through our disciplinary 
procedures.

Our Compliance, Responsibility and 
Ethics Committee provides oversight of 
our global compliance programme and the 
management of associated risks, including 
bribery and corruption. We have a zero-
tolerance policy for bribery and corruption at 
Hikma. As a publicly listed company on the 
London Stock Exchange (LSE), we are subject 
to the regulations of the UK Listing Authority.

We also comply with the UK Bribery Act 2010 
and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as 
well as global anti-corruption standards and 
local anti-bribery and corruption laws.

We operate a formal third-party due diligence 
process for all third parties with whom we do 
business. This uses a set of risk evaluation 
criteria to place third parties into categories 
based on level of risk. High-risk third parties 
are subject to enhanced due diligence 
processes. Additionally, third parties are 
continuously monitored to identify potential 
reputational and compliance risks including 
sanctions, adverse media coverage and 
political affiliations. In 2023, our management 
team consolidated multiple platforms used 
for supplier registration, onboarding, risk 
and performance evaluation, sourcing, and 
contracting by transitioning into a single, 
multifunctional tool. It seamlessly integrated 
with our ERP system, Moody’s risk data, and 
EcoVadis’s sustainability rating tool to ensure 
full transparency and adherence to our 
risk processes. 

Product quality and safety 
Ensuring the wellbeing and safety of our 
patients is the core of our mission. We uphold 
a strict pharmacovigilance framework to 
safeguard against patient harm and to 
guarantee the safe, effective use of 
our products.

We have globally aligned processes to 
identify, assess, and communicate any 
changes in the benefit-risk balance of our 
products and to implement timely corrective 
and preventative actions.

Our pharmacovigilance efforts span the 
entire lifecycle of our products on a global 
scale, adhering to all regional regulations 
and deadlines for safety reporting.

Pharmacovigilance is monitored at 
the highest levels of our business and is 
included in our enterprise risk management 
process, which is overseen by the Executive 
Committee and the Board on a regular basis.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Ensuring the quality and 
safety of our patients is 
the core of our mission.”

Maintaining constituency 
in FTSE4Good Index
We maintained our membership of the 
FTSE4Good Index Series for the ninth 
consecutive year. The FTSE4Good is an index 
of LSE-listed companies that demonstrate 
strong Environmental, Social and Governance 
(ESG) practices as measured against globally 
recognised standards. The index assesses 
the sustainability-related performance of 
companies, particularly around addressing 
themes including human rights, anti-
corruption, environmental performance, 
health and safety, and community 
engagement. FTSE4Good assessments are 
used by a wide variety of market participants 
to develop responsible investment funds and 
other products.

To ensure the applicability, adequacy, and 
effectiveness of our pharmacovigilance 
system, we monitor our worldwide 
compliance metrics on a monthly basis. 
These metrics are documented in global 
pharmacovigilance monthly reports and 
are discussed in global pharmacovigilance 
monthly meetings. Furthermore, findings 
from pharmacovigilance audits and 
inspections and the status of implementing 
corrective and preventative actions are 
discussed in quarterly pharmacovigilance 
quality meetings.

Our marketed products (either manufactured 
by Hikma or outsourced through partners) 
comply with Current Good Manufacturing 
Practices (cGMPs). We implement quality 
oversight on our suppliers, partners and 
sub-licensors to ensure that these 
stakeholders are in full compliance with 
regulatory standards and Hikma 
requirements. Quality agreements are in 
place to focus on compliance to cGMPs 
and define each party’s responsibilities. 
Risk-based cGMP audits are also conducted 
on suppliers by our global quality team and 
other reputable third-party consultants.

Governance
Board level oversight
Our Board of Directors has overarching 
oversight of our environmental sustainability 
strategy and considers climate-related 
matters throughout the year. Our EVP 
Strategic Planning and Global Affairs 
provides ESG-related updates to the Board, 
including climate-related risks and 
opportunities, progress against environment-
related targets and any changes in risk status, 
in scheduled bi-annual meetings. The Board 
has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s 
approach to risk management and internal 
control. The Audit Committee oversees risk 
management and internal control activities 
with delegated authority from the Board 
(see Risk Management section, page 68). 

The TCFD working group presented the 
findings from the TCFD work this year to the 
Audit Committee. A general progress report 
is sent to the Executive Chairman of the 
Board three times a year, that includes a 
section on TCFD-related projects progress 
and environmental impact reporting. The 
Remuneration Committee linked 
environment-related targets to the 2023 
Annual bonus as well as the 3-year Long 
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for the Executive 
Chairman and Executive Vice Chairman of 
the Board, those were related to emissions 

reduction and water stress mitigation. 
ESG-related initiatives have been included 
in our five-year capital expenditure business 
plan, overseen by the Board. 

Management level leadership
Our EVP Strategic Planning and Global 
Affairs, who reports directly into our CEO, 
heads up the TCFD working Group, that 
started in 2021 and consists of senior 
representatives from Group Risk 
Management, Procurement, Finance, 
Sustainability and Investor Relations. This 
group leads our internal cross-functional 
efforts to integrate the TCFD 
recommendations into our business 
and meets on a regular basis. Our crisis and 
continuity teams work closely with members 
of the TCFD working group and provide 
valuable insight into the potential impact of 
climate-related risks on our operations. In 
addition, external consultants help progress 
our understanding of Hikma’s climate-related 
risks and opportunities. The Environmental 
Sustainability Committee reviews metrics, 
progress against TCFD recommendations 
and our targets and oversees the 
development of action plans. We continue to 
focus on strengthening our ESG governance, 
including climate change, at all levels of the 
organisation.

Process for identifying and 
assessing climate-related risks
We identify and assess climate-related risks 
using a range of approaches. We conduct 
risk identification and assessment exercises 
as part of the enterprise risk management 
process with all risk owners across the 
business (see page 68) for details on our 
risk processes). The outcomes of these 
reviews feed into the TCFD working group’s 
assessment of the most relevant climate-
related risks for Hikma. The TCFD working 
group monitors relevant current and 
emerging regulation, market risks, 
reputational risks, technology risks and acute 
and chronic physical risks. In 2022, we went 
through an independent review of our CSA 
work and our efforts to align with the TCFD 
recommendations, concluding that we have a 
well-developed TCFD response, year-on-year 
improvement and clear management 
processes to assess climate-related risk. 
Our CSA exercises are robust, using publicly 
available data and projections. 

Climate Scenario Analysis (CSA) 
methodology
To assess Hikma’s climate-related risks and 
opportunities over the short, medium and 
long-term, we have undertaken, with third 
party support, a CSA and financial impact 
assessment. The CSA assessed a range of 
potential climate-related risks and 
opportunities across different climate 
scenarios and time horizons incorporating 
public reference projections for changes to 
the climate system, socio-economic 
pathways, energy market dynamics, 
technological progress and financial risks. 

To support the narrative and understanding 
of climate-related risks and opportunities,  
we refined our climate scenario narratives in 
2023. These narratives were informed by 
climate projections, per the table below. 

We have been performing CSA since 2021 
and are continuously improving our insights. 
The table shows the details of the climate 
scenarios that we used over the years.

Climate scenario narratives in 2023

Low Carbon world (~1.5°C) 
Orderly 

Low Carbon world (~1.5–2°C)
Disorderly

This is a ‘Net Zero by 2050’ aligned 
scenario where global temperature 
rise is limited to 1.5°C warming. The 
transition is smooth and immediate. 

This is a ‘Net Zero by 2050’ aligned 
scenario where global temperature rise 
is limited to 1.5°C but the transition is 
divergent and/or delayed. 

Transition risks are likely to 
be experienced associated with 
the transition to a green economy 
however, physical risks will be reduced.

Significant transition risks are likely 
to be experienced associated with the 
transition; however, physical risks will 
be reduced.

High Carbon world (~3–4°C) 

This is a ‘business-as-usual’ scenario 
where global temperatures rise to 
3–4°C above pre-industrial levels.

Climate policies are not sufficient 
to achieve official commitments and 
physical risks considerably increase 
resulting in catastrophic impacts.

The Low Carbon world-Disorderly transition is considered the most relevant scenario to Hikma and those scenario assumptions have 
been used in financial statement preparations for alignment.

Integrating risk management processes
Climate-related risks are identified, 
assessed, and managed by teams across 
the organisation, depending on the nature 
of the risk. Our risk management framework 
(see page 68) provides a structure for 
significant risks to be escalated and 
integrated into our enterprise risk 
management process. 

Examples of how climate-related risks are 
managed and integrated into existing risk 
management activities include: 
 – Longer-term viability assessment: 

environment and climate change related 
risks included in the scenario modelling 
(see page 76)

 – Crisis and continuity management 

programme: site assessments of physical 
risks and controls (see page 74)

 – TCFD alignment is considered as part

Climate-related opportunities
We acknowledge that climate change can 
result in climate-related opportunities such 
as the impact on stakeholder expectations, 
talent attraction and retention. In addition, 
changing demographics, migration and 
evolving disease prevalence might drive 
changing needs for certain medicines. We 
have not yet quantified those opportunities. 
In 2024, we will continue to develop our 
understanding of how we might benefit from 
those opportunities. As part of our energy 
strategy, we invest in on-site renewable 
energy where possible and appropriate. 
Our geographical footprint covers a range of 
locations, some with mature energy transition 
strategies, and some with emerging 
economies and developing energy transition 
strategies. We are continuously monitoring 
these developments. 

Financial impact of climate-related risks 
and opportunities

Materiality
For the purpose of climate risk analysis, we 
apply a risk scoring matrix that considers 
likelihood, velocity of risks, financial impact, 
and a wide variety of possible impacts 
including but not limited to delivery of 
strategic objectives, patient safety, product 
quality, reputation, continuity of supply, 
management time and effort to remediate. In 
the context of climate risk analysis, the CSA 
results do not exceed our climate-related 
financial materiality threshold in the most 
relevant scenario Low Carbon world-
Disorderly transition.

Strategy
Risks and opportunities identified
In 2023, we organised a workshop with key 
stakeholders from different businesses, 
corporate functions, and geographical 
regions to review how our strategic business 
drivers might be impacted by climate change. 
Participants included our TCFD Working 
Group (Investor relations, Finance, 
Sustainability, Risk, Procurement) as well 
as management from Operations, R&D, 
Manufacturing, Engineering, Supply Chain 
and Commercial. We explored how external 
influencing factors such as regulation, 
technology, energy costs, changing medical 
needs, supply chain vulnerability and the 
political landscape might translate into 
climate-related risks to our business, and also 
what kind of climate-related opportunities 
might arise. We have updated our risk register 
with several climate-related risks and 
opportunities to further explore in 2024. 

Our updated climate-related risk register 
consists of 16 risks and opportunities. 
Through our risk management framework 
and assessment methodologies, we selected 
the following climate-related risks and 
opportunities, deemed to be most relevant 
and for which modelling could be enhanced, 
for further analysis: 

Physical risks
 – Impact of extreme weather events, 
including impact of severe floods 
and storms

 – Impact of chronic changes to the 
natural environment, including 
increased water stress 

Transition risks
 – Impact of carbon pricing, including 

carbon pricing mechanisms, carbon 
pass-through costs in the supply chain 
and the increased cost of raw material

 – Impact of energy pricing

How did we calculate the potential financial impact of carbon pricing?
We used the EcoAct Carbon and Energy Pricing Tool, that is informed by academic research, CDP data, and publicly available carbon price 
projections from the International Energy Agency. Cost exposure is calculated based on projected carbon and energy prices, combined 
with Hikma’s projected consumption of relevant goods and services.

How would this risk affect operations and financial planning? 
Direct emissions from Hikma’s purchased goods and services will be regulated by (future) carbon pricing mechanisms, climate regulation 
and carbon tax. Carbon pass-through costs from 3rd parties in our supply chain, who are subject to carbon pricing (such as transport, 
distribution suppliers) will have an indirect impact on our cost base. Raw materials and packaging costs may increase due to climate-related 
constraints on plastics, labour and energy. We incorporated the following categories in our analysis: finished and semi-finished goods, 
upstream transport, energy, API, packaging, excipients, and intermediates. 

Our diverse global presence (North America, Europe, MENA) sees varying degrees of sustainability advancement in our manufacturing 
countries, which necessitates constant monitoring and agile adaptation to evolving market conditions. For the time horizon to 2050 in a Low 
Carbon world – Disorderly transition, carbon prices will increase, however we deem the financial impact still not material at this stage. 
Although the range exceeds the materiality threshold in the context of climate-related risks, it is important to note that the upper end of the 
range arises in the Low Carbon world - Orderly transition, a scenario that we deem unlikely to happen. 

How are we managing this risk? 
We routinely look at ways to manage our procurement costs and offset price increases. Our sustainable procurement programme aims to 
better understand the carbon impact of purchased goods and services. As a key mitigation strategy, we engage with key material suppliers 
to understand their carbon reduction objectives, and the activities they are undertaking to move to renewable energy and increase energy 
efficiency in their operations. Through supplier engagement, we expect to be able to partially mitigate the impact of carbon cost pass-
through in the future. In our CSA, we calculated different potential mitigation scenarios, where the impact of carbon pricing would be 
constrained. While current exposure is low, it is expected that carbon costs will increase over the coming decade as more countries 
establish carbon prices. We continue to monitor developments.

How did we calculate the potential financial impact of energy pricing?
We used the EcoAct Carbon and Energy Pricing Tool, that is informed by price projections from the EnerData EnerFuture database. Cost 
exposure is calculated based on projected energy prices, combined with Hikma’s projected consumption of electricity and natural gas.

How would this risk affect operations and financial planning? 
It is not certain that Hikma will face increasing energy cost over time, as governments have not pledged to implement policies directly 
intended to increase the cost of electricity and natural gas. However, limiting factors such as increasing energy demand because 
of population growth, technology and renewable energy investment, in combination with interrupted supply because of natural disaster, 
conflict and limited metals may increase energy pricing in our value chain. The financial impact relates to the potential change in Hikma’s 
energy cost from a 2022 baseline, reflecting an increase in energy cost for electricity and natural gas at our manufacturing sites and offices. 
In both Low Carbon world scenarios, electricity prices rise through 2030 but tend to fall sharply afterwards, counterbalancing the impact 
of increased consumption. To further improve the modelling, transition to lower carbon energies should be included, as well as increased 
on-site generation capacity, which would reduce consumption and cost exposure.

How are we managing this risk?
Hikma is continuously evaluating opportunities to transition to renewable energy in each of our three regions (North America, Europe, 
MENA). Opportunities differ in potential, depending on the maturity of the markets that we operate in and the required financial 
investments. Where price increases might occur, Hikma may choose to accelerate site and country-specific adjustments to 
substitute natural gas for electricity, and vice-versa. Future modelling should account for this possibility.

How did we calculate the potential financial impact of storms?
To calculate the potential financial impact of severe storms, we used data from the ThinkHazard database, the National Hurricane Centre 
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration portal to determine climate-related risk exposure baselines. A financial impact 
matrix was developed with degrees of asset and inventory loss or damage, and the length of operational shutdown was assumed based on 
the qualitative and quantitative narrative for each storm category in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. 

How did we calculate the potential financial impact of floods?
Hikma sites and key supplier sites were screened for both pluvial and coastal flood risk using the Aqueduct Flood Hazard Maps. In addition, 
a 15 km radius around Hikma sites was screened for indirect pluvial flooding risk. Financial modelling was conducted using operational 
disruption and loss from inundation at facility. 

How would this risk affect operations and financial planning? 
Extreme weather events impacting our facilities, might cause interrupted manufacturing or supply of key resources. They may impact 
national infrastructure and could lead to power outages, restrictions on access for supply chain and workforce leading to downtime, lost 
sales, fines and potentially in the end reputational damage. Extreme weather events may also impact critical suppliers leading to downtime, 
lost sales, fines, and reputational damage. While no sites were identified with direct exposure to inundation risk, more research is needed to 
assess the indirect inundation risk.

One site in the US was exposed to the risk of extreme storms. The potential financial implications of physical risks under the worst-case 
scenario High Carbon world (for extreme weather events ) are anticipated to remain minimal through at least 2030. 

How are we managing this risk? 
With the insights from our modelling and understanding that these risks are not significant to our sites at this stage, we will continue to 
engage with our operational facilities teams in the highest risk regions to ensure our business continuity and recovery processes are fit 
for purpose.

$5m - $6m

$10m - $14m 

Low Carbon world – Disorderly transition

High Carbon world

How did we calculate the potential financial impact of water stress?
We looked at the potential future cost of water and potential EBIT loss due to production downtime as a result of water rationing. Total future 
water costs in our CSA consist of municipal water supply costs and water tanker costs (including fuel price projections). We assumed that 
the cost of municipal and tanker water change proportionally to water stress and a production site’s water consumption will increase 
proportionally to the growth rate. At the same time, the number of days with lack of access to water supply increases proportionally to the 
degree of water stress and the site’s water storage mitigation. All total costs are based off future water consumption projected using the 
Hikma production growth rate.

How would this risk affect operations and financial planning? 
Given that water is used for cleaning in our manufacturing processes, we consider water stress a risk. Water stress is likely to increase in the 
future due to increases in demands for water from growing populations and industry and from a decrease in fresh water supply due to 
climate change. Shortage and potential rationing of water could potentially lead to disrupted operations and could financially impact Hikma 
both through increased cost of water supply and from loss of EBIT from production downtime. Only direct and tangible financial impacts 
have been assessed in the 2023 CSA. Other consequences such as impacts to workforce, increased political unrest or conflict, and impacts 
to third parties have not been assessed, but Hikma acknowledges them. Our CSA initially focused on four countries (Jordan, Saudi Arabia, 
Algeria and Egypt) and shows that Hikma faces potential water stress in both baseline and future projection scenarios, resulting in 
increased water costs and potential loss of EBIT due to production downtime. At this stage, impact figures are not currently material 
and are mitigated by storage capacity. 

How are we managing this risk?
To mitigate the risk of water shortage, we hold onsite storage capacity. Other mitigation actions include implementing water reduction and 
saving initiatives on site.

Our executive remuneration goals steer us towards achieving good water management at all Hikma’s sites in MENA (where water stress is 
most apparent) by establishing water management systems, processes and targets, and implementing opportunities for efficient water use.

Resilience of our strategy
The results of our CSA show that climate 
change is not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group’s strategy or financial 
viability for the time horizon to 2030. Our 
CSA, longer-term viability statement and 
impairment tests are aligned through 
common scenario inputs. We will continue 
to strengthen our monitoring metrics and 
understand where we need to improve our 
mitigation controls. 

Our model inputs in the CSA do not include 
mitigating actions on the part of Hikma, our 
suppliers, or governments, for example, and 
cover time horizons well beyond our current 
business planning. We recognise that 
climate-related risks will continue to develop 
over a significantly longer period and believe 
that we will be able to adapt our strategy and 
respond appropriately to emerging climate-
related risks that could have a material 
impact on the Group in the future. Where we 
identify any areas for improvement, we will 
build clear action plans and ownership to 
address these gaps and ensure our long-
term resilience.

Executive remuneration
To ensure continued focus on Hikma’s 
commitment to reduce emissions, we have 
linked progress towards our climate-related 
programmes to executive remuneration. 
The Executive Vice Chairman’s performance 
target for 2023 included a responsibility to 
complete energy audits in two MENA 
countries together with action plans for 
achieving reductions. Also, we have 
adopted water-related targets as part of 
management’s Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
More details can be found in the Governance 
section on page 103.

The following table highlights metrics that 
are linked to our climate-related risks and 
that are helping us better understand 
and monitor the impact of these risks.

Progress against targets is described 
in the Sustainability section.

Metrics and targets
We are committed to minimising our impact 
on the environment. As a growing company, 
we are working to measure and manage our 
use of resources to ensure sustainable 
growth. We recognise that manufacturing 
and delivering medicines has an impact on 
the natural environment and are committed 
to the efficient and responsible management 
of energy, water and waste, both within our 
organisation as well as across our value 
chain. In order to maintain our success as an 
organisation, it is important that we continue 
to manage resources responsibly and 
consider long-term environmental 
impacts where we do business.

Metrics to assess climate-related risks and 
opportunities
We are disclosing our environmental 
sustainability data including historical 
data and calculation methodologies in 
our Sustainability section (page 39). We 
are measuring and managing our carbon 
footprint and are disclosing our Scope 1, 
Scope 2 and material Scope 3 emissions. 
We provide details on our water consumption 
and our waste management. We will continue 
to analyse Scope 3 categories that are 
relevant and material but not yet calculated. 
Increasing energy costs or carbon pricing 
present potential risks to our business. 
In addition, as part of the ‘Reputation’ 
principal risk (see page 72), we monitor our 
performance against external ESG ratings.

Risk management

In 2023, we faced complex situations and 
managed the risks with coordinated 
and effective responses.

Risk management framework
Risk context
Our purpose is to put better health within 
reach, every day for healthcare professionals 
and their patients. We bring patients across 
North America, MENA and Europe a broad 
range of generic, specialty and branded 
pharmaceutical products.

The future is uncertain and carries risks for 
our business. These risks may be threats or 
opportunities related to our strategy and 
delivery of our goals, our activities and 
processes, the expectations of our 
stakeholders, or our key relationships 
and dependencies.

Find out more about the internal and external 
context for risk management for the Group 
in the ‘Our strategy’ (on pages 10–11), 
‘Our business model’ (on pages 12–13) 
and ‘Our markets’ (on pages 18–19) 
sections of the report.

Risk strategy
Effective management of risk is fundamental 
for the long-term success of the Group. 
We operate an Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) framework to ensure that we are 
comprehensive and structured in our 
approach. The framework enables a thorough 
view of our risk exposure to be developed, 
which informs our decision-making and 
improves our strategic, tactical, operational 
and compliance processes. The approach 

enables us to fulfil our obligations and 
provides assurance that our activities 
are appropriately controlled.

Risk appetite
The Board determines the nature and extent 
of the principal risks it is willing to take and 
communicates this through the Group risk 
appetite. The risk appetite outlines expected 
management strategies and details limits and 
tolerances on risk exposure for each of the 
principal risks. It forms the foundation of the 
ERM framework and guides management 
decision-making across the Group. The risk 
appetite is reviewed twice a year at Board-
level and is monitored by management 
on an ongoing basis.

Risk governance
The Board has overall accountability for 
the Group’s approach to risk management 
and internal control. The Audit Committee 
oversees risk management and internal 
control activities with delegated authority 
from the Board.

The Audit Committee reviews the material 
risks facing the Group, considering different 
sources of assurance, including executive 
management, internal audit, and external 
audit. The Chair of the Audit Committee 
is a standing member of the Compliance, 
Responsibility and Ethics Committee (CREC) 
to ensure connection between the Board 
Committees with primary risk oversight 
responsibilities1.

Internal audit provides independent 
assurance of the Group’s internal control 
environment. For more details on our internal 
audit approach see page 97.

The Group risk management function 
enables and drives effective risk 
management practices, guides global risk 
owners in assessing and reporting their risks, 
coordinates emerging risk assessments, and 
establishes connections and partnerships 
across the organisation to promote and 
develop a responsible risk culture.

Compliance and internal control functions 
with professional expertise in managing risk 
and internal control in specialist areas are 
in place across the organisation.

The CEO and Executive Committee have 
direct ownership of risk management for the 
Group. Risk management accountability is 
fully embedded within their executive 
responsibilities.

As part of the risk governance framework, 
senior executives are assigned responsibility 
for specific principal risks. These global risk 
owners coordinate risk management 
activities across the organisation with 
support from management teams to manage 
risk exposure in line with the risk appetite.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Risk management activities
Risk management activities occur at all levels 
of the organisation. The ERM framework 
provides structure for these activities to 
ensure consistency of approach, alignment 
to the risk appetite and monitoring of our 
risk exposure across the Group.

The Group risk management function 
coordinates regular risk assessments to 
review management of risks we already know 
about, and to identify, analyse and evaluate 
new and emerging risks. These assessments 
are consolidated through the Group risk 
management function and reported to 
the Executive Committee by the global 
risk owners.

Compliance and internal control functions, 
and internal audit, also conduct regular 
formalised risk assessments in relation 
to their mandates.

Summarised reports and key outcomes 
of risk assessments are reviewed by 
management teams, the Audit 
Committee and Board.

In addition to these core reporting processes, 
various other risk management activities 
occurred during the year.

Risk management in practice
Our ability to effectively manage risk enables 
delivery of our objectives. To ensure we are 
action-oriented in managing threats and 
opportunities we categorise our risks 
considering significance of exposure and 
the opportunity for management action.

An example of our risk management in 
practice is seen in the ‘Sudan conflict’ 
case study on the next page. 

Strategic risks
Group level strategic risk assessments are 
conducted by the Executive Committee 
and Board of Directors with a formal review 
on an annual basis to consider threats and 
opportunities related to our strategy from 
internal and external perspectives and 
over various time horizons.

Emerging risks
Emerging risks are those that are newly 
identified and have the potential to become 
significant risks for the Group, those that 
may already be well known but are rapidly 
changing, or those that are developing over a 
longer term that may have significant impact 
on our ability to achieve our objectives.

Internal control activities
Compliance and internal control functions 
across the Group develop and manage 
internal control systems, frameworks and 
processes for their areas of focus as part of 
risk mitigation strategies, to meet internal 
and external expectations, and to ensure 
compliance with regulatory requirements.

Often driven by forces outside our control, 
emerging risks may be mitigated by existing 
control frameworks but are assessed to 
determine if any aspects fall outside current 
processes or if the controls in place may 
become inadequate as the risk develops.

Priorities for 2024
In 2024 we will continue to develop 
connections and partnerships between 
compliance and internal control functions, 
and external groups to bring greater 
assurance for the Group.

We will prepare and adapt to the updated 
UK Corporate Governance Code.

We will further develop sustainability and 
climate-related risk assessments alongside 
our alignment with the recommendations 
from the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (see pages 56–65 
for more details).

Our approach involves establishing 
cross-functional teams to assess the threats 
and opportunities, recognising these may 
develop over an extended timeframe. The 
risk assessment methods deployed vary and 
may involve engaging with external experts, 
scenario modelling, engagement with 
existing risk mitigation programmes, and 
development of new risk mitigation and 
control strategies that will be sustainable 
over the longer term.

We scan for emerging risks in a wide array 
of domains, including economics and 
geopolitics, social and demographic, 
technology, legal and regulatory, environment 
and sustainability, global and local workforce, 
and business and competitive environment. 
We focus our emerging risk assessments and 
monitoring according to likelihood, impact 
and velocity.

Examples of emerging risks that are 
monitored include geopolitical instability 
in the Middle East, changing working 
models, development of generative 
artificial intelligence, disruptive forces in 
the competitive environment, and physical 
and transitional climate change related 
risks and opportunities.

Case study: 

Sudan conflict
The conflict in Sudan has caused 
catastrophic disruption for the country, 
and impacted our employees, our 
business and the community we serve. 
We responded to the situation and we 
are adapting our operating model to 
the new realities. See Note 6 on page 
160 for information on the financial 
impact to Hikma.

Situation overview
 – In April 2023, violent conflict erupted 
in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. 
The conflict spread to other parts of the 
country and has caused a humanitarian 
crisis with millions of people displaced 
from their homes and adverse impact 
to the Sudanese economy

 – Borders closed and travel in and 
around Khartoum became unsafe

 – The banking system was not operational
 – The health system was severely 
impacted, with hospitals and 
distributors operating at very 
limited capacity

Risk management response
 – Structured response: Our trained 
Crisis Management Teams were 
activated to respond to the rapidly 
changing complex, abnormal and 
unstable situation 

 – Employee focus: the safety and 

support for our employees was the 
priority of our response. Local 
management established regular 
two-way communication with the team 
to ensure that, where possible given 
the hugely challenging environment, we 
were supporting their needs. Decisions 
on restructuring the local organisation 
were carefully considered and 
employees were supported financially
 – Security: arrangements were bolstered 
at our premises to protect our people 
and our assets

SUDAN

KHARTOUM

 – Board oversight: the Board maintained 
oversight and guided management’s 
response throughout the situation
 – Halted operations: as the situation 
developed and as the impact of the 
conflict on our people and premises 
became clear we halted operations 
 – Communication and disclosure: once 

the potential scale of the impact became 
clear, we communicated externally to 
highlight the financial significance of 
the situation for the Group

 – Community: we organised emergency 

response medicine donations to 
government through humanitarian 
non-profit organisations

 – Insurance: we worked with the insurance 
provider on evaluating the losses and 
providing all the support, documentation, 
and any required information, to recoup 
losses covered under the policy

 – Government and healthcare 

authority: we have engaged with 
the regulatory authority and Ministry 
of Health in Sudan to support 
development of new procedures 
to enable access to medicines via 
importation from countries including 
Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt 

 – Logistics and operating model: with 

the interests of patients and community 
in mind we assessed alternative 
business model options and have 
started supply to the market in limited 
volumes

 – Lessons learned: we conducted reviews 
of our response effectiveness which 
have informed our resilience 
programmes across the Group

Outcome
Through these and various other actions 
we were able to support our employees 
and the community, and take learnings 
to continue to build the resilience of 
our organisation as a whole.

We put the health and safety of 
our employees and patients first.”

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group faces risks from a range of sources that could have 
a material impact on our financial commitments and ability 
to trade in the future.

The Board performs robust assessments of strategic, operating 
and emerging risks for the Group considering our risk context 
and input from executive management. 

In 2023, Hikma faced the impact of geopolitical and macroeconomic 
events, including the conflict in Sudan and the ongoing economic 
challenges affecting Egypt which impacts our supply chain and 
currency exchange. The situation in the Middle East and Red Sea is 
closely monitored for developments and consequences for Hikma, 
including increased shipping costs and lead times. These situations 
are managed to the degree possible by local, regional and group 
management teams across multiple principal risk areas, overseen 
by the Executive Committee and Board.

The Board adjusted the ‘Industry dynamics’ principal risk description 
to include reference to geopolitical events, macroeconomic factors 
and local political action to better characterise the risk for Hikma in 

light of the events of the year. The previous ‘Organisational 
development’ principal risk has been renamed ‘People’.

The Board determined that the principal risks facing the Group have 
not materially changed over the year and that there are no new 
principal risks to be added.

The set of principal risks should not be considered as an exhaustive 
list of all the risks the Group faces. Certain risk factors are outside 
the control of management.

The Board recognises that the principal risks are dynamic and 
that management of these risks must be continuous as the risk 
environment changes. The Board is satisfied that the principal 
risks are being managed appropriately and consistently within 
the target risk appetite.

Effectively managing these risks is directly linked to the performance 
of our strategic KPIs (see pages 16–17) and the delivery of the 
strategic priorities outlined on pages 10–11. Our principal risks are 
set out below with examples of management actions that help to 
control the risk; the actions described do not include all actions 
taken by management.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Going concern and longer-term viability
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 
Provisions 28–31 and other regulatory disclosure requirements, 
going concern and longer-term viability assessments are provided.

Assessment of position and prospects
The Group’s current and forecast financial positions are used 
to assess the going concern position and longer-term viability.

The position and prospects of the Group are assessed at 
Executive Committee meetings and at the end of the financial 
year. The assessments consider strategic and operational updates, 
principal and emerging risks, financial reporting and forecasting 
from the Chief Financial Officer, and through the development of 
a business plan. The business plan takes into account our current 
position, specific risks and uncertainties facing the business and 
known changes to our organisation and business model.

The Executive Committee assesses the future strategic positioning 
of Hikma as a company in the context of the changing business 
environment. Aspects of this analysis are shown in ‘Our markets’ 
(see pages 18–19).

These various assessments are presented to the Audit Committee 
and Board of Directors for independent scrutiny of management’s 
assumptions and modelling approach. The Board also receives 
regular updates on operational, strategic and financial matters 
from executives.

Financial position
The going concern and longer-term viability assessments are 
based on the financial position (as at 31 December 2023):

 – net cash flow from operating activities was $608 million
 – overall net debt was $976 million (1.2 times core EBITDA)
 – available borrowing capacity is $1,284 million of committed 
undrawn long-term facilities (see Note 29 of the Group 
consolidated financial statements on page 183). These facilities 
are well-diversified across the subsidiaries of the Group and are 
with a number of financial institutions

Financial covenants are suspended while the Group retains 
its investment grade status from two rating agencies1. As of 
31 December 2023 the Group’s investment grade rating was 
affirmed by S&P and Fitch.

Future prospects
The Group’s base case forecasts take into account reasonable 
possible changes in trading performance, including those that 
may arise related to various inflationary effects, currency volatility, 
facility renewal sensitivities, and maturities of long-term debt.

Assumptions
Financial modelling for the business plan and the going concern 
and viability assessments is subject to assumptions related to:

 – launch and commercialisation of new products
 – market share and product demand rates
 – maintenance of certain product prices
 – political and social stability
 – ability to increase operational efficiency and reduce central costs 
 – effective tax rate being within the current guidance range
 – ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity (for longer-

term viability)

Going concern
For the purposes of assessing the going concern position the base 
case and a forecast including severe but plausible downside risks 
were analysed over a period longer than 12 months from the date 
of signing the financial statements.

The analysis shows that Hikma is well-placed to manage its business 
and financial risks successfully despite current uncertainties and 
confirms that the going concern basis should be used in preparing 
the financial statements.

Severe but plausible downside risk 
scenarios are used to test the viability 
of the Group.”

Longer-term viability
Viability period
The longer-term viability of the Group is assessed for a period 
longer than for the going concern analysis. The longer-term viability 
assessment was conducted for a period of three years, ending on 
31 December 2026. This is the timeframe for acquisitions and business 
development opportunities to become integrated into our business, 
and for pipeline products to contribute as marketed products. Our 
forecasts are more accurate in the near term than in the long term 
and this limitation also applies to our viability assessments.

Stress testing, modelling and sensitivity analysis
Management developed severe but plausible multi-event risk 
scenarios that could impact the business adversely.

The Group’s strategic objectives, principal risks (PR), assessments 
of longer-term emerging risks (ER), management input, real-world 
examples and the financial modelling assumptions listed above 
were used to design the scenarios. Realistic but extremely severe 
adjustments were further applied for sensitivity analysis.

The following hypothetical severe but plausible multi-event risk 
scenarios were reviewed and assessed.

Longer-term viability scenarios
 – Scenario 1: Information and cyber security, technology and 

infrastructure (PR): Impacts of a ransomware attack affecting 
endpoints and ERP systems were modelled with potential loss 
of sales, general business interruption, and response and 
remediation costs

 – Scenario 2: Ethics and compliance (PR): The implications of a 

systemic failure of the corporate compliance programme leading 
to a regulator investigation were explored, including reputational 
impact, fines and legal fees, loss of sales, remediation expenses, 
and additional compliance costs 

 – Scenario 3: Industry dynamics (PR): Significant levels of 
price erosion over and above business plan assumptions
 – Scenario 4: Product pipeline (PR): Significant and extensive 

delays to strategic product launches

 – Scenario 5: Crisis and continuity management (PR): Escalation 
and development of situations of political and social instability 
in MENA markets were assessed with loss of sales recognised

 – Scenario 6: API and third-party risk management (PR): 

Significant disruptions to our raw and packaging materials 
supply chain were modelled

 – Scenario 7: Climate change (ER): Disruption as a result of extreme 
weather events was assessed with impacts on certain facilities 
including property damage and business interruption (see also 
our disclosures related to climate change on pages 56–65)

 – Scenario 8: Product quality and safety (PR): A prolonged regulator-
imposed restriction of a major US FDA-inspected manufacturing 
site was modelled factoring in loss of sales and remediation 
expenses, as well as a reduction to operating costs

Longer-term viability analysis
The consequences of each of these severe but plausible multi-event 
risk scenarios were modelled over the forecast period and the impacts 
on EBITDA, ability to meet our debt obligations, and cash flow 
were determined.

The assessment shows that although the scenarios are severe, they 
do not threaten the viability of Hikma. Headroom was comfortably 
maintained throughout the viability period for each of the multi-event 
risk scenarios.

The assessment and analysis did not rely on management actions 
that could be taken in the circumstances to reduce the impact 
and consequences of the risk events. Such actions, the ongoing 
implementation of the ERM programme, and investment in 
infrastructure and change initiatives are anticipated to continue to 
enhance organisational resilience and support longer-term viability.

The outcome of these various quantitative and qualitative 
assessments leads management to believe that Hikma is resilient 
to downside risk scenarios. This is largely as a result of our financial 
position (in particular our strong balance sheet and low levels of debt) 
and is supported by the fact that our business is well-diversified 
through geographic spread, product diversity, and large customer 
and supplier bases. Further details are provided in the ‘Our strategy’ 
(pages 10–11), ‘Our business model’ (pages 12–13), and ‘Our markets’ 
(pages 18–19).

Our assessments show that Hikma 
is resilient to downside risk scenarios.”

Dear Shareholders
2023 has been an excellent year for Hikma, 
all three of our businesses have contributed 
to the success of the Group to deliver a set 
of results ahead of our original expectations. 
For our Board it has been a year of change, 
our focus has been on successfully handling 
changes to the Board and Executive 
Committee while not losing sight of our goals 
and delivering a solid financial performance.

Appointment of a new CEO
Following an extensive global search, the 
Board and I were delighted to announce the 
appointment of Riad Mishlawi as CEO with 
effect from 1 September 2023. Having worked 
alongside Riad for many years in his various 
roles at Hikma, most recently as President of 
the Injectables business, I have no doubt in 
Riad’s leadership capability and know that he 
will apply his focus on execution and delivery 
to drive growth across the Group. Further 
details on the CEO selection process are 
included on page 94 and details on Riad’s 
skills and experience are included on 
pages 4 and 86. 

Board and Committee 
composition 
As announced in our 2022 Annual Report, 
we made a number of changes to the 
composition of our Board and Committees 
in 2023.

In April 2023 Victoria Hull was appointed as 
Senior Independent Director and assumed 
the role of Chair of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee, this followed the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) where Patrick 
Butler retired from these roles upon reaching 
nine years of service as a Non-Executive 
Director. Patrick also stepped down from the 
Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee at the same time; both 
Committees require fully independent 
membership under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018 (the Code) (nine 
years of service is one of the circumstances 
identified under Provision 10 of the Code as 
likely to impair or that could appear to impair 
independence). Patrick continued to serve as 

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023a non-independent Non-Executive Director 
to support the transitions to a new CEO and 
new Senior Independent Director and we 
thank him for his service and dedication to 
the Hikma Board following his decision to 
retire from the Board with effect from 29 
February 2024. As Senior Independent 
Director and Chair of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee, Patrick greatly 
assisted with directing our governance and 
succession arrangements and leaves Hikma 
well positioned for the future. Patrick has 
been a great friend to Hikma and to me 
personally. We wish him well for the future. 

Riad Mishlawi joined the Compliance, 
Responsibility and Ethics Committee on 
his appointment as CEO in September 2023.

Succession planning 
A key priority for the coming year is to review 
succession plans for all our Board and senior 
management roles. After a number of new 
appointments to the Board and Executive 
Committee in September 2023, all filled by 
internal candidates thanks to robust 
succession planning processes, it is 
imperative that we refresh our succession 
plans for the future and carefully consider 
our options. This review will be led by our 
new Chief People Officer, Hussein Arkhagha, 
and will be supported by the Nomination and 
Governance Committee.

We will also review our succession plans for 
the independent Non-Executive Directors, 
noting that we have two independent 
Non-Executive Directors reaching nine 
years of service in 2025.

Diversity, equity and inclusion
As a Board we have always taken diversity 
seriously, and our Board Diversity Policy 
sets targets for the diversity of Hikma’s 
Board in line with the gender and ethnic 
diversity targets set by the Listing Rules, 
the FTSE Women Leaders Review and the 
Parker Review. We are proud to report that 
Hikma meets all targets set for gender and 
ethnic diversity at the Board. The Board 
Diversity Policy is available on our website 
at www.hikma.com.

We acknowledge the importance of Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion (DEI) beyond the 
boardroom and have adopted initiatives, 
where permitted under applicable local laws, 
in line with the voluntary target set by the 
FTSE Women Leaders Review, to increase the 
gender diversity of the senior management 
team (direct reports to the CEO and the 
senior leaders who report directly to them). 
Our Remuneration Committee has integrated 
targets, where permitted under applicable 
local laws, to increase gender diversity within 
the senior management population into the 
performance measures for the Long-Term 

Incentive Plan and Annual Bonus Plan, 
further detail is included on pages 104, 
118 and 122. Information on our senior 
management and workforce gender diversity 
is included on page 85 and information on 
our broader DEI initiatives is included on

During the course of the year the 
Board carefully considered the voluntary 
recommendation, published by the Parker 
Review in March 2023, for FTSE 350 
companies to set themselves a target for the 
percentage of their senior management who 
self-identify as being from an ethnic minority1. 
After a detailed review, acknowledging 
Hikma’s diverse geographic footprint, large 
global workforce, small UK workforce and 
risks to workforce engagement, the Board 
opted not to set an ethnic diversity target for 
Hikma’s senior management population. 
Although we decided not to set a target, we 
do support the underlying objective of the 
Parker Review to increase ethnic diversity 
among senior management. In order to show 
focus on this important issue we undertook a 
detailed ethnic diversity survey of our senior 
management population, using an expanded 
list of ethnicities sensitive to Hikma’s 
workforce2. We were pleased to see the 
importance our senior management place on 
this issue, with a response rate to the survey 
of 78%. The survey showed that our senior 
management population has a high level of 
ethnic diversity and the results are set out 
on page 85 along with other enhanced 
ethnic diversity disclosures. We have 
also committed to monitoring our senior 
management ethnic diversity on an annual 
basis. Further information on our decision-
making process is included on page 95.

Workforce engagement 
For the Board to function well, it is 
imperative that we engage with the 
wider Hikma workforce, so as defined under 
Provision 5 of the Code, Nina Henderson is 
our designated independent Non-Executive 
Director for workforce engagement. Nina 
undertakes an active programme of 
engagement each year which helps ensure 
that workforce perspectives are considered 
when undertaking Board and Committee 
business and, outside of our Executive 
Directors, ensuring that the Board is visible 
among our colleagues. The engagement 
programme is organised in conjunction with 
the CEO and Nina formally reports to the 
Board on her findings at each meeting. 

During 2023 a number of our Non-Executive 
Directors were able to engage closely with the 
business, whether this was through induction 
programmes for our Non-Executive Directors 
appointed in 2022 or utilising opportunities 
to visit Hikma facilities when Non-Executive 

Directors were travelling in relation to other 
external engagements.

This year’s activities involved participation 
in events throughout the calendar year, 
including:

 – attendance at a leadership team 

meeting for the Injectables business 
in Pennsylvania (US)

 – visits to manufacturing facilities in Amman 
(Jordan), Portugal, Cherry Hill and Dayton 
(NJ, US), Columbus and Bedford (OH, US). 
During these visits, Non-Executive 
Directors were able to tour the facilities, 
inspect new machinery and meet with 
local management and the wider workforce

 – visits to corporate offices in Amman 
(Jordan), Berkeley Heights (NJ, US), 
Paris (France) and Dubai (UAE) to meet 
with local management, providing 
opportunities to meet with the local 
workforce in informal settings over 
lunches and dinners

 – the Board held their annual strategy 

meeting at the Berkeley Heights office in 
New Jersey, the Board also held a dinner 
with local management and visited Hikma 
manufacturing facilities nearby

Nina used her engagement activities 
to communicate with the workforce on 
remuneration matters where appropriate.

Further detail on our workforce engagement 
activities and outcomes, is included in our 
Section 172 statement on page 22.

Stakeholder engagement 
The Board undertakes significant efforts to 
understand and take account of the needs 
and perspectives of all of our stakeholders, 
including customers, suppliers, employees, 
regulators, investors and the communities 
in which we operate. Further detail including 
examples of the outcomes and actions of 
those stakeholder engagement activities, 
is included in our Section 172 statement 
on pages 20 to 25. Information on our 
Supplier Code of Conduct is included 
on page 101.

On behalf of the Board, we look forward 
to leading the business on delivering our 
strategy for the benefit of all stakeholders 
in 2024. Fundamental to that delivery is our 
focus on continuing to operate effective 
corporate governance practices.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Corporate Governance

UK Corporate Governance Code compliance

Hikma is committed to high standards of 
corporate governance and we work hard to 
ensure compliance with the Principles and 
Provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) published in July 2018 and 
the Markets Law of the Dubai Financial 
Services Authority (the Markets Law). The 
Code and associated guidance are available 
to view on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk.

The report on pages 82 to 137 describes how 
the Board has applied the Code and Markets 
Law throughout the year ended 31 December 
2023. The Board considers that this Annual 
Report provides the information shareholders 
need to evaluate how we have complied with 
our current obligations under the Code and 
Markets Law. Except as referred to in the 
following section on the Executive Chairman, 
regarding Code Provisions 9 and 19, Hikma 
has complied with all relevant Principles and 
Provisions of the Code throughout the year.

Executive Chairman
Provision 9 of the Code states that the chair 
should be independent on appointment 
when assessed against the circumstances 
set out in Provision 10. The roles of chair and 
chief executive should not be exercised by 
the same individual. A chief executive should 
not become chair of the same company. If, 
exceptionally, this is proposed by the board, 
major shareholders should be consulted 
ahead of appointment. The board should set 
out its reasons to all shareholders at the time 
of the appointment and also publish these 
on the company website.

Provision 19 of the Code states that the chair 
should not remain in post beyond nine years 
from the date of their first appointment to 
the board.

The Board acknowledges that Said 
Darwazah’s position as Executive Chairman 
and his overall tenure are departures from 
Provisions 9 and 19 of the Code. The 
background to this role, rationale for the role 
and safeguards to support our governance 
structure are summarised below.

Background
The Executive Chairman role was created in 
February 2018, following the appointment of 
a new CEO. Previously, Said Darwazah was 
the Chairman and CEO. The Board continues 
to consider that it is important to retain 
corporate memory, important relationships 
and the culture of the organisation. Therefore, 
it is valuable to retain Said’s services in a 
strategic capacity.

The Board consulted shareholders prior to 
Said’s appointment as Executive Chairman 
and CEO in May 2014 and following the 
change to the position of Executive 
Chairman in February 2018. 

Rationale
The Board is focused on the commercial 
success of Hikma and believes that 
continuing the position of Executive 
Chairman is the best way to achieve success 
for Hikma for the following reasons:

 – Continuity of strategy: Said has been 
a driving force behind the strategic 
success of the business since 2007 and 
the Board believes that it is important for 
the continued success of the Group that he 
remains in a strategic role. The Executive 
Chairman’s role is to develop the Group’s 
strategy in conjunction with the CEO. 
The division of responsibilities for 
our Executive Chairman and CEO 
are available on our website at  
www.hikma.com 

 – Executive Chairman’s role: the Executive 
Chairman position is highly visible inside 
and outside Hikma, providing leadership 
to the Board and management of the 
Company, acting as an ambassador 
with business partners and advisers 
to the organisation

 – Stakeholder engagement: a significant 
number of Hikma’s key political and 
commercial relationships across the 
MENA region, Asia and some continental 
European countries are built on the 
long-term trust and respect for the 
Darwazah family such that the role 
of the Executive Chairman remains key. 
During the course of 2023 the Executive 
Chairman undertook an active programme 
of stakeholder engagement activities, 
examples of which are highlighted below. 
Said attended a number of meetings with 
key shareholders; while holding the joint 
role of Executive Chairman and CEO, 
shareholder meetings focused on the 
performance of the Group; and later in 
the year, Said attended meetings with 
larger shareholders alongside Riad 
Mishlawi as part of the transition of CEO 
responsibilities. Said also attended an 
event, jointly hosted by the Access to 
Medicine Foundation and World Economic 
Forum, to facilitate discussions and agree 
actions with government policymakers, 
regulators, suppliers, manufacturers and 
non-profit organisations on the evolving 
role of generics and biosimilars 
manufacturers and partners in ensuring 
the supply of essential medicines in 
low- and middle-income countries

Independence

The Board reviews the independence of each 
of its Non-Executive Directors during the year 
as part of the annual corporate governance 
review, which includes consideration of 
progressive refreshment of the Board. 
We are committed to ensuring that the 
Board comprises a majority of independent 
Non-Executive Directors, who objectively 
challenge management, balanced against 
continuity on the Board. This is also 
important to meet the independence 
requirements of the Board Committees. 
The Board considers John Castellani, Nina 
Henderson, Cynthia Flowers, Douglas Hurt, 
Laura Balan, Victoria Hull and Dr Deneen 
Vojta to be independent. These individuals 
have extensive experience of international 
pharmaceutical, financial, corporate 
governance and regulatory matters, bring 
strong independent oversight, continue 
to demonstrate independence and were 
not associated with Hikma prior to joining 
the Board.

Since the AGM in 2023, the Board no longer 
views Patrick Butler as an independent 
Director. This is due to his total service with 
Hikma reaching nine years in April 2023, 
which Provision 10 of the Code identifies as 
a circumstance likely to impair or that could 
appear to impair independence. Following 
the AGM in 2023 and to preserve the 
independence of our Board, Patrick stepped 
down as Senior Independent Director, Chair 
of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee and any memberships of Board 
Committees requiring fully independent 
membership under the Code. The Board 
asked Patrick to stay on the Board as a 
non-independent, Non-Executive Director 
for a maximum period of one further year, 
stepping down no later than the AGM in 2024 
to allow time to aid the transition to a new 
CEO and to fully support the transition of 
responsibilities as Senior Independent 
Director and Chair of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee to Victoria Hull. 
Patrick Butler will retire from the Board on  
29 February 2024.

The Board does not view Ali Al-Husry as 
an independent Director, this is due to the 
length of his association with Hikma, having 
held an executive position with Hikma prior 
to listing, and his involvement with Darhold 
Limited, Hikma’s largest shareholder. 
However, Ali continues to bring to the 
Board broad corporate finance experience, 
in-depth awareness of the Group’s history, 
and a detailed knowledge of the MENA 
region, which is an important and 
specialist part of the Group’s business. 

Safeguards
The Board continues to operate the following 
enhanced governance controls to support 
the Executive Chairman role:

 – Governance structure review: the 

independent Non-Executive Directors 
meet at least annually in a private session 
chaired by the Senior Independent 
Director. This meeting includes 
consideration of the appropriateness of 
the governance structure, the division of 
responsibilities between the Executive 
Chairman and the CEO and safeguards 
for shareholders. During their 2023 
meeting, the independent Non-Executive 
Directors reviewed the succession plan 
and the effectiveness of the governance 
controls in place to support the Executive 
Chairman role and concluded that the 
Executive Chairman role should continue

 – Senior Independent Director role: the 
Senior Independent Director has an 
enhanced role at Hikma, taking joint 
responsibility, with the Executive 
Chairman, for the annual Board evaluation, 
setting the Board agenda, agreeing action 
points and the minutes of the meetings

 – Committee Chair roles: the Chairs of 

the Board Committees and the Director 
responsible for workforce engagement 
undertake a significant amount of work 
in the discharge of their responsibilities
 – Transparency and engagement: Hikma 
has always had the highest regard for 
shareholders, with several of the original 
investors from before listing still investing 
and supporting Hikma today. Over the c.18 
years since flotation Hikma has maintained 
the highest standards of shareholder 
engagement, which reflects the 
importance placed in maintaining strong 
investor relations and governance. To 
underline the importance of shareholder 
engagement, the independent Non-
Executive Directors monitor shareholder 
sentiment in relation to the Executive 
Chairman, paying close attention to 
shareholder votes in favour of his 
re-election at the AGM. On a rolling 
five-year basis, shareholder votes in 
favour of his re-election average 96%

The Board considers that the Executive 
Chairman role is key to Hikma and does not 
intend to make any changes to this structure 
in the medium term. Should shareholders 
require any further information relating to 
these matters, questions may be directed 
to the Company Secretary.

Letter from the Chair

Victoria Hull
Chair, Nomination and 
Governance Committee and 
Senior Independent Director

Dear Shareholders
I am writing to you for the first time as Senior Independent Director 
(SID) and Chair of the Nomination and Governance Committee (NGC 
or the Committee). I was appointed to these roles in April 2023 to 
help steer the development of the Group’s governance and 
succession arrangements.

Succession
The Committee oversees succession for both Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors and reviews the succession plans for 
these roles at least once a year. Below Board level, the Committee 
is responsible for ensuring that appropriate arrangements are in 
place for senior positions, including the Executive Committee.

One of the priorities identified during the 2023 Board evaluation 
was a detailed review of succession plans following a number of new 
appointments to the Board and Executive Committee in the latter 
part of 2023. Regular updates on the review of succession plans 
have been scheduled with the Committee through 2024. Further 
information on the 2023 Board evaluation is included on page 96.

Executive – appointment of a new CEO
On 12 April 2023, the Board was delighted to announce the 
appointment of Riad Mishlawi as CEO with effect from 1 September 
2023. Riad’s appointment followed an extensive global search in 
conjunction with Heidrick & Struggles, an independent search firm 
with no other connection to Hikma, appointed to assist in identifying 
suitable candidates. 

A structured timetable was adopted for the process, regular updates 
and discussions were scheduled with the Committee and Board 
throughout. A person specification was developed, shared with and 
approved by all Board members. We then agreed a long list of external 
candidates which, following separate individual meetings with Said 
Darwazah, Patrick Butler, John Castellani, Cynthia Flowers and 
Douglas Hurt, was distilled to a short list for more detailed interviews 
with groupings of Directors on specialist subjects. At the same time 
we undertook a leadership assessment of the Executive Committee, 
which highlighted Riad as our preferred internal candidate. Riad went 
through the same detailed interviews with Directors on the specialist 
subjects as the external candidates. During the course of this process 
all Directors interviewed all shortlisted external and internal 
candidates. In early 2023 the Board were of the unanimous view 
that Riad was the preferred candidate to become Hikma’s CEO, 
appointing the Remuneration Committee to settle the terms of 
the offer. We agreed a suitable transition period and target 
appointment date of Q3 2023 to allow time for the orderly 
transition of responsibilities internally.

94

The Board would like to thank Said Darwazah for stepping in as CEO 
from 24 June 2022 to 31 August 2023. In addition to his responsibilities 
as Executive Chairman, Said ensured continuity and minimised 
disruption to the business while the Board identified and appointed 
a permanent CEO. 

Non-Executive
During 2022 we welcomed three new independent Non-Executive 
Directors to the Board and in 2023 we completed their induction 
programmes and transitioned the SID and NGC Chair role. These 
changes have allowed us to develop our succession plans for the 
independent Non-Executive Directors over the medium term.

John Castellani, Chair of the Compliance, Responsibility and Ethics 
Committee (CREC), and Nina Henderson, Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee and Director for workforce engagement, will reach nine 
years of service in 2025 and, following recommendation by the 
Committee, the Board approved successors for these important roles. 
The successors will spend one year shadowing their incumbents and 
will formally be appointed into these roles with effect from close of 
business at the AGM in 2025.

The proposed successors and rationale for their appointments is set 
out below:

 – Deneen Vojta has been named as successor for Chair of the CREC. 
As a healthcare professional, Deneen has a keen interest in Hikma’s 
sustainability programme, oversight of which is moving under the 
CREC in 2024, and its impact on stakeholders, including healthcare 
providers and patients. Deneen has served as a member of the 
CREC for over a year, having joined on her appointment to the 
Board in November 2022

 – Cynthia Flowers has been named successor for Chair of the 

Remuneration Committee. Cynthia is an experienced member of 
Hikma’s Remuneration Committee, having been a member since 
her appointment to the Board in June 2019. She also brings outside 
experience to the role, as Chair of the Compensation Committee of 
G1 Therapeutics Inc

 – Laura Balan has been named as successor for Director for 

workforce engagement. Laura has detailed knowledge of the global 
healthcare industry and has taken a keen interest in engaging with 
the workforce on recent trips to Hikma locations

Patrick Butler will retire from the Board with effect from 29 February 
2024, having stayed on the Board as a non-independent, Non-Executive 
Director for one additional year, following nine years of independent 
service, to support the CEO transition and the transition of 
responsibilities as SID and NGC Chair to me.

Balance
During the year, the Committee reviewed the composition of the 
Board. This review included consideration of the skills and attributes 
of each member, the balance between constructive challenge and 
empowerment of the executive, the results of the recent Board 
evaluation exercise and the current and desired level of diversity 
in the Boardroom. I am pleased to report that the Committee 
confirms that the Board continues to operate effectively and that 
each member is valued for the experience and skills that they bring.

Skills and experience
The Committee continues to believe that a longer induction period 
is desirable for new independent Non-Executive Directors to allow 
for building understanding of the business and, where succession 
for a Committee Chair is taking place, the transfer of knowledge and 
relationships associated with the particular committee. Additionally, 
the Board believes it is important for Directors to have significant 
international experience at an executive level, a challenging yet 
consensual style, and the highest level of integrity. The Committee 
regularly considers whether there may be gaps in fulfilling the specific 

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023and in-depth experience that the Board requires as a whole, 
which focuses on the following areas:

 – strategy, culture and leadership
 – business environment in both the US and the MENA region
 – pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution
 – development of new healthcare capabilities
 – listing regulations, investor perceptions and governance

Hikma supports Directors in their continued professional 
development. As the Directors are highly experienced, their training 
needs tend to be related to either ensuring awareness of changes 
in the business, political and regulatory environments, or bespoke 
training on particular areas for development. Therefore, Hikma 
financially supports specific training requests and ensures that 
Directors are briefed by internal and external advisers on a 
regular basis.

During the year, the Board also received briefings on matters such as 
the pharmaceutical competitive environment, healthcare business 
development activity, external stakeholder perspectives, investor 
perceptions, market sentiment, cybersecurity, business intelligence, 
capital markets, emerging risks and regulatory developments. 

Tenure
We anticipate that the independent Non-Executive Directors will 
generally serve for a period of nine years or, if required to facilitate 
an orderly transfer of responsibilities, until the next Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) of the Company following the ninth anniversary 
of their appointment. Their appointments are formally reviewed 
after three years and again at six years.

Except for Patrick Butler, who will retire from the Board with effect 
from 29 February 2024, each Director will stand for election or re-
election at the 2024 AGM. The position of each Director was reviewed 
during the year as part of the consideration of succession 
arrangements, independence issues, the annual governance 
structure reviews, the Board and Committee evaluation processes 
and the ongoing dialogue between the Executive Chairman and 
the SID.

Time commitment
The Committee continues to review the external commitments 
of each Director with a view to ensuring that the benefits of the 
additional experience from their external commitments are not 
outweighed by reductions in their commitment to Hikma. The 
Directors achieve excellent attendance and spend significant time 
delivering their responsibilities. Accordingly, the Committee considers 
that there is currently an appropriate balance. The Committee will 
continue to monitor the situation. 

Diversity, equity and inclusion
The Board Diversity Policy was updated in December 2022 to take 
account of the new diversity related disclosures and targets under 
the Listing Rules, applying to financial years beginning on or after 
1 January 2023. Hikma complied early, providing additional disclosures 

Hikma’s inclusive workplace 
welcomes different cultures, 
perspectives and experiences 
from across the globe.”

in line with the new diversity disclosures and targets under the Listing 
Rules in our 2022 Annual Report. This information is summarised on 
page 85 and included in the prescribed format required under the 
Listing Rules on page 135. Hikma supports the recommendations of 
the Parker Review and the FTSE Women Leaders Review in relation 
to Board diversity and has adopted the targets for Board diversity 
set by both reviews. The Board Diversity Policy is available at  
www.hikma.com.

At a Group level, Hikma’s objective is to ensure that it has an inclusive 
workplace that welcomes different cultures, perspectives, and 
experiences from across the globe. Hikma is committed to attracting, 
retaining and developing talented people, irrespective of their race, 
colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital 
status, national origin, present or past history of mental or physical 
disability and any other factors either protected from consideration 
by law or not related to a person’s ability to perform the relevant role. 
This statement is included in our Code of Conduct and communicated 
to all employees.

One of the pillars of the Group’s strategy is ‘people and responsibility’. 
The Group’s policy and approach to diversity, equity and inclusion 
(DEI), succession and appointments are a core part of this pillar. The 
Committee monitors the DEI metrics which are detailed on page 85 
and uses these as a reference point when considering the level of 
achievement against its DEI initiatives. Hikma has successful 
empowerment and talent development programmes to help all of our 
people make the most of their potential, for more information please 
see pages 48 and 49. Further detail on workforce diversity is provided 
on page 85.

The Group’s talent acquisition policies for the three most senior 
staff grades require a balanced list of candidates to support our 
diversity goals.

Ethnicity
The Board considers that it has demonstrated strong ethnic diversity 
since the formation of Hikma and has four Directors from ethnic 
minority backgrounds (when assessed against UK ONS criteria), 
representing 33% of the Board, including the Executive Chairman and 
CEO. The Board has adopted and meets the targets set by the Parker 
Review and diversity related disclosures under the Listing Rules to 
have at least one Director identifying as minority ethnic.

The Board has not adopted the voluntary recommendation, published 
in March 2023 by the Parker Review, to set an ethnic diversity target 
for the senior management team (direct reports to the CEO and the 
senior leaders who report directly to them). During the course of 2023, 
the Committee received a number of updates on the voluntary 
recommendation and spent time considering the appropriateness of 
setting an ethnic diversity target for Hikma, a company with a diverse 
geographic footprint and global workforce. Following a detailed review 
the Board decided not to set an ethnic diversity target for the 
following reasons:

 – the Parker Review is primarily focused on the UK, Hikma has a small 

UK workforce, accounting for c. 9% of the senior management 
population

 – following a GDPR and labour law review of the jurisdictions where 
our senior management population are employed, Hikma was not 
able to survey individuals in a number of countries, representing  
c. 25% of our senior management population. Excluding such 
a high percentage of our senior management would have an 
adverse impact on our ability to set an ethnic diversity target

 – developments in the US relating to DEI targets

In order to demonstrate focus on the issues raised by the Parker 
Review in relation to senior management ethnic diversity, Hikma 
has implemented the following steps:

 – undertaken an ethnic diversity survey of our senior management 
population in December 2023. The survey was voluntary and 
contained an expanded list of ethnicities, sensitive to Hikma’s 
workforce. Individuals had the option to respond by selecting 
‘prefer not to say’. 78% of our senior management population 
responded to the ethnic diversity survey and the results of the 
survey showed a high level of ethnic diversity among our people
 – enhanced ethnic diversity disclosures, including the results of our 
ethnic diversity survey, are included on page 85. Individuals who 
could not be surveyed as a result of GDPR and labour law issues 
are reported as a separate ‘unknown’ category

 – a commitment to monitor ethnic diversity among the senior 

management population annually

Gender
Since its founding, Hikma has actively promoted gender diversity 
across its operations. Our Board has good gender diversity with 
women representing 42% of the Board. The Board has adopted 
and meets the targets set by the FTSE Women Leaders Review 
and diversity related disclosures under the Listing Rules to have 
at least 40% of Board members identifying as women. 

The Board also adopted the voluntary target set by the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review, to increase the gender diversity of the senior 
management team (direct reports to the CEO and the senior leaders 
who report directly to them). Where permitted under local law, 
our Remuneration Committee has integrated targets to increase 
gender diversity within the senior management population into 
the performance measures for the Long-Term Incentive Plan and 
Annual Bonus Plan, further detail is included on pages 118 and 122. 
Subject to applicable local laws, these targets are not intended to act 
as quotas or preferences and selections will continue to be made 
based on merit. Information on our senior management gender 
diversity is included on page 85.

Governance review
As in previous years, the Committee undertook the annual review 
of the Group’s governance arrangements in conjunction with the 
Company Secretary. This year the exercise included a review of the 
structure of the Board, Board succession planning, a regulatory 
update in relation to current and emerging corporate governance 
reporting and review and approval of updated policies and 
procedures in relation to the Market Abuse Regulation.

Evaluation and performance
In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the Code) we 
undertake a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of performance of 
the Board, its Committees, the Chairman and individual Directors. We 
operate a three-year cycle of external evaluation in year one, followed 
by internal evaluations in years two and three. Our last external 
evaluation took place in 2021, so in 2023, Hikma undertook an internal 
evaluation. Hikma engaged Lintstock Ltd to facilitate this process, 
Lintstock is an advisory firm that specialises in Board reviews, and 
had no pre-existing connections, beyond conducting Board reviews, 
with Hikma.

96

Process
The first stage of the exercise involved Lintstock engaging with key 
stakeholders, in order to set the context for the review and to tailor 
the scope to the specific circumstances of Hikma. All Directors 
then completed an online survey addressing the performance 
of the Board, its Committees and the Executive Chairman.

As well as addressing core aspects of Board and Committee 
performance in 2023, the exercise included a skills analysis which 
was used to support the assessment of Board skills set out on page 84 
and identify topics for future Board briefing sessions.

Outcome
Lintstock’s report was discussed at a Board meeting in December 
2023. We reviewed the areas receiving lower scores to ensure 
alignment with key priorities and strategic issues identified by the 
review to agree actions for 2024. The Board also reflected on the 
status of priorities and actions agreed following the 2022 review 
to ensure those items had been closed or had plans in place to 
address them.

As a result of the 2023 review, the Board agreed the following 
priorities for 2024:

 – Succession and talent management: following a number of 

changes to Hikma’s leadership team in the latter part of 2023, 
including a new CEO, President of Injectables and Chief People 
Officer, we agreed to undertake a detailed review of succession 
plans for the Executive Committee, their direct reports, and 
associated processes for talent management. Regular updates 
have been scheduled with the Committee and the Board to 
support the Chief People Officer in this exercise

 – Strategy and growth: following the 2023 review, a number of 

improvements were made to the Board strategy session held in 
October 2023. Rather than waiting to the next strategy session in 
2024, we agreed to strengthen discussions of key strategic issues in 
the boardroom by integrating key items through the annual Board 
calendar to ‘keep the conversation going’ in relation to items such 
as capital allocation, return on invested capital and longer-term 
capital expenditure

Executive Chairman’s appraisal 
The Executive Chairman and I meet regularly to discuss matters 
including Board succession planning, the performance of the Board 
and how his role helps deliver and enhance that performance. This 
builds on discussions that I hold with the independent Non-Executive 
Directors as a group and commentary received through the Board 
evaluation and other stakeholder engagement processes. The 
Executive Chairman’s performance is also reviewed by the 
Remuneration Committee as part of the determination of 
performance-based compensation.

Director appraisal
The Executive Chairman, having taken into account the comments 
from the Board evaluation and discussions with the SID, reviewed the 
performance of each of the Directors during the year and concluded 
that each Director contributes effectively to the Board, brings 
particular areas of skill and experience that ensure the Board as a 
whole has the right capabilities, and devotes sufficient time to their 
role. The Committee has concluded that the relevant Directors be 
recommended to shareholders for re-election at the 2024 AGM.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Audit Committee

Letter from the Chair

Douglas Hurt
Chair, Audit Committee

Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to report that the Audit Committee (the Committee) 
has had another year of solid progress in its oversight of the matters 
delegated to it by the Board.

During the year, the Committee continued to play a key role in 
assisting the Board in its oversight of financial reporting and 
auditing matters. The Committee’s activities included reviewing 
and monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial information, 
the Group’s systems of internal controls and risk management, 
and the internal and external audit process.

Verification
The qualitative disclosures in the Annual Report, in addition to the 
external audit, adviser review and internal review processes, have 
been reviewed by our internal teams who are responsible for each 
section of the Annual Report and who have provided additional 
verification and support in respect of each material statement of fact. 
This process assisted the Committee in its determination that the 
report and financial statements taken as a whole are fair, balanced 
and understandable.

Audit Committees and External Audit: 
Minimum Standard
The Committee confirms that it complies with the reporting 
obligations set out under the Audit Committees and the External 
Audit: Minimum Standard, published by the FRC in May 2023. 
Disclosures in line with these reporting obligations are included 
within this Committee report on pages 97 to 100 and an explanation 
of the entity’s accounting policies can be found on pages 151 to 155.

Internal audit
The internal audit of Hikma is performed by EY, who report directly 
to the Chair of the Committee. There is a regular programme of 
interaction between EY and the Committee.

EY assess each facility and the Group’s major processes over a 
three-year period. For major sites, assessments are more frequent. 
Management is required to respond to findings within an agreed time 
period and ensure mitigation or remediation of all high risk findings 
within six months.

During the year, the Committee monitored progress with the internal 
audit programme for 2023 and reviewed and approved the plan for 
2024. EY and management work closely together to deliver the 
internal audit plan, develop action plans for points raised, and ensure 
that the Committee receives appropriate and timely information. 

During the year, the Committee continued to monitor the 
performance and independence of the internal auditors in 
accordance with the policies that have been established. The 
Committee assessed the effectiveness of the internal audit function 
by reviewing its reports, progress against the 2023 plan and meeting 
with internal audit without management present. The Committee 
considers that EY bring significant pharmaceutical and MENA 
market experience which is complemented by the experience of 
other third-party experts where required and concluded that EY 
continue to perform an effective internal audit programme and 
remain independent.

External audit
The external audit was undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(PwC) and has been since their appointment in May 2016. PwC were 
appointed following a competitive tender process. Mr Nigel Comello 
was appointed as the senior statutory auditor in May 2022. The 
Committee recommends the re-appointment of PwC for 2024. 
We believe the independence and objectivity of the external auditor 
and the effectiveness of the audit process are safeguarded and 
strong. The Company has complied with the Statutory Audit 
Services Order for the financial year under review.

Effectiveness
During the year, the Committee reviewed the work of PwC and 
concluded that they provided an effective audit, had constructive 
relationships with the relevant parties and that the senior statutory 
auditor provided clear and constructive leadership to the audit team. 
As part of this review the Committee examined the following areas:

 – Audit quality and technical capabilities: the Committee 

considered that the auditor undertook an effective and in-depth 
assessment and verification exercise in respect of the financial 
statements and associated disclosures for the year ended 
31 December 2023 and that the level of expertise PwC brought to 
bear was high. The Committee provides feedback on the auditor’s 
performance as part of its regular meetings with them without 
management present. The Committee also takes into account the 
reports of the FRC, including the Audit Quality Inspection 
Supervision report, and believes that there is an open and 
appropriately challenging relationship between the audit leadership 
team, the Committee and management. Management also 
conducts a formal review of audit quality and effectiveness using 
a survey where feedback is provided by Committee members and 
management. The key outcomes are summarised and considered 
by the Committee in their assessment of the auditor

 – Independence: the Committee regularly reviews the independence 

safeguards of the auditor and remains satisfied that auditor 
independence has not been compromised. During the year, the 
Committee refreshed its policies on the provision of non-audit 
services and employment of former employees of the external 
auditor. The Committee is satisfied that the auditor is independent

 – Challenge and judgement: the Committee considers that PwC 
provide significant challenge to the management team which 
results in the Company’s position being fully considered and 
supported and, where appropriate, further strengthened. The 
Committee believes that PwC have demonstrated well considered 
and clearsighted judgement in the matters on which it has provided 
opinion and has been open to an appropriate level of challenge 
and debate. Examples of PwC’s professional scepticism and 
challenge, as noted by the Committee, include their in-depth 
audit and challenge of the assumptions used in the impairment 
review exercise where PwC challenged the cash flow forecasts, 
discount rates and terminal growth assumptions, as well as their 
challenge of the assumptions and key judgements used in the 
impairment exercise related to the halted operations in Sudan 
and the accounting for the acquisition of Akorn Operating 
Company LLC as a business combination.

Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Corporate Governance 
Audit Committee – Letter from the Chair
continued

 – Non-audit services: the Committee’s policy on non-audit services 
is available on our website www.hikma.com. The Committee has 
discretion to grant exceptions to this policy where it considers that 
exceptional circumstances exist and that independence can be 
maintained, while having due regard to the FRC’s ethical standards 
for auditors meaning that non-audit fees will be capped at 70% of 
the average audit fees paid in the previous three consecutive 
financial years. In 2023, PwC provided assurance services related to 
the interim review and other non-audit services with a total value of 
$553,000 (2022: $210,000). These services are within the ordinary 
course of services provided by the auditor 

The Committee confirms that the statutory audit services for the 
financial year under review were conducted in compliance with the 
Competition and Markets Authority Order, and a competitive audit 
tender process was undertaken in 2015.

Audit tendering
PwC was appointed as auditor in May 2016, therefore, the current 
Annual Report is the eighth report that they have audited. PwC 
rotated the senior statutory auditor in 2019 and 2022. This followed 
the Chair of the Committee being transferred to Douglas Hurt in 
December 2020. The Committee considers it is prudent to allow time 
for one significant change to become embedded before embarking 
on another. In accordance with the audit tendering guidelines, a key 
priority for the Committee in 2024 will be to commence planning for 
an external audit tender. The Committee will keep the situation under 
review and report to shareholders accordingly.

Position and prospects 
During the year, management undertook an annual review of its 
strategic direction and an extensive assessment of the Group’s 
short-term and medium-term prospects which are included in 
the budget for the following year and the five-year business plan, 
respectively. Management presented and received the Board’s 
approval and commentary on the full strategy, budget and 
business plan. Having taken account of how the business has 
responded to the challenges of the commercial environment, the 
business plan, principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group 
and other relevant information, the Committee has concluded that 
the Group continues to have attractive prospects for the future. 

Going concern and longer-term viability
The Directors considered the going concern position as detailed 
on page 75. Having reviewed and challenged the downside 
assumptions, forecasts and mitigation strategy of management, 
the Directors believe that the Group is adequately placed to manage 
its business and financing risks successfully. The Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for a period longer than 12 months 
from the date of signing the financial statements. Therefore, the 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.

The Directors, having considered the longer-term viability 
assessment as detailed on pages 75 and 76, confirm that they 
have a reasonable expectation that Hikma will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due and over the 
viability period which ends on 31 December 2026. 

Significant matters
As part of its work reviewing the financial statements of the Group 
and the report of the auditor, the Committee considered and 
discussed the following important financial matters:

 – Impairment review: as in previous years, management undertook 
the impairment test exercise in respect of intangible assets, right 
of use assets and property, plant and equipment. Management had 
recommended a total impairment charge of $32 million in respect 
of different individual intangible assets, $7 million in respect of 
right of use assets and $1 million in respect of property, plant 
and equipment excluding impairment charges related to halted 
operations in Sudan outlined below. The Committee reviewed 
management’s approach and recommendations and concluded 
that the proposals were appropriate

 – Halted operations in Sudan: the Committee reviewed and 

challenged management’s judgements of the effect on the carrying 
value of the Group’s assets in respect of the halted operations in 
Sudan as result of the conflict in the country. Management had 
recommended a total impairment charge of $75 million mainly 
related to financials assets, property, plant and equipment and 
inventory. The Committee reviewed management’s assessment 
and concluded that it was appropriate. Additional detail on 
Hikma’s response to the conflict in Sudan is included on page 70
 – Valuation of acquired assets from Akorn Operating Company LLC 
(Akorn): the Committee reviewed and challenged the accounting 
treatment of the acquisition as a business combination as well as 
the estimates and judgements used to derive the value of the 
acquired assets, and concluded that they were appropriate. 
The valuation exercise was performed by a third-party expert

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023 
 
 – Revenue recognition: the Committee reviewed the Group’s policies 
for revenue recognition and the application of those policies by 
management. The Committee reviewed the model applied by 
management to arrive at the chargebacks, which estimates the 
‘in-channel’ inventories held by wholesalers and the chargeback 
rate being the difference between the contracted price with 
indirect customers and the wholesaler’s invoice price. Similar 
reviews were undertaken of the deductions to revenue made 
for customer rebates, returns and indirect non-customer and 
government rebates. The Committee also agreed the disclosures 
around these year-end estimates and the sensitivity of the 
estimates to changes in assumptions

 – Taxation: Hikma’s worldwide operations are highly integrated and 
involve a number of cross-border supply chains, which results in 
judgement being required to estimate the potential tax liabilities 
in different jurisdictions. The Committee took advice from 
professional services firms and management in assessing the 
reasonableness of the Group’s provisions for uncertain tax 
positions which amounted to $59 million and in reviewing the 
deferred tax assets in key markets which amounted to $226 million. 
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the disclosures 
in the Annual Report, and reviewed and approved the Group’s tax 
strategy statement, which is available on the Company’s website 
at www.hikma.com

 – Legal matters: The Committee reviewed management’s 

conclusions regarding the appropriate accounting treatment for the 
settlement of legal cases. These cases relate to the manufacture 
and sales of prescription opioid medications. The Group reached 
an agreement in principle to resolve the vast majority of the opioid 
related cases brought against Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. by 
US states, their subdivisions, and tribal nations. The agreed upon 
settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. 
Management recommended booking a total provision of  
$129 million to cover the expected settlement amount for all related 
cases in North America. The Committee reviewed management’s 
approach and recommendations and concluded that the proposals 
were appropriate

Fair, balanced and understandable reporting
Hikma is committed to clear and transparent disclosure and seeks 
to continuously improve the clarity of its reporting. At the request of 
the Board, the Audit Committee considers whether Hikma’s Annual 
Report is fair, balanced and understandable and that the narrative 
section of the report is consistent with the financial information. 
The Committee’s assessment is underpinned by a report from the 
Reporting Committee following their comprehensive review of the 
Annual Report. The Reporting Committee is comprised of 
representatives from Finance, Investor Relations, Risk, Sustainability 
and Company Secretariat and is supported by divisional and 
functional heads, as required.

The Reporting Committee’s activities include:

 – initiating the review process for the Annual Report significantly 

before the year-end, considering external developments, issuing 
guidance to contributors and identifying areas for improvement
 – obtaining input from external advisers, including the external and 

internal auditors, designers, corporate brokers and public relations 
advisers

 – undertaking several multi-functional reviews of the disclosures 

as a whole prior to the publication of the Annual Report to ensure 
consistency and accuracy across the document as a whole
 – overseeing an extensive verification process to ensure the 

accuracy of disclosures

Each member of the Audit Committee and the Reporting Committee 
is satisfied that the 2023 Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and has recommended the adoption of 
the Report and Accounts to the Board.

Reporting controls
Hikma’s key controls and risk management systems relating to the 
financial reporting process include the enterprise resource planning 
system, the processes in the ‘Fair, balanced and understandable’ and 
‘Verification’ sections described earlier in this letter, the review of the 
financial statements and disclosures that is undertaken by the 
Executive Committee, and detailed internal financial control 
processes necessitating the verification of financial records 
at a local, regional and Group level.

Risk management and internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that Hikma’s 
systems of internal controls and risk management remain effective.

Risk management
The Committee has continued to receive reports on the operation 
of the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework which 
includes the material controls and programme for enhancing the 
Group’s risk management efforts. Management escalated certain risks 
that materialised during the year for Board attention and oversight, for 
example the response to the conflict in Sudan. Such instances serve 
to hone escalation and disclosure protocols and learnings are taken 
to improve risk mitigation programmes. Further information on 
Hikma’s response to the conflict in Sudan is included on page 70.

The Board continued to exercise oversight of cyber risks during the 
year, including presentations from management on internal testing, 
lessons learnt, the results of a cyber maturity assessment conducted 
by an external party, and recommendations for implementation to 
enhance our resilience. Further information on Hikma’s management 
of cyber risks is included on page 72.

As in previous years, management and the Board have undertaken 
a thorough assessment of the Group’s emerging risks as well as the 
annual review of the principal risks. The Committee and the Board 
have considered the principal risks facing the Group and have 
decided that no adjustments were required in the year under review. 
The Board and management have also reviewed the appetite for 
those principal risks and have concluded that it remains appropriate. 
Further information regarding the Group’s risk management activities 
is available in the risk management section on pages 68 to 79.

Internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that Hikma’s systems 
of internal controls and risk management processes are effective 
and has delegated responsibility for reviewing their effectiveness 
to the Committee. 

The key elements of our internal control framework are as follows:

 – a documented and disseminated reporting structure with clear 
policies, procedures, authorisation limits, segregation of duties 
and delegated authorities

 – written policies and procedures for material functional areas 
with specific responsibility allocated to individual managers

 – a comprehensive system of internal financial reporting that includes 

regular comparison of results against budget and forecast and 
a review of KPIs, each informed by management commentary
 – an established process for reviewing the financial performance 
and providing support to Hikma companies and associates 
together with direct support from Hikma’s finance function

 – annual budgets, updated forecasts and medium-term business 
plans for Hikma that identify risks and opportunities and that 
are reviewed and, where appropriate, approved by the Board

 – a defined process for controlling capital expenditure which 

is detailed in the governance framework

Effectiveness 
The Board is satisfied that Hikma’s systems for internal control are 
in accordance with the FRC’s guidance, and have been in place 
throughout the year under review and up to the date of approval of 
the Annual Report and Accounts. The Board reviews the effectiveness 
of these systems at least annually as part of the processes for the 
Annual Report, and throughout the year when reviewing Internal 
Controls and Assurance testing outcomes as well as risk management 
reports. The Board has not identified any material weaknesses. 
In making this assessment, the Board takes into account:

 – Internal audit: the Committee receives regular reports from the 

internal auditors and other third-party experts who review relevant 
parts of the Group business operations, assess Hikma’s processes, 
identify areas for improvement, monitor progress, and undertake 
their own assessment of the risks facing Hikma

 – Internal controls and assurance: the Committee receives regular 

reports from the Internal Controls and Assurance team, who review 
relevant parts of the finance function and operational processes, 
based on a risk based testing plan. The team assesses Hikma’s 
processes, identifies areas for improvement, and monitors 
remediation progress

 – Risk management: the ERM framework provides a structure for risk 
management activities to occur at all levels of the organisation, 
including management of principal risks and uncertainties (detailed 
on pages 68 to 79) and emerging risks. Risk reporting processes 
ensure the Executive Committee and the Board are engaged in 
the design and implementation of new control initiatives and 
provide oversight of existing programmes

 – Financial performance: Hikma’s financial performance and 
forecasting reports are reviewed by the Board to aid the 
understanding of the underlying performance of the business, 
deviations from expectations and management’s operational 
challenges and responses

 – Ethics: the business integrity and ethics procedures and 

controls that are led by the Compliance, Responsibility and Ethics 
Committee (CREC). To ensure consistency and awareness between 
these Committees’ responsibilities, the Audit Committee Chair is 
a standing member of the CREC

 – Governance: the Board and Group-level controls and processes 

that make up our approach to governance that is led by the 
Nomination and Governance Committee and includes 
all appropriate financial and non-financial controls
 – External auditor: the regular and confidential dialogue 

with the external auditor

During the year, Hikma’s Internal Controls and Assurance team 
took steps to prepare for the expected upcoming changes to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code as well as setting up a formal fraud 
prevention and detection programme for the Group, building on 
existing practices and policies, in preparation for the newly legislated 
criminal offence of failure to prevent fraud. The fraud prevention and 
detection programme further supports the Company’s internal 
control environment with formalised controls, in preparation for the 
newly legislated failure to prevent fraud criminal offence.

Management and the Committee received regular updates on 
potential programme developments, as well as the results of internal 
assurance of controls from the Internal Controls and Assurance team. 

The Committee also maintains a programme of in-depth reviews into 
specific financial and operational areas of the business. These reviews 
allow the Committee to meet key members of the management team 
and provide independent challenge. During 2023, the Treasury team 
presented a deep dive on their mandate, processes, systems, and 
controls. The Committee deliberated with management and the 
Treasury team during the presentation, gaining comfort in relation to 
the general control environment surrounding the treasury function of 
the Group, in addition to the various assurance activities undertaken 
by Internal audit and internal controls and assurance.

Membership of the Committee
The Committee comprises solely of independent Non-Executive 
Directors, who as a whole, have competence relevant to Hikma’s 
business and the industry in which it operates. I am considered by 
the Board to have significant recent and relevant financial experience 
chiefly related to my work with other audit committees, having been 
a finance director of another listed entity and having held senior 
financial positions in other entities. Biographical details of the 
Committee members can be found pages 86 and 87. The Board 
is satisfied that the Committee has the resources and expertise 
to fulfil its responsibilities.

As Chair of the Audit Committee, I remain available to shareholders 
and stakeholders should they wish to discuss any matters within this 
report or under the Committee’s area of responsibility whether at the 
AGM or by writing to the Company Secretary.

For and on behalf of the Audit Committee.

Letter from the Chair

John Castellani
Chair, Compliance, Responsibility 
and Ethics Committee

Dear Shareholders
During 2023, the Compliance, Responsibility and Ethics Committee 
(CREC or the Committee) continued to promote and oversee our 
commitments to business integrity, quality, communities and ethical 
conduct. This report focuses on the matters that the Committee 
addressed during the year. Further details related to the structure 
of our Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) compliance and integrity 
programme are available on our website at www.hikma.com.

Hikma’s compliance programme
ABC programme
Our ABC compliance programme continues to perform in a highly 
effective manner. The ABC programme has strong support from the 
Board, the CREC and the CEO, and the Chief Compliance Officer has 
direct access to the Committee.

Commitment to integrity
The Committee and the Board are very proud of Hikma’s 
commitment to high standards of business integrity. It includes 
the Board’s long-standing, zero-tolerance approach to bribery and 
corruption which has been demonstrated in numerous instances, 
including being a founding member of the World Economic Forum’s 
Partnering Against Corruption Initiative.

Code of Conduct
The Committee continues to oversee the development and promotion 
of Hikma’s Code of Conduct, which embodies the important moral 
and ethical values that are critical to the Group’s success. The Code of 
Conduct guides all the Committee’s activities and is the key reference 
point for all our employees. Hikma’s Code of Conduct is available at 
www.hikma.com/who-we-are/codes-and-standards/.

Supplier Code of Conduct
Our Supplier Code of Conduct reinforces our commitment to 
integrity and transparency in all our business dealings, as it sets 
out the highest ethical standards we expect from all our suppliers. 
In 2023, we digitalised our supplier onboarding process, including 
the acknowledgement of the Supplier Code of Conduct as a 
required step. The Supplier Code of Conduct can be found  
at www.hikma.com/who-we-are/codes-and-standards/.

Speak up
The Committee continued to receive regular reports on issues 
identified through our speak up channels, which provide both 
internal and external stakeholders a resource to raise concerns 
about suspected misconduct confidentially and anonymously. 
Our procedures require that all reports received via our speak up 
channels are investigated, as appropriate, by senior and independent 
employees. A review has been carried out to ensure our speak up 
procedures remain appropriate and compliant with applicable law. 

The Committee has reviewed the speak up procedures and remains 
satisfied that the procedures in place continue to operate effectively. 
The overall level of speak up reports received is within the normal 
range for an organisation of our size.

The Chair of the Audit Committee is a standing member of the CREC 
and vice versa, which ensures that any relevant issues are considered 
by the right people within our governance structure. Both Committee 
Chairs report all relevant matters considered by their Committees to 
the next Board meeting. Speak up matters are reported and 
considered as part of this process.

Training
During the year, we continued with our training programmes for the 
Code of Conduct, ABC, speak up, anti-money laundering, Criminal 
Finances Act, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), antitrust 
and related matters, both virtually and in person. The programmes 
have been developed with assistance from external experts and are 
provided to employees virtually through their personalised corporate 
training portal. Our training programmes include worked examples 
and tests to ensure and enhance understanding. 

Internal auditing and monitoring
The Committee receives regular updates on the monitoring 
programme conducted by the Hikma Compliance team. In addition, 
the Committee retains independent third parties to conduct periodic 
and recurring audits of our governance and transparency and the 
compliance programme and related activities.

Ethics
Corporate Social Responsibility
The Committee oversaw, encouraged and supported the 
corporate social responsibility programme which is so clearly linked 
to our founder’s desire to improve lives, particularly through health, 
educational and development opportunities for the least privileged. 
Our sustainability section provides a detailed assessment of our key 
efforts in relation to corporate social responsibility and is available 
on pages 40 to 65.

Ethical issues
The Committee oversaw Hikma’s response to ethical issues arising 
during the year. There are no matters to report. 

Modern slavery 
Hikma is committed to taking the required actions to identify, prevent 
and mitigate modern slavery in the form of forced or compulsory 
labour and human trafficking in any of its businesses, operations 
or supply chains across the globe. 

Key measures in support of this goal include:
 – a global Supplier Code of Conduct which requires our suppliers 
and third parties who represent or conduct business on behalf 
of Hikma to comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and 
ethical standards, including with respect to forced or compulsory 
labour and human trafficking

 – continuing our partnership with EcoVadis, a leader in 

sustainability ratings, to assess our main supplier base 
for any risk of modern slavery or human rights abuses

 – training Hikma staff on labour standards and how to recognise 

and respond to any incidences of modern slavery
 – carrying out appropriate due diligence and audits
 – an anonymous speak up line to empower Hikma employees, 

consultants, suppliers and third parties to report potential issues 
of modern slavery

 – engaging with supply chain partners and the operational part of 
our business if and when any risk of modern slavery is identified

Hikma’s modern slavery statement is available at www.hikma.com.

Regulations
Antitrust, anti-money laundering (AML) and trade sanctions
The General Counsel oversees Hikma’s compliance with the  
antitrust, AML and trade sanctions legislation, among other matters. 
The General Counsel has created procedures for the management 
of these matters which have been reviewed and approved by the 
CREC. The General Counsel reports to the CREC on relevant matters 
that arise, including pertinent changes to the regulatory landscape. 
The legal team has developed a training programme on antitrust, 
AML, prevention of tax evasion and trade sanctions, which has been 
undertaken by colleagues whose roles require training or awareness.

Criminal Finances Act
The General Counsel is responsible for ensuring compliance with 
the Criminal Finances Act. The CREC has approved procedures that 
have been recommended by the General Counsel and reviewed 
those procedures at appropriate intervals. The procedures are 
designed to respond to the requirements of the prevention of tax 
evasion legislation from the UK government. Hikma’s processes and 
procedures in this regard are proportionate to its risk of facilitating 
tax evasion, which is relatively low. Hikma is steadfast in applying 
the principles of the UK prevention of tax evasion legislation across 
its businesses and will continue to oversee matters of compliance.

Data protection
The General Counsel is responsible for Hikma’s data protection 
policies which are designed to ensure compliance with relevant 
legislation. The policies were considered by the Board at the point 
of implementation of the GDPR and were updated during 2023.

I am available at any time to discuss with shareholders any 
matter of concern.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Remuneration Committee

Letter from the Chair 

Nina Henderson
Chair, Remuneration 
Committee

Dear Shareholders
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee), I am 
pleased to present our remuneration report for 2023. This includes 
my annual statement, explaining the Committee’s work this year, 
our annual report on remuneration for 2023, a summary of our 
Remuneration Policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2023 
AGM, and details of how we propose to operate the Policy this year.

At the 2023 AGM, the new Policy was approved with 98.24% of 
shareholders voting in favour. I would like to thank shareholders for 
their strong support of our remuneration policy.

Hikma’s Remuneration Policy 
This policy enables performance awards for the delivery of the 
Group’s business plans and strategy in line with Hikma’s mission and 
core values. The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) pays for performance 
for actions and investments that generate results over multiple years 
and subsequently aligns with the shareholder experience. 

As detailed last year, the new Remuneration Policy introduced 
significant changes to our incentive structure, moving away from the 
Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) to a separate Annual Bonus and LTIP 
incentive model. This remuneration design enhances Hikma’s 
competitive position enabling retention and recruitment of 
executive talent. 

2023 is the first year that performance was assessed under the new 
annual bonus and the outcomes have been summarised in this letter 
and in further detail on pages 120 to 125. The 2023 Performance Share 
Plan (PSP) award was also the first grant under the new LTIP. The 
Performance outcomes will be assessed at the end of financial year 
2025. Details of PSP awards are included on page 118. There were no 
changes to the way the policy was implemented during the year.

Director changes
On 12 April 2023, Hikma announced that Riad Mishlawi, the former 
President of the Group’s Injectables business, would succeed Said 
Darwazah as Chief Executive Officer, effective from 1 September 2023. 
Riad was appointed following a thorough search process facilitated 
by an executive recruitment firm. The process included external 
candidates. The recruitment process is further outlined on page 94. 
Riad brings a successful track record delivering the Injectables 
business’ profitable growth and deep knowledge of Hikma 
having been with the company for over 20 years.

In June 2022 Said Darwazah, Executive Chairman, assumed the 
additional role of CEO. For this added responsibility, Said did not 
receive incremental remuneration. On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to take this opportunity to thank Said for his leadership while the CEO 
search process was conducted. 

One of the Committee’s key responsibilities was considering the 
appropriate remuneration package for Riad Mishlawi. To determine 
the appropriate package, the Committee examined multiple reference 
points, including pay levels at global pharmaceutical and FTSE peers, 
taking into account the size and complexity of Hikma. The approved 
package aligns with the new Policy. It provides a salary of $1,000,000 
with a pension allowance in line with the rate applicable to the wider 
workforce, at 10% of salary. The annual bonus opportunity and LTIP 
opportunity is 200% of salary and 300% of salary, respectively, as is 
applicable for each Executive Director. 

Remuneration policy implementation for 2024
Executive Director 2024 salary review
The Committee undertook a benchmarking exercise comparing 
Executive Director compensation to appropriate global 
pharmaceutical and FTSE peers. The Committee determined that 
Executive Directors’ base salaries remain unchanged for the Executive 
Chairman at $1,018,000 and Executive Vice Chairman at $806,787. At 
appointment, the new CEO’s salary took account of a merit increase 
and remains unchanged at $1,000,000. 

Wider employee context 
During the year, the Committee was pleased to note that an average 
pay increase of 4.7% was granted across the Company and 83% of the 
total spend on pay increases was applied to employees below middle 
management levels.

The Committee continues to be briefed on the wider employee pay 
policies and practices throughout the Group, including the Living 
Wage and the level of pay in each one of our jurisdictions, which 
takes account of the cost of living.

2023 Performance outcomes
The 2023 incentive outcomes correlate to the returns experienced 
by our shareholders with the core earnings per share increasing 23% 
and an increase in share price of 8% over the previous 12 months.

Financial outcomes
During the 2023 financial year Hikma delivered strong results across 
all three of its businesses. This strong performance resulted in Group 
revenue of $2,875m (2022: $2,517) and Core Operating Profit after 
R&D of $707m (2022: $596m). This represented 105% of the 
revenue target and 111% of the Core Operating Profit target. 

The US Generics business had a particularly strong year with revenue 
and Core Operating Profit increasing by 39% and 86% respectively. 
The increase in profits was driven, in part, by the launch of sodium 
oxybate (see page 7). 

The revenue of the Injectables business grew by 6% having 
benefitted from the broad range of products it produces. 

In April 2023, Hikma took the decision to halt operations in Sudan due 
to the ongoing conflict in the country. During 2023 our Sudan 
business was budgeted to generate revenues of $66m and a Core 
Operating Profit of $22m representing 7% of revenue and 11% of Core 
Operating Profit targets for our MENA business. Despite these 
challenges, the total MENA business generated revenues of $908m 
(2022: $862m) and a Core Operating Profit of $204m (2022: $197m). 
These represent 99% of MENA revenue target and 103% of MENA 
Core Operating Profit target.

Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Corporate Governance 
Remuneration Committee
continued

We have not sought to adjust the group or regional financial targets or 
outcomes as they relate to executive bonuses to reflect the cessation 
of Hikma’s activities in Sudan. This has impacted the formulaic 
outcome of the bonus for all executive directors. The Executive Vice 
Chairman, who is responsible for managing the MENA business, has 
been particularly impacted as his annual incentive calculation is 
materially based on regional results. 

When reviewing the annual incentive payment for Mazen Darwazah, 
the Committee recognised his exceptional leadership and the action 
taken to ensure the security of our colleagues and resilience of 
our total MENA business in response to the Sudan situation. As a 
result, the Committee decided to exercise its discretion to increase 
the annual incentive from 66% to 84% of the maximum to recognise 
his contribution in these exceptional circumstances (details of the 
calculation are shown on pages 122 and 123). For the wider workforce, 
below the main board, bonus pools were adjusted to recognise that 
operations in Sudan were halted. 

No other discretion has been applied by the Committee this year.

Strategic outcomes
As previously mentioned, Riad Mishlawi became CEO with effect from 
1 September 2023. The Executive Chairman was set a performance 
objective of ensuring an effective onboarding for the new CEO, and 
Riad Mishlawi was additionally set the objective of ensuring there was 
a smooth transition in leadership of the Injectables business (on his 
appointment as CEO). The continued strong business performance 
demonstrated that there had been an effective transition to the new 
CEO as well as a successful transition in terms of the leadership of the 
Injectables business with the appointment of Bill Larkins as President 
of Injectables (see page 88 for details of his experience).

The Executive Vice Chairman was set a target of gaining the necessary 
approvals for expansion of our manufacturing facilities in KSA to 
facilitate the increase in production needed to meet the business 
growth plans in MENA. These were all completed during the year 
and the business will now focus on building the production capacity.

The impact of Hikma’s business on the environment continues to 
be a focus. The Board set two environmentally related performance 
targets in 2023. The Executive Chairman was set a target for reducing 
the scope 1 and 2 emissions during 2023. A total reduction of 15% was 
achieved (see page 50). The Executive Vice Chairman was set the 
target for the completion of energy audits and development of action 
plans for two countries in MENA. During the year three energy audits 
were completed and action plans developed.

The Board and management recognise that Hikma’s people are its 
most important asset and that talent development, retention and 
recruitment are key management responsibilities. Hikma’s ability to 
build it’s business is enabled and advantaged by the diversity of its 
talent. This diversity (gender, race, religion and economic 
background) brings a broad perspective to business decisions while 
aligning with Hikma’s mission and values. 

Participation of women in management positions is lower in MENA 
than the rest of the Group. The Executive Vice Chairman was set a 
target of increasing the number of women in MENA management 
positions by 9% in 2023. As at 31 December 2023 the number of 
women in management positions in MENA had remained 
unchanged, however, work has been undertaken to review 
incumbent development plans, promotion processes and 
external hiring to address the imbalance going forward. 

The total 2023 incentive payment, as a percentage of base salary, 
for the Executive Directors are summarised in the following table:

120-125.

Operation of 2024 bonus 
The 2024 bonus will be based on performance measures weighted 
80% financial and 20% strategic deliverables. The financial element 
focuses on revenue and profit and the strategic element will be 
a combination of initiatives related to Hikma’s strategy, it’s 
environmental impact and enabling talent diversity.

Fifty percent of any bonus payment for Executive Directors will be 
paid in cash with the remainder deferred in to shares for a period 
of three years. The maximum bonus will be 200% of base salary.

Further details on the targets can be found on page 131.

LTIP awards to be made in 2024
A PSP award with a maximum for the Executive Directors of 300% 
of base salary.

The performance conditions will be measured from 1 January 2024 
and include:

 – Relative TSR against FTSE 50-150 peer group excluding investment 

trusts (20% weighting)

 – Business development and portfolio expansion (40% weighting)
 – Compound annual growth of EPS (30% weighting)
 – Talent diversity and development (10% weighting)

Further details regarding the performance conditions for the award 
are included on page 132. 

In its application of the new Policy’s Annual Bonus Plan and LTIP, the 
Committee went through a rigorous target setting process, 
considering multiple data points, including Hikma’s annual business 
plan, targets for previous awards, analyst consensus and targets 
among our global pharmaceutical and FTSE peers.

The Committee carefully considers views expressed by shareholders 
when making decisions regarding the Remuneration Policy design 
and implementation. Details regarding shareholder engagement 
activity are included on page 25.

Concluding remarks
On behalf of the Committee, I would like to express our appreciation 
to Shareholders for their engagement and valued input. I remain 
open to discussion with shareholders should there be any matters 
that they would like to raise.

I commend our Remuneration Report to you. We look forward 
to receiving your support at our Annual General Meeting on 
25 April 2024.

A higher increase may be made 
for example where there is a 
material change in role or 
responsibilities, promotion, 
where there needs to be 
an adjustment to reflect 
an individuals increased 
experience in the role, 
when pay is materially behind 
market competitive levels, or in 
exceptional circumstances, with 
the rationale clearly explained in 
the next report to shareholders.

Base salaries for Executive 
Directors are reviewed annually 
by the Committee and changes, 
if any, normally take effect from 
1 January.

Salaries are set with reference 
to:

 – pay increases for the general 

workforce

 – salaries in peer companies 

from the global 
pharmaceutical sector 
and UK listed companies

 – company performance 

and affordability

Salaries for individuals who 
are recruited or promoted to 
the Board may be (but are 
not required to be) set below 
market levels at the time of 
appointment, with the intention 
of bringing the base salary levels 
in line with the market as the 
individual becomes established 
in their role.

Benefits

An appropriate package of 
market competitive benefits to 
ensure executives are rewarded 
and focused.

Pension (or cash allowance)

An appropriate level of 
pension contribution to 
ensure executives are provided 
with a retirement standard 
commensurate with their role, 
whilst being in line with the 
wider workforce.

Benefits may include, but are 
not limited to:

 – healthcare
 – school fees
 – company cars/transport 

(or cash allowance)

 – life insurance
 – relocation: when relocation 
is required by the Company
 – tax equalisation: where the 

director becomes tax resident 
in a jurisdiction as a result of 
the role and to the extent that 
additional taxes are paid and 
related advisory fees.

As the Company operates 
internationally it may be 
necessary for the Committee 
to provide special benefits or 
allowances, for example (but not 
limited to) benefits customarily 
included in the country where 
the Executive Director resides. 
These would be disclosed to 
shareholders in the annual 
report on remuneration for 
the year in which the benefit 
or allowances were paid.

The Company operates defined 
contribution arrangements in 
its main operational jurisdictions 
and executives participate in 
these arrangements. A cash 
supplement in lieu of pension 
may be paid provided the total 
pension payment does not 
exceed the maximum 
opportunity.

Not applicable.

The value of benefit is based 
on the cost to the Company 
and there is no predetermined 
maximum limit. The range and 
value of the benefits offered 
are reviewed periodically.

Not applicable.

The maximum pension 
cash allowance (or pension 
contribution as appropriate) 
in line with the predominant 
pension contribution made 
for the wider global workforce 
which is currently 10% of salary.

Maximum of 200% of salary

The maximum face value of 
awards relating to a financial 
year of the Company will be 
300% of base salary.

Performance measures 
and weightings are reviewed 
annually to ensure they continue 
to support the achievement of 
the Company’s key strategic 
priorities.

Annual bonus financial targets 
are set with reference to internal 
plans and analyst consensus 
forecasts.

Details of the performance 
measures for 2024 are shown 
on page 131.

The Committee has discretion 
to adjust formulaic outcomes if 
they are not considered to be 
representative of the overall 
financial performance of the 
Group. Any adjustments applied 
will be explained in the relevant 
annual report on remuneration.

Performance is measured 
over three financial years.

Performance measures for 
the 2024 award are shown 
on page 132

The Committee will set 
appropriate performance 
measures for future years.

LTIP targets are set with

reference points which may 
include internal plans and 
analysts’ consensus forecasts.

The Committee has discretion 
to adjust formulaic outcomes if 
they are not considered to be 
representative of the overall 
financial performance of the 
Group. Any adjustments applied 
will be explained in the relevant

Executive Directors are eligible 
to participate in an Annual 
Bonus Plan under which annual 
bonus is earned subject to the 
achievement of performance 
over the financial year against 
targets set by the Committee at 
the start of each financial year.

No bonus is payable for 
performance below threshold 
level, 25% for threshold and up 
to 50% of maximum pays out 
for on-target performance.

Half of any bonus will normally 
be deferred into an award over 
shares, typically for a period 
of three years. Dividend 
equivalents may be accrued 
on deferred shares based on 
dividends paid to shareholders 
during the vesting period. These 
may accrue either in cash or 
shares on a reinvestment basis.

Malus and clawback provisions 
apply.

Performance share awards 
may be granted. In usual 
circumstances awards vest 
after a three-year period, 
subject to the achievement of 
performance targets measured 
over three financial years.

Normally, vested shares are 
subject to a holding period of 
two years (shares may be sold at 
vesting to satisfy any tax-related 
liabilities).

25% of the award value will vest 
for threshold performance and 
62.5% of the award value will 
vest for target performance.

Dividend equivalents may be 
accrued on the shares earned 
from LTIP awards based on 
dividends paid to shareholders 
during the vesting period. In line 
with the LTIP rules, dividend 
equivalents may also accrue 
during any applicable post-
vesting holding period. These 
may accrue either in cash or 
shares on a reinvestment basis.

Malus and clawback provisions

Shareholding policy

To provide alignment between 
the interests of Executive 
Directors and shareholders 
over the longer term. 

In-employment 
shareholding policy
Shareholding guidelines for 
all Executive Directors will 
be at least 300% of salary.

Executive Directors are 
expected to build up their 
shareholding guideline within 
a 5-year period from their date 
of appointment to the Board.

Post-cessation 
shareholding policy
All Executive Directors will be 
required to hold the lower of 
(i) their shareholding at the date 
of termination of employment; 
or (ii) shares equivalent to the 
minimum share ownership 
guideline at that date, for a 
period of two years post-
employment.

Differences between the policies for Executive Directors and employees, consideration of shareholder views and consideration of 
conditions elsewhere in the Group
Employees were not directly consulted on the executive remuneration policy. All employees receive a salary, pension, and medical insurance 
on a similar basis to the Executive Directors. Additionally, all employees participate in a cash bonus scheme, which is similar to the annual 
bonus. The Committee reviews detailed internal and summary benchmarking data and is satisfied that the level of remuneration 
is proportionate across the wider employee population. Further information is available on page 25 regarding how the Committee takes account 
of shareholder views when developing and implementing the remuneration policy, 

Remuneration Policy table for the Chair and Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors’ (NEDs) fees are set by the Board under the direction of the Executive Directors having considered the:

 – pay practice in FTSE and sector peers
 – extensive travel required to undertake the role
 – significant guidance and support required from the NEDs

NEDs do not participate in the Group’s pension or incentive arrangements. The annual fees payable to newly recruited NEDs will follow the 
policy for fees payable to existing NEDs, whose fees comprise:

Component

Approach

Application of Remuneration Committee discretion

Basic fee

An underlying fee for undertaking the duties of a Director of 
Hikma, chiefly relating to Board, strategy, and shareholder 
meetings. Provides a level of fees to support recruitment 
and retention of NEDs with the necessary experience.

Committee 
membership fee

A composite fee for taking additional responsibilities in 
relation to Committee membership. Usually, NEDs are 
members of at least three committees.

Committee 
Chair/employee 
engagement fee

Expenses

The Committee Chairs undertake additional responsibilities 
in leading a committee and are expected to act as a sounding 
board for the executive that reports to the relevant 
committee. The Director responsible for employee 
engagement receives a similar fee due to the additional 
requirements of that role. The chairmanship fee is paid in 
addition to the membership fee and a Senior Independent 
Director fee is paid to the individual in that position.

The Company pays expenses incurred wholly in relation to 
the position of NEDs and ensures that Directors do not incur 
a tax liability as a result. The Company retains discretion to 
provide for an allowance structure as an alternative to the 
latter payment.

Whilst there is no maximum, the practice is to remain within 
the parameters of FTSE peers.

Remuneration Policy

Performance measures
The Committee considered the operation of the remuneration policy in terms of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 as follows:

Clarity: the Committee regularly engages with shareholders, their representative bodies and management to explain the approach to 
executive pay.

Simplicity: the rationale, structure and strategic alignment of each element of pay has been explained in the remuneration policy.

Risk: there is an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay together with objectives that ensure there is alignment with long-term 
shareholder interests. 

Predictability: the pay opportunity under different performance scenarios is set out in the illustrations below.

Proportionality: executives are incentivised under the Remuneration Policy to achieve stretching annual targets. Additionally the Policy builds 
in stretching targets over three-year performance periods for the Long Term Incentive Plan awards. The Committee assess performance 
holistically and the end of each performance period against underlying business results together with internal and external context.

Alignment with culture: Hikma’s purpose and values can be reinforced under the strategic objectives under the Remuneration Policy.

Details of the performance measures for the short-term incentive for the year ending 31 December 2023 and how they are aligned to company 
strategy and the creation of shareholder value are set out on pages 120 – 125. Annual short-term incentive targets for the 2024 financial year 
are shown on page 131. Targets that are commercially sensitive will be disclosed retrospectively in next years' Remuneration Report.

Performance measures for the March 2024 Long Term Incentive award are shown on page 132. 

These performance targets are designed to be stretching but achievable and are set based on information from a number of areas, 
including broker forecasts for Hikma and its peers as well as our corporate strategy and plans.

Illustrations of application of Remuneration Policy
The following charts show the potential projected total remuneration available for 2024 at four levels of performance: minimum, target, 
maximum and maximum with assumed share price appreciation of 50% (in accordance with the Corporate Governance Code 2018).

The scenarios in the graphs are as follows:

 – fixed pay includes salary, benefits, and pension. The numbers are based on the base salary for 2023, the cost of transportation and medical 

benefits provided and a pension contribution of 10% of base salary.

 – annual bonus is shown as a maximum percentage of base salary, with minimum, target and maximum performance shown as 0%, 50% and 

100% respectively.

 – LTIP is shown as a maximum of base salary, with minimum, target and maximum performance shown as 0%, 62.5% and 100% respectively.
 – share price appreciation has been calculated as a 50% increase in the value of the LTIP between the date of grant and vesting
 – no dividend accrual has been incorporated in the values relating to the LTIP

1.  The current Remuneration Policy was introduced on 28 April 2023. NED fees are paid in GBP and reported in USD so an element of changes will be as a result of exchange rate differences
2.  Riad Mishlawi was appointed as CEO with effect from 1 September 2023 and therefore comparative figures are not provided
3.  Siggi Olafsson stepped down from the Board on 24 June 2022
4.  Non Executive Directors do not participate in the in the bonus plan. 
5.  Patrick Butler stepped down as a member of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 28 April 2023
6.  These NEDs were appointed during 2022 and therefore did not receive fees for the full year in 2022

Hikma’s pay review, which took effect from 1 January 2024, awarded average percentage increases in wages and salaries of 4.7% (2023: 4%) 
for existing employees (with certain exceptions for jurisdictions experiencing very high inflation). The nature and level of benefits to employees 
in the year ended 31 December 2023 were broadly similar to those in the previous year (2022: unchanged).

UK gender and CEO pay ratios
Hikma has 29 employees employed in the UK and, as a result, is exempt from gender pay and average employee: CEO pay disclosure 
requirements. The small number of employees and significant diversity of roles and seniority in the UK makes meaningful gender pay 
comparisons in the UK difficult. The ratio of total CEO pay to the average Group employee is 25:1 using a simple average methodology. 
Hikma is committed to paying fairly and not discriminating on gender or other grounds.

1. Patrick Butler stepped down from the Remuneration Committee on 28 April 2023

Advice and support
The Committee seeks the assistance of senior management (CEO, CPO, VP Total Reward and Company Secretary) on matters relating to policy, 
performance and remuneration but ensures that no Director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration or benefits.

Willis Towers Watson (WTW) continue to provide independent advice to the Committee in relation to market practice, UK corporate governance 
best practice, incentive plan review and target setting. The total fees for advice to the Committee during the year, including advice relating to 
the CEO compensation undertaken in 2023, were $121,244 (2022: $285,234). WTW was appointed by the Committee in 2016 following a 
competitive tender process. WTW adheres to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct. They charge their fees on a time 
spent basis. They provide no other services to the company other than Remuneration Committee advice and compensation benchmarking.

The Committee is satisfied that the WTW team providing remuneration advice do not have connections with Hikma that may impair their 
independence.

During the year the Committee instructed Mercer to conduct a MENA region specific benchmarking exercise on a fixed fee basis of $6,000 
(2022: $6,000). Mercer are a recognised expert in the region in question.

Except as disclosed on page 96 Hikma has complied with all the relevant principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 
throughout the year.

Performance awards incentivised Directors to deliver annual financial performance targets and certain key strategic deliverables, with the 
majority of awards made in shares to ensure that medium-term performance was delivered.

The Committee set annual performance targets for awards under the EIP, in accordance with the rules of the EIP. Annual performance metrics 
were based on:

 – Financial metrics: At least 80% of the performance award, with specific targets based on the budget approved prior to the performance 

period. The precise targets were determined by the Committee on an annual basis

 – Strategic deliverables: Up to 20% of the performance award was based on the delivery of specific, subjective targets that were set by the 

Committee in order to ensure that key milestones in the Company’s strategy are delivered

At the end of each year the Committee determined the level of performance for the prior year. Based on the performance, the Committee made 
the following awards:

cessation of employment of an Executive Director, the Company’s policy is that the Director must hold for a period of two years the lower 
of the shares held on cessation of employment or shares equivalent to 300% of the final, annualised salary.

During 2023, the following share awards vested for Executive Directors. The total shares vested in 2023 are summarised in the following 
three tables.

Under the EIP, performance criteria must be met before an award is granted. There are three award types under the EIP which are treated in the 
following manner in respect of the table above:

 – Element A – a cash bonus that is payable immediately and attributed to the earnings for the performance year
 – Element B – an award of shares that vests two years after grant subject to there being no forfeiture events and is attributed to the earnings 

in respect of the year in which it vests (i.e. two years after being granted)

 – Element C – an award of shares that vests three years after grant and, due to their being no further performance requirements, is attributed 

to the earnings for the performance year in the same manner as Element A

Core revenue

Historically, the pricing of generic pharmaceutical products has decreased with time. The 
Committee is cognisant that this could lead to declining revenue over the longer term, which 
could ultimately result in a declining business overall. By ensuring that a significant proportion 
of performance remuneration is based on revenue, the Committee is able to ensure that the 
Executive Directors are focused on mitigating pricing declines by maximising the potential  
of the in-market portfolio, launching new products, and developing the pipeline. See page 3  
of the Strategic report for further detail on the performance related to this target.

Core operating profit 
(COP)

Ultimately, the COP is a key measure of value to Hikma’s shareholders. Given the highly 
competitive business environment in which Hikma operates, the Executive Directors must 
focus continuously on optimising Hikma’s cost base.

Committee is cognisant that this could lead to declining revenue over the longer term, which 

could ultimately result in a declining business overall. By ensuring that a significant proportion 

of performance remuneration is based on revenue, the Committee is able to ensure that the 

Executive Directors are focused on mitigating pricing declines by maximising the potential  

of the in-market portfolio, launching new products, and developing the pipeline. See page 3  

of the Strategic report for further detail on this target.

Core operating profit 

Ultimately, the COP is a key measure of value to Hikma’s shareholders. Given the highly 

(COP)

competitive business environment in which Hikma operates, the Executive Directors must 

focus continuously on optimising Hikma’s cost base. 

MENA revenue 

The Executive Director is responsible for this region. The Committee considered financial 

metrics to be the best method of ensuring delivery of the strategy that could be measured in an 

objective manner that is readily understandable by investors. Measured by target MENA revenue 

compared to audited MENA revenue for the year ended 31 December 2023 (see page 31)

MENA COP

The Executive Director is responsible for this region. The Committee considered financial

1.  The performance criteria for Elements B and C of the EIP are assessed before a grant is considered. Additionally, Element B is subject to forfeiture criteria for the first two years after grant
2.  The face value is the value at the point of the EIP grant which is the 30-day average to the 31 December of the performance year. The face value (30-day average price) in respect of 
awards granted in 2020 $25.32 (£19.30p), and 2021 $33.94 (£25.25p), and 2022 $29.55(£22.20), and 2023 $18.44(£15.15). The actual value received by Executive Directors under the 
share incentive arrangements is dependent upon the share price of Hikma at the time of vesting, the satisfaction of performance criteria and the non-occurrence of forfeiture events 
(EIP Element B only).  Forfeiture would apply to 50% of any unvested Element B shares if the financial performance in any year is less than 30% of the target.

3.  The minimum value of the awards at vesting will be the share price on the day of vesting multiplied by the number of shares vesting. If the Executive Director leaves employment during 

the vesting period, the normal position is that zero shares vest. If all the forfeiture conditions occur in each year of the vesting period under Element B only, zero shares will vest. 
The weighting of each forfeiture condition has a proportional impact on the vesting percentage under Element B only

4.  The outstanding awards shown for Riad Mishlawi relate to grants made prior to appointment as CEO and percentage is based on full year equivalent salary
5.  The share price was determined by the average closing price in the five business days preceding the grant date.  25% of grant vests at threshold and 62.5% vests at target performance

Total shareholder return
During the last ten years, Hikma has outperformed the FTSE 100 index. The performance has been below the FTSE 350 Pharmaceuticals & 
Biotechnology segment, a relatively small group of companies that are mainly focused on developing new drugs. The Remuneration Committee 
has chosen these comparators because it uses executive compensation benchmarking data from the FTSE 100 and the pharmaceutical 
industry when considering compensation for the Executive Directors.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Remuneration table 
The following table sets out the total remuneration, including amounts vesting under short-term and long-term incentive plans, for each 
financial period in respect of the Directors holding the positions of Executive Chairman and CEO. The total figures for the financial years 2017 
and 2016 are higher than would otherwise be the case due to a change of incentive plan. In accordance with the Regulations, the 2017 and 2016 
totals include LTIPs vesting during the relevant period (which were granted three years before) and Element C of the EIP which was granted in 
respect of the relevant period. The Regulations require Element C to be treated in a similar way to the annual bonus, although it is an award of 
shares that will vest three years after grant.

Hikma complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 requirement that all Directors be subject to election or annual re-election 
by shareholders.

External appointments
Hikma recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector and not-for-profit 
appointments, and that these can broaden the experience, network and knowledge of the Director, from which Hikma can benefit. 
Executive Directors may accept external appointments as long as they do not lead to a conflict of interest and are allowed to retain any fees. 
During the year under review, Said Darwazah received fees of $4,100 (2022: $4,100), There were no other fees paid to Executive Directors 
relating to external appointments. External appointments are detailed in their Director profiles on pages 86 and 87.

Implementation of Policy
In February 2024, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salaries for Executive Directors and agreed that there would be no changes 
with effect from 1 January 2024.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Annual bonus design for year ending 31 December 2024
The measures and targets for the annual bonus plan will be reviewed annually by the Committee and those agreed for 2024 are:

Area

Description

Rationale

Financial

Group/Division 
Revenue

Group Core/
Divisional EBIT

Historically, the pricing of generic pharmaceutical products has 
decreased with time. The Committee recognizes that this could 
lead to declining revenue over the longer term, which could 
ultimately result in a declining business overall. 
By ensuring that a significant proportion of performance 
remuneration is based on revenue, the Committee is able to ensure 
that the Executive Directors are focused on mitigating pricing 
declines by maximising the potential of the in-market portfolio, 
launching new products, and developing the pipeline. Please see 
page 16 of the Strategic report for the detail on this target

Ultimately, core operating profit is a key measure of value to Hikma’s 
shareholders. Given the highly competitive business environment 
in which Hikma operates, the Executive Directors must focus 
continuously on optimising Hikma’s cost base.

Long term incentive awards to be made in year ending 31 December 2024
The Committee intends to issue a Performance Share Plan (PSP) award to the Executive Directors. Under the Policy long-term incentive 
measures will be reviewed annually by the Committee and will be designed to drive Hikma business strategy and align with the delivery of 
value to shareholders. It is proposed that the following targets will be set for the 2024 award and measure over the period 1 January 2024 to

Closing statement
We have continued to develop our approach to remuneration reporting this year and the Committee hopes that this has aided your 
understanding of our Remuneration Policy and practices. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or observations.

Results
Hikma’s reported profit attributable to shareholders of Hikma 
Pharmaceuticals PLC for the year in 2023 was $190 million 
(2022: $188 million).

Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 47 cents per share 
(2022: 37 cents per share) bringing the total dividend for the full year 
to 72 cents per share (2022: 56 cents per share). The proposed 
dividend will be paid on 3 May 2024 to eligible shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 22 March 2024, subject 
to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2024.

Post-balance sheet events
On 1 February 2024, the Group reached an agreement in principle to 
resolve the vast majority of the opioid related cases brought against 
Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. by US states, their subdivisions, and 
tribal nations. These cases relate to the manufacture and sales of 
prescription opioid medications. The agreed upon settlement is not 
an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. The Group booked a total 
provision of $129 million to cover for the expected settlement amount 
for all related cases in North America. The provision is considered 
an adjusting post balance sheet event and is recognised in 
the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2023.

Creditor payment policy
Hikma’s policy, which is also applied by all subsidiaries and will 
continue in respect of the 2024 financial year, is to settle terms 
of payment with all suppliers when agreeing the terms of each 
transaction and to ensure that we abide by those terms of payment. 
Trade creditors of Hikma at 31 December 2023 were equivalent to 
76 days’ purchases (2022: 83 days), based on Group trade payables 
multiplied by 365, divided by trailing 12 months Group cost of goods 
sold.

During the year Hikma made charitable donations of over $6.0 million 
(2022: $5.0 million):

Research and development
Hikma’s investment in research and development (R&D) during 2023 
represented 5.2% of Group revenue (2022: 5.7%). Further details on 
Hikma’s R&D activities can be found on pages 12 to 19.

Significant contracts
Due to the nature of Hikma’s business, members of Hikma are party 
to agreements that could alter or be terminated upon a change of 
control of Hikma following a takeover. However, none of these 
agreements is individually deemed to be significant in terms of its 
potential impact on the business of Hikma taken as a whole. The 
Directors are not aware of any agreements between Hikma and its 
Directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss of 
office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. There are 
no persons, with whom Hikma has contractual or other arrangements, 
who are deemed to be essential to the business of Hikma.

Directors
It is the Board’s policy that all Directors should retire and, should 
the Director wish to continue in office, seek election or re-election 
on an annual basis. Accordingly, Said Darwazah, Mazen Darwazah, Ali 
Al-Husry, John Castellani, Nina Henderson, Cynthia Flowers, Douglas 
Hurt, Laura Balan, Victoria Hull and Deneen Vojta will seek re-election 
at the AGM and Riad Mishlawi will seek election at the AGM.

Indemnities and insurance
Hikma maintains an appropriate level of Directors’ and Officers’ 
insurance. The Directors benefit from qualifying third-party 
indemnities made by Hikma that were in force during the year and as 
at the date of signing this report. These indemnities are uncapped in 
amount in relation to losses and liabilities which Directors may incur 
to third parties in the course of the performance of their duties.

Auditors
Each person who was a Director of Hikma at the date when this report 
was approved confirms that: 

 – so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 

of which Hikma’s auditors are unaware

 – the Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as 
a Director to make themself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that Hikma’s auditors are aware of that information

This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

Workforce engagement
Nina Henderson is the designated Non-Executive Director to engage 
with the workforce under the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 
(the Code) and undertook workforce engagement activities, 
as described on pages 22 and 83. Hikma continued to operate its 
existing workforce engagement mechanisms which include intra-
Group communications, social networking, an open door policy for 
legitimate union representatives and the operation of share incentive 
arrangements. Hikma does not discriminate against a potential 
employee on grounds of disability and will make reasonable 
adjustments to employ and develop disabled people.

Stakeholder engagement
Further information on the Board’s engagement with stakeholders 
is detailed in our Section 172 Statement on pages 20 to 25.

Equity
Capital structure
Details of the issued share capital, together with movements in 
the issued share capital during the year, can be found in Note 31 
to the Group financial statements on pages 183 and 184. Hikma has 
one class of Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each (Shares) which carries 
no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at 
general meetings of Hikma.

During 2023, Hikma issued Shares solely pursuant to the exercise of 
options under the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan, 2009 Management 
Incentive Plan, 2018 Management Incentive Plan, and 2014 Executive 
Incentive Plan.

There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding or on the 
transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provision 
Hikma’s Articles of Association (the Articles) and prevailing legislation.

The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of 
Hikma’s shares that may have resulted in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities or on voting rights. No person has any special rights with 
regard to the control of Hikma’s share capital and all issued shares are 
fully paid.

Share buyback
At the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 28 April 2023, shareholders 
gave the Directors authority to purchase shares from the market up 
to an amount equal to 10% of Hikma’s issued share capital at that time. 
This authority expires at the earlier of 28 July 2024 or the 2024 AGM, 
which is scheduled for 25 April 2024. During 2023 no Ordinary Shares 
were purchased by the Company.

During 2022, the Company purchased and cancelled 12,499,670 
Ordinary Shares.

During 2020, the Company purchased 12,833,233 Ordinary Shares 
from Boehringer Ingelheim (the ‘Treasury Shares’). The Treasury 
Shares are held in treasury and, accordingly, do not receive 
dividends and do not exercise voting rights.

Share issuance
At the AGM on 28 April 2023, the Directors were authorised to issue 
relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of £7,342,093 
and to be empowered to allot equity securities for cash on a non-pre-
emptive basis up to an aggregate nominal amount of £4,405,256 at 
any time up to the earlier of the date of the 2024 AGM or 28 July 2024. 
The Directors propose to renew these authorities at the 2024 AGM 
for a further year. In the year ahead, other than in respect of Hikma’s 
obligations to satisfy rights granted to employees under its various 
share-based incentive arrangements, the Directors have no present 
intention of issuing any additional share capital of Hikma.

Details of the employee share schemes are set out in Note 37 to 
the Group financial statements on pages 187 to 189. The Hikma 
Pharmaceuticals Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) holds no shares. 
The EBT has waived its right to vote on any shares it holds and also 
to its entitlement to a dividend. Other than the EBT and the Treasury 
Shares, no other shareholder has waived the right to a dividend.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Diversity disclosures pursuant to Listing Rule 9.8.6R
In April 2022, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published its final rules to increase the disclosure of diversity on listed company 
boards and executive committees. This requires listed companies to disclose in a prescribed format information on the diversity of their board 
and executive committee. The Listing Rules (to which Hikma is subject) have been amended to require disclosure of the prescribed information 
and the new requirement applies to financial years beginning on or after 1 April 2022.

The Listing Rules require listed companies to state whether they have met certain targets on board diversity. The information in the table below 
is at 31 December 2023, which is the date selected as the reference date within Hikma’s accounting period. The targets set out in the Listing 
Rules are that:

1. at least 40% of the individuals on its board of directors are women;

2. at least one of the following senior positions on its board of directors is held by a woman (the chair, SID, CEO or CFO); and

Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Corporate Governance 
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of 
the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulation.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards and the Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable 
law). In preparing the Group and Company financial statements, the 
Directors have also elected to comply with International Financial 
Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IFRSs as issued by IASB).

Under company law, Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or 
loss of the group for that period. In preparing the financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:

 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 

consistently;

 – state whether applicable UK-adopted international accounting 
standards and IFRSs issued by IASB have been followed for the 
Group financial statements and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 have been followed for the 
Company financial statements, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 

and prudent; and

 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will 
continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are also responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006. 

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

London SW1Y 4AN on Thursday 25 April 2024, starting at 11.00 am. 
The Notice convening the meeting is given in a separate document 
accompanying this document, and includes a commentary on the 
business of the AGM, explains how shareholders can take part 
and includes notes to help shareholders exercise their rights 
at the meeting.

Hikma provides for the vote on each resolution to be by poll rather

cast by proxy. The level of proxies lodged for each resolution is 
projected onto a screen as each resolution is put to the meeting. 
A ‘vote withheld’ explanation is included in the Notice.

Powers of the Directors
The powers of the Directors are determined by the Articles, the Code 
and other relevant UK legislation. The Articles give the Directors the 
power to appoint and remove Directors. The power to buy back, issue 
and allot shares contained in the Articles is subject to shareholder 
approval at each AGM. The Articles, which are available on the 
website, may only be amended by special resolution of 
the shareholders.

Substantial shareholdings
As at 31 December 2023, Hikma had been notified pursuant 
to sections 89A to 89L of the Financial Services and Markets Act 
2000 and Rule 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the 
UKLA of the following interests in the voting rights attaching to the

Our audit approach
Overview
Audit scope

 – Our audit included full scope audits of four components, an 

audit of specific financial statement line items of one additional 
component and audit procedures performed centrally over 
certain specific material balances at locations around the Group 
and over central consolidation and adjustment entities. Full scope 
components account for 81% of consolidated revenue and 68% of 
core profit before tax.

Key audit matters

 – Adequacy and appropriateness of management’s impairment 

and impairment reversal indicators assessment in respect of the 
Generic Advair Diskus® and Generics cash generating units (Group)

 – Valuation and accuracy of gross to net rebate and returns 

adjustments in the US (Group)

 – Recoverability of the carrying amounts in respect of investments 

in subsidiaries (Company)

Materiality

 – Overall Group materiality: $31 million (2022: $25 million) based 
on approximately 5% of core profit before tax (2022: based on 
approximately 5% of core profit before tax).

 – Overall Company materiality: $37.6 million (2022: $39 million) based 
on approximately 1% of total assets (2022: based on approximately 
1% of total assets).

 – Performance materiality: $23.2 million (2022: $18.75 million) (Group) 

and $28.2 million (2022: $29.2 million) (Company).

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and 
assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest 
effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These 
matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

The key audit matters below are consistent with last year.

Report on the audit of 
the financial statements

Opinion
In our opinion:

 – Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC’s Group financial statements and 

Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a 
true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of the Group’s profit and the 
Group’s cash flows for the year then ended;

 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 

accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006;

 – the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
“Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and

 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 

the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual 
Report, which comprise: the Consolidated and Company balance 
sheets as at 31 December 2023; the Consolidated income statement, 
the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
Consolidated cash flow statement and the Consolidated and 
Company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; 
and the notes to the financial statements, comprising material 
accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

Separate opinion in relation to IFRS Accounting 
Standards as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 2 to the financial statements, the Group, 
in addition to applying UK-adopted international accounting 
standards, has also applied IFRS Accounting Standards as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).

In our opinion, the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued 
by the IASB.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as 
applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit 
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in Note 7, we have provided no non-audit 
services to the Company or its controlled undertakings in the period 
under audit.

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Adequacy and appropriateness of management’s impairment and 
impairment reversal indicators assessment in respect of the Generic 
Advair Diskus® and Generics cash generating units (Group)

The group has property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) of $1,096 million (2022: 
$1,024 million) and intangible assets of $1,100 million (2022: $1,124 million). 
Management has assessed whether indicators of impairment or impairment 
reversal existed in relation to PPE and intangible assets as at 31 December 
2023, performed at the cash generating units (“CGUs”) level, being the lowest 
level at which largely independent cash inflows are generated. 

The goodwill and certain intangible assets allocated to the Generic Advair 
Diskus® and Generics CGUs were impaired in previous years. This, together 
with recent CGU performance, has resulted in these CGUs being the focus of 
our key audit matter. 

CGUs with finite life assets must be assessed for indicators of impairment at 
each reporting date. Where an impairment indicator has been identified, the 
recoverable amount of the CGU needs to be calculated to assess whether an 
impairment exists. Conversely, where there has been a sustained improvement 
in the conditions that gave rise to a prior impairment an impairment reversal 
should be recorded, other than where the impairment related to goodwill which 
cannot be reversed. Management’s assessment did not identify any indicators 
of impairment or impairment reversal.

The assessment of whether an impairment trigger has occurred requires 
exercise of judgement. The determination of whether there has been a 
sustained improvement in the conditions that gave rise to a previous 
impairment, to support an impairment reversal, also involves a significant 
degree of judgement and careful consideration. This includes, but is not limited 
to, consideration of actual performance in the year and management’s view of 
future cash flow forecasts. These forecasts are based on management’s 
expectations of external factors such as market competition, likelihood of 
regulatory product approvals and changes to regulations in addition to its own 
intentions. These impact key assumptions like market share, pricing, revenue 
growth and profit margins. 

Accordingly, the adequacy and appropriateness of management’s impairment 
and impairment reversals indicators assessment for these two CGUs was 
determined to be a key audit matter.

Refer to the Audit Committee review of areas of significant judgement, 
accounting policies (note 2), critical accounting judgements and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty (note 3), and goodwill and other intangible assets 
(note 15) and property, plant and equipment (note 16) in the Group financial 
statements.

Valuation and accuracy of gross to net rebate and returns 
adjustments in the US (Group)

Management is required to make estimates in respect of revenue recognition, 
specifically the level of returns and rebates to be realised against the Group’s 
revenue. The Group recorded significant revenue deductions for the year 
ended 31 December 2023 and determined provisions for customer rebates 
of $27 million, indirect rebates of $67 million and returns of $133 million.

In aggregate, these estimates are complex, material to the financial statements 
and require significant estimation by Directors to establish an appropriate 
provision and accordingly this was determined to be a key audit matter. 

Refer to the Audit Committee review of areas of significant judgement, 
accounting policies (note 2), critical accounting judgements and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty (note 3), trade and other receivables (note 21) and 
other current liabilities (note 27) in the Group financial statements.

We performed the following audit procedures in order to evaluate the 
reasonableness of management’s indicators assessment and their 
conclusions:

 – We reconciled the carrying values of the CGUs to underlying financial 

records and understood the constituents of the CGU;

 – We obtained management’s five-year business plan (“5YBP”) and verified 

that the 5YBP was approved by the Board;

 – We evaluated the current year performance of the CGUs against prior year 
forecasts, compared the previous 5YBP to the current year 5YBP and 
challenged management to understand the reasons for improvement in 
the performance of both CGUs;

 – We considered the changes to the 5YBP since the last formal recoverable 
value determination in 2022, focusing on changes in the forecasts with 
respect to key contributor products. 

 – We analysed the changes to forecasts for key contributor products since 

the last formal recoverable amount determination for the CGUs in 2022 to 
assess whether these changes have a material impact on the recoverable 
amounts of the CGUs in order to determine if they represent an indicator 
of impairment or impairment reversal;

 – We made enquiries of management including the commercial, regulatory 
and legal teams to further understand the key inputs and assumptions 
underpinning the forecasts for the overall CGU and in respect of key 
contributor products. We corroborated and challenged these key inputs 
and assumptions from these discussions using available third party 
data (e.g. IQVIA market intelligence, analyst reports), by inspecting 
correspondence with the regulator, and agreeing information to 
contracts; and,

 – Our internal valuation experts determined discount rate ranges for these 
CGUs. We considered the movement in these ranges since the prior year 
to identify any potential triggering events which may indicate a full 
impairment assessment is required as per IAS 36.

Based on our procedures we consider management’s conclusion that there 
are no indicators of impairment or impairment reversal to be reasonable.

We also evaluated the disclosures in note 2, note 3, note 15 and note 16 
and consider these to be appropriate.

We considered the Group’s processes for making judgements in this area 
and performed the following procedures:

 – We assessed the revenue recognition policy and applicable controls in 

place around this process;

 – We tested controls over the validation and approval of payment claims;
 – We tested returns, rebates payments and credit memos throughout the 
year by agreeing selected transactions back to the underlying source 
documentation including customer claims and payment information;
 – We confirmed channel inventory with major wholesalers or performed 

alternative procedures where confirmations were not received;

 – We developed an independent expectation or tested management’s 
process for the largest elements of the reserves at 31 December 2023 
using assumptions and inputs based on contracted prices and rebate 
terms, historical rebates, discounts, validated channel inventory levels, 
and invoices received or payments made, as applicable, subsequent to 
year-end to validate provisions. We compared this expectation to the 
actual accrual recognised by the Group; and,

 – We considered the historical accuracy of the Group’s estimates in 
previous years and the effect of any adjustments to prior years’ 
accruals in the current year’s results.

Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any material 
differences between our independent expectations and the reserves 
recorded. We also evaluated the disclosures in note 2, note 3, note 21 
and note 27 which we consider to be appropriate.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Recoverability of the carrying amounts in respect of investments 
in subsidiaries (Company)

The investments in subsidiaries of $3,303m (2022: $3,296m) are accounted for 
at cost less impairment in the Company balance sheet at 31 December 2023.

We performed the following audit procedures in relation to the carrying 
amount of investments in subsidiaries:

Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less provision for 
impairment in the Company balance sheet. Investments are tested for 
impairment if impairment indicators exist. If such indicators exist, the 
recoverable amounts of investments in subsidiaries are estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Any such impairment loss is 
recognised in the income statement.

The impairment assessment was identified as a key audit matter due to the size 
of the underlying investment carrying values at 31 December 2023. Impairment 
indicators were identified in connection with certain investments in subsidiaries 
due to the carrying value of investments exceeding the net assets of the 
underlying subsidiaries. As a result, the recoverable amount of the investments 
are determined by reference to the value in use, in order to determine the 
headroom, if any. The determination of the recoverable amount requires the 
application of management judgement and estimates, particularly in 
determining the key assumptions to be applied in preparing cash flow 
projections.

Refer to accounting policies (note 2) and investment in subsidiaries (note 4)  
in the Company financial statements.

 – We evaluated management’s assessment of whether any indicators of 
impairment existed by comparing the carrying values of investments 
in subsidiaries with the net assets of the underlying subsidiaries at 
31 December 2023;

 – For investments where the net assets were lower than the carrying values, 
we assessed their recoverable value by reference to the value in use of 
the investments compared to their carrying values at 31 December 2023. 
Where applicable, we verified that the recoverable values of investments 
were consistent with the recoverable values of the related CGUs tested for 
goodwill impairment purposes, leveraging the audit work undertaken as 
part of the Group audit; and,

 – We separately evaluated the difference between the carrying value of 
the Company’s investments in subsidiaries and the Group’s market 
capitalisation.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
arising from our work.

The impact of climate risk on our audit
As explained in the Sustainability Report, the Group is mindful of 
its impact on the environment and is focussed on ways to reduce 
climate related impacts. In planning and executing our audit we 
have considered the Group’s risk assessment process to identify 
and model the potential impact of climate change on the financial 
statements and further engaged with our own sustainability experts. 
Based on this, we understand that the key impact to the Group could 
be a potential increase in input costs for energy intensive supplies 
such as active pharmaceutical ingredients and packaging materials 
due to carbon pricing. This would impact the financial statement line 
items and estimates associated with future cash flows since the 
impact of climate change is expected to become more notable in the 
medium to long term. The key areas impacted include recoverability 
of goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets. We note that 
management’s assessment is that the impact on Hikma is currently 
immaterial, nevertheless, while auditing the estimates associated 
with the forecasts, we have challenged management on reflecting 
the impact of climate change and any climate change related 
commitments in the cash flows particularly in the context of the 
Group’s target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25% by 
2030. We have not identified any matters as part of this work which 
contradict the disclosures in the Annual Report or lead to any 
material adjustments to the financial statements.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items 
and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the 
Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry 
in which they operate.

Procedures, including oversight discussions and site visits by senior 
team members, were performed prior to year-end to refine the audit 
approach and evaluate component auditor procedures and controls 
testing. As at 31 December 2023, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC had 57 
subsidiaries and one joint venture as part of the Group. These entities 
may operate solely in one segment but more commonly operate 
across two. Each component submits a Group reporting package to 
Hikma’s central accounting team including its income statement and 
balance sheet prepared under Group accounting policies which are in 
accordance with the accounting standards. We instructed component 
teams in the US, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Algeria to audit reporting 
packages of certain entities in these territories and report to us the 
results of their full scope audit work. We also engaged our component 
team in Portugal to perform an audit over specific balances. 
In addition to instructing and reviewing the reporting from our 
component audit teams, we conducted file reviews and participated 
in key meetings with local management both remotely and in person. 
We had regular dialogue with component teams throughout the year 
and performed site visits to the US, Jordan, Algeria and Portugal. In 
addition to the work performed by our component teams, central 
audit procedures were performed by the Group engagement team 
in relation to specific material balances not covered by component 
auditors. The Group consolidation and related central consolidation 
and other adjustments, financial statement disclosures and corporate 
functions were also audited by the Group engagement team. This 
included our work over central taxation adjustments, valuation of 
goodwill and intangible assets and major transactions. Taken together, 
audit work over the full scope components and central procedures 
performed covered approximately 81% of the Group’s revenue and 
68% of the Group’s core profit before tax. In addition to the audit 
procedures noted above, we also performed disaggregated analytical 
review procedures over certain of the Group’s smaller and lower 
risk components that were not directly included in our Group audit 
scope. This provided the evidence we needed for our opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. We also 
performed a full scope audit of the Company to a separate 
Company standalone materiality.

142

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Overall materiality

$31 million (2022: $25 million).

Financial statements – Group

Financial statements – Company

$37.6 million (2022: $39 million).

How we determined it

Rationale for 
benchmark applied

Based on approximately 5% of core profit before 
tax (2022: Based on approximately 5% of core 
profit before tax)

The Group’s principal measure of earnings is core 
results. Management believes that it reflects the 
underlying performance of the Group and is a 
meaningful measure of the Group’s performance 
to stakeholders.

Based on approximately 1% of total assets (2022: 
Based on approximately 1% of total assets)

Total assets is used as the benchmark as the 
Company’s principal activity is to hold the Group’s 
investments and perform treasury functions on 
behalf of the Group.

For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a 
materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of 
materiality allocated across components was between $12 million and 
$27.5 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory 
audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low 
level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, 
we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit 
and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes 
of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample 
sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of overall 
materiality, amounting to $23.2 million (2022: $18.75 million) for the 
Group financial statements and $28.2 million (2022: $29.2 million) for 
the Company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number 
of factors – the history of misstatements, risk assessment and 
aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls – and concluded 
that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above $1.5 million (Group 
audit) (2022: $1.2 million) and $1.8 million (Company audit) (2022: 
$1.2 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, 
in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating to going concern
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting included:

 – agreeing the underlying cash flow projections to board approved 

forecasts, assessing how these forecasts are compiled, and 
assessing the accuracy of management’s forecasts;

 – evaluating the key assumptions within management’s forecasts;
 – considering liquidity and available financial resources;
 – considering compliance with covenants in the current year and 
ability to comply with these at each future covenant reporting 
date in the going concern period;

 – assessing whether the plausible downside scenario prepared by 
management appropriately considered the principal risks facing 
the business; and

 – evaluating the feasibility of management’s mitigating actions in 

the plausible downside scenario.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any 
material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually 
or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 
at least twelve months from when the financial statements are 
authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the 
directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the directors’ reporting on how they have applied the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or 
draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with 
respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of 
this report.

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual 
Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any 
form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an 
apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a 
material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing 
to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ report, we also 
considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions 
and matters as described below.

Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC
continued

Strategic report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’ 
report for the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report 
and Directors’ report.

Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Annual Report on Remuneration to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.

Corporate governance statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statements 
in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of 
the corporate governance statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect 
to the corporate governance statement as other information are 
described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have 
concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate 
governance statement, included within the Corporate Governance 
Report is materially consistent with the financial statements and our 
knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to 
add or draw attention to in relation to:

 – The directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust 

assessment of the emerging and principal risks;

 – The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal 
risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and 
an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

 – The directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements;

 – The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group’s 
and Company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers 
and why the period is appropriate; and

 – The directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable 

expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention 
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term 
viability of the Group and Company was substantially less in scope 
than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering 
the directors’ process supporting their statement; checking that the 
statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement 
is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and Company and their environment 
obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we 
have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate 
governance statement is materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

 – The directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and 
provides the information necessary for the members to assess the 
Group’s and Company’s position, performance, business model 
and strategy;

 – The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of 

effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and

 – The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit 

Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report 
when the directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by 
the auditors.

Responsibilities for the financial statements 
and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the financial statements, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the 
applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control 
as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance 
with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements 
in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our 
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, 
is detailed below.

144

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified 
that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations 
related to patent protection, product safety (including but not limited 
to the United States Food and Drug Administration regulations), 
competition and antitrust laws, pricing practices and legislation, and 
anti-bribery and corruption legislation (including but not limited to the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and we considered the extent to which 
non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial 
statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have 
a direct impact on the financial statements such as applicable tax 
legislation, the Companies Act 2006 and Listing Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA). We evaluated management’s incentives and 
opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements 
(including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the 
principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries 
to manipulate financial results and management bias in accounting 
estimates. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment 
with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate 
audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit 
procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or 
component auditors included:

 – discussions with management and the Group’s legal counsel, 
including consideration of known or suspected instances of 
non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud;

 – assessment of matters reported on the Group’s whistleblowing 

hotline and results of management’s investigation of such matters;

 – challenging assumptions made by management in its significant 
accounting estimates particularly in relation to estimation of 
rebate and returns provisions, and recoverability of intangible 
assets (see related key audit matters above); and

 – identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal 

entries posted with unusual account combinations and 
consolidation journals.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described 
above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to 
events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, 
the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher 
than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional 
misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of 
certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing 
techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number 
of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will 
often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size 
or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to 
enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which 
the sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description  
forms part of our auditors’ report.

Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.

Other required reporting

Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:

 – we have not obtained all the information and explanations we 

require for our audit; or

 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, 

or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or

 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 

are not made; or

 – the Company financial statements and the part of the Annual 
Report on Remuneration to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were 
appointed by the members on 11 May 2016 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 and subsequent 
financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement 
is eight years, covering the years ended 31 December 2016 to 
31 December 2023.

Other matter
In due course, as required by the Financial Conduct Authority 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, these financial 
statements will form part of the ESEF-prepared annual financial report 
filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the Financial Conduct 
Authority in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard 
(‘ESEF RTS’). This auditors’ report provides no assurance over whether 
the annual financial report will be prepared using the single electronic 
format specified in the ESEF RTS.

financial statements  

1. Adoption of new and revised standards 

The following new and revised standards and interpretations have been 
issued and are effective for annual periods beginning on 1 January 2023.

Insurance Contracts  

IAS 1 (Amendments) 

IAS 8 (Amendments) 

IAS 12 (Amendments)

Income Taxes – deferred tax related to

IAS 1 amendments had an impact on the Group’s disclosures of 
accounting policies, but did not impact the measurement, recognition or 
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. The other new and 
revised standards and interpretations had no significant impact on the 
consolidated financial statements but may impact the accounting for 
future transactions and arrangements. 

The standards and interpretations that had been issued but were not 
mandatory for annual reporting periods ending on 31 December 2023 
were not early adopted. The Group doesn’t expect any significant impact 
from applying these standards and interpretations. 

2. Accounting policies 

General information 
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC is a public limited liability company 
incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies 
Act 2006. The address of the registered office is stated on page 202. 

The Group’s principal activities are the development, manufacturing, 
marketing and selling of a broad range of generic, branded generic and 
in-licensed patented pharmaceutical products in solid, semi-solid, liquid 
and injectable final dosage forms. 

Basis of preparation  
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC’s consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting 
Standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as 
applicable to companies reporting under those standards. The 
consolidated financial statements also fully comply with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (”IFRS Accounting Standards”). 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, except for the revaluation to fair value of 
certain financial assets and liabilities.  

The accounting policies included in this note have been applied 
consistently other than where new policies have been adopted. 

The Group’s previously published consolidated financial statements were 
also prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting 
standards, the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and were fully 
compliant with the IFRS Accounting Standards. 

The presentational currency of the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements is the US dollar as the majority of the Group’s business is 
conducted in US dollars. 

Going concern 
The Directors believe that the Group is well diversified due to its 
geographic spread, product diversity and large customer and supplier 
base. Taking into account the Group’s current position and its principal 
risks for a period longer than 12 months from the date of signing the 
consolidated financial statement, a going concern analysis has been 
prepared using realistic scenarios applying a severe but plausible 
downside which shows sufficient liquidity headroom. Therefore, the 
Directors believe that the Group and its subsidiaries are adequately 
placed to manage their business and financing risks successfully, despite 
the current uncertain economic outlook. Having assessed the principal 
risks, the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
(See page 75). 

Financial covenants are suspended while the Group retains its 
investment grade status from two rating agencies1. As of 31 December 
2023, the Group’s investment grade rating was affirmed by S&P and Fitch. 

1. 

 Rating agencies: means each of Fitch, Moody’s and S&P or any of their affiliates or successors  

Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Hikma 
Pharmaceuticals PLC (the Company) and entities controlled by the 
Company (together, the Group).  

All subsidiaries and the Company’s financial statements are consolidated 
up to 31 December each year. 

Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition 
method. All identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. All 
acquisition-related costs are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement as incurred. 

The consideration is measured at the aggregate fair values of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by 
the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. 
Where applicable, this consideration may include the fair value of assets 
or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. 

Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability is a financial 
instrument and, within the scope of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, is 
measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the 
consolidated income statement in line with IFRS 9. 

Subsequent changes to those fair values can only affect the measurement 
of goodwill, where they occur during the ‘measurement period’ and are as 
a result of additional information becoming available about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. All other changes are 
dealt with in accordance with relevant IFRS Accounting Standards. This will 
usually mean that changes in the fair value of consideration are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement. 

Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially 
measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of consideration, 
non-controlling interest and any fair value of previously held equity 
interest over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. If, after 
reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and acquired contingent liabilities exceeds 
the cost of the consideration, the gain is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated income statement. 

The non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the 
non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, 
liabilities and acquired contingent liabilities recognised.

2. Accounting policies continued 

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the 
end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group 
reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is 
incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, 
to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that 
existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the 
amounts recognised as of that date. 

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition 
to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject 
to a maximum of one year. 

Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised in the consolidated income statement when 
control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to 
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The point at which 
control passes is determined by each customer arrangement, but 
generally occurs on delivery to the customer. 

The Group has generally concluded that it acts as principal in its revenue 
arrangements because it typically controls the goods before the transfer  
to the customer. 

The Group manufactures certain medicines on behalf of some 
customers. The revenue from providing contract manufacturing services 
is recognised when these medicines are approved by the quality control 
department, there is no alternative use of these medicines and the 
Group has enforceable right to payments. 

Revenue represents the amounts receivable after the deduction 
of discounts, value added tax, other sales taxes, allowances given, 
provisions for chargebacks, accruals for estimated future rebates, 
returns and price adjustments. The methodology and assumptions 
used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored and adjusted 
regularly in light of contractual and historical information. 

The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period 
between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer 
and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the 
Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for time value of money.  

Variable consideration 
The ultimate net selling price is calculated using variable consideration 
estimates for certain gross to net adjustments.  

Chargebacks 
In the US, the Group sells its products directly to wholesale distributors, 
generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains and mail-order pharmacies. 
The Group also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies, 
managed care organisations, hospitals, and group purchasing 
organisations, collectively referred to as ‘indirect customers’. The Group 
enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing 
for certain products. The indirect customers then independently 
select a wholesaler from which they purchase the products at agreed-
upon prices. The Group will provide credit to the wholesaler for the 
difference between the agreed-upon price with the indirect customer 
and the wholesaler’s invoice price. This credit is called a chargeback. 
The provision for chargebacks is based on historical sell-through levels 
by the Group’s wholesale customers to the indirect customers, and 
estimated wholesaler inventory levels. As sales are made to large 
wholesale customers, the Group continually monitors the provision for 
chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes that actual 
chargebacks may differ from estimated reserves. 

152

Returns 
The Group has a product return policy that allows customers to return 
the product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the 
expiration date. Provisions for returns are recognised as a reduction of 
revenue in the period in which the underlying sales are recognised. 

The Group estimates its provision for returns based on historical 
experience, representing management’s best estimate. While such 
experience has enabled reasonable estimations in the past, history 
may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns. The Group 
continually monitors the provisions for returns and makes adjustments 
when it believes that actual product returns may differ from established 
reserves (see Note 27 for return sensitivity analysis). 

Rebates  
In the US, rebates are granted to wholesaler distributors and direct 
customers. Rebates are also granted to healthcare authorities and certain 
indirect customers under contractual arrangements. Products sold in the 
US are covered by various programmes (such as Medicaid) under which 
products are sold at a discount.  

The Group estimates its provision for rebates based on current 
contractual terms and conditions as well as historical experience, 
changes to business practices and credit terms. While such experience 
has enabled reasonable estimations in the past, history may not always 
be an accurate indicator of future rebate liabilities. The Group continually 
monitors the provisions for rebates and makes adjustments when it 
believes that actual rebates may differ from established reserves. 
All rebates are recognised in the period in which the underlying sales 
are recognised as a reduction of revenue (see Notes 21 and 27 for rebates 
sensitivity analysis). 

Performance obligation  
Free goods 
Free goods are issued to certain customers as an alternative to discounts. 
These free goods give rise to a separate performance obligation, which 
requires management to allocate the transaction price to the original 
goods and the related free goods. Revenue for free goods is recognised 
when they are transferred to the customer and a contract liability is 
recognised when the free goods are due but not yet transferred to 
the customer. 

Share-based payments (Note 37) 
At the Company’s discretion and subject to the achievement of Group 
and personal performance criteria in the prior year, employees 
(including Executive Directors) of the Group receive performance-based 
remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees 
render their services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-
settled transactions) under 2014 Executive Incentive Plans (EIP), the 
2009 and 2018 Management Incentive Plan (MIP) or the deferred bonus 
shares awards introduced within the 2023 Incentive Policy.  

Additionally, a new Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced 
under the 2023 Incentive Policy, which represents a performance share 
plan with performance measured over certain non-market and market 
conditions in future years. 

The cost of share-based payments’ transactions with employees for the 
EIP, MIP and deferred bonus shares awards is measured by reference to 
the fair value at the date at which the share-based awards are granted. 
Fair value is determined based on the share price as at the date of grant 
discounted by dividend yield. The cost of share-based payments for 
these share awards is recognised, together with a corresponding increase 
in equity, on a straight-line basis over the year of performance and the 
vesting period after the grant date. 

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2023 
 
2. Accounting policies continued 

The cost of share-based payments’ transactions with employees under 
the LTIP is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which 
the share-based payments are granted. Fair value is determined based 
on Monte Carlo methodology for the market condition portion. For non-
market conditions, fair value is determined based on the share price at 
the date of the grant, no discounting for dividend yield is applied as 
participants will receive the benefit of dividends paid during the vesting 
period in the form of additional shares. The cost is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period after the grant date. 

The Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest, and the impact of the revision of the original estimates 
(except for the portion related to a market vesting condition), if any, 
is recognised in the consolidated income statement, such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity reserves.  

The dilutive effect of outstanding share-based payments is reflected in the 
computation of diluted earnings per share.  

Taxes (Note 12) 
The Group provides for income tax according to the laws and regulations 
prevailing in the countries where the Group operates. Furthermore, the 
Group computes and records deferred tax assets and liabilities according 
to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’.  

The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax in the current 
period and deferred tax.  

Current Income Tax  
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities within 
one year.  

The current tax incurred in the period is based on taxable profit for the 
year and prior year movement accounted for in the current year. Taxable 
profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s tax incurred is calculated using 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
consolidated balance sheet date.  

Deferred tax  
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the 
consolidated balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
will reverse. To the extent the temporary difference arises from goodwill 
or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of 
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit and at the time of the transaction does 
not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences, 
no deferred tax is provided.  

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries, and interests in joint ventures, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled, or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the consolidated income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to 
equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt within equity.  

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.  

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
consolidated balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all 
or part of the asset to be recovered.  

Mandatory temporary exception 
The Group has applied the temporary exception issued by the IASB in 
May 2023 from the accounting requirements for deferred taxes in IAS 12. 
Accordingly, the Group neither recognises nor discloses information about 
deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. 

Uncertain tax position  
In line with IFRIC 23, if it is considered probable that a tax authority will 
accept an uncertain tax treatment, the tax charge should be calculated 
on that basis. If it is not considered probable, the effect of the uncertainty 
should be estimated and reflected in the tax charge. In assessing the 
uncertainty, it is assumed that the tax authority will have full knowledge of 
all information related to the matter. 

Exceptional items and other adjustments (Note 6) 
We use a number of non-IFRS measures to report and monitor the 
performance of our business. Management uses these adjusted numbers 
internally to measure our progress and for setting performance targets. 
We also present these numbers, alongside our reported results, to 
external audiences to help them understand the underlying performance 
of our business. Our adjusted numbers may be calculated differently to 
other companies. 

Adjusted measures are not substitutable for IFRS numbers and should 
not be considered superior to results presented in accordance with IFRS 
Accounting Standards.  

Core results 
Reported results represent the Group’s overall performance. However, 
these results can include one-off or non-cash items that mask the 
underlying performance of the Group. To provide a more complete 
picture of the Group’s performance and to improve comparability of our 
consolidated financial statements to external audiences, we provide, 
alongside our reported results, core results, which are a non-IFRS 
measure. We represent and discuss our Group and segmental financials 
reconciled between reported and core results. This presentation allows 
for full visibility and transparency of our financials so that shareholders 
are able to clearly assess the performance factors of the Group.  

Core results mainly exclude: 

– 
– 

– 

– 

Amortisation of intangible assets other than software 
Impairment charge/reversal of intangible assets and property, plant 
and equipment 
Finance income and expense resulting from remeasurement and 
unwinding of contingent consideration and co-development 
earnout payment agreement financial liabilities 
Exceptional items which management believes to be exceptional in 
nature by virtue of their size or incidence, or have a distortive effect 
on current year earnings, such as costs associated with business 
combinations, one-off gains and losses on disposal of businesses, 
legal expenses, reorganisation costs and any exceptional items 
related to tax such as significant tax benefit/expense associated 
with previously unrecognised deferred tax assets/liabilities 

Our core results exclude the exceptional items and other adjustments 
set out in Note 6 in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

2. Accounting policies continued 

Intangible assets (Note 15) 
Intangible assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. 

The assets other than goodwill are amortised on a straight-line basis and 
the amortisation expense is recognised in the selling, general and 
administrative expenses. 

Judgement is used to assess the degree of certainty attached to the flow 
of future economic benefits that are attributable to the use of the asset 
on the basis of the evidence available at the time of initial recognition, 
giving greater weight to external evidence. 

Expenditures on research and development activities are charged to 
the consolidated income statement, except only when the criteria for 
recognising an internally generated intangible asset is met, which 
is usually when approval from the relevant regulatory authority is 
considered probable. 

Also, the Group engages with third-party research and development 
companies to develop products on its behalf. Substantial payments 
made to such third parties to fund research and development efforts 
are recognised as intangible assets if the capitalisation criteria for an 
intangible asset are met, typically when licences are acquired and certain 
milestones are met. All other expenditures are charged to the 
consolidated income statement. 

Principal intangible assets are: 

(a) Goodwill 

(b) Product related intangibles: 

(i)  Product files and in-licensed products recognised through 

acquisitions and partnerships are amortised over their useful 
economic lives once the asset is ready for use  

(ii)  In-process product files recognised on acquisition are amortised 
over the useful economic life once the asset is ready for use 

(c) Purchased software: is amortised over the useful economic life when 

the asset is ready for use 

Other identified intangibles are: 

(d) Customer relationships: represent the value attributed to the long-
term relationships held with existing customers that the Group 
acquired on business combinations. Customer relationships are 
amortised over their useful economic lives  

(e) Trade names: are amortised over their useful lives from the date 

of acquisition 

(f)  Marketing rights: are amortised over their useful lives commencing 

in the year in which the rights first generate sales 

A unit of production method of depreciation is applied to operations in 
their start-up phase, as this reflects the expected pattern of consumption 
of the future economic benefits embodied in the assets. When these 
assets are fully utilised, a straight-line method of depreciation is applied. 

Projects under construction are carried at cost, less any recognised 
impairment loss. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other 
property, plant and equipment assets, commences when the assets are 
ready for their intended use. 

Any additional costs that extend the useful life of property, plant and 
equipment are capitalised. 

Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant 
and equipment 
At the same time each year, the Group carries out an impairment review 
for goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use as follows: 

(a) Goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units. 
These cash-generating units are tested for impairment annually, or 
more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be 
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less 
than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
unit and then to the other assets of the unit prorata on the basis of 
the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.  

(b) Intangible assets that are not yet ready for use are not subject to 

amortisation and are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.  

The Group also reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets that are subject to depreciation and 
amortisation to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss (if any). 

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less 
than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the consolidated income statement. 

When an impairment loss for the asset, other than goodwill, subsequently 
reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount. However, the increased carrying 
amount should not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had there been no impairment in prior years. A reversal of 
an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement. 

Leases (Note 17) 
In accordance with IFRS 16, the Group applies a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make 
lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the 
underlying assets:  

Details of the intangible assets useful lives are included in Note 15. 

– 

Property, plant and equipment (Note 16) 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost on acquisition and are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis except for land. 

The normal expected useful lives of the major categories of Property, 
plant and equipment are: 

Buildings 

Machinery and equipment  

Vehicles, fixtures and equipment 

20 to 50 years 

3 to 20 years 

3 to 13 years 

Right-of-use assets: The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is 
available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for 
any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets 
includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs 
incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement 
date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is 
reasonably certain of obtaining ownership of a leased asset at the end 
of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and 
the lease term

information and recent financing rounds. For investments in listed shares, 
fair value is readily determinable under level 1 valuation, see Note 29. 

(iii) Financial assets at amortised cost  
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as ‘financial assets at amortised cost’.  

For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified 
approach in calculating expected credit loss. Therefore, the Group does 
not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance 
based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. 
The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its 
historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors 
specific to the debtors and the economic environment. 

Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified in two categories: financial liabilities 
at FVTPL or financial debts measured at amortised cost representing loans 
and borrowings. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of 
the financial liabilities and is determined at the time of initial recognition. 

(i) Financial liabilities at FVTPL (Notes 27 and 30) 
The Group currently has two financial liabilities at FVTPL as below: 

– 

– 

co-development and earn out payment agreements with third 
parties where the Group received payments on certain research 
and development milestones. In return for receiving such milestone 
payments, the Group has agreed to pay the contracting parties a 
certain percentage of future sales of those products 
contingent consideration arising from the Columbus business 
acquisition represents contractual liabilities to make payments to 
third parties in the form of milestone payments that are dependent 
on the achievement of certain US FDA approval milestones; and 
payments based on future sales of certain products 

These financial liabilities are recorded under other current liabilities and 
other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  

(ii) Financial debts 
Financial debts are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction 
costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. 

Cash dividend  
The Company recognises a liability to pay a dividend when the 
distribution is authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company. 
In accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom, a final dividend is 
recognised when it is approved by the majority of shareholders and an 
interim dividend is recognised when it is paid. 

2. Accounting policies continued 

– 

– 

Lease liabilities: at the commencement date of the lease, the Group 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease 
payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments 
include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), 
less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that 
depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid 
under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include 
the exercise price of a purchase option, payments for optional 
extension periods and payments of penalties for terminating a lease 
when these options are reasonably certain to be exercised by the 
Group. The discount rate used to calculate the lease liabilities is the 
incremental borrowing rate (IBR). The Group estimates the IBR 
using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when 
available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates 
(such as the subsidiary’s stand-alone credit profile)  
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets: the Group applies 
the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases 
of machinery and equipment (i.e. those leases that have a lease 
term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do 
not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value 
assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are 
considered of low value (i.e. below $5,000). Lease payments on 
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised 
as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term 

Inventories (Note 20) 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Purchased products are stated at acquisition cost including all additional 
attributable costs incurred in bringing each product to its present 
location and condition. The costs of own-manufactured products 
comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and 
any overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. In the consolidated balance sheet, 
inventory is primarily valued at historical cost determined on a moving 
average basis, and this value is used to determine the cost of sales in the 
consolidated income statement.  

Provisions (Note 26) 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal 
or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation. 

Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
consolidated balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 

Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following 
measurement categories: 

(i) Financial assets at FVTPL (Note 23) 
Include listed shares, debt instruments and investment portfolios held by 
the Group that are traded in an active market and are mostly designated 
as being measured at fair value through profit or loss. Gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. 

(ii) Financial assets at FVTOCI (Note 19) 
The Group irrevocably choses to designate certain investments as 
financial assets at FVTOCI as they mainly are venture capital investments 
and are not held for trading. Investments in unlisted shares are measured 
using a level 3 fair value which is based on cost and adjusted as necessary 
for impairment and revaluations with reference to relevant available 

155

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  
continued 

– 

For previously impaired assets, an assessment is made at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that 
previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have 
decreased, if such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s 
or CGU’s recoverable amount 

Based on the annual impairment trigger assessment and impairment 
testing for other intangible assets, the Group has not identified any 
material impairment on an individual asset basis, that may have 
significant risk resulting in a material adjustment to their carrying 
amounts within the next financial year.  

Taxation (Note 12) 
Tax and transfer pricing audit risk 
Critical judgement 
In common with most international organisations, the Group is subject 
to tax and transfer pricing audits from tax authorities from time to time. 
Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable 
estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made, management 
provides for its best estimate of the liability in line with IFRIC 23 principles. 
These estimates take into account the specific circumstances of each 
dispute and relevant external advice, and are inherently judgemental in 
nature and could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and 
each dispute progresses. The Group regularly takes professional advice 
to ensure the risks are appropriately analysed and managed with any 
ultimate potential liability being adequately provided, and continues to 
invest in its financial systems to improve the quality of the Group’s 
financial data which reduces the risk of an adverse tax authority audit. 

As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s uncertain tax positions amounted 
to $59 million (2022: $50 million) (Note 12), while it is not practical to 
provide a sensitivity analysis due to the number of uncertain tax positions 
held and the number of jurisdictions to which these relate, the Group 
reviews material uncertain tax positions on an individual basis and believes 
that it has accounted for an adequate provision for the liabilities likely to 
arise from open assessments and audits and continues to re-evaluate 
existing uncertain positions to determine if a change in facts and 
circumstances has occurred that would make it necessary to adjust. 

Contingent liabilities 
The promotion, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products and 
medical devices are highly regulated and the operations of market 
participants, such as the Group, are closely supervised by regulatory 
authorities and law enforcement agencies, including the FDA and 
the US Department of Justice. As a result, the Group is subject to 
certain investigations by governmental agencies, as well as other 
various legal proceedings considered typical to its business relating to 
employment, product liability and commercial disputes which may result 
in a possible obligation depending on whether some uncertain future 
event occurs in relation to legal proceedings and/or governmental 
agencies investigations. 

It is the Group’s policy to provide for amounts related to these legal 
matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount 
is reasonably estimable. 

A contingent liability is not provided for and disclosed in Note 36 if: 

– 

– 

payment is not probable where the Group denies having engaged 
in conduct that would give rise to liability with respect to these civil 
suits and is vigorously pursuing defence of legal proceedings, or 
it is a present obligation but the amount cannot be measured reliably 

3. Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty 

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described 
in Note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements and estimates 
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. The estimates are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

The estimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if 
the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and 
future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.  

The Group’s Directors believe that the following accounting policies that 
involve Directors’ judgements and estimates are the most critical and 
might result in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year. 

Revenue recognition estimate (Notes 4 and 5) 
The Group’s revenue recognition policies require Directors to make 
estimates of the net selling price, which is complicated due to chargebacks, 
product returns and rebates, which together are considered to be a critical 
estimate that might result in a material adjustment. 

These arrangements vary by product arrangement and buying group. 
Refer to Notes 21 and 27 for sensitivity analysis. 

Chargebacks 
Critical estimates 
The key inputs and assumptions included in calculating this provision are 
estimations of ‘in channel’ inventory at the wholesalers (including 
processing lag), estimated chargeback rates as informed by average 
historical chargeback credits adjusted for expected chargeback levels for 
new products, changes to pricing and estimated future sales trends 
(including customer mix). Refer to Note 21 for sensitivity analysis. 

Returns 
Critical estimates  
The key assumptions included in calculating this provision are 
estimations of the product shelf life, returns rate for revenue subject to 
returns, as informed by both historical return rates and consideration of 
specific factors like product dating and expiration, new product launches, 
entrance of new competitors and changes to contractual terms. Refer to 
Note 27 for sensitivity analysis. 

Rebates 
Critical estimates  
The key inputs and assumptions included in estimating this provision are 
the historical relationship between contractual rebate payments to 
revenue, past payment experience, changes to pricing and sales levels, 
estimation of ‘in channel’ inventory at the wholesalers and retail 
pharmacies and estimated future sales trends (including customer mix). 
Refer to Notes 21 and 27 for sensitivity analysis. 

Intangible assets – impairment testing (Note 15) 
Critical judgement 
– 

Determining whether an impairment indication has occurred for 
individual intangible assets or group of assets. In such case, the 
Group assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether it is 
more likely than not that the recoverable value of the intangible 
asset or group of assets is less than its carrying amount as a basis for 
determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative 
impairment test.

5. Business segments 

For management reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three principal operating divisions – Injectables, Branded and Generics. 
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its segmental information. (See business and financial review section on page 26 for more 
details on the business segments performance) 

Core operating profit, defined as ‘segment result’, is the principal measure used in the decision-making and resource allocation process of the 
chief operating decision maker, who is the Group’s Chief Executive Officer.

Impairment and costs in relation to halted operations in Sudan: In April 2023, violent conflict erupted in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. The 
conflict has since been escalating in other areas of the country. The Group has evaluated the effect on the carrying values of the Group's assets, 
and as a consequence, a loss of $76m was recognised to reflect the fall in the recoverable amount of the assets listed below. A further $7 million 
of employee benefits, hyperinflation and other expenses from the halted operations have been classified as exceptional items on the basis that 
no revenue was generated after the operations were halted.

Provision for legal settlements: On 1 February 2024, the Group reached an agreement in principle to resolve the vast majority of the opioid related 
cases brought against Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. by US states, their subdivisions, and tribal nations. The agreed upon settlement is not an 
admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. The Group booked a total provision of $129 million to cover the expected settlement amount for all 
related cases in North America (Notes 26 and 41) 
Intangible assets amortisation other than software of $88 million (Note 15) 
Impairment charge on intangible assets: $32 million mainly comprise $11 million in relation to product related intangible assets as a result of 
the decline in performance and forecasted profitability and $16 million marketing rights due the termination of business development contracts. 
Additionally, $5 million of impairment charge relates to software (Notes 9 and 15) 
Impairment charge on property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets: $8 million of impairment charge mainly relates to a leased 
property with no future plans of utilisation (Notes 9, 16 and 17) 
Remeasurement of contingent consideration and other financial liability: $2 million represents the finance expense resulting from the valuation of 
the liabilities associated with the future contingent payments in respect of contingent consideration recognised through business combinations 
and the financial liability in relation to the co-development earnout payment agreement (Notes 11, 27, 29 and 30) 
Unwinding of contingent consideration and other financial liability: $3 million represents the finance expense resulting from the unwinding 
of contingent consideration recognised through business combinations and the financial liability in relation to the co-development earnout 
payment agreement (Notes 11, 27, 29 and 30)

UK corporation tax is calculated at 23.5% blended rate (2022: 19.0%). 

The Group incurred a tax expense of $89 million (2022: $42 million), the reported and core effective tax rates are 31.7% and 20.9% respectively (2022: 18.0% 
and 21.3% respectively). The reported effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate due to the exceptional items related to Sudan. 

Taxation for all jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdiction. 

The charge for the year can be reconciled to profit before tax per the consolidated income statement as follows:  

Profit before tax 

Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 23.5% (2022: 19.00%) 

Profits taxed at different rates 

Permanent differences: 
–  Non-deductible expenditure 
–  Other permanent differences

Profits taxed at different tax rates relate to profits arising in overseas jurisdictions where the tax rate differs from the UK statutory rate. Permanent 
differences relate to items which are non-taxable or for which no tax relief is ever likely to be due. The major items are expenses and income disallowed 
where they are covered by statutory exemptions, foreign exchange differences in some territories and statutory reliefs such as research and development.  

The exceptional costs associated with the halted operations in Sudan mainly comprise tax on permanent differences of $24 million and unrecognised 
deferred tax assets of $12 million on the basis that the Group does not consider it probable that tax deductions can be realised on these temporary 
differences for local tax purposes. 

Rate change, tax losses and other deductible temporary differences for which no benefit is recognised include items for which it is not appropriate 
to recognise deferred tax. 

The change in the uncertain tax positions relates to the balance the Group holds in the event a revenue authority successfully takes an adverse view 
of the positions adopted by the Group in 2023 and prior years. As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s uncertain tax positions amounted to $59 million 
(2022: $50 million). The Group released $13 million in 2023 (2022: $3 million) primarily due to the resolution of some audits with the relevant tax 
authorities and released $nil (2022: $2 million) following closure of tax audit with no final tax adjustments required by the relevant tax authorities, 
this was offset by new provisions and updates of $22 million booked in 2023 (2022: $15 million) arising from new and ongoing tax audits. There was 
no impact from the currency exchange difference in 2023 (2022: $1 million reduction to the aggregate balance). If all areas of uncertainty were audited 
and all areas resulted in an adverse outcome, management does not believe any material additional tax would be payable beyond what is provided. 

Prior year adjustments include differences between the tax liability recorded in the tax returns submitted for previous years and the estimated tax 
provision reported in a prior year’s consolidated financial statements. This category also includes adjustments to the tax returns against which an 
adverse uncertain tax position has been booked and included under ‘change in uncertain tax positions’ above.

12. Tax continued 

Tax contingent liabilities 
Due to the Group operating across a number of different tax jurisdictions, it is subject to periodic challenge by local tax authorities on a range of 
tax matters arising in the normal course of business. These challenges generally include transfer pricing arrangements, other international tax matters 
and the judgemental interpretation of local tax legislation. 

A tax contingent liability is not provided for and disclosed if: 

– 
– 

tax payments are not probable in the future on challenges by tax authorities; or 
it is a present tax obligation, but the amount cannot be measured reliably 

Publication of tax strategy 
In line with the UK requirement for large UK businesses to publish their tax strategy, the Group’s tax strategy has been made available on the 
Group’s website. 

Global minimum tax – Pillar Two  
Pillar Two legislation has been enacted, or substantively enacted, in certain jurisdictions where the Group operates. The legislation will be effective for 
the Group’s financial year beginning 1 January 2024. The Group is in scope of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation and has performed an 
assessment of the Group’s potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes for the year ending on 31 December 2024.  

The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the most recent information available regarding the financial 
performance of the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment, the Group has identified potential exposure to Pillar Two income 
taxes in respect of profits earned in the UAE. The potential exposure comes from the constituent entities (mainly operating subsidiaries) in these 
jurisdictions where the expected Pillar Two effective tax rate is below 15%. Starting in 2024, the Group’s core effective tax rate guidance reflects Pillar 
Two impact which contributed to an increase of 2 to 3 percentage points. Further factors such as the proportion of profit before tax, revenues, costs, 
and foreign currency exchange rates have been considered in the guidance for the core effective tax rate in 2024. 

The Group is continuing to assess the impact of the Pillar Two income taxes legislation on its future financial performance. 

Deferred tax 
Recognition of deferred tax assets  
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based on the current forecast of taxable profits arising in the jurisdiction in which the deferred tax asset arises. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that there are forecast taxable profits within a reasonable period.  

This exercise is reviewed each year and, to the extent forecasts change, an adjustment to the recognised deferred tax asset may be made. 

Recognition of deferred tax assets is driven by the Group’s ability to utilise the deferred tax asset which is reliant on forecast taxable profits arising in 
the jurisdiction in which losses are incurred. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset only where it is appropriate to do so. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances

The Group has a potential deferred tax asset of $288 million (2022: $246 million), of which $226 million (2022: $192 million) has been recognised. 

No deferred tax asset has been recognised on gross temporary differences totalling $288 million (2022: $223 million), with a tax effect of $62 million 
mainly due to the unpredictability of the related future profit streams. $200 million (2022: $195 million) of these gross temporary differences relate to 
losses, of which $183 million are UK losses that don’t expire. No deferred tax is recognised against the losses due to significant uncertainty regarding 
future taxable income forecasts in the relevant jurisdictions. None of the non-UK losses are expected to expire in 2024. The remaining $88 million 
represent other unrecognised gross short-term temporary differences that relate to multiple jurisdictions. 

During the year a reduction in the deferred tax liability has been recognised on temporary differences relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries of $1 million (2022: reduction of $4 million). No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the remaining unremitted earnings of 
$414 million (2022: $294 million), as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 

Other deferred taxes mainly relate to property, plant and equipment, temporary differences related to Sudan as well as the difference between book 
and tax bases in relation to the research and development expenditures.  

Mandatory temporary exception 
The Group has applied the temporary exception issued by the IASB in May 2023 from the accounting requirements for deferred taxes in IAS 12. 
Accordingly, the Group neither recognises nor discloses information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

The proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2023 is 47 cents (2022: 37 cents).  

The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2024 and has not been included as a 
liability in these consolidated financial statements. Based on the number of shares in free issue at 31 December 2023 (221,081,371), the final dividend 
would be $104 million. 

14. Earnings per share (EPS) 

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in free 
issue during the year after deducting Treasury shares (Note 31). Treasure shares have no right to receive dividends.  

Diluted EPS is calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares used in the basic EPS calculation for the conversion of all 
potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares.  

Core basic and diluted EPS are intended to highlight the core results of the Group before exceptional items and other adjustments.

In accordance with the Group policy, goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or more frequently if there are indicators that 
goodwill may be impaired. The impairment test was performed by calculating the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated, 
based on discounted cash flows by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flows under which 
these CGUs sit. These values are then compared to the carrying value of the CGUs to determine whether an impairment is required.

Terminal growth rates 

Discount rates 

Determination of assumptions  

Growth rates are internal forecasts based on both internal and external market information, 
informed by historical experience and management’s best estimates of the future 

Margins reflect past experience, adjusted for expected changes in the future 
Establishing the launch date and probability of a successful product approval for 
pipeline products  

Terminal growth rates are based on the Group’s experience in its markets 

Discount rates for each CGU are derived from specific regions/countries 

Period of specific projected cash flows  5 years 

The valuation did not result in any impairment for the CGUs and indicated that sufficient headroom exists even under reasonable changes in 
key assumptions.  

The Group monitors the development of climate related risks and assessed the qualitative and quantitative impact which is not expected to have 
a material impact on the consolidated financial statements nor the recoverable amount of the CGUs (See page 56).  

Product-related intangible assets 
Product rights not yet available for use 
Product rights not yet available for use amounts to $75 million (2022: $22 million), no amortisation has been charged against them. The Group 
performs an impairment review of these assets annually. The result of this test was an impairment charge of $3 million in the Generics segment mainly 
due to the high risk of obtaining regulatory approval for a certain product (2022: $8 million in the Injectables segment). 

Product rights 
Product rights consists of marketed products of $469 million (2022: $535 million) which includes one product in the injectables CGU of $129 million 
(2022: $140 million) that has a remaining useful life of twelve years (2022: thirteen years), in addition to generic Advair Diskus® of $87 million (2022: 
$97 million) that has a remaining useful life of eight years (2022: nine years). The product rights have an average estimated useful life of twelve years. 

The Group performs impairment indicators assessment for definite life intangible assets, if any indicator exists, the Group reconsiders the asset’s 
estimated economic benefit, calculates the recoverable value of the individual assets or asset group’s cash flows and compares such value against the 
individual asset’s or asset group’s carrying amount. If the carrying amount is greater, the Group records an impairment loss for the excess of book value 
over the recoverable value. As at 31 December 2023, the result of this testing was an impairment charge of $10 million (2022: $64 million). 

Software  
Software intangibles mainly represent the Enterprise Resource Planning solutions that are being implemented in different operations across the Group 
in addition to other software applications, of which $1 million is not yet available for use (2022: $9 million). The software has an average estimated 
useful life that varies from three to ten years. 

Following a review of impairment indicators for software as at 31 December 2023, an impairment charge of $5 million was recognised (2022: $1 million). 

Other identified intangibles 
Other identified intangibles comprise marketing rights, customer relationships and trade names of $137 million (2022: $135 million) of which $76 million 
represent assets not yet available for use (2022: $58 million). The Group performs an impairment review of other identified intangible assets that are 
not yet available for use annually, and performs impairment indicators assessment for assets in use. The result of this test was an impairment charge 
of $17 million mainly in the Injectables and Generics segments due to the discontinuation of certain marketing rights (2022: $29 million).  

Marketing rights  
Marketing rights are amortised over their useful lives commencing in the year in which the rights are ready for use with estimated useful lives varying 
from two to ten years. 

Customer relationships 
Customer relationships represent the value attributed to existing direct customers that the Group acquired on the acquisition of subsidiaries. 
The customer relationships have an average estimated useful life of fifteen years.

Investments at FVTOCI mainly include venture capital investments which are not held for trading and which the Group has irrevocably designated as 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.  

During the year, the Group sold one of its investments, invested in four new ventures and increased investment in three existing ones. 

The total portfolio as at 31 December 2023 includes two investments in listed companies with a readily determinable fair value that falls under level 1 
valuation (Note 29), their values are measured based on quoted prices in active markets. The other investments are unlisted shares without readily 
determinable fair values that fall under level 3 valuation (Note 29). The fair value is estimated by management based on the cost of investment and 
adjusted as necessary for impairment and revaluations with reference to relevant available information and recent financing rounds.  

During the year, the total change in fair value was a net loss of $13 million (2022: $8 million loss) recognised in other comprehensive income. 

Advance payment related to non-financial asset represents cash advanced for settlement mainly in future product licenses. 

Restricted cash represents the cash margin on a long-term loan.

21. Trade and other receivables continued 

At 31 December 2023, the provision balance relating to chargebacks was $236 million (2022: $204 million). The key inputs and assumptions included 
in calculating this provision are estimations of ‘in channel’ inventory at the wholesalers (including processing lag) of 39 days (2022: 36 days), estimated 
chargeback rates as informed by average historical chargeback credits adjusted for expected chargeback levels for new products, changes to pricing 
and estimated future sales trends (including customer mix). Based on the conditions existing at the balance sheet date, an increase/decrease in the 
estimate of in channel inventory by 1 day increases/decreases the provision by $6 million (2022: $5 million), and if the overall chargeback rate of 57% 
(2022: 57%) increases/decreases by one percentage point, the provision would increase/decrease by $4 million (2022: $4 million). 

At 31 December 2023, the provision balance relating to customer rebates was $49 million (2022: $49 million). The key inputs and assumptions included 
in calculating this provision are the historical relationship between contractual rebate payments to revenue, past payment experience, changes to 
pricing and sales levels, estimation of ‘in channel’ inventory at the wholesalers and retail pharmacies and estimated future sales trends (including 
customer mix). Based on the conditions existing at the balance sheet date, a ten-basis point increase/decrease in the rebates rate of 4.9% (2022: 
5.7%) would increase/decrease this provision by approximately $1 million (2022: approximately $1 million).

Provision for end of service indemnity relates to employees of certain Group subsidiaries and includes some immaterial amounts for defined benefit 
plans. This provision is calculated based on relevant laws in the countries where each Group company operates, in addition to their own policies. 
For defined benefit plans, the actuarial valuations performed in 2023 did not result in any change in the net liability (2022: $nil) 

Legal provision is related to the expected settlement amount for legal matters, of which $7 million is expected to be settled after more than one year 
(Notes 6 and 41).

Contract and refund liabilities: The Group allows customers to return products within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration 
date. In addition, free goods are issued to customers as sale incentives, reimbursement of agreed upon expenses incurred by the customer or as 
compensation for expired or returned goods. 

At 31 December 2023, the provision balance relating to returns was $158 million (2022: $168 million). The key assumptions included in calculating this 
provision are estimations of the product shelf life, estimations of revenue estimated to be subject to returns and the estimated returns rate of 1.47% 
(2022: 1.78%) as informed by both historical return rates and consideration of specific factors like product dating and expiration, new product launches, 
entrance of new competitors, and changes to contractual terms. Based on the conditions existing at the balance sheet date, a ten-basis point 
increase/decrease in the returns and allowances rate would increase/decrease this provision by approximately $11 million (2022: $9 million). 

Indirect rebates and other allowances: mainly represent rebates granted to healthcare authorities and certain indirect customers under contractual 
arrangements. 

At 31 December 2023, the provision balance relating to the indirect rebates was $96 million (2022: $55 million). The key inputs and assumptions 
included in calculating this provision are the historical relationship between contractual rebate payments to revenue, past payment experience, 
changes to pricing and sales levels, estimation of ‘in channel’ inventory at the wholesalers and retail pharmacies and estimated future sales trends 
(including customer mix). Based on the conditions existing at the balance sheet date, a ten-basis point increase/decrease in rebates rate of 4.7% 
(2022: 3.1%) would increase/decrease this provision by approximately $2 million (2022: $2 million). 

The movements on the provisions for contract and refund liabilities and indirect rebates and other allowances for the years ended 31 December 2023 
and 2022 were as follows:

29. Financial policies for risk management and their objectives 

Credit and concentration of risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments. 

The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances 
for expected credit loss, chargebacks, and other allowances. A provision for impairment is made based on expected credit loss which is estimated 
based on previous experience, current events and forecasts of future conditions. A loan or receivable is considered impaired when there is no 
reasonable expectation of recovery, or when a debtor fails to make a contractual payment for a specific period which varies based on the type of 
debtor and the market in which they operate. 

During the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group’s largest two customers in the MENA region represented 6.8% of Group revenue (2022: 6.9%), 
5.1% from one customer in Saudi Arabia (2022: 5.3%), and 1.7% from one customer in Algeria (2022: 0.9%). At 31 December 2023, the amount of 
receivables due from all customers based in Saudi Arabia was $106 million (2022: $139 million) and the amount of receivables due from all customers 
based in Algeria was $57 million (2022: $48 million). 

During the year ended 31 December 2023, three key US wholesalers represented 36% of Group revenue (2022: 37%). The amount of receivables due 
from all US customers at 31 December 2023 was $379 million (2022: $325 million). 

The Group manages this risk through the implementation of stringent credit policies, procedures and certain credit insurance agreements. 

Trade receivable exposures are monitored consistently as they arise. Credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer, based on a number 
of qualitative and quantitative factors related to the creditworthiness of a particular customer. The Group is exposed to a variety of customers ranging 
from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic risks vary across 
the Group. In line with local market practice, customers in the MENA region are offered relatively long payment terms compared to customers in 
Europe and the US. Typical credit terms in the US range from 30 to 90 days, in Europe 30 to 120 days, and in MENA 180 to 360 days . Where 
appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. 

The following table provides a summary of the age of trade receivables (Note 21):

The increase in the allowance for expected credit loss is mainly driven by the impairment of trade and other receivables related to Sudan exposure 
(Note 6). 

Market risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The Group’s objective is to reduce, where it is appropriate to do so, fluctuations 
in earnings and cash flow associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. Management actively monitors these exposures to 
manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety of derivative financial instruments, if needed.

29. Financial policies for risk management and their objectives continued 

Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital and monitors its liquidity to have reasonable assurance that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and 
deliver its growth strategy objectives, while reducing its cost of capital and maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt 
and equity mix. The Group regularly reviews the capital structure by considering the level of available capital and the short to medium-term strategic 
plans concerning future capital spend, as well as the need to meet dividends, banking covenants, and borrowing ratios. 

The Group defines capital as equity plus net debt which includes long and short-term financial debts (Notes 24 and 28), lease liabilities (Note 17), 
net of cash and cash equivalents (Note 22) and restricted cash (Note 19). Group net debt excludes co-development and earnout payments, acquired 
contingent liabilities and contingent consideration (Notes 27 and 30).  

During the year, the Group continued its strategy of obtaining debt financing at both the Group level and at the operating entities level. This enables 
the Group to borrow at competitive rates and to build relationships with local, regional and international banks and is therefore deemed to be the most 
effective means of raising finance, while maintaining the balance between borrowing cost, asset and liability management, and consolidated balance 
sheet currency risk management. 

In order to monitor the available net funds, management reviews financial capital reports on a monthly basis, in addition to the continuous review by 
the Group treasury function. 

At 31 December 2023, the Group’s gearing ratio (total debt/equity) was 54% (2022: 60%).  

Cash management  
The Group manages the deployment of cash balances to predefined limits approved by the Board of Directors under the cash/risk management 
policy. Per the policy, the Group’s excess cash should be held with highly rated global and regional financial institutions. The aim of the policy is to 
mitigate the risk of holding cash in certain currencies, countries and financial institutions, through a specific threshold. The Group reviews the policy 
periodically to meet its risk appetite.  

Foreign exchange risk and currency risk 
The Group uses the US dollar as its reporting currency and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange movements primarily in the Euro, Algerian dinar, 
Sudanese pound, Japanese yen, Egyptian pound, Tunisian dinar and Moroccan dirham. Consequently, where possible, the Group enters into various 
contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change, to hedge against the risk of movement in foreign denominated assets and 
liabilities. Due to the lack of open currency markets, the Algerian dinar, the Sudanese pound, the Tunisian dinar, the Moroccan dirham and the 
Egyptian pound cannot be hedged at reasonable cost. Where possible, the Group uses financing facilities denominated in local currencies to mitigate 
the risks. The Jordanian dinar and the Saudi riyal had no impact on the consolidated income statement as those currencies are pegged against the 
US dollar. 

Sudan was considered to be a hyperinflationary economy in the year ended 31 December 2023. At 31 December 2023, the prevailing rate for the 
Sudanese pound was 1,000.35 per US dollar (2022: 583.34).  

Currency risks, as defined by IFRS 7, arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is other than the functional 
currency of an entity and being of a monetary nature. 

The currencies that have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements and the exchange rates used are as follows: 

US dollar /Euro 
US dollar /Sudanese pound1 
US dollar /Algerian dinar  

US dollar /Saudi riyal 

US dollar /Pound sterling 

US dollar /Jordanian dinar 

US dollar /Egyptian pound 

US dollar /Japanese yen 

US dollar /Moroccan dirham 

US dollar /Tunisian dinar

A sensitivity analysis based on a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates would result in a $6 million (2022: $15 million) movement in foreign 
exchange loss/gain on the Group results. 

The Group sets certain limits on liquid funds per currency (other than the US dollar) and per country.

An interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous one percentage point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 
31 December 2023, with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of the Group’s net debt portfolio as at 31 December 2023, a 
one percentage point increase/decrease in interest rates would result in $3 million increase/decrease in net finance cost per year (2022: $4 million 
increase/decrease).

29. Financial policies for risk management and their objectives continued 

During 2023, the Group completed the transitioning of its remaining USD Libor loans to Term SOFR. As at 31 December 2023, none (2022: 
$0.06 million) of the Group’s utilised debt portfolio, as well as none (2022: $93 million) of the Group’s unutilised debt facilities have USD LIBOR 
as the benchmark interest rate. 

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between 
willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. 

The carrying value of the following financial assets/liabilities are not significantly different from their fair values, as explained below: 

– 

Cash at banks and on hand and time deposits – due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments and given that generally they 
have negligible credit risk, management considers the carrying amounts not to be significantly different from their fair values  
Restricted cash (Note 19) – the fair value of restricted cash is not considered to be significantly different from the carrying value 

– 
–  Other financial assets (Note 19) – mainly represent long-term receivables carried at amortised cost, of which the fair value is estimated not to be 

– 

– 
– 

significantly different from the respective carrying amounts 
Receivables and payables – the fair values of receivables and payables are estimated not to be significantly different from the respective 
carrying amounts 
Short-term loans and overdrafts approximate to their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
Long-term loans – loans with variable rates are re-priced in response to any changes in market rates and so management considers their carrying 
values not to be significantly different from their fair values  

Loans with fixed rates relate mainly to: 

– 

– 

$500 million 3.25%, five-year Eurobond with a carrying value of $497 million at 31 December 2023 and fair value of $481 million, accounted for at 
amortised cost. The fair value is determined with reference to a quoted price in an active market as at the balance sheet date (a level 1 fair value) 
(Note 28) 
A ten-year $150 million loan from the International Finance Corporation with outstanding balance of $86 million at 31 December 2023 and a fair 
value of $80 million. Fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made 
to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities of such loans (a level 2 fair value) 

Management classifies items that are recognised at fair value based on the level of the inputs used in their fair value determination as described below: 

– 
– 
– 

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
Level 2: Inputs that are observable for the asset or liability 
Level 3: Inputs that are not based on observable market data

Investments in unlisted shares at FVTOCI represent venture capital investments and are measured at cost and adjusted as necessary for impairment 
and revaluations with reference to relevant available information and recent financing rounds. 

Contingent consideration liability represents a contractual liability to make payments to third parties in the form of milestone payments that depend 
on the achievement of certain US FDA approval milestones; and payments based on future sales of certain products. These liabilities were recognised 
as part of the Columbus business acquisition in 2016.  

The valuation for the payments that are based on future sales is based on a discounted cash flow model applied to projected future sales for a period 
of seven years (2022: eight years). The key assumption used for this valuation is the sales projections informed by pricing and volume assumptions 
which were determined using a probability weighted average of different possibilities on sales growth rates. The valuation for milestone payments is 
based on 100% probability of success and is discounted using a rate of 6% (2022: 4.9%).

The Group regularly monitors all cash, cash equivalents and debt to maintain liquidity needs. This is done by analysing debt headroom and expected 
cash flows. The Group seeks to be proactive in its liquidity management to avoid any adverse liquidity effect. 

At 31 December 2023, the Group had undrawn facilities of $1,613 million (2022: $1,592 million). Of these facilities, $1,284 million (2022: $1,311 million) 
were committed long-term facilities.

Contingent consideration and acquired contingent liabilities represent contractual liabilities to make payments to third parties in the form of 
milestone payments that depend on the achievement of certain US FDA approval milestones; and payments based on future sales of certain 
products. These liabilities were recognised as part of the Columbus business acquisition in 2016. The current portion of these liabilities are recognised 
in other current liabilities (Note 27).  

The contingent consideration liability is accounted for as a financial liability at fair value under IFRS 9 (note 29) 

The acquired contingent liability was recognised as part of the Columbus business acquisition in 2016. On acquisition, the contingent liability was 
recognised at fair value under IFRS 3 ’Business Combinations’ and it is subsequently measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognised under 
IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’ and the amount initially recognised less any settlements made in respect of the liability.

31. Share capital continued 

In 2022, the Board approved the capitalisation of the merger reserve and the issuance of a Bonus Share with a $1,746 million nominal value, this share 
was subsequently cancelled through a capital reduction, which created $1,746 million of distributable reserves to the Group. Moreover, the Group 
executed a share buyback programme of $300 million in 2022, which resulted in the purchase and cancellation of 12,499,670 shares.

Akorn Operating Company LLC (Akorn) 
On 5 July 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of the assets of Akorn as part of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy process, and paid cash consideration of 
$98 million. This acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 ‘business combination’. 

The net assets acquired in the transaction are provisional. The identifiable assets and liabilities recognised as a result of this acquisition are as follows: 

Product related intangible assets (Note 15) 

Property, plant and equipment (Note 16)

Product related intangible assets comprise product rights of $36 million and IPR&D of $27 million. $19 million of product rights are expected to be 
ready for use following the finalisation of the technology transfer process. Property, plant and equipment mainly included land and buildings of 
$25 million, and machinery and equipment of $11 million, of which the Group has disposed of $15 million of land and buildings, and $3 million of 
machinery and equipment, no gain/loss has been recognised as a result of these disposals. At 31 December 2023, $11 million of land and buildings 
has been classified as held for sale. 

Other liabilities mainly comprise technology transfer costs. No goodwill arose as a result of this acquisition. 

Akorn did not contribute to the revenue and profit before tax of the Group in 2023 as the contributions are expected to flow after the finalisation of the 
technology transfer process.

36. Contingent liabilities  

Standby letters of credit and letters of guarantees 
A contingent liability existed at the balance sheet date in respect of standby letters of credit and letters of guarantees totalling $55 million (2022: 
$55 million) arising in the normal course of business. No provision for these liabilities has been made in these consolidated financial statements. 

A contingent liability existed at the balance sheet date for standby letters of credit totalling $14 million (2022: $14 million) for potential stamp duty 
obligations that may arise from the repayment of loans by intercompany guarantors. It’s not probable that any repayment will be made by the 
intercompany guarantors. 

Legal proceedings 
The Group is involved in a number of legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business, including actual or threatened litigation and actual or 
potential government investigations relating to employment matters, product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, sales and marketing practices, 
infringement of IP rights, the validity of certain patents and competition laws. 

Most of the claims involve highly complex issues. Often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability of a loss, 
if any, being sustained and/or an estimate of the amount of any loss is difficult to ascertain. It is the Group’s policy to provide for amounts related to 
these legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable.  

The Group currently intends to vigorously defend against these proceedings. From time to time, however, the Group may settle or otherwise resolve 
these matters on terms and conditions that it believes to be in its best interest.

Starting in 2016, several complaints have been filed in the United States on behalf of putative classes of direct and indirect purchasers of generic drug 
products, as well as several individual direct purchasers opt-out plaintiffs and third-party payors of generic drug products. These complaints, which 
now number thirty-two allege that more than forty generic pharmaceutical defendants including the Group entities engaged in conspiracies to fix, 
increase, maintain and/or stabilise the prices and market shares of the generic drug products named between approximately 2010 and 2016. The 
plaintiffs seek treble damages, which can be significantly higher than the profits Hikma made on the named drug products, and equitable injunctive 
relief under federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. The lawsuits have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation (MDL) court in 
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (In re Generic Pharmaceuticals Pricing Antitrust Litigation, No. 2724, (E.D. Pa.)). 
At this point, the Group does not believe sufficient evidence exists to make any provision. 
Starting in June 2020, several complaints have been filed in the United States on behalf of both individual plaintiffs and putative classes of direct and 
indirect purchasers, as well as third party payors of Xyrem® against certain Group entities and other defendants. Currently, most of these cases have 
been consolidated in an MDL court in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (In re Xyrem (Sodium Oxybate) Antitrust 
Litigation, No.2966, (N.D. Cal)). These complaints allege that Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC and its subsidiaries entered into unlawful “pay-for-delay” 
reverse payment agreements with each of the defendants, including Hikma, in settling patent infringement litigation over Xyrem®. The plaintiffs in 
these lawsuits seek treble damages, which can be significantly higher than the profits Hikma makes from selling the generic version of Xyrem®, and 
equitable injunctive relief under federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. A trial has been scheduled to start on October 28, 2024 in 
the MDL matter. At this point, the Group does not believe sufficient evidence exists to make any provision. 
In November 2020, Amarin Pharmaceuticals filed a patent infringement lawsuit against certain Group entities in the United States District Court 
for the District of Delaware (No. 20-cv-1630) alleging that Hikma’s sales and distribution of its generic icosapent ethyl product infringes three 
Amarin patents that describe certain methods of using icosapent ethyl. Amarin sought an injunction barring Hikma from selling its generic 
product as well as unspecified damages. Hikma’s product is not approved for the patented methods but rather is approved only for a different 
indication not covered by any valid patents. In January 2022 the court dismissed the lawsuit, and Amarin has appealed the court’s ruling to the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Briefing on the appeal has been completed but no oral argument has been scheduled. 
The Group does not believe sufficient evidence exists to make any provision.

37. Share-based payments 

Executive incentive plan  
The 2014 Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. The EIP is a combined cash bonus 
(element A), deferred shares (element B) and restricted shares (element C) scheme. In 2023, element C was replaced by the new 2023 Incentive Plan.  

Under the EIP, the Company makes grants of conditional awards under element B to the senior management level of the Group. Awards are dependent on 
the achievement of individual and Group KPIs over one year prior to grant and a two-year vesting period, and are then subject to a two-year holding period 
during which they are subject to forfeiture conditions.  

The cost of the EIP of $11 million (2022: $13 million) has been recorded in the consolidated income statement as part of selling, general and 
administrative expenses and research and development expenses. 

The fair value per share is the face value of share on the date of grant less the present value of dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period.  

The weighted average exercise share price for 2023 is $22.67.

2023 Incentive Plan 
Long-term incentive plan  
The 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced under the 2023 Incentive Policy and was approved by shareholders at the 2023 Annual 
General Meeting. Under the LTIP, the Company makes grants of conditional awards to the Executive Directors and senior executives of the Group. 
Awards are dependent on certain non-market and market conditions with a vesting period of three years from the grant, and are then subject to a  
two-year holding period.  

The cost of the LTIP of $4 million has been recorded in the consolidated income statement as part of selling, general and administrative expenses. 

The fair value per share is the face value of shares on the date of grant for non-market conditions. Valuation is based on the Monte Carlo methodology 
for market condition. No discounting for dividend yield is applied as participants will receive the benefit of dividends paid during the vesting period in 
the form of additional shares.  

Details of the outstanding grants under this plan are shown below:

40. Defined contribution retirement benefit plan 

The Group has defined contribution retirement plans in four of its subsidiaries: Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC – United Kingdom, Hikma Pharmaceuticals 
LLC, Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing PSC and Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. The details of each contribution plan are as follows: 

Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC  
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC currently has a defined contribution pension plan available for staff working in the United Kingdom whereby Hikma 
Pharmaceuticals PLC contributes 10% of basic salary. Employees are immediately entitled to 100% of the contributions. Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 
contributions for the year ended 31 December 2023 were $0.2 million (2022: $0.3 million). 

Hikma Pharmaceuticals LLC  
Hikma Pharmaceuticals LLC currently has an employee savings plan whereby Hikma Pharmaceuticals LLC fully matches employees’ contributions, 
which are fixed at 10% of basic salary. Employees are entitled to 100% of Hikma Pharmaceuticals LLC contributions after three years of employment 
with the Company. Hikma Pharmaceuticals LLC contributions for the year ended 31 December 2023 were $3.6 million (2022: $3.4 million). 

Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing PSC  
Arab Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing PSC currently has an employee savings plan whereby Arab Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing PSC fully matches 
employees’ contributions, which are fixed at 10% of basic salary. Employees are entitled to 100% of Arab Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing PSC 
contributions after three years of employment with the Company. Arab Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing PSC contributions for the year ended 
31 December 2023 were $0.5 million (2022: $0.5 million). 

Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.: (401 (k) Retirement Plan)  
Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. has a 401(k)-defined contribution plan, which allows all eligible employees to defer a portion of their income through 
contributions to the plan. Eligible employees can begin contributing to the plan after being employed for 90 days. Employees can defer up to 95% of 
their eligible income into the plan, not to exceed $22,500 (2022: $20,500), not including catch-up contributions available to eligible employees as 
outlined by the Internal Revenue Service. The company matches the employees’ eligible contribution dollar-for-dollar on the first 6% of eligible pay 
contributed to the plan. Employer contributions vest 50% after two years of service and 100% after three years of service. Employees are considered to 
have completed one year of service for the purposes of vesting upon the completion of 1,000 hours of service at any time during a plan year. Employer 
contributions to the plan for the year ended 31 December 2023 were $8 million (2022: $9 million). The assets of this plan are held separately from those 
of the Group. The only obligation of the Group with respect to this plan is to make specified contributions. 

41. Subsequent event 

On 1 February 2024, the Group reached an agreement in principle to resolve the vast majority of the opioid related cases brought against Hikma 
Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. by US states, their subdivisions, and tribal nations. These cases relate to the manufacture and sale of prescription opioid 
medications. The agreed upon settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. 

The Group booked a total provision of $129 million to cover the expected settlement amount for all related cases in North America. The provision is 
considered an adjusting post balance sheet event and is recognised as an exceptional item in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2023 (Notes 6 and 26).

Notes to the Company  
financial statements  

For the year ended 31 December 2023 

1. Adoption of new and revised standards  

The nature of the impact on the Company of new and revised standards is the same as for the Group. Details are given in Note 1 to the Group 
consolidated financial statements. 

2. Accounting policies 

Basis of accounting 
These financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2023 have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101. 

As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards as below: 

– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 

Paragraph 10(d) of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (statement of cash flows) 
Paragraph 16 of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (statement of compliance with all IFRS Accounting Standards) 
Paragraph 38A of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (requirements for minimal of two primary statements, including cash flow statements) 
Paragraph 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ 
Paragraph 111 of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (cash flow statement information) 
Paragraphs 134 to 136 of IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' (capital disclosures) 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure’ 
Paragraph 17 of IAS 24 ‘Related Parties Disclosures’  
Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’  
IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flow’ 
Paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' 

No individual profit and loss account is prepared as provided by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation to fair value of certain financial assets and 
liabilities. The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in Note 2 to the Group consolidated financial statements with 
the addition of the policies noted below.  

Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provision for impairment. The carrying value of investments is reviewed for 
impairment when there is an indication that the investment might be impaired. Any provision resulting from an impairment review is charged to the 
Company profit and loss. Testing for impairment requires making estimates for the valuation of the investments. 

Trade receivables acquired from subsidiaries through an intercompany factoring arrangement and intercompany receivables are classified 
as financial assets at amortised cost and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any expected credit loss. 
The Company applies a general approach in calculating expected credit loss for the intercompany receivables. At the reporting date, all outstanding 
balances were considered to have low credit risk, therefore, the general approach using a 12-month probability of default was applied when assessing 
expected credit loss on a 12-month period basis. The Company applies a simplified approach for the intercompany factoring arrangement. 

Equity-settled employee share schemes are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share based payment’. The current charge relating to the 
subsidiaries’ employees is recharged to the respective subsidiary. 

There are no critical judgements and estimates involved in applying the above accounting policies, that may have a significant risk of resulting in a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. 

The presentational and functional currency of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC is the US dollar as the majority of the Company’s business is conducted in 
US dollars.

At 31 December 2023, 12,833,233 of the issued share capital are held as Treasury shares (2022: 12,833,233) of which the voting rights attached to these 
shares are not capable of exercise, and 221,081,371 shares are in free issue (2022: 220,235,852). 

In 2023, share capital increased by 845,519 shares as a result of the exercised shares granted under the share-based compensation schemes 
(2022: 1,237,467). 

In 2022, the Board approved the capitalisation of the merger reserve and the issuance of a Bonus Share with a $1,746 million nominal value, this share 
was subsequently cancelled through a capital reduction, which created $1,746 million of distributable reserves to the Company. Moreover, the 
Company executed a share buyback programme of $300 million in 2022, which resulted in the purchase and cancellation of 12,499,670 shares. 

13. Profit for the year 

The net profit in the Company for the year is $71 million. Included in the net profit for the year is dividend income of $70 million. The remaining income 
statement components mainly comprise factoring income from subsidiary, general and administrative expenses and net financing expenses. Audit 
fees for the Company are included within fees to the company's auditor and its associates for the audit of the parent company and consolidated 
financial statements as disclosed in Note 7 to the Group consolidated financial statements. 

The net profit in the Company for the prior year was $266 million. Included in the net profit for the prior year was dividend income of $276 million. 
The remaining income statement components largely represented factoring income from subsidiary, general and administrative expenses and net 
financing expenses. 

14. Contingent liabilities and financial guarantees 

A contingent liability existed at the balance sheet date for standby letters of credit totalling $14 million (2022: $14 million) for potential stamp duty 
obligations that may arise from the repayment of loans by intercompany guarantors. It is not probable that any repayment will be made by the 
intercompany guarantors. 

In addition, the Company guaranteed Hikma Finance USA LLC $500 million, 3.25%, five-year Eurobond issued in July 2020 (Note 28 to the Group 
consolidated financial statements). The Company has also guaranteed Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. contingent consideration related to the 
Columbus business acquisition (Note 27 and 30 to the Group consolidated financial statements). Financial guarantees issued by the Company on 
behalf of subsidiaries are accounted for at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9. The fair value of these liabilities is immaterial given the low probability 
of default for any of the related subsidiaries.

Shareholder fraud
The Financial Conduct Authority has issued a number of warnings 
to shareholders regarding boiler room scams. Shareholders may 
have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ 
who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out 
to be worthless or high-risk shares in US or UK investments. These 
operations are commonly known as boiler rooms. These brokers 
can be very persistent and extremely persuasive. Shareholders are 
advised to be very cautious of unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares 
at a discount or offers of free company reports. If you receive any 
unsolicited investment advice:

 – obtain the correct name of the person and organisations
 – check they are authorised by the FCA by looking the firm up on 

www.fca.org.uk/register

 – report the matter to the FCA either by calling 0800 111 6768 or visit 

www.fca.org.uk/consumers
 – if the caller persists, hang up
