Additional Information

316  Glossary

30 years ago in Cardiff, Wales, Admiral was born.  
We started as a small motor insurance Company, but  
have grown to become an established multinational  
and multi-product insurer, putting our customers first,  
doing business in five countries and proud to be  
Wales’ only FTSE 100 Company. 

We are always striving to be ‘better together’, as  
outlined in our purpose statement – and it’s our unique 
 culture and dedicated colleagues that help us achieve this.  
Thank you to every single person who, over the last  
30 years, has contributed to our purpose to help more  
people to look after their future.

Starting
SOMETHING 
BETTER

Admiral was launched in 1993 by Henry Engelhardt, David 
Stevens and their team. With only one brand and 57 colleagues, 
they built Admiral from the ground up. They chose to do  
things differently. They were happy to embrace innovation,  
new technology, new ways of working, and to take risks. 
They put customers at the heart of what they did and believed 
in the power of the team. In 2004, Admiral floated on the 
London Stock Exchange, and in 2007 became, and still is, 
the only Welsh Company in the FTSE 100.

Environment

Our customers pay us an agreed premium to insure themselves 
against a specific risk. We efficiently pool these risks and manage 
our capital with discipline to protect our customers when they need 
us. We generate further income from investing premiums, selling 
ancillary add-ons and unsecured personal lending products, and 
from fees generated over the lifetime of a policy. The difference 
between our revenues and our paid and expected claims and 
operating costs drives our profitability. The majority of our profits 
are paid out in dividends, with a proportion held back to continue 
investing in our capabilities and business opportunities, and to 
support growth.

Our customers
We provide a broad range of 
insurance and lending products 
to meet our customers’ specific 
needs, enabling more people to 
look after their future.

Managing claims
We engage closely with our 
customers throughout the 
claims process, ensuring 
they are supported and 
receive a fair outcome in a 
timely manner. 

Partners/suppliers
  These include our partners 
in reinsurance, IT hosting, 
distribution and claims 
management, and finance. 
Read more about how we are 
working with partners and 
suppliers on page 95 

Our people 
People are at the heart 
of our business. We have 
always focused on providing 
a supportive environment 
that allows people to develop 
and grow. Our unique culture 
drives openness, equality 
and employees who care 
about their work.

Managing risk
We underwrite carefully 
selected risks and share a 
proportion of that risk with 
reinsurers and co-insurers, 
earning profit commission 
where the business 
generates overall profits. 

Co-insurers/re-insurers

Managing investments
We prudently invest the 
premiums we collect to 
generate investment income.

Our Business Model

What we do

Insurance underwriting 
and other products 
Our primary business is to sell car, 
van, home, travel, and pet insurance. 
The majority of our customers buy our 
products through the price comparison 
channel, with a smaller proportion buying 
either directly or through brokers and 
agents. We generate further income from 
the sale of ancillary add-ons and from fees 
generated over the lifetime of a policy. 

The UK is our core market and we have 
an estimated 19% share of the private 
car insurance market (2022: 17%) and 
a 8% share of the private home insurance 
market9 (2022: 7%). We leverage the 
capabilities and resources from our 
established UK business to grow our 
international businesses. 

Outside of our core underwriting 
activities, we sell a range of unsecured 
personal loans and car finance products 
in the UK through Admiral Money. 
We also invest in new ventures through 
Admiral Pioneer, which is designed to 
test new products and identify future 
sources of earnings.

Optimising capital structure 
through reinsurance 
A key feature of our business model 
and success is the extensive use of 
reinsurance and co-insurance partnerships. 
These include proportional and non-
proportional risk-sharing agreements, 
where insurers outside of the Group 
underwrite the majority of the risk 
generated. These arrangements include 
profit commission terms which allow 
us to retain a significant portion of the 
profit generated. 

Investing premiums 
We also generate income by investing 
the premiums we collect. Our investment 
strategy is focused on capital preservation 
and low volatility of returns relative 
to liabilities. We have an asset liability 
matching strategy to manage interest 
rate and currency risk. We hold a prudent 
level of liquidity and the investment 
portfolio has a high-quality credit profile.

Competing 
IN THE 
ADMIRAL
GAMES

In 2023, colleagues from around 
the Group had a great time taking 
part in the first Admiral Games. 
Every business put a team together 
and came to Cardiff with high spirits 
and an aspiration to win, competing 
in sports ranging from athletics, 
swimming, football and a pentathlon!

Admiral Pioneer was crowned the 
2023 champion, with UK Business 
Support coming second and Admiral 
Seguros third.

Emma Huntington, Admiral Pioneer 
CEO: “I am so proud of our team and 
how well we competed during the 
Admiral Games. We had an amazing 
team that supported each other 
through the whole two days. It was a 
defining two days for me at Admiral.”

Andrea Ferri, ConTe: “You find yourself 
spending four days on a university 
campus in Wales, with 160 athletes 
and colleagues from different parts 
of the world, competing in ten sports, 
carrying the Italian and ConTe flag: 
this is Admiral!”

The drivers of our success

Our drivers of success help us achieve our purpose, maximise 
the value we create for our stakeholders, and stand out as a  
go-to insurance provider.

Excellent customer service
Our focus on providing good customer 
service remains as crucial today as it was 
in 1993. 

We aim to create insurance products 
that are easily understood and accessible 
through simple and clear communication. 
Our sales teams provide all relevant 
information, including limitations, so our 
customers can make informed decisions 
and choose the right products for 
their needs. 

To ensure responsible sales and 
transparent claims processes, we actively 
review our practices against internal 
policies and regulatory requirements. 
We provide clear guidance and focus 
on delivering good outcomes to 
our customers in a timely manner. 
Customers can reach us via multiple 
channels and we have controls in place 
to identify and appropriately support 
vulnerable customers. 

We regularly measure customer 
satisfaction across key benchmarks, 
such as the Net Promoter Score® (NPS), 
to stay close to customers’ views and 
understand areas where our service needs 
improvement, as well as where we are 
doing well. 

Unique Company culture
A great culture goes a long way towards 
building long-term commercial success. 
Our four pillars of culture are the 
foundation for why we enjoy coming 
to work every day and why Admiral is 
celebrated as a Great Place To Work®.

We encourage open and transparent 
communication at all levels. 
Our management operate an open-door 
policy, and our Group CEO engages with 
colleagues through the ‘Ask Milena’ 
initiative. 

We promote equality and an environment 
where everyone can succeed and be 
themselves. Employee-led diversity and 
inclusion groups empower colleagues 
to actively shape our employee policies.

Our share ownership scheme 
plays an important role in how we 
recognise and reward our colleagues. 
When people own a part of their 
Company, they share in its success.

Since day one we’ve said, ‘if people like what 
they do, they do it better’. Our ‘ministry of 
fun’ organises events so that colleagues can 
spend time together, have fun and connect. 

Operational excellence
We take great pride in providing good value 
financial products and services that meet 
customer needs. 

Our focus on risk selection and data 
analytics shapes our decision-making and 
is built upon extensive claims experience, 
underwriting capabilities, and insights 
from big data. 

Our efficient claims management is backed 
by a culture of continuous improvement, 
proactive engagement, decades of 
experience in claims handling, and great 
customer service. 

We remain focused on building long-term 
sustainable and profitable businesses 
through financial discipline. Our cost-
conscious approach is strongly embedded 
across the organisation as our employees 
are shareholders, and this translates into  
a competitive expense ratio. 

Efficient capital employment 
Our partnerships with our reinsurers are 
underpinned by a track-record of strong 
underwriting results and good risk 
management. Sharing risk allows us to hold 
less capital whilst ensuring protection from 
losses, thus supporting our commitment 
to strong shareholder returns. We include 
an assessment of the projected solvency 
and principal and emerging risks as 
part of our capital plan and Own Risk 
and Solvency Assessment.

Track record of long-term 
profitable growth 
Our success is in part due to our prudent 
reserving philosophy. We release reserves 
over time as we gain more information 
on the development of claims or defaults 
across our insurance and loans businesses.

Celebrating 
OUR RESILIENT 
PERFORMANCE AND 
AUTHENTIC CULTURE

“Admiral’s vision to 
help more people look 
after their future is 
evident in the strong 
2023 performance.”

Mike Rogers
Group Chair

As I reflect on the challenges 
and triumphs of the past  
year, I am pleased to present 
my inaugural Chair statement 
for Admiral Group. 

This was certainly a challenging 
year, with high inflation and macro-
economic uncertainty. Against this 
backdrop, Admiral remained steadfast 
in its commitment to providing peace 
of mind for our colleagues, customers 
and shareholders. Having worked in the 
insurance industry for a number of years, 
I can say that there is an authenticity of 
culture and strong commercial thinking at 
Admiral. The pace and passion for better 
consumer outcomes is infectious. 

Exceptional leadership 
in difficult times 
Milena and her Executive team have 
exhibited exceptional leadership 
throughout a challenging period within 
the industry and economic cycle. 

Our customers, suppliers, colleagues 
and shareholders have all endured a 
very demanding year – our ability to not 
only weather these storms, but to adapt 
and grow is a testament to the collective 
strength and strategic foresight of 
our management team.

Resilience in performance 
Admiral’s vision to help more people 
look after their future is evident in the 
strong 2023 performance. The Group 
demonstrated its traditional ability 
to adapt, evolve, and deliver results. 
This resilience is no accident; it reflects 
our financial discipline and longstanding 
commitment to looking after our people 
and customers; thereby safeguarding our 
shareholders’ interests and ensuring the 
sustained success of Admiral Group.

Admiral retains outstanding competitive 
advantage in the UK motor market: 
defending and extending this remains 
our number one priority. 

We are also mindful of our opportunity 
to leverage our brand, capabilities and 
customer relationships into new products 
and markets.

Presently, we cater to the needs of 
nearly ten million customers across five 
countries. We have made good progress 
in Admiral Money and Household, Pet, 
Travel and Van insurance in the UK, along 
with our European franchises. We believe 
that diversifying our income streams 
where we have competitive advantage 
will add significant shareholder value.

Green transition
Our commitment to sustainability remains 
strong. Businesses, now more than ever, 
play a critical role in the transition to 
a greener economy. Admiral recognises 
this responsibility and underscores its 
commitment in our latest Sustainability 
Report. Our journey toward a greener 
future is not just a reflection of corporate 
responsibility but a strategic imperative 
reflected in the Group’s Net Zero 
ambition. From supporting our customers 
in the adoption of electric vehicles to 
using renewable energy in our sites, 
sustainability is becoming embedded 
throughout the business.

30 years of growth 
None of the Group’s achievements would 
be possible without the dedication and 
resilience of our thousands of colleagues 
worldwide. Their energy, adaptability, 
and commitment have been the 
driving force behind Admiral’s success. 
From Cardiff to Rome, their commitment 
to each other and our customers is the 
beating heart of our organisation. 

This year marked a significant milestone 
as Admiral celebrated its 30th anniversary. 
The insurance industry and the nature 
of work have evolved since Admiral’s 
inception in 1993, and the Group has 
consistently adapted to remain a leader 
in the field. 

I extend my thanks to Annette Court 
who joined the Board in 2012 and was 
appointed Chair in 2017. Annette guided 
the management team through the 
transition from a founder-led business, 
strengthening leadership development 
and succession, helping the business 
navigate regulatory, economic, and 
global challenges. 

We also fondly remember Jean Park, 
who retired from the Board earlier this 
year and sadly passed away soon after. 
Jean’s contributions, particularly as the 
Chair of the Group Risk Committee 
and Senior Independent Director, 
were invaluable. Her legacy of steadfast 
support and wise counsel will be greatly 
missed. I welcome the addition of Fiona 
Muldoon to the Board. Fiona enhances 
our collective expertise and strengthens 
our customer-centric approach.

Staying true to our values 
While the industry has undergone 
changes, Admiral’s core values remain. 

Looking ahead, we remain optimistic 
about the future. The Group’s strategic 
roadmap is designed to drive long-term 
value for our shareholders. We are 
confident that our diversified portfolio, 
agile business model, and unwavering 
commitment to achieve the best 
outcomes for our customers, will position 
us for continued success. 

I extend my gratitude to the Board, 
management team, and colleagues for 
their dedication and support. Together, 
we will continue to shape the future 
and continue our journey of sustained 
growth and success.

Rewarding
COLLEAGUES THROUGH 
OUR SHARE SCHEME 

Cheya: “I used my shares to pay for 
three months travelling across Australia, 
New Zealand and Thailand when I had a 
career break at Admiral. It was an amazing 
experience and I loved every minute of 
it. The shares helped me save up money 
without even having to think about it. 
It’s great to feel like I own a part of the 
business I work for!”

Aaron: “Like a lot of other people across 
the Company, I’ve cashed my shares with 
the intention of putting together a house 
deposit. However, after a bit of accounting 
I realised I had some spare and decided 
to treat myself to a new guitar!”

Since 2004, Admiral Group has  
given colleagues up to £3,600 worth 
of share awards per year through 
the employee share scheme1. 
Our colleagues play a very important 
role in our success, and we want 
them to benefit financially from 
their hard work and dedication.

We caught up with some of our colleagues 
to find out how they have used their 
shares over the years and what the 
scheme means to them:

Will: “The Admiral share scheme has 
made a huge difference to me; I feel 
invested in the success of the business and 
motivated to do my best to contribute to 
it. The scheme has also helped me to look 
after the future of my family – including 
making it possible for us to fund the 
construction of a house extension.“

Embedding
OUR PURPOSE

In 2021 we formalised our purpose 
statement and framework: 
Help more people to look after 
their future. Always striving for 
better, together. Our purpose 
defines the reason we exist and 
underpins everything we do, from 
creating products to supporting 
customers as well as our approach 
to sustainability. 

In October 2023, we launched our 
purpose toolkit for managers across the 
Group. It supports “Leading with purpose” 
workshops where teams explore our 
framework in more detail, leading to an 
increased understanding of individual, 
team and departmental roles in delivering 
our purpose. Continuing to cascade and 

embed our purpose at all levels of our 
Company ensures it remains top of mind 
when engaging with all stakeholders. 
Having one common statement brings 
us together so we all strive to achieve 
the same goal.

Our Group Governance and UK Household 
product teams held their workshops 
in November, where they considered 
how they play a part in helping more 
people to look after their future 
and looking after our stakeholders. 
During the workshops colleagues shared 
their individual purpose, writing on 
jigsaw pieces that all fitted together to 
demonstrate how each colleague plays 
their part and the importance of working 
together as a team.

Doing
THE LITTLE THINGS 
THAT ADD VALUE FOR ALL 
OUR STAKEHOLDERS

“Our core values of 
putting our customers  
and people first and 
enjoying what we 
do are as true today 
as they were in 1993.”

Milena Mondini de Focatiis
Group Chief Executive Officer

2023 was a strong year.  
In the context of challenging 
market conditions, we 
reported another set of solid 
results with strong Group 
profit of £443 million and 
turnover up 31%. 

We welcomed more than 500,000 
additional customers across the Group, 
an increase of 6% and substantially 
improved our loss ratios, while continuing 
to strengthen and diversify our business. 

Over the past couple of years, the industry 
was hit by the worst inflation in recent 
history and we faced a cost-of-living 
crisis in the UK. This had a negative 
impact on our customers and our people, 
who needed more support too. 

Once again, we maintained pricing 
discipline and acted ahead of the 
market to adapt to these trends. 
We continued to build on our historical 
strengths and to look after our customers 
and our people, whilst at the same 
time making positive progress on 
our strategic objectives.

The combination of these three 
things has left us well placed to achieve 
further growth, increase underwriting 
margins and better provide for more 
customers’ needs.

Celebrating 30 years together
Our 30th anniversary served as a great 
reminder to reflect on Admiral’s journey. 
From a small start-up in Wales, the 
Admiral team built a £4.8 billion business 
catering to over nine million customers 
across five countries. We became the 
market leader in UK Motor insurance, with 
cumulative profits of around £7 billion 
over our 30 years and a dividend payout 
ratio of around 90% for our shareholders 

Our strategic progress
One of Admiral’s historical characteristics 
is to navigate the ups and downs of 
the insurance cycle well, together with 
continuing to enhance our capabilities 
and preparing for the next climb. 
This year we made strong progress in 
all of our three core strategic pillars: 
Admiral 2.0, business diversification and 
motor evolution.

Customer experience and outcomes 
have remained our primary focus, 
including embracing the new Consumer 
Duty act in the UK. Something I’ve been 
particularly proud of was the smooth 
implementation of some large technology 
delivery projects, including Guidewire 
claims systems for our UK customers 
and a new platform for lending. 
We completed the transformation 
to scaled agile across all our businesses, 
materially reducing the cost of 
technology change.

We continued to diversify the business 
with the number of policies beyond UK 
Motor up 12% and now accounting for 
almost half of total Group customers. 
It has been pleasing to see, despite 
the challenging market conditions, 
that all our businesses older than 
3 years improved their results. 

It wasn’t only organic growth that 
we achieved in 2023. We accelerated 
our diversification strategy in the UK, 
announcing our intention to acquire 
the renewal rights for RSA’s pet and 
home direct insurance businesses, 
under the More Than brand. It marked 
our first acquisition of relevant size 
but more importantly, the opportunity 
was a perfect fit with our strategy. 

We achieved double digit growth in 
our electric vehicle book, supporting 
more of our customers to transition 
to green mobility, and through Veygo 
we are offering differentiated propositions 
to customers to meet their evolving 
mobility needs. 

over the last few years. We continued 
our historical trend of strong capital 
efficiency and a return on equity of 36% 
in 2023. This is a growth story fueled 
by a strong combination of core technical 
competence and continuous innovation 
in every part of the value chain: service, 
pricing, products and distribution.

Whilst so much has changed, I am proud 
that so much has also stayed the same. 
Our core values of putting our customers 
and people first and enjoying what we 
do are as true today as they were in 1993. 

A year of two halves
Something else that sets us apart is our 
ability to focus on the long term whilst 
being pragmatic in how we steer the 
business in different parts of the insurance 
cycle. We do not forego difficult decisions 
for short term targets. This has been 
a year of two halves, and our approach 
serves as a perfect example of 
this mindset. 

In January it felt like we were standing 
at the foot of a mountain. We knew we 
had a steep climb ahead of us. As we 
entered 2023, we were still helping 
customers with the freeze events of 2022. 
The year began with a spike in inflation, 
which persisted, and the onset of new 
supply chain concerns. 

As in 2022, we acted fast. We continued 
to increase premiums ahead of the market 
to account for inflation, even if this meant 
a further reduction of our UK Motor 
book, which was 7% down year on year 
at the end of June (albeit this reduction 
was more than compensated by growth 
in other parts of the Group). 

After a few challenging months we 
reached the summit of the mountain 
and started to get comfortable with 
our pricing levels, but it still felt like 
we needed a stronger foothold amidst 
the macro-economic uncertainty.

As the summer arrived, we started to 
have a better outlook and a clear sight 
of the downward path. Inflation and claims 
trends started to stabilise. As the rest 
of the market followed by increasing 
their premiums, our competitiveness and 
our retention improved and in the second 
half of the year we reversed our loss of 
policies in UK Motor.

Our people
It was another memorable year of 
accolades for our culture. Not only 
were we voted as the number one 
Best Company to work for in the UK 
and recognised as a diversity leader 
in Europe, we were also ranked 13th 
globally as one of the World’s Best 
Workplaces™ by 2023 Great Place to 
Work®. We now have over 13,000 amazing 
colleagues and we celebrated Admiral’s 
30th birthday together with the 
first edition of the Admiral Games 
sporting event.

Together, we also stepped up our 
contribution to ‘employability’ 
supporting around 2,000 people 
to find new jobs and volunteering 
over 14,000 impact hours.

2024 and beyond
Despite persistent geopolitical and 
macro-economic uncertainty, our 
outlook is more positive. We are 
benefiting from better market conditions 
and a stronger position, thanks to 
the discipline we maintained over 
the past year. 

I am always mindful that the descent 
from a mountain can be more dangerous 
than the climb up. There is no room 
for complacency or distractions. 
We will focus on every single step, 
with clear priorities, strong execution 
and continuing to leverage on our 
historical competencies. 

We are well positioned for further 
growth and diversification. 
Assuming no unforeseen market 
disruptions, I am confident that 
we should expect stronger underwriting 
performance across all our geographies. 
And in the long term, I look forward 
to seeing Admiral celebrate another 
30 years of success.

Donating
£400,000 AS PART 
OF OUR GLOBAL 
EMERGENCY FUND

In 2023, we sadly saw many 
difficult events devastate 
communities across the world. 
Helping more people to look after 
their future is part of our core 
purpose, and so in 2021 we set 
up our Global Emergency Fund, 
allowing a process to speed up 
making donations when people 
and organisations need it most. 

In 2023, we donated over £400,000 to a 
number of urgent appeals, including:

Canada
The wildfires in Nova Scotia brought 
devastation to its communities with 
over 200 homes and structures lost or 
damaged, and over 16,000 residents 
having to evacuate. To support the 
recovery, we donated CAN$50,000 
through our Global Emergency Fund and 
created an emergency colleague support 
fund to provide immediate assistance to 
employees affected by the fires.

Italy
The region of Emilia-Romagna suffered 
severe flooding in May, resulting in more 
than 36,000 people displaced across 
100 cities and towns. Through the Global 

Emergency Fund, and working with 
ConTe’s Charity Team, we donated €25,000 
to the Civil Protection Department that 
supported relief efforts on the ground.

Turkey and Syria
We donated £250,000 to the Disasters 
Emergency Committee (DEC) Turkey 
and Syria Earthquake Appeal following 
the devastating effects of the 
Kahramanmaras earthquakes in February 
2023. This supported aid efforts including 
emergency food for 2,000 families for ten 
days, plus tents for 240 families who lost 
their homes.

Our UK business also matched any 
donations made from colleagues to 
Turkey-Syria appeals via our Give-As-You-
Earn programme, from February to April, 
raising an additional £6,250.

Helping
OUR CUSTOMERS 
THROUGH IMPACTS 
OF EXTREME WEATHER

Weather events can be extremely 
disruptive and stressful if homes 
are damaged. One of our customers 
and their family were faced with the 
possibility of months out of their 
home after Storm Babet left their 
house flooded. Their daughter had 
been diagnosed with an aggressive 
form of cancer a few weeks prior to 
the event, and their home had been 
set up to care for her. 

As their insurer, we wanted to do 
whatever was possible to get them safely 
back in their home before Christmas, 
knowing that claims of this magnitude 
can mean restoration works take a very 
long time. We worked closely with our 
suppliers to assist the family in finding a 
rental property suitable for their needs, 
however as the restoration process was 
expedited with the help from suppliers, 
the family decided to remain in the 
hotel instead. 

Thanks to the effort of all involved, the 
family were back in their home in time 
for Christmas.

We understand the value of quality 
products and efficient service, and are 
proud to have helped the family get back 
into their home quickly. Supporting our 
customers is at the heart of what we do: 
we focus on being there for our customers 
when they need us the most.

Our Strategy

23

•  L’olivier introduced a welcome 

bot which uses AI to identify and 
authenticate the customer and 
their reasons for calling. This means 
customers can quickly be put through 
to the right person to help

•  Admiral Seguros opened new customer 
communication channels, including 
WhatsApp for service, chat online for 
quotes, and online claims help for ‘first 
notification of loss’

•  ConTe launched a digital assistant that 
identifies customer needs and guides 
them to a solution, avoiding the need 
for a phone call when appropriate.

Smart working 
•  We continued to evolve our hybrid 
working model to focus on making 
the time in the office meaningful 
with more spaces for engagement 
and collaboration

•  We regularly complete Pulse surveys 
to ensure the happiness of staff 
and effectiveness of our new way of 
working, and have continued to ensure 
we support all colleagues no matter 
where and how they work.

Data and advanced analytics and 
enhanced risk selection
•  In the UK, we have implemented the 
NextGen Application Programming 
Interface (API) platform alongside 
a range of services, to improve the 
experience of our contact centre 
agents by swiftly providing them with 
the information that they need when 
they are on calls with customers

•  We are nearing completion of our new 
European data platform. This is a suite 
of innovative technologies which will 
deliver faster and more insightful data 
to support decision-making

•  We continued to enhance our risk 

selection capabilities, and we leveraged 
our cloud-based machine learning 
platform by implementing our first 
models in our Van insurance business 
and continued to develop models in 
our other businesses.

1. ACCELERATING 
TOWARDS 
ADMIRAL 2.0

Overview
Our ambition is to accelerate the 
evolution of our core businesses 
toward what we refer to as Admiral 2.0, 
continuing to leverage our historical 
strengths whilst becoming even more 
agile, digital and technology-focused. 
Admiral 2.0 puts the customer first and 
leverages data and advanced analytics to 
constantly be more efficient to improve 
their overall experience.

Core competencies: 
•  Digital first 

•  Scaled agile

•  Customer-centric innovation 

•  Smart working 

•  Data and advanced analytics and 

enhanced risk selection

Progress in 2023:
Digital first
•  We have continued transitioning to the 

cloud. This enables us to better serve our 
customers by using modern, feature-
rich technology platforms with a good 
digital experience

•  In 2023 >50% of Group digital 

interactions, sales and renewals were 
completed online, allowing customers to 
reach us in the way that suits them best

•  The Elephant UK app brand in the UK 
now has the ability for breakdown 
customers to report a breakdown 
directly through the Elephant app, 
thus accessing AA breakdown recovery 
assistance easily and quickly.

Scaled agile
•  All businesses have further embedded 
agile ways of working. Scaled agile 
enables better collaboration between 
functions and quicker customer 
feedback, leading to improved products 
and processes

•  Our UK insurance business created 

a new operating model that ensures 
greater alignment between IT and 
business areas, further reducing 
dependencies between teams and 
creating an optimised flow of value 
delivered to our customers

•  Implementing scaled agile has helped to 
better organise people and outcomes, 
with dedicated focus on growth, 
customer and efficiency targets.

Customer-centric innovation 
•  Our UK operations have continued to 
develop our virtual assistant capability 
in our contact centres. Customers are 
effectively directed to the right service 
to them, whether digital or an agent

Transitioning
TO THE CLOUD

We have updated our US and UK 
core product systems that manage 
customer payments and policies and 
have migrated these to the cloud. 
We have also started the process 
of upgrading the systems in our 
European businesses. This will drive 
better outcomes for our customers, 
upgrade our technology stack and 
future-proof our businesses.

This upgrade helps to mitigate 
technology and security risk, improves the 
speed of release, reduces the overhead 
of upgrades going forward and the total 
cost of ownership of the estate. 

Our UK Insurance business now performs 
the majority of its transactions in the 
cloud, and crucially all new policies 
and most claims are cloud managed. 
This increases agility and speed to market 
by reducing the cost and risk of launching 
new products. 

Security remains paramount and is 
embedded into all cloud-based processes: 
anything hosted externally is managed 
with directory-integrated, role-based 
access and multi-factor authentication.

Celebrating
DATA ACADEMY 
TURNING ONE!

It’s been a hugely successful first 
year for the UK Data Academy.

The Academy was set up to supply 
training and development programmes 
and events, increase data awareness 
and education, and improve diversity in 
the data world. It has surpassed its 2023 
target of 3,000 training hours, with over 
500 people across 50 different teams 
engaging with the Academy during the 
year, and over 70 mentoring relationships 
established. The training has focused on 
learning events, cloud tooling, our data 
strategy and topics such as generative 
AI. Our people have benefitted from 
access to training, learning events such 
as lunch and learns and community 
drop-in knowledge sessions, including 
more than 50 people benefitting from 
individual development programmes since 

launching. As well as this, the Academy 
has continued to partner with Women in 
Data, providing us access to their 35,000 
strong Data Community. This has given us 
a unique opportunity to advertise roles to 
their members and be represented at the 
Women in Data Flagship event. 

As of October 2023, our Data Community 
figures are at 28% female, with the 
industry benchmark from WiD being 
25%. This is a great result for us – but we 
recognise that there’s still more to do.

We are delighted that in 2023, the 
Academy was a finalist across three 
industry recognised awards2 in the UK for 
Best Data Academy, and our UK business 
has been represented at 16 external 
events including podcasts, panels and 
conference talks.

2. DIVERSIFICATION

Overview
Diversification is essential to our strategy 
to keep building a sustainable and resilient 
business. Our approach is to leverage 
the capabilities and knowledge from our 
established businesses to build future 
successful propositions and to transition 
to a low carbon economy. We make 
focused and gradual investments in 
new opportunities that strengthen and 
complement our existing customer 
offerings and leverage our core strengths. 
In just over a decade, we have launched 
numerous products including Household, 
Travel and Pet insurance and a personal 
lending business. Our diversified business 
model means that customers can engage 
with us across a number of products, 
and we can support a growing variety of 
their needs.

Core competencies
•  Scale up promising products 

•  Strengthen customer propositions 

•  Leverage core strengths 

Progress in 2023 
Scale up promising products
•  This year we saw growth in turnover for 
all key diversification areas with 33% in 
UK Household, 56% in Admiral Money 
and 17% in European Motor. 49% Of 
customers are now from non-UK Motor 
businesses (2022: 46%)

•  UK Travel insurance expanded customer 
numbers by 41%, a positive turn after 
the challenges faced post-pandemic. 
UK Travel also expanded its footprint, 
pricing for a wider range of customers, 
enabling more access to our products

•  ConTe in Italy remained profitable 

and reached the milestone of selling 
one million policies during the year 
(2022: 0.97 million policies), showing a 
good growth trajectory for the business

•  L’olivier in France returned to 
profitability, driven by rate 
increases and improvement in 
expenses, strengthening our Group 
diversification objective. 

Celebrating
PET TURNING ONE!

Throughout 2023, we achieved strong 
growth in sales and market share. 
The acquisition due in 2024 of the “More 
Than” Pet and Household renewal rights 
from RSA will help accelerate the growth 
we have seen this year in our Pet product 
and we are looking forward to welcoming 
more pets on board in 2024.

We successfully entered a new 
market in 2022 with the launch 
of our UK Pet insurance product. 
In July 2023 we went live with 
renewals and enjoyed seeing many 
customers keeping their cover 
with Admiral. Fun fact: our most 
popular pet name is Luna!

The Pet insurance team are continually 
looking for new ways to enhance the 
product. In partnership with Burns Pet 
Nutrition, we launched new puppy 
parenting classes, with help from 
Lioness Bethany England and the TikTok 
influencer Ben the Vet, to support new 
pet parents. These 15-30 minute sessions 
were streamed live and customers could 
ask our special guests any question from 
pet health and training, to finding the 
right breeder.

Reaching 
MORE CUSTOMERS AS CONTE 
SELLS OVER ONE MILLION 
POLICIES DURING THE YEAR

Our learnings from ConTe are being 
applied across our businesses and drive 
our diversification achievements forward.

ConTe in Italy is our largest 
operation outside the UK and 
provides customers with Motor 
and Pet insurance. In 2023 ConTe 
sold over one million Motor 
policies and continued to increase 
customer numbers (7%) profitably. 
This success demonstrates our 
ability to take what we do well in 
our UK Motor business and leverage 
our core strengths into other 
markets and products.

ConTe is also advancing channel 
diversification, by exploring alternative 
acquisition methods. This year they have 
been dedicating time to expanding their 
broker networks and connections. 

In line with their customer-centric 
approach, ConTe made several digital 
improvements in 2023, such as 
introducing a digital assistant to their 
website. This tool helps to identify what 
the customer needs and quickly provides 
a solution, for example a correct phone 
number, an informative video or a link 
to their online portal.

Evolve our proposition 
•  During the year, we saw a double-digit 
increase in electric vehicle customers. 
We have a bespoke electric vehicle 
customer journey to ensure our 
policyholders are well informed of the 
benefits and cover we provide

•  Out of charge recovery was rolled out 
to all our UK EV customers at the start 
of 2023 after a successful test in 2022. 
This means customers in the UK and 
the Channel Islands who completely 
run out of charge will be recovered 
alongside their vehicle and taken to 
either the nearest charging point, their 
home address, or any other destination

•  We have continued to strengthen 
our electric vehicle proposition by 
launching wall box cover for our 
customers. This means that their 
home vehicle charger will be covered if 
damaged during an accident or fire, or 
from theft

•  Veygo, our short-term car insurance 

provider, launched a new subscription 
service offering customers rolling 
monthly insurance cover. Customers pay 
monthly and can cancel at any time 
with no fees, allowing customers to 
easily buy insurance when they need it 
at the right price.

Develop competencies for 
the future 
•  In partnership with Ford Credit we 

launched Ford Insure Live, a connected 
car insurance product for Ford private 
car customers. This will allow us to 
further explore connected car data and 
what it means for the future of mobility

•  Through Admiral Pioneer, we are testing 

new propositions around changing 
consumer preferences. This includes the 
rise in popularity of subscription models 
and the growth of embedded insurance 
at the point of sale.

3. EVOLUTION 
OF MOTOR

Overview 
Our Evolution of Motor strategic pillar is 
built on evolving our proposition for the 
changes that are happening in mobility 
worldwide. Different views exist on future 
mobility trends and where the greatest 
future impact will be, but all agree that 
the way people move is changing. It is 
an exciting time for the industry, and 
we want to make sure that we fully 
understand the changes and what they 
will mean for our customers and for 
our business.

To stay close to these trends, we are 
harnessing our test-and-learn philosophy, 
looking at emerging propositions, and 
developing core competencies that will be 
relevant for the future. 

Core competencies 
•  Understand changes in mobility

•  Evolve our proposition

•  Develop competencies for the future

Progress in 2023
Understand changes in mobility 
•  Our dedicated mobility team continues 
to investigate how changes in mobility 
will impact our customers and ways we 
can adapt our products to changing 
customer needs

•  We continue to explore new methods 
of mobility and what that means for 
the insurance industry through the 
work of our dedicated Autonomous 
Vehicle team

•  We have entered into a collaboration 

agreement with ZF, We Know, BP Pulse 
and Ferrovial to explore the feasibility 
of autonomous transportation between 
Heathrow Airport and nearby hotels. 
We aim to understand the insurance 
requirements and processes, and the 
fundamentals of what a successful 
autonomous transportation business 
would look like.

Strengthening
OUR PARTNERSHIP 
WITH WAYVE

Recently Wayve partnered with grocery 
brands ASDA and Ocado to explore the 
future of last mile delivery and self-driving 
technology and Admiral supported them 
by sharing our experience. We are proud 
of this collaboration and excited about 
the future of autonomous technology.

Wayve are one of the leading 
autonomous vehicle software 
companies in the UK. We first 
partnered with Wayve at the 
beginning of their journey in 
April 2018, insuring their very 
first test vehicle. The partnership 
has expanded over time to now 
insure their fleet of autonomous 
test vehicles in central London.

This allows us to remain close to 
the forefront of autonomous vehicle 
development, gaining real world 
experience by working with new 
and emerging technologies, and 
understanding what it takes to prepare 
for the future of autonomous mobility. 

Launching
FORD INSURE LIVE

“Our partnership  
with Admiral has proven 
instrumental to our 
development to date. 
With their support,  
we are able to conduct 
real-world testing of 
autonomous vehicles 
on UK public roads and 
operate the UK’s largest 
autonomous grocery 
delivery trial with ASDA.”

Alex Kendall
Co-Founder & CEO, Wayve

Understanding our customers’  
is essential to delivering products 
and services that really meet their 
needs and provide added value. 
We partnered with Ford Credit in 
2019, and together in 2023 we 
launched Admiral Live and Ford 
Insure Live, both for Ford private  
car drivers. 

The products utilise Ford’s connected car 
technology, which shares live data and 
has tracking capabilities to help provide a 
more personalised and accurately priced 
product based on how customers drive. 
Data is only shared with us if the customer 
permits it, and ranges from the speed of 
the vehicle to the status of seatbelts and 
number of passengers. 

Data is sent directly from the vehicle’s 
modem, which replaces the need for 
an engineer to install a telematics 
box, making the experience smoother 
for customers.

The introduction of Admiral Live and Ford 
Insure Live will enable us to learn more 
about connected car technology and how 
it can benefit customers now and in the 
future. Their introduction encapsulates 
how we collaborate with the motor 
industry and embrace technological 
changes to provide ever-improving, 
customer-focused products and services.

Q&A with Milena, Geraint, Cristina and Costantino

Navigating
CHALLENGING 
MARKET CONDITIONS

Q: How does Admiral stay ahead of 
the game and look to the future?
I believe our strategic pillars – 
diversification, Admiral 2.0, and evolution 
of motor – provide a good foundation 
to serve our customers, strengthened 
by our unique Company culture. As we 
progress in all three, we aim to maintain 
our competitive edge in the long term 
and ensure sustainable value creation 
for our stakeholders.

Embracing technology through Admiral 
2.0, such as the roll out of Guidewire 
10 and transitioning to the Cloud, 
has improved efficiencies and our 
tech foundations. We use large data 
sources and data analytics to refine 
our risk selection and decision making, 
and our extensive claims experience 
and underwriting capabilities leave 
us well placed to effectively manage 
claims. In addition, we have a strong 
culture of managing costs well. All of 
these have resulted in a market leading 
combined ratio. Diversifying into non-
Motor insurance markets is essential 
to building a sustainable and resilient 
business. It creates more options for our 
customers and leverages our brand and 
experience. 49% of our customers are 
now non-UK Motor customers, including 
one of our more recent propositions, UK 
Pet business, that just turned one.

Evolving with emerging mobility trends, 
for example electric vehicle insurance, 
makes it easier for customers to find the 
right insurance for their needs and make 
greener choices. Our EV growth was again 
double digits in 2023.

We continue to challenge ourselves 
to improve and strengthen our 
fundamentals, and I believe Admiral’s 
proven track record of growth, agility 
and discipline positions us well for 2024 
and the future!

3  Proposed baseline year for emissions cuts is 2021,  

still to be verified by SBTi.

“It’s been an amazing  
30 years and whilst so 
much has changed,  
I’m proud that so much 
has also stayed the same. 
Our core values of  
putting our customers 
 and people first and 
enjoying what we do are 
as true today as they  
were in 1993.”

Milena Mondini de Focatiis
Group Chief Executive Officer

Q: How is Admiral helping 
communities and meeting its 
sustainability objectives? 
Considering long-term sustainability has 
been part of Admiral’s DNA long before we 
had a sustainability team. We have people 
that have been here since we started 30 
years ago, we’ve established long-term 
partners and strong relationships, and 
our employees are engaged in their work 
and invested in the performance of the 
business, as they’re shareholders through 
our share scheme.

Admiral donates to worthy causes across 
our businesses using many avenues. 
A large part of our community investment 
is focused on skills development and 
employability, reducing inequalities 
so that people can lead more secure 
lives. Through our Global Emergency 
Fund we have helped communities 
through devastating events such as the 
wildfires in Canada, flooding in Italy, and 
earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. We also 
fund many environmental causes and 
through our Match Fund employees can 
nominate charities they’d like to support. 
I am proud that our people have given 
over 14,000 hours of their time to such 
great causes. Volunteering for charities, 
mentoring, and planting trees are just 
a few ways our employees got involved 
and made a difference in 2023. 

From a customer perspective, our 
affordability team has supported our 
customers with their payments and 
concerns during the cost of living crisis 
and we have helped them enjoy improved 
customer journeys. During storm events 
we maintained an average weekly call 
answer rate of 97%, demonstrating 
our commitment to our customers 
when they need us.

From an environmental perspective, 
we have targets to reach Net zero by 
2040, and to cut emissions in half by 
20303. Our UK scope 2 emissions have 
already reduced to zero. We are well on 
our way to setting Science Based Targets 
for our emissions which we aim to share 
in the future alongside our Net Zero 
transition plan. Our focus is to do the 
right thing, and this has been reflected in 
an MSCI index rating of AA, as well as an 
improved CDP rating to B.

Q. Are you confident with the 
solvency position and do you have 
any updates on the internal model?
I am confident that our capital position 
remains strong and well above risk 
appetite level. We had a successful debt 
issue during the year and our improved 
solvency rate of 200% is still supportive 
of a stable dividend payout and the 
ability to make future investments. 
We’ve demonstrated over the past 15 
years that we’ve been able to grow 
five insurance businesses from scratch, 
a lending business, and multiple price 
comparison businesses whilst maintaining 
a 90% average pay-out ratio.

In addition, we have been progressing 
on the internal model process and expect 
to enter a pre-application process with 
our regulators soon. We will provide 
a further update when we have more 
information to share.

Geraint Jones
Group Chief Financial Officer

Q: What are your thoughts on 
the 2023 results and what should 
we expect going forward?
I am pleased with how we have come 
through two challenging years, having 
managed a lot of change and navigating 
a complex cycle. Our teams also worked 
very hard as we transitioned to the new 
accounting standard, IFRS 17, to provide 
clear information. 

It was a solid set of results with a healthy 
Profit Before Tax of £443 million driven 
by improvements in almost all businesses. 
We are gaining customers in the UK, Spain, 
Italy and France with Group customer 
growth of 6%. Admiral Money has grown 
profit nearly five-fold to £10.2 million; 
whilst having maintained our cautious 
approach to growth and prudently held 
provisions within the uncertain economic 
context, which we believe continues to 
build a good foundation for the future.

We said 2022 was probably the worst 
point of the cycle, and we are now starting 
to see the benefits of our pricing actions. 
In particular, this is reflected for UK Motor 
Insurance where we slowed growth in 
the first half but managed to grow in the 
second half of 2023, and are well placed 
moving into 2024.

Cristina Nestares
CEO, UK Insurance

Q: What has been the biggest 
challenge for UK Insurance this year?
It’s once again been a year of balancing 
pricing increases with the continued 
high claims inflation and macroeconomic 
uncertainties. Our aim has been to 
navigate this cycle well, focussing on 
profit over growth and maintaining 
pricing discipline. We are now seeing the 
benefits of raising prices ahead of the 
market, with a return to customer growth 
in the second half of the year. Inflation was 
high but stable with high repair costs 
and used car prices impacting claims, as 
well as supply chain pressures and labour 
shortages. Uncertainty on small bodily 
injury claims together with the potential 
impact of wage inflation on large 
bodily injury claims have added to the 
challenges, but we adapted the business 
where needed, with prudent reserving 
and with some changes in our supply 
network having a positive impact. 

Our customer base has remained stable 
despite the year’s challenges showing 
that we can offer our customers good 
quality products and services and give 
them more options through MultiCover 
which saw even more customers take 
up these great products.

We were well placed for the 
implementation of Consumer Duty 
regulation, which aligns with our 
commitment to deliver good value and 
good outcomes for our customers.

I am also proud to say we were voted the 
#1 Best Big Companies to Work For in the 
UK and also #1 in Great Place To Work® 
Best Workplaces in Financial Services and 
Insurance. This along with our 4.4 ‘Excellent’ 
Trustpilot score means we must be doing 
something right for our people and our 
customers – which will remain key going 
into 2024!

Q: How is Home Insurance 
performing? 
The Home Insurance book continues to 
show promise, with customer growth 
of 12% and a profit of £7.9 million. 
Weather events were less severe in 2023, 
but some of the severe weather in 2022, 
particularly the December freeze event, 
continued to impact the 2023 result. 
Weather impacts will naturally come 
through every few years, but the reported 
loss ratio – excluding prior period releases 
and the impact of severe weather - was 
only marginally higher due to inflation as 
we continued to improve risk selection 
and claims capabilities. In response to 
the threat of more regular and severe 
weather, we regularly review our approach 
from a pricing and risk selection and 
claims perspective and continue invest 
in associated areas. 

We have been part of Flood Re since 
2016. Flood Re is an agreement between 
insurers and the UK government which 
allows insurers to offer more affordable 
insurance for UK homes in areas most at 
risk of flooding that were built before 2009. 
This allows us to help more customers get 
the products they need at a fairer price.

Cost efficiencies were observed due 
to our increased scale and higher inflation 
was countered by raising prices ahead 
of the market. The acquisition due in 2024 
of RSA’s direct home and pet operations 
will strengthen our offering and scale 
in these businesses and I am excited 
to welcome our new colleagues from 
the More Than business.

Costantino Moretti
CEO, International Insurance

Q: Are you pleased with the  
progress in EU Insurance after  
a challenging 2022? 
I’m very proud of our hard work this year 
and of the Admiral culture that is so 
embedded in our businesses, reflected 
in having been voted in the top 10 in 
Great Place To Work®4 across all our 
European entities.

We continued to prioritise margin over 
growth and to strengthen business 
fundamentals in tough market 
environments, and delivered much 
improved results overall with a £6 million 
profit before tax in European Motor 
from strong rating action and improved 
efficiency. As Admiral celebrates a big 
birthday, I’ll take a moment to reflect 
back on our journey so far.

Our first international operation, 
Admiral Seguros, was launched in 
2006. The Spanish insurance market is 
challenging, with intense competition. 
Within this context, we focused on 
building strong fundamentals and 
adapting our strategy to market 
dynamics. We now have over 440,000 
customers, a growing direct channel, 
and are setting the basis for future growth 
by investing and expanding our broker 
and partnership channels, for example 
with our ING partnership.

France 6th, Spain 2nd.

ConTe, which was launched in Italy in 2008, 
is our largest business outside the UK 
with more than one million customers. 
We delivered another year of profit and 
a 19% year on year increase in turnover. 
We continue to explore new distribution 
channels while remaining focused on 
our direct channels, efficiency and 
advanced analytics, and market-leading 
customer service.

In France, we launched L’olivier in 2011, 
steadily building scale in the direct market 
and now insuring over 470,000 customers. 
Our sustained focus on margin protection, 
cost controls and efficiency has made 
us very competitive and we are now 
accelerating our product diversification 
with our Household proposition to unlock 
cross-selling opportunities.

We have built good businesses in Europe, 
customer-centric and well set-up for 
sustainable growth and creating long-
term value for the Group, and we intend 
to continue to deliver on our strategy.

Q: What is the outlook 
for the US business?
We launched Elephant in 2009 and 
the last couple of years have seen 
an exceptionally challenging market 
environment with strong competition 
and very high levels of claims inflation. 
We have taken strong action by increasing 
prices to combat claims inflation, cost 
reductions, and improved risk selection. 
The reduced loss reported in 2023 is 
encouraging, and we expect to see further 
benefits from our recovery plan earned 
through in 2024.

In addition, we have built a solid tech 
platform that allows us to service our 
customers better and faster and we 
continued to maintain our commitment 
to Admiral 2.0 with upgrades to our main 
policy and billing IT platform, Guidewire, 
during the year which contributed to 
improving efficiencies.

Looking ahead, we have made good 
progress in exploring options for Elephant 
to reach its full potential in a huge market. 
These assessments take time and are 
receiving our full attention.

Rising 
TO EXTERNAL 
CHALLENGES TO DELIVER 
SOLID RESULTS IN 2023

The past few years have 
surely been some of the most 
challenging in the Group’s  
30-year history  – exiting the 
pandemic into two heavily 
inflationary years leading 
to tough conditions for the 
industry (and of course for 
our customers). And that’s 
not to mention several major 
UK regulatory changes in 
the past couple of years – 
well navigated by our teams.

Our clear goal for 2023 was to significantly 
improve underlying insurance results 
and it’s very positive to see clear 
evidence of that emerging through the 
year. I’ve been very satisfied with the 
disciplined approach taken across the 
Group, even if that resulted in a shrinking 
customer base for a period in the UK 
motor business.

“In 2023, the Group 
delivered a solid set 
of results. 2023 was  
clearly a year where the 
strong actions taken  
since early 2022 started  
to bear fruit.”

Geraint Jones
Group Chief Financial Officer

The 2023 numbers are the first full year 
results reported under the major new 
insurance accounting standard, IFRS 
17. I want to repeat my huge thanks to 
the team involved in getting the Group 
ready to produce these results, which was 
definitely no small achievement A really 
great team effort!

As usual I’ll begin with a quick review 
of the group profit versus last year* 
in the table on the next page.

Considering the impact of the lower 
profitability of the 2021/22 years is still 
an important factor in the 2023 result, 
the near £600 million profit for the main 
business was very positive. Only three 
years have seen higher UK profit and 
two of those were very impacted by 
reduced frequency during the pandemic. 
Critically the impact of significant price 
increases over 2022 and 2023 has led to 
much improved underwriting year results 
which will feed into the results over the 
next few years. The business is well placed 
moving into 2024 too.

The UK Household business continued 
to grow and delivered a profit of around 
£8 million, benefitting from reinsurer 
profit commission related to older years. 
Price increases led to higher average 
premiums which should improve margins 
as we head into 2024. 

Outside the UK our businesses 
substantially improved their combined 
result compared to 2022, with the 
European businesses returning to overall 
profit (despite continuing to invest 
in new products beyond motor and 
diversified distribution within Motor). 
In the US, whilst the reported loss was still 
not small, underlying results showed sharp 
improvement year-on-year thanks to the 
strong actions of our team there.

And a few observations on the other lines:

•  Admiral Money’s £10 million profit 

was a clear highlight; the team took a 
cautious approach to volume through 
the year and paused growth in the 
second half of the year to focus on 
high quality risk selection. We’re very 
comfortable with arrears trends and our 
cautious credit loss provision and the 
business is well set to restart growth 
in 2024

•  In Admiral Pioneer, the tremendous 

growth and continued steps forward in 
products in Veygo stood out, though 
one particularly large claim impacted 
the bottom line. Pioneer continues to 
invest in testing its small commercial 
insurance business line 

•  The cost of the Group’s share schemes 
was basically in line with the previous 
year, but other overheads and charges 
increased fairly notably. There are 
a number of factors explaining the 
increase, many of which shouldn’t be 
repeated in 2024 (e.g. M&A project fees, 

£m

Other costs
Pre-tax profit

adverse currency movement, costs 
to settle a historic Italian tax matter). 
Fuller details on page 52. I definitely 
expect a much lower number in 2024 
(barring anything unexpected).

More Than acquisition 
As mentioned through the report, 
Admiral’s first significant acquisition 
will complete during H1 2024. We will 
fund the upfront payment of £82.5 million 
from free cash. 

As the acquisition is entirely of intangible 
assets with no new capital raised to fund 
it, the transaction will result in a reduction 
to the Group’s solvency ratio of around 
10 points. Given the Group’s very strong 
capital position, this is comfortably 
absorbed. More details on the accounting 
will feature in 2024’s accounts.

Internal model
The Group has been developing an 
internal model to calculate its solvency 
capital requirement (SCR) in a way 
that reflects Admiral’s risk profile more 
accurately than the standard formula and 
allows management to better incorporate 
capital considerations into business 
decisions. The model will calculate the 
SCR for the Group’s main UK lines of 
business and for most of market risk.

Progress to application and approval 
by the Group’s two main prudential 
regulators has been slower than we’d 
have liked, though huge effort from our 
team has gone, and continues to go 
into the project. We expect to enter the 
regulatory pre-application process soon 
and will then hopefully have a clear path 
to application and approval thereafter. 
It’s too early to give concrete information 
on the exact timing of the application or 
likely financial outcome of the process 
and more information will follow at the 
appropriate time.

Dilution 
Starting in 2024 we will make a change 
to the way we provide shares to the 
Group’s employee share schemes. 
Historically we’ve issued new shares to 
the trusts each year, mindful of a 10% 
rolling ten-year cap. We will no longer 
dilute shareholders to fund the share 
schemes, initially (probably for 2024 
and 2025) making use of shares already 
within the trusts and thereafter buying 
shares in the market, funded through a 
reduction in special dividend. This change 
will increase earnings per share by around 
1% per year from now on compared to 
our previous approach.

Wrap-up
Whilst the current year reported profit 
won’t break many records, 2023 was 
clearly a year when the strong actions 
taken since early 2022 started to bear 
fruit. We enter 2024 with much improved 
margins across our insurance businesses 
and a strong position in Admiral Money. 
I look forward to seeing the improvements 
start to feed through into the reported 
results in 2024.

A note on the 2022 IFRS 17 comparatives:  
As explained more fully on page 37, the 
restated 2022 IFRS 17 insurance profits 
are lower than the originally reported 
IFRS4 numbers. This is due to differences 
in the movements in reserve strength or 
risk adjustment position over 2022 under 
each standard.

Celebrating
COLLEAGUES  
THAT HAVE  
BEEN HERE  
SINCE THE START

As our co-founder Henry Engelhardt 
said “people who like what 
they do, do it better”, and this 
has underpinned our culture 
across the Group for the last 30 
years. Since starting out in our 
Cardiff office in 1993 with just 
51 colleagues, to growing to over 
13,000 across the world today, 
we have always put our people at 
the heart of what we do. We are 
incredibly proud that some of those 
51 colleagues have stayed with us 
for the last 30 years and helped 
make us the Company we are today.

We asked them what they remember 
about their first day at Admiral and what 
has kept them here…

What do you remember about your 
first day at Admiral?
Tim: This should be fun!

Bethan: How small the department was! 
I’d followed my friend Teri to Admiral from 
our previous jobs (she started September 
1992 and is also still here) so I wasn’t 
nervous, and it took about 10 minutes 
to meet everyone. IT were based on floor 
11 of the building along with ex-CEO 
and founder Henry, the server room, post 
room and Marketing – a tight squeeze!

Teri: I was convinced I’d made a horrible 
mistake. When I accepted the job, we were 
called DIAL and that’s what my contract 
said. On my first day I came into the office 
to find we’d changed our name, we had 
desks and PCs but no chairs so I had to sit 
on a pile of boxes of listing paper. Bear in 
mind that this was only three months 
before we were due to launch. I spent 
the first couple of weeks at offices in 
Reading amending I/90 to fit our model 
of direct insurance.

What has been your best Admiral 
memory from the past 30 years?
Tim: Probably the day we floated 
after many years of waiting to see if it 
would happen.

Teri: There have been a few days that 
stand out; my first day, the day we opened 
for business, the day we floated!

Bethan: I know most people say it was 
when we floated on the Stock Exchange, 
but I was on maternity leave then and 
missed all the excitement in work! Other 
highlights for me have been the Stay 
at Home Refund during the pandemic. 
A few of us worked on that, and after it 
was tested and live - which was done really 
quickly - we monitored and ran the job 
every day for a month to get them all out 
by when we’d promised. Twitter was  
good for instant feedback, I loved seeing 
people post about what they were doing 
with their £25. My favourite was a girl  
who bought new slippers and spent the 
rest on cider!

What kinds of roles have you had 
during your time at Admiral?
Bethan: I’ve been in IT Development 
since I joined - I started as an Analyst/
Programmer, then Senior Analyst/
Programmer, Team Manager. 

Tim: I started in the Post Room, then 
moved to IT. Then within IT I’ve moved 
from Operations in Cardiff to Swansea 
and back again to Cardiff again!

What makes Admiral special to you?
Teri: Every day is different and every 
day is a challenge. What makes Admiral 
special; even seeing the business grow 
from 30-odd people to over 13,000, 
it’s never lost its small local Company 
feeling. I doubt you’d see senior managers 
in the lift dressed in pyjamas in every 
major Company.

Bethan: The answer to this has changed 
as the Company has grown and changed. 
In the early days, it was that we felt like 
a family and everyone knew everyone. 
When we got too big for that, it was the 
way Admiral looks after us and the rewards 
that come as a by-product of that. 
Along the way it’s been the interesting 
work, and more recently it’s been how 
we give back to the community and the 
world. There’ll always be something to  
be proud of.

Reporting 
ANOTHER SOLID 
SET OF RESULTS

Group highlights
Admiral reports another solid set of results 
in 2023 against a backdrop of continued 
elevated levels of claims inflation, and 
resulting significant rate increases. 

Highlights of the Group’s results for 2023 
are as follows:

•  Businesses across the Group grew 
strongly in 2023, with customer 
numbers up 6% and turnover up 
significantly more at 31% year-on-year:

–  UK Motor customers were broadly 
flat at the end of 2023 having 
fallen in the first half. Market price 
increases accelerated relative to 
Admiral in the second half, leading 
to improved competitiveness and a 
return to growth 

–  UK Household grew turnover by 33% 
as a result of an increase in customers 
of 12% and continued increases in 
average premium. Including Travel 
Insurance, (which reported its first 
small profit), and Pet Insurance, 
overall UK insurance customers grew 
by 6%

–  Outside the UK, International 
Insurance customer numbers 
increased by 4%, made up of a 7% 
increase in Europe and a reduction 
in the US. Increases in average 
premiums to reflect the level of 
claims inflation led to a growth in 
turnover of 12%

–  Admiral Money has employed a 

controlled approach to growth, with 
a total loans balance at the year end 
of £0.96 billion, 8% growth since 
December 2022 and slightly lower 
than the HY 2023 position. 

•  Group pre-tax profit was £443 million, 
23% higher than 2022, restated on an 
IFRS 17 basis:

–  UK Motor Insurance profit was 

£593 million, 13% higher than 2022 
(£525 million) as the significant 
increases in average premium 
over the last year started to earn 
through, as well as higher investment 
income due to the higher interest 
rate environment

–  UK Household reported a profit of 

£8 million (2022: loss of £11 million), 
with 2023 less impacted by severe 
weather events, and benefitting from 
the positive impact of a commutation 
of quota share arrangements on prior 
underwriting years. 

•  The International Insurance business 

reported a notably lower loss of 
£18 million (2022: £56 million):

–  The EU Motor business returned 

to a profit of £6 million for the year 
(2022: loss of £16 million), as a result 
of a lower current year combined 
ratio arising from higher average 
premiums and small releases on prior 
underwriting years

–  The result in the US also improved 
from a loss of £36 million in 2022 
to a loss of £20 million in 2023, 
following actions taken to improve 
the underwriting result through 
large price increases and a focus on 
reducing costs. 

•  Admiral Money reported a higher profit 
of £10 million (2022: £2 million), the 
increase in the average loans portfolio 
year-on-year driving the positive result 
through increased net interest income 

•  Other Group costs increased to 

£146 million (2022: £94 million), the 
adverse movement driven by higher 
central costs due to a number of one-
off items, as well as higher business 
development costs and finance charges.

Earnings per share 
Earnings per share for 2023 is 111.2 pence 
(2022: 95.4 pence, restated on an IFRS 17 
basis). The increase from 2022 is aligned 
to the increase in pre-tax profit above, 
offset partly by a higher effective tax rate, 
with the increase in the UK corporation 
tax rate to 25% (from 19%) from 1 April 
2023 being a significant driver of the 
higher effective rate. 

Return on equity
The Group’s return on equity was 
36% in 2023, 7 points higher than the 
restated 29% for 2022. Average equity 
for 2023 is lower than 2022 as a result 
of the transition to IFRS 17 and higher 
dividends were paid out compared to 
profits recognised on an IFRS 17 basis. 
2022 full year post-tax profits on an 
IFRS 17 basis were £86 million lower 
than those reported under the previous 
standard, IFRS 4. Further information on 
the restatement of 2022 financials follows 
later in the report. 

“We enter 2024 with 
improved margins across 
our insurance businesses 
and a strong position 
in Admiral Money.”

Geraint Jones 
Group Chief Financial Officer

Dividends 
The Group’s dividend policy is to pay 65% 
of post-tax profits as a normal dividend 
and to pay a further special dividend 
comprising earnings not required to be 
held in the Group for solvency or buffers.

The Board has proposed a final dividend 
of 52.0 pence per share (approximately 
£156 million) split as follows:

•  35.4 pence per share normal dividend

•  A special dividend of 16.6 pence 

per share

The 2023 final dividend reflects a pay-out 
ratio of 97% of second half earnings 
per share. 52.0 pence per share is in line 
with the final 2022 dividend (52.0 pence 
per share). 

The total 2023 dividend, including the 
interim dividend of 51.0 pence per share, 
declared with the Group’s interim 2023 
results is 103.0 pence per share, 8% lower 
than the 112.0 pence per share paid 
in 2022. 

The total 2022 dividend also included the 
final additional special dividend of 45.0 
pence per share arising from the phased 
return to shareholders of the proceeds 
from the sale of the Penguin Portals 
comparison businesses which completed 
in 2021. The total 2022 dividend was 
157.0 pence per share.

The 2023 final dividend payment date is 
7 June 2024, ex-dividend date 9 May 2024 
and record date 10 May 2024.

Re-statement of prior  
period comparatives following  
IFRS 17 adoption 
IFRS 17, the new insurance contracts 
accounting standard has been effective 
from 1 January 2023. As a result, the 
opening balance sheet as at 1 January 
2022, the 2022 comparative Income 
Statement and the balance sheet as at 
31 December 2022 have been restated 
under IFRS 17, using a fully retrospective 
approach (i.e. as though IFRS 17 had 
always been in place). 

The new accounting policies and choices 
adopted in the implementation of IFRS 
17 are disclosed in the notes to these 
financial statements. Both the policies 
and transition impact are consistent with 
the key accounting policy decisions and 
transition impact set out on page 234 of 
the 2022 Annual Report.

Throughout this report, the Group’s 
results under IFRS 17 at 31 December 
2023 are compared to the 31 December 
2022 comparatives which have been 
restated under IFRS 17. 

IFRS 17 reported profits for 2022 are 
lower than the previously reported IFRS 4 
profits. The difference primarily arises as 
a result of differences in the movements 
in reserve strength or risk adjustment 
position over 2022 under each standard. 
Under IFRS 4, Admiral moved down to the 
95th percentile over the course of 2022, 
with a greater proportion of this move 
taking place in the second half of the 
year. Under IFRS 17, Admiral moved down 
to the 95th percentile at the transition 
date of 1 January 2022, and remained at 
that percentile during 2022. This results 
in lower reserve releases under IFRS 17 in 
2022, and therefore lower profit. 

Note 1 to the financial statements 
provides further information regarding 
the key factors driving the differences 
between the IFRS 4 and IFRS 17 reported 
results in 2022.

Economic backdrop
Global inflation continued to impact 
claims inflation across Admiral’s markets 
in 2023, although with some positive signs 
of improvement in the second half of 
the year, particularly in the Group’s main 
UK market. 

The main drivers of this claims inflation 
continue to be higher repair costs, 
longer repair timescales and high levels 
of wage inflation which impacts the 
projected costs of bodily injury claims. 
Used car prices continue to be one of 
the largest contributors to damage 
inflation, although they stabilised in 2023 
with inflation easing in the latter part of 
the year.

Admiral continues to focus on medium 
term profitability, and has maintained a 
disciplined approach to business volumes, 
increasing prices to reflect the elevated 
claims inflation. The Group customer 
base has continued to grow, although this 
disciplined approach has resulted in slower 
growth in some businesses. UK Motor 
customers were broadly flat year-on-year 
at the end of 2023, having slowed in the 
first half as a result of price increases 
ahead of the market since 2022, offset by 
growth during the second half of the year 
as Admiral increased prices at a slower rate 
than the market. The Group continues to 
set claims reserves cautiously.

Admiral Money grew its consumer loans 
book year-on-year, though the portfolio 
reduced in size in the second half due 
to a prudent approach reflecting the 
macroeconomic environment and 
potential financial impact on consumers. 
The business continues to hold 
appropriately cautious provisions for 
credit losses.

The Group’s results  
are presented in the  
following sections:
•  UK Insurance – including UK 

Motor (Car and Van), Household, 
Travel and Pet

•  International Insurance – 

including L’olivier (France), 
Admiral Seguros (Spain), ConTe 
(Italy), and Elephant (US)

•  Admiral Money

•  Other Group Items – including 
Admiral Pioneer and other 
central costs

UK Insurance review

Finding
WAYS TO MAKE
A DIFFERENCE

2023 was a more encouraging 
year after a difficult 2022 for 
the industry. Inflationary pressures 
began to stabilise and our early 
and strong pricing response 
positions the business for a robust 
improvement in results. 

Product proposition and pricing 
enhancements and the Group’s 
commitment to helping more people 
to look after their future, led to the 
growth of the UK customer base by 
6% while achieving a Trustpilot rating 
of 4.4 (one of the best in the industry). 
Further, to remain competitively 
priced, we continued to focus on 
improving operational efficiencies 
and sustaining our leading position 
in claims management. 

The cost-of-living crisis has created 
a lot of pressure for our people and in 
addition to the energy support payments 
and package improvements in 2022, 
we officially recognised that we were 
paying our people the real living wage 
by signing up to the Real Living Wage 
Foundation in 2023. 

Our award winning culture was again 
recognised by being placed in the Top 10 
Great Places to Work survey and number 
three for Great Places to Work for women. 
A feature of our culture throughout our 
history is to support our communities 
and in 2023 our teams provided over 
14,000 impact hours and helped over 
a thousand people into work or helped 
them to gain new skills with funding 
and support for our community partners. 

Inflation remained elevated compared 
to pre-pandemic years. Supply chain 
pressures across the global repair network 
led to slower damage repair times during 
2022 and early 2023, resulting in service 
pressures across the industry. In response, 
Admiral leveraged our scale and strong 
working relationships with our repair 
network partners to counter these 
effects, leading to good improvements in 
repair times and easing service challenges 
faced by our teams. Overall, damage 
inflation appears to have moderated 
towards the end of the year from the 
levels seen during 2022, but higher wage 
inflation is likely to feed into bodily injury 
claims over time, which we have provided 
for in our reserves. 

Beyond motor, our diversification 
businesses continued to show growth 
and deliver against key objectives. 
Our strong multi-product proposition 
and retention performance supported 
further growth in our Household insurance 
business, despite unprecedented rate 
increases during the year to offset 
inflation pressures. Enhanced pricing 
capabilities and improvements to the 
Household proposition has established 
a great platform to capitalise on 
future opportunities. The refreshed 
Pet proposition that was relaunched 
in late 2022 appears to resonate with 
our customers and the book has grown 
strongly (albeit from a low base). 
The acquisition of the More Than Pet 
and Household renewal rights from Royal 
Sun Alliance (RSA) will give a further 
boost to these businesses, significantly 
accelerating our growth ambitions for Pet. 

Our Travel business has bounced back 
very well post-pandemic with record sales 
volumes and a growing renewal book, 
and reports a profit for the first time. 

“A solid set of results, 
demonstrating the 
resilience of the business 
during challenging 
economic conditions, 
whilst continuing to 
invest in the business, 
and support our 
customers and people.”

Cristina Nestares
CEO, UK Insurance

We’re very pleased that our motor book 
has returned to growth in the last six 
months of 2023, after 12 months of 
contraction following our disciplined 
approach of strong price increases 
to offset the impact of inflation. 
Our relatively early pricing response 
led to a fall in our competitiveness and 
market share in the second half of 2022 
and first half of 2023. We recognise that 
the market moves in cycles and there 
are times when it’s better to protect 
margin at the expense of growth, 
with a view to capturing volume when 
the market opportunity arises.

OUR 
CUSTOMERS 
DURING THE 
COST OF 
LIVING CRISIS

Formed during the Covid pandemic, 
our Affordability team, has helped 
to further focus on how we look 
after vulnerable policyholders. 
With high inflation and the high 
cost of living in the UK, the team 
has been working with our most 
impacted policyholders to get 
their insurance payments back 
on track. The team plays a pivotal 
role in helping customers who 
are struggling, as well as those 
dealing with other concerns 
such as terminal illness, loss of 
employment, disability, and 
mental health. 

In 2023, we trained over 3,000 colleagues 
on vulnerable customer awareness 
to better identify and support these 
customers. We also introduced a 
phone line that UK customers can call 
for support and discuss alternative 
payment arrangements. The feedback 
has been resoundingly positive, with one 
customer saying:

“The amount of stress I’ve been in 
lately in terms of finances has been 
very overwhelming. I lost my dad in 
December, prior to that he had remained 
in hospital. I’m now the only driver in 
my household and I passed my test 
because I needed to take responsibility 
for my family. I’ve never been in financial 
difficulty, and I’m just trying to get back 
on track. I can’t thank you enough for 
helping me in my lowest time.” 

To sustain our competitiveness and 
operational resilience, we’ve continued 
to invest to refresh our technology 
estate and transform our channel and 
distribution capabilities. During the 
year, a key pillar of the strategy was the 
migration of over 6.5 million customer 
risks to a new policy and billing centre 
on Guidewire, which I’m proud to say 
was successfully completed. 

2023 will be defined as the key turning 
point in the recent challenging 
insurance cycle and I believe we’re well 
positioned with a strong team and 
good fundamentals to capture market 
opportunities for profitable growth in 
2024 and further earnings momentum.

Highlights for the UK Insurance business include:
•  In UK Motor Insurance:

–  Customer numbers grew in the second half of the year, to finish at 4.94 million, 
in line with a year earlier. Admiral’s price increases to account for claims inflation 
in the second half of 2022 and early 2023 were more significant than the wider 
market, but this gap closed over the latter part of 2023. Turnover increased by 
35% to £3.4 billion from £2.5 billion

–  Profit growth of 13% to £593 million (v £525 million) as the rate increases 
implemented over the past year are now earning through, and the higher 
interest yield environment results in increased investment income.

•  In UK Household Insurance:

–  Customer numbers grew by 12% to 1.76 million (31 December 

2022: 1.58 million). As in Motor, price increases have led to higher average 
premiums which contributed to a strong 33% increase in turnover

–  Profit was £7.9 million (2022: loss of £10.7 million) as a result of less severe 

impact of weather in 2023 compared to 2022, along with the benefit of the 
commutation of quota share arrangements on prior underwriting years.

UK Motor profit increased by 13% to 
£593.3 million (2022: £524.9 million) as 
a result of a lower current period loss 
ratio as the significant rate increases 
from late 2022 and early 2023 start 
to earn through, as well as higher net 
investment income due to the higher 
interest rate environment. This was partly 
offset by lower quota share recoveries 
due to both the more favourable 
current period loss ratio and continued 
loss ratio improvements on prior 
underwriting years, and lower co-insurer 
profit commission.

By year end 2023, customer numbers 
were flat when compared to the end of 
2022, with growth in the second half 
of 2023 due to market price increases 
resulting in Admiral becoming increasingly 
competitive, after lower customers 
earlier in the year due to the strong price 
increases implemented by Admiral ahead 
of the market in late 2022 and early 2023 
reflecting the inflationary environment.

Gross earned premium at 
£2,115.4 million is 18% higher than 2022 
(2022: £1,795.7 million), reflecting the 
significant increase in average earned 
premium as the price increases over the 
last year start to earn through. 

The UK Motor core expense ratio 
decreased to 21.4% (2022: 21.6%), 
with the written expense ratio decreasing 
by 3 points to 17.8% (2022: 20.8%), as 
a result of the higher premiums noted 
above. Insurance expenses are higher 
in 2023, driven by wage increases, 
higher amortisation of intangible assets 
from the new systems that are now 
in use, and a short-term increased cost 
of claims handling as new claims systems 
were implemented.

The movement in onerous loss 
component reflects the movement in 
the provision for projected claims costs, 
inclusive of risk adjustment, on unearned 
premium. The onerous loss component at 
the start and end of 2023 was small (less 
than £2 million), with movements over the 
course of both years leading to immaterial 
impacts in the Income Statement. 

41

Claims incurred 
Claims inflation remains high and 
continues to be influenced by the average 
costs of repairing vehicles, in turn due to 
the elevated cost of replacement parts 
and paint, as well as high labour costs 
and shortages. Used car price inflation 
has stabilised, showing signs of slowing 
down in the second half of the year, 
and repair times have also started to 
reduce resulting in stabilising costs for 
replacement vehicles. 

Average claims cost inflation for 2023 is 
approximately 10%, with higher inflation 
in the first half of 2023, easing modestly 
in the second half. Claims frequency was 
also slightly higher in 2023 compared to 
2022 as a result of increased miles driven, 
although remains below pre-Covid levels. 

The longer-term impacts of inflation on 
bodily injury claims remain uncertain. 
Admiral has not observed material 
changes in inflation for bodily injury 
claims settled in 2023 when compared to 
2022. However, an allowance in the best 
estimate reserve to reflect the potential 
impacts of higher than historic levels of 
future wage inflation on certain elements 
of large bodily injury claims reserves, 
is maintained.

There is still a relatively high level of 
uncertainty within motor claims across 
the market arising from inflation and the 
future developments relating to both 

whiplash reforms and the Ogden discount 
rate. The review of the Ogden discount 
rate is due to start in mid-2024, with the 
new rate, and any change to methodology, 
unlikely to be known until late 2024 or 
early 2025. Admiral’s assumption for the 
Ogden discount rate within best estimate 
reserves continues to be the prevailing 
rate of minus 0.25 per cent. 

Admiral holds significant and prudent risk 
adjustment above best estimate reserves, 
which has reduced (93rd percentile 
confidence level) when compared to the 
end of 2022 (95th percentile confidence 
level), the movement being in line with 
expectations given the slightly less 
volatile inflationary environment and a 
perceived lower likelihood of an adverse 
movement in the Ogden discount 
rate, together with the continued 
diversification of the business. Whilst the 
underlying methods to calibrate the 
reserve risk distribution from which the 
percentile is selected are consistent year 
on year, a number of developments in the 
reserve risk modelling in 2023 result in a 
slightly less volatile distribution than at 
the end of 2022.

Further information is included in notes 2, 
3 and 5 to the financial statements.

The core Motor loss ratio has reduced to 
66.8% (2022: 75.7%) as a result of a lower 
current period loss ratio. Movements in 
the current period loss ratio and prior year 
reserve releases were as follows:

*1. Reported Motor loss ratio shown on a discounted basis, excluding unwind of finance expenses

The current period loss ratio improved 
by 8.7 points which can be primarily 
attributed to higher average premium 
in the period following significant 
price increases.

The benefit from prior period releases 
was flat at 20.2% (2022: 20.0%), with the 
absolute level of prior period releases 
increasing by £65.6 million or 20% to 
£392.8 million, from £327.2 million. 
The benefit includes both favourable 
development of the best estimate reserve 
for prior period claims, and the movement 
in the risk adjustment as set out above. 
Reserve releases as a percentage of 
premium are heavily impacted by the 18% 
increase in earned premium in the year.

Quota share reinsurance
Under IFRS 17, Admiral’s quota share 
reinsurance result reflects the net 
movement on ceded premiums, reinsurer 
margins and expected recoveries (claims 
and expenses) for each underwriting 
year on which quota share reinsurance 
is in place (primarily 2021 underwriting 
year onwards). 

Admiral’s UK Motor quota share 
contracts operate on a funds withheld 
basis, with Admiral retaining ceded 
premium (net of the reinsurer margin) 
which then covers claims and expenses. 
If an underwriting year is not profitable, 
investment income is allocated to the 
withheld fund and used to delay the point 
at which cash recoveries are collected 
from the reinsurer. Other features of the 
arrangements include expense ratio caps 
and commutation options for Admiral 
that become available 24-36 months after 
the start of the underwriting year.

Total

The adverse quota share result in 2023 is 
therefore driven by:

–  Lower recoveries of £30.3 million on 
the 2023 underwriting year (UWY 
2023) compared to £91.0 million 
recoveries on the 2022 underwriting 
year (UWY 2022) in 2022 due to the 
significantly improved loss ratio on 
UWY 2023 compared to UWY 2022

–  A significant reversal of recoveries 

that had been previously recognised 
on the 2021 underwriting 
year, as a result of favourable 
developments in loss ratio.

Co-insurer profit commission 
Co-insurer profit commission is lower 
in 2023 (£76.5 million) compared to 
2022 (£127.5 million). In 2022, a greater 
proportion of the reserve releases were 
related to older underwriting years 
(2019 and prior) which have lower 
combined ratios, with the releases 
therefore attracting higher profit 
commission. In addition, in 2023 no profit 
commission has been recognised on 
underwriting years 2021 and 2022 
due to the current combined ratio 
positions on those years.

Net investment income
Net investment income benefitted 
significantly from the higher yield 
environment during 2023, increasing to 
£53.6 million from £17.4 million in 2022. 
Investment income before insurance 
finance expense more than doubled 
to £111.8 million (2022: £53.8 million) 
primarily as a result of the yield 
environment. Further information on 
the Group’s investment portfolio and 
the income generated in the period 
is provided in the Investments and Cash 
section later in the report. 

Net insurance finance expense reflects 
the unwind of the discounting benefit 
recognised when claims are initially 
incurred. The expense has increased 
significantly in 2023 (£58.2 million; 
2022 £36.4 million) as a result of the 
significant increase in risk-free interest 
rates since the start of 2022, with a 
significant proportion of the insurance 
finance expense in 2023 relating to claims 
incurred during 2022 and, to a slightly 
lesser extent, 2023.

43

Admiral generates other revenue from 
a portfolio of insurance products that 
complement the core car insurance 
product, and fees, generated over the 
life of the policy. The most material 
contributors to other revenue continue 
to be: 

•  Profit earned from Motor policy 
upgrade products underwritten 
by Admiral, including breakdown, 
car hire and personal injury covers 

•  Revenue from other insurance products, 

not underwritten by Admiral

•  Fees such as administration and 

cancellation fees 

•  Interest charged to customers paying 

for cover in instalments.

Under IFRS 17, income from underwritten 
ancillaries and an allocation of instalment 
income and administration fees in 
line with Admiral’s gross share of the 
core motor product premium, are 
included within Insurance Revenue in 
the underwriting result as ‘Gross other 
insurance revenue’. The remaining income 
from instalment income, fees as well 
as income from other non-underwritten 
ancillary products is presented in other 
net income. 

Overall contribution increased to 
£247.3 million (2022: £236.8 million), 
primarily as a result of increased 
instalment income following an increase 
in the proportion of customers paying 
by instalment and the increase in 
average premiums.

Other revenue was equivalent to £62 
per vehicle (gross of costs), with net other 
revenue per vehicle at £52 per vehicle, 
both favourable compared to 2022 as 
a result of the above-mentioned increases 
as well as a broadly flat customer base.

UK Insurance review
continued

The UK Household business enjoyed 
strong top line growth in 2023 with a 
33% increase in turnover to £338.6 million 
(2022: £255.4 million) as a result of 
significant price increases in response to 
higher claims inflation. 

The number of households insured 
increased by 12% to just under 1.8 million 
with Admiral’s multicover offering 
contributing strongly to the growth. 

The result for the year also improved 
materially, with the business delivering 
a profit of £7.9 million compared to a loss 
of £10.7 million in 2022. The improvement 
was due to two factors: 

•  The impact of severe weather and 

subsidence in 2023 was significantly 
lower in 2023 than 2022. Whilst the 
final quarter of 2023 saw a run  
of named storms which were the main 
contributor to the £9.8 million weather 
impact in the year, 2022 was impacted 
by a significant winter freeze event 
which impacted the prior year result 
by £33.3 million. 

•  The 2023 result benefitted from a 

one-off recognition of reinsurer profit 
commission relating to prior period 
following a commutation. This benefit 
is recognised in the quota share 
reinsurance result, with the prior period 
quota share result being negatively 
impacted by the original de-recognition 
of that profit commission following 
significant weather events. 

The reported loss ratio for the period 
was 70.2%, increasing to 72.6% when 
excluding prior period releases which 
primarily reflect the reduction in risk 
adjustment in the current period. 
The impact of releases on the 2023 
reported loss ratio (benefit of 2.4 points) 
is lower than the prior period (benefit 
of 7.4 points) partly as a result of an 
increase in the estimate of the ultimate 
cost of the December 2022 freeze event. 

The reported loss ratio - excluding prior 
period releases and the impact of severe 
weather - for 2023 was 61.3%, marginally 
higher than the equivalent ratio for 2022 
of 59.9%. The impact of higher claims 
inflation was largely matched by the 
increases in average premium, which 
earned through in the second half of the 
year and are expected to continue earning 
through into 2024. 

Admiral’s expense ratio improved to 
29.4% (2022: 31.4%), with the impact 
of continued investment in technology 
more than offset by increasing 
average premiums and the benefits of 
increased scale.  

The quota share result for the period was 
a loss of £1.4 million (2022: £9.2 million 
profit). Despite the benefit from the 
one-off recognition of reinsurer profit 
commission, the quota share result was 
materially lower than 2022 as there was 
no repeat of the recoveries made from 
reinsurers following the December 2022 
freeze event. 

Overall, excluding the impact of severe 
weather, profit for the period was 
£17.7 million, £4.9 million lower than 2022 
(2022: £22.6 million), primarily as a result 
of the slightly higher attritional loss ratio.

Establishing
A DIVERSIFIED 
SET OF CHANNELS 
AND PRODUCTS

In 2023, markets continued 
to be challenging with high 
claims severity inflation, 
and the Motor insurance 
industry has reported high 
combined ratios. Within this 
context, we continued to 
prioritise margin over growth 
and managed to achieve 
solid customer and turnover 
growth, with average 
premiums finally growing 
in all geographies.

Despite the inflation decelerated 
compared to 2022 it remains high, placing 
pressure on claims, so it is imperative 
to continue to stay prudent and 
prioritise profitability.

The overall profit in Europe is a combined 
outcome of the positive contribution 
from Italy and France, while Spain has 
reported a loss. France and Italy are now 
both profitable, and we will continue to 
grow the book with discipline and invest 
in diversification (distribution in Italy; 
product with Household in France). 

“Markets hit the worst 
part of their cycle in 2023, 
but we have continued 
to demonstrate strong 
performance and results.”

Costantino Moretti
CEO, International Insurance

The Spanish result is a function of the 
unprecedented high combined ratio 
of the Motor insurance industry, as well 
as continued investment to build our 
distribution diversification capabilities. 
We have taken strong action and have built 
good foundations, which we believe will 
result in improved performance in 2024.

The US has shown a strong improvement 
of all KPIs and has reported a lower loss 
compared to last year. We are confident 
that the actions taken will continue to 
have a positive impact and contribute to 
move Elephant closer to breakeven.

Due to those improvements, Elephant 
did not require a capital injection from 
the Group and we expect this will also 
be the case in 2024. We have made good 
progress on assessing strategic options 
and we are now deep diving on a short list 
of them, aiming to get to a final decision 
in the first part of 2024.

I am grateful for the hard work of 
our employees who have made our 
companies a Great Place to Work. I am 
also proud of the focus we have put on 
helping our customers and supporting 
the communities in which we operate. 
Well done to the team, as we look forward 
to a positive 2024!

“In a difficult market 
environment, we 
delivered good results and 
operational successes.”

Antonio Bagetta 
CEO, ConTe

In 2023, L’olivier performed well in the 
context of challenging market conditions. 
Amidst escalating inflation and sluggish 
market volumes that fell short of 
projections, L’olivier adeptly navigated 
these uncertainties by prioritising margin 
protection. This approach inevitably 
moderated our growth trajectory, 
resulting in a 6% year-on-year increase 
in our motor policy base up to 420,000 
customers. Concurrently, our turnover saw 
a 15% increase to £219 million, bolstered 
by a robust average premium.

By proactively adjusting our pricing 
strategies ahead of competitors, we 
saw favourable loss ratio development. 
This, combined with stringent expense 
control and continuous enhancements in 
operational efficiency, culminated in our 
fifth year of written profits, achieving a 
robust 95% written combined ratio. 

Looking ahead to 2024, L’olivier is set to 
further leverage our commitment to 
digitalisation and artificial intelligence 
deployment (for example, pushing 
100% of new claims notification online). 
This pivotal focus aims to serve our 
customers faster and enables better 
service while increasing our cost efficiency.

We are also poised to expedite our 
product diversification with further 
development in household insurance, 
continuing our 2023 trend when turnover 
grew by more than 100% (albeit from a 
low base). This aligns with our ongoing 
strategy to enhance cross-selling and our 
multi-product offering.

Finally, I would like to thank all L’olivier 
staff for their energy, enthusiasm 
and great contribution to these good 
2023 results.

2023 was a positive year for ConTe, with 
continued focus on sustainable growth: 
+20% revenue increase led by higher 
average premiums (+13%) and customer 
growth (+7%). Market conditions have 
been improving, following a challenging 
2022 which saw the market combined 
ratio increase to 108% and 128% for 
the direct channel. These inflationary 
pressures, together with regulatory 
changes, led direct competitors to raise 
prices materially, allowing ConTe.it to do 
the same.

Our key aim is to be a very profitable 
insurer in Italy through advanced 
technologies and analytics. 
We strengthened our fundamentals with 
a new data platform which improves 
the time to market for analytics 
model releases.

Sustainability has been a cornerstone of 
our operations making significant strides 
in being more efficient (4pp of written 
expense ratio reduction), responding 
to customers’ needs and expectations, 
investing in data capabilities and ensuring 
long term-viability.

ConTe also achieved the highest NPS in 
the industry and the best Trustpilot score 
for online insurance, largely reflecting our 
excellent operational service levels.

Our people remained a key priority in 
2023. We implemented several wellbeing 
initiatives and increased our GPTW 
Trust index by 9 points to 87 in 2023. 
We were also awarded by Milano Finanza 
for our innovative approach to people 
management, and in particular for our 
Corporate Welfare, Employee Benefit and 
Family Care Welfare. 

It has been a year of operational 
successes, with sustainable growth of the 
Italian business driven by higher average 
premium and number of customers, 
continuing to strengthen our data and 
technological innovation and the launch 
of new channels. In addition, we continued 
to focus on our customers and our people, 
and I would like to thank the ConTe team 
for their continued commitment and hard 
work in 2023!

“We are starting to  
see the benefit of strong 
actions taken during 
tough market  
conditions in 2023.”

“Despite very challenging 
market conditions, 
Elephant materially 
improved its result with 
reduced losses in 2023.”

Alberto Schiavon 
CEO, Elephant 

Claims inflation was the major theme 
for the Spanish car insurance industry in 
2023. Q4 market results showed a market 
combined ratio12 exceeding 100% for the 
first time in two decades. Market price 
correction started early in the year and 
accelerated in the second half, we expect 
this trend to continue into 2024.

Admiral Seguros was not immune to this 
market context. Inflation in the first two 
quarters was ahead of our expectation, 
putting pressure on loss ratios for both 
the 2022 and 2023 underwriting years. 
We took strong action, raising prices more 
than the market across all channels with 
a focus on protecting margin. Q4 average 
premium was up 16% vs a year earlier, 
despite a portfolio shift towards lower-risk 
profiles. The increasing trend in income 
per policy contributed to an improved 
expense ratio and sets the business up 
well going into 2024. 

With a more medium-term perspective, 
we continued to invest in new distribution 
channels as routes to future scale. 
June saw the successful launch of our 
digital insurance product for ING bank, 
“Seguro de Auto NARANJA”. This has 
attracted positive feedback about both 
the product and purchase experience. 
In the broker channel, we reinforced our 
commercial management team and 
made pleasing progress in underwriting. 
We improved productivity, and enhanced 
our digital servicing platforms, increasing 
our digital sales ratio by 30%, becoming 
even more responsive to customer needs.

For another consecutive year, we were 
voted 2nd Great Place to Work in Spain, 
winning the special prize “Better for 
People” in recognition of a collaborative 
and open team culture. I would like to 
thank all of my colleagues for their hard 
work and contribution during 2023.

In 2023, Elephant materially improved its 
result with a reduced loss of £20 million 
from £36 million in 2022, in line with our 
commitment to turn around our financial 
performance and despite very challenging 
market conditions with sustained severity 
inflation. Our combined ratio decreased 
by around 9 points13 (compared to an 
industry projection of 3.514 points lower) 
driven by improvements in both our loss 
and expense ratios.

Our expense ratio was 5 points15 better 
than 2022, benefitting from efficiency 
initiatives (including a reduction in 
headcount) and a more favourable 
acquisition market. The latter was driven 
by reduced competition in a difficult 
market, as many players lowered their 
growth appetite to protect their bottom 
line while increasing rates.

Our loss ratio improved by 4 points16 
as a result of strong rating action and 
intentional mix shift towards lower loss 
ratio segments and away from newer 
channels and states. We increased base 
rates by an additional 38% in 2023, 
compared to circa 16% across the top 
five players in our states.17 Important to 

note is that the most recent underwriting 
quarters continue to show improving 
results compared to prior ones, at the 
same point of development. It remains 
early days but this is promising. 

Our significant rate increases over the last 
few years have led to a 18% reduction in 
vehicles insured throughout 2023, but at 
a substantially higher average premium, 
leading to an overall growth in turnover 
of 1%. 

I am very grateful to the Elephant team 
for the dedication, hard work, and 
commitment in delivering excellent 
customer service, modernising our 
technology stack, while improving our 
business fundamentals at a much faster 
rate than the market.

In the US, Admiral underwrites motor 
insurance through its Elephant Auto 
business. After a disappointing 2022 and 
in a context of high inflationary pressures, 
Elephant focused on materially improving 
its underwriting result in 2023 with 
strong rating action and cost reduction. 
The conscious decision to focus on 
improving underwriting results led to an 
18% decrease in the number of vehicles 
insured to 0.19 million (2022: 0.24 million), 
a moderately higher turnover of 
£271.2 million (2022: £268.5 million) and 
a reduced loss before tax of £19.6 million 
(2022: loss of £36.4 million). In light of 
this early progress, the business did not 
need further capital from the Group in 
2023. Elephant will continue to prioritise 
improving the loss ratio ahead of growth 
in the immediate future. 

Admiral’s International insurance 
businesses continued to grow, with 
customers increasing by 4% to 
2.17 million (2022: 2.08 million) and 
turnover growth of 12% to £894.9 million 
(2022: £795.9 million). 

Inflation remained high throughout 
2023 and had a material impact on the 
International results, driving increased 
market premiums particularly in Italy, 
Spain and the US. Admiral continues to 
focus on medium term profitability.

Admiral Seguros (Spain) grew its customer 
base by 3% to 0.45 million customers 
over the past year (2022: 0.43 million) 
despite strong price increases in a 
competitive market with high claims 
inflation. The business continues to 
focus on improving margins, enhancing 
digital and data capabilities, as well as 
sustainable growth through distribution 
diversification through the broker channel 
and other partnerships. 

The Group’s largest international 
operation, ConTe in Italy, increased 
vehicles insured by 7% to 
1.04 million (2022: 0.97 million) and 
Motor turnover by 20% to £272.4 million 
(2022: £227.9 million) reflecting 
disciplined growth and price increases. 
The business continued to focus on risk 
selection and expense reduction as well 
as growth in the broker channel. 

L’olivier (France) increased its 
customer base by 6% to 0.42 million 
(2022: 0.40 million). The business has 
focused on margin protection in a difficult 
market with risk selection and loss 
ratio improvements, alongside strong 
cost control and the development of 
household insurance to leverage cross-
selling opportunities and further support 
future growth.

The insurance service margin also 
improved to -3.0% (2022: -7.8%), 
driven by an improved combined 
ratio. This, together with increased 
investment income, resulted in a lower 
reported loss before tax of £18.0 million 
(2022: £56.2 million). 

The combined ratio improved to 100.3% 
(2022: 109.5%), due to the combined 
effect of higher premiums, increased scale 
in the European businesses, and a strong 
focus on expense efficiency in Europe 
as well as a reduced cost base in the US. 
This resulted in the loss ratio improving to 
69.6% (2022: 74.7%) while the expense 
ratio reduced to 30.7% (2022: 34.8%). 
Investment in diversification continued 
with a focus on distribution in Italy 
and Spain, and Household insurance in 
France. This will further facilitate the 
long-term growth and profitability of 
these businesses.

The European insurance operations 
in Spain, Italy and France insured 
1.91 million vehicles at 31 December 
2023 – 6% higher than a year earlier 
(2022: 1.80 million). Motor turnover 
was up 17% to £613.3 million 
(2022: £522.9 million), driven by strong 
price increases and the larger book sizes. 
The combined European Motor profit was 
£6.1 million (2022: loss of £16.5 million), 
an improvement driven by higher average 
premium and an improved expense ratio 
despite continued inflationary pressures. 
The combined ratio reduced to 95.4% 
(2022: 104.2%).

Admiral Money distributes and 
underwrites unsecured personal 
loans and car finance products for UK 
consumers through price comparison, 
credit scoring applications and direct 
channels. The proposition is focused on 
offering real rates to provide customers 
with upfront transparency and certainty. 

Admiral Money recorded a pre-tax profit 
of £10.2 million in 2023 (improved from 
£2.1 million profit in 2022), continuing 
the positive trajectory seen since 2020.

Gross loan balances grew 8% to 
£0.96 billion (2022: £0.89 billion), 
with a £81.7 million (2022: £63.7 million) 
credit loss provision, leading to a net loan 
balance of £875.1 million 

(2022: £823.7 million). The increase 
in average portfolio size year on year 
contributed to a 49% increase in 
net interest income to £66.4 million 
(2022: £44.6 million).

As with prior year, Admiral Money 
continued to carefully manage 
affordability and credit criteria for 
new lending in 2023 to reflect the 
higher interest rate and elevated 
inflation environment. At the same 
time interest rates on new loans were 
increased to reflect the rising cost 
of funding. These measures will help 
ensure sustainable financial performance 
into the future.

The credit loss charge increased to

Overall, an appropriately cautious 
approach has been taken to calculating 
the credit loss provision, including 
post model adjustments for model 
performance, cost of living, economic 
scenarios forecast uncertainty, reflecting 
the level of uncertainty in the current 
economic environment. For further 
information, refer to note 7 in the 
financial statements.

Admiral Money is funded through a 
combination of internal and external 
funding sources. The external funding 
is secured against certain loans via 
transfer of the rights to the cash-flows 
to two special purpose entities (SPEs). 
The securitisation and subsequent issue 
of notes via SPEs does not result in a 
significant transfer of risk from the Group.

Enhancing
OUR DIGITAL 
CAPABILITIES

“I’m proud of how we  
have navigated these 
uncertain times,  
and I am absolutely 
delighted with our 
 first double digit profit  
of £10 million.”

Scott Cargill
CEO, Admiral Money

2023 has also been a year of significant 
and successful investment in our 
capabilities, particularly in technology 
and data. We are especially looking 
forward to seeing the benefits of our 
new origination platform in 2024. 
This new technology also provides us 
with options to broaden our participation 
in the consumer lending market in 
the future.

We have also completed the delivery 
of several enablers for realising our goal 
to be the lender of choice for Admiral 
Insurance customers. This is a key pillar 
of our strategy and where we have 
the most significant and sustained 
competitive advantage. Over 50% of 
our new customer flows in 2023 came 
from either current or recent Admiral 
Insurance customers. 

Looking to 2024, we enter the year 
with good momentum. We expect to 
benefit from our strong position in a 
growing market as we see a continued 
shift to comparison and credit score 
marketplaces. I expect to see further 
growth in our loan balances towards 
the £1.2 billion range during 2024, 
assuming current economic conditions. 
Combined with a tightly controlled 
cost base, we should see continued 
improvements in the economics in the 
coming years.

I’d like to finish by thanking our 
customers and all of my colleagues 
and wish everyone the best for 2024.

I’m pleased to be able to say 
it has been a positive 2023  
for Admiral Money.

Coming into the year we knew there 
would be continued uncertainty with 
higher interest rates and inflation 
impacting on the cost of living. I’m proud 
of how we have navigated these uncertain 
times and I am absolutely delighted with 
our first double digit profit of £10 million. 
I would also draw particular attention to 
our cost income ratio which is below 40% 
for the first time and which represents 
growing evidence of a likely long-term 
competitive advantage.

Through the year we have continued to 
focus on high quality risk selection and 
a controlled and conservative approach 
to growth. Our on-balance sheet loan 
book at end of December stands at 
£0.96 billion, 8% growth since FY 2022 
and slightly down on the HY 2023 
position. Our net income of £66 million 
has increased by 49% from 2022, largely 
reflecting the higher average balances 
through the year as well as margin 
improvements to provide risk resiliency.

We retain a firm focus on prime 
lending and are seeing a high level of 
resilience from our customers despite 
inflation and higher interest rates. 
Where loss experience has varied from our 
expectation, in true Admiral fashion we 
have adapted our approach quickly and 
decisively and have remained well below 
our IFRS 9 expected credit loss (ECL) 
reserve position. Our NPS score of 68 and 
Trustpilot score of 4.5 provide continued 
evidence that our commitment to being 
an efficient prime focused lender and 
providing certainty and transparency 
to UK customers on their lending needs 
is a successful formula.

a gain of £4.7 million from the sale of 
UK government bonds which was not 
repeated in the current period, and 
the current period also includes a loss 
of £3.6 million in 2023 related to the

debt restructure. Excluding these factors, 
underlying interest and investment 
income increased to £8.2 million from 
£5.4 million, in line with the higher 
interest rate environment.

Insurance result. 

Share scheme charges relate to the 
Group’s two employee share schemes. 
The increase in the charge compared to 
2022 is driven primarily by the higher 
share price in 2023 relative to 2022, 
which increases the employer’s national 
insurance cost on shares due to vest.

Other central costs consist of Group-
related expenses and include the cost of 
a number of significant Group projects, 
such as the internal model development 
and other regulatory projects, central 
management salaries and expenses, 
and additional expenses including gains 
and losses on amounts held in foreign 
currencies. The significant increase in 
other central costs is driven primarily by 
costs incurred on interest and penalties 
on settlement of a historic Italian tax 
matter (further details are provided in 
the taxation section later in this report); 
an adverse impact of foreign exchange 
movements (compared to a gain on these 
balances recognised in 2022), and higher 
costs related to M&A activity. 

Admiral launched Admiral Pioneer 
in 2020 to focus on new product 
diversification opportunities, as part of 
the investment in product diversification. 
Pioneer businesses include Veygo (flexible 
pay-as-you-go and learner driver insurer 
in the UK) and small business insurance 
in the UK. Pioneer reported a loss of 
£16.2 million in 2023 (2022: £13.5 million). 
This was mainly driven one particular 
large claim in Veygo, for which a cautious 
reserving approach has been adopted, 
together with continued investment in 
small business insurance.

Business development costs increased to 
£15.3 million (2022: £8.8 million), primarily 
attributed to increased investment in new 
businesses within the operations across 
the Group as part of the diversification 
strategy. Admiral took the decision to 
close its small fleet insurance business 
in France, which also resulted in modest 
closure costs.

Finance charges of £20.3 million 
(2022: £12.1 million) primarily related 
to interest on subordinated notes, as 
well as a small one-off charge in relation 
to the renewal of the Group’s revolving 
credit facility. In July 2023, the Group 
issued £250 million subordinated loan 
notes, at a fixed rate of 8.5%, with a 
redemption date of January 2034. At the 
same time as the new issue, the Group 
made a tender offer for the existing 
£200 million subordinated loan notes, with 
£145 million of the 2024 notes tendered. 
At 31 December 2023 the resulting 
nominal value of subordinated liabilities 
on the balance sheet is £305 million, 
which will reduce to £250 million in 
July 2024. 

A loss of £2.6 million (2022: £2.8 million) 
was attributed to compare.com in 
the first half of the year, which was 
a combination of a small loss in the 
business together with a small loss 
recognised on disposal. The sale of this 
US comparison business completed 
during the period, with no cash exchange 
as a result, but Admiral receiving a 
minority share in the acquiring business.

Group Capital Structure and Financial Position

53

The Group manages its capital to ensure 
that all entities are able to continue 
as going concerns and that regulated 
entities comfortably meet regulatory 
capital requirements. Surplus capital 
within subsidiaries is paid up to the Group 
holding company in the form of dividends. 

The Group’s regulatory capital is 
based on the Solvency II Standard 
Formula, with a capital add-on to reflect 
recognised limitations in the Standard 
Formula with respect to Admiral’s 
business, predominantly in respect 
of profit commission arrangements 
in co- and reinsurance agreements.

The Group continues to develop its 
partial internal model to form the 
basis of future capital requirements. 
Having taken time to review, update and 
extend the scope of the model as well as 
completing further cycles of independent 
external validation, the Group expects to 
enter a pre-application process with its 
regulators soon. Once the pre-application 
process is complete, the Group expects 
to be able to communicate timelines 
for a full application. 

In the interim period before model 
approval, the current standard formula 
plus capital add-on basis will continue 
to be used to calculate the regulatory 
capital requirement. 

The estimated and unaudited Solvency 
ratio for the Group at the date of this 
report is as follows:

Tier 2 capital.

*2. Solvency capital requirement includes updated, unapproved capital add-on.
*3. Solvency ratio calculated on a volatility adjusted basis. 

The Group’s solvency ratio has improved 
over 2023 to a strong closing position at 
200% (2022: 180%). Strong generation 
of economic capital in the core UK 
motor business, in particular during the 
second half of the year, contributed to an 
increase in Own Funds of approximately 
£200 million. The increase in Tier 2 Capital 
of approximately £50 million (further 
detail below) also contributed to the 
Own Funds increase as well as smaller 
favourable impacts from movements in 
yields and spreads in the year, and the 
impact of changes in the risk margin 
arising from the PRA’s introduction of the 
new UK prudential regime for insurers, 
‘Solvency UK’. 

The SCR also increased over the year, 
though to a lesser extent. The increase of 
approximately £50 million was primarily as 
a result of the increase in premiums across 
all Group businesses and the associated 
impact on underwriting and operational 
risk elements of the capital requirement. 

The SCR above includes an updated 
capital add-on which is recalculated at 
the end of each period. As a result, it is 
different to the fixed Group capital add-
on which is included in the regulatory 
Quantitative Reporting Templates (QRTs) 
reported to the PRA. 

During the second half of 2023, the PRA 
issued notice of an updated fixed Group 
capital add-on of £24 million, which is 
lower than the previously approved add-
on of £81 million, but higher than the 
Group’s own assessment of the capital 
add-on at the end of 2023. 

The estimated solvency ratio including 
the fixed Group capital add-on of 
£24 million, that is calculated at the 
balance sheet date rather than the date 
of this report, and will be reported in 
the Group’s 2023 Solvency and Financial 
Condition Report (SFCR) is as follows:

Group Capital Structure and Financial Position
continued

Issue of subordinated loan notes
During July 2023, Group issued 10.5 year, 
8.5% £250 million subordinated loan 
notes. At the same time as the new issue, 
the Group made a tender offer for the 
existing £200 million subordinated loan 
notes, due to mature in 2024. £145 million 
of the 2024 notes were tendered, with 
the remaining £55 million of 2024 notes 
not classified as Tier 2 Capital within Own 
Funds at the end of 2023.

Investments and cash
Investment strategy
Admiral Group’s investment strategy 
focuses on capital preservation and low 
volatility of returns relative to liabilities 
and follows an asset liability matching 
strategy to control interest rate, inflation 
and currency risk. A prudent level of 
liquidity is held and the investment 
portfolio has a high-quality credit profile. 
In 2023, the focus remained on matching, 
and cashflows were invested into high 
quality assets to take advantage of rising 
risk-free rates, whilst being appropriately 
cautious on the credit outlook. The Group 
holds a range of government bonds, 
corporate bonds, alternative and private 
credit assets, alongside liquid holdings in 
cash and money market funds.

A further aim of the strategy is to 
reduce the Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) related risks in the 
portfolio whilst continuing to achieve 
sustainable long-term returns. In 2023, 
the portfolio weighted average ESG score 
had an MSCI AA rating. 

Net investment income for 2023 was 
£126.7 million (2022: £66.4 million). 
Provisions for expected credit losses 
developed favourably, leading to 
a £2.5 million release of provisions 
(2022: £1.8 million favourable impact).

The investment return on the Group’s 
investment portfolio (excluding unrealised 
gains and losses and the movement in 
provision for expected credit losses) 
was £124.4 million (2022: £64.1 million). 
The annualised rate of return was higher 
at 3.3% (2022: 1.6%), due to higher 
reinvestment yields and higher returns 
on floating rate securities as interest rates 
rose throughout the year.

In 2023, there were no significant 
commutations, with the majority of quota 
share reinsurance covering underwriting 
year 2020, and all arrangements covering 
the 2019 and prior underwriting years, 
having now been commuted.

UK Household Insurance
The Group’s Household business is 
supported by long-term proportional 
reinsurance arrangements covering 
70% of the risk, that run to at least 
2024. In addition, the Group has non-
proportional reinsurance to cover the 
risk of catastrophes stemming from 
weather events.

International Car Insurance 
In both 2022 and 2023 Admiral retained 
35% (Italy), 30% (France), 30% (Spain) and 
40% (USA) of the underwriting risk in each 
country respectively. 

Excess of loss reinsurance
The Group also purchases excess of loss 
reinsurance to provide protection against 
large claims and reviews this cover annually. 
The UK Motor excess of loss cover remained 
similar to prior years with cover starting at 
£10 million. 

UK Motor Insurance
Munich Re and its subsidiary entity, 
Great Lakes, currently underwrites 40% 
of the UK Motor business. From 2022, 
20% of this total is on a co-insurance basis 
(via Great Lakes) and will extend to 2029. 
The remaining 20% is on a quota share 
reinsurance basis and these arrangements 
now extend to 2026. 

The Group also has other quota share 
reinsurance arrangements confirmed 
to at least 2024, covering 38% of the 
business written.

The nature of the co-insurance proportion 
underwritten by Munich Re (via Great 
Lakes) in the UK is such that 20% of all 
Motor premium and claims accrue directly 
to Great Lakes and are not reflected in the 
Group’s financial statements. Similarly, 
Great Lakes reimburses the Group for its 
proportional share of expenses incurred in 
acquiring and administering this business. 

The quota share reinsurance 
arrangements result in all Motor 
premiums, claims and expenses that 
are ceded to reinsurers being included 
in the Group’s financial statements. 
These agreements operate on a funds 
withheld basis and include certain 
features such as expense caps and an 
allocation of investment income earned 
on the funds held by Admiral on behalf 
of the reinsurers. These features result 
in higher profit commission should the 
underwriting year reach profitability. 

Admiral tends to commute its UK Car 
Insurance quota share reinsurance 
contracts 24-36 months after inception 
of an underwriting year, assuming there 
is sufficient confidence in the profitability 
of the business covered by the 
reinsurance contract.

After an underwriting year is commuted, 
movements in financial statement 
loss ratios result in reserve releases (or 
strengthening if the loss ratios were 
to increase) rather than reduced or 
increased profit commission.

An increase in the market value 
of the portfolio of £98.1 million 
(2021: £255.6 million reduction) 
primarily relates to the reversal of losses 
recognised in 2022 as the bonds are 
held closer to maturity. That movement 
is reflected in the Statement of Other 
Comprehensive Income.

The Group continues to generate 
significant amounts of cash and its 
capital-efficient business model enables 
the distribution of the majority of 
post-tax profits as dividends. Total cash 
and investments at 31 December 2023 
was £4,214.5 million (31 December 
2022: £3,705.8 million), the increase 
reflecting market value gains noted 
above, an increase in assets at the Group 
level following the refinancing of the 
Group’s subordinate debt during 2023, 
and growth in premiums written. 

The net increase in cash and investments 
in the period is £508.7 million (2022: 
decrease of £407.1 million).

Taxation
The tax charge for the period is 
£105.6 million (2022: £75.9 million), 
which equates to 23.8% (2022: 21.0%) 
of profit before tax. The increase in the 
UK rate of corporation tax to 25% (from 
19%) from 1 April 2023 is a significant 
driver of the increase. In addition, in 
late 2023 the Group settled an amount 
related to a historic Italian tax matter. 
This is not expected to result in a material 
increase in the tax charge going forward. 
See note 10 to the financial statements 
for further details.

Co-insurance and reinsurance
Admiral makes significant use of 
proportional risk sharing agreements, 
where insurers outside the Group 
underwrite a majority of the risk 
generated, either through co-insurance 
or quota share reinsurance contracts. 
These arrangements include profit 
commission terms which allow Admiral 
to retain a significant portion of the 
profit generated.

Although the primary focus and disclosure 
is in relation to the UK Motor insurance 
book, similar longer-term arrangements 
are in place in the Group’s international 
insurance operations and the UK 
Household and Van businesses.

Our approach to sustainability 
Sustainability has always been at the 
heart of Admiral’s business, throughout 
the Group’s thirty year history. Admiral has 
supported millions of customers,  
provided a great place for its employees 
to work and thrive, and supported 
its communities. The Group has sought  
to reduce its carbon footprint for  
over a decade. 

In 2023, the Group further increased its 
focus on sustainability. It has brought 
together existing sustainability efforts 
under a newly-appointed Group Head of 
Sustainability, supported by an enhanced 
sustainability governance structure. 
This approach will provide the dedicated 
resource, expertise, and Group-wide 
focus needed to co-ordinate all aspects 
of sustainability already present across 
the Group. 

Our Purpose 
Admiral Group’s purpose is to help more 
people to look after their future, while 
always striving for better, together. 
The purpose framework demonstrates 
how our purpose is embedded across 
Admiral Group. 

The purpose framework and its 
consideration of stakeholders provides 
a roadmap for the types of decisions 
taken across the business on issues 
of sustainability. To see this in action, 
please turn to our Materiality Assessment 
on page 58.

Sustainability governance 
Group Board: The Admiral Group Board is 
ultimately responsible for understanding 
the Group’s impact on the environment, as 
well as the impact of a changing climate 
on the Group. It is the principal governing 
body for sustainability-related issues and 
takes ownership of sustainability and 
climate-related topics and associated 
stakeholder engagement. The Board 
approves the Group’s sustainability 
approach and our sustainability ambitions 
which can have a material impact 
on Admiral. Milena Mondini, Group 
CEO, is the accountable Sustainability 
representative for the Group and the 
Group CRO, Keith Davies has designated 
SMCR responsibilities in relation to 
understanding and managing the risks to 
the business created by climate change. 

Board Committees: The Board has 
delegated authority to several permanent 
committees that deal with sustainability 
related matters. The principal committees 
of the Board – Group Audit, Group 
Remuneration, Group Risk, and Group 
Nomination and Governance – play an 
important role in the Group’s sustainability 
related decision-making processes. 
For example, the Group Risk Committee 
oversees the management of climate-
related risk and ensures appropriate 
oversight is in place for both ‘outside in’ 
risks and ‘inside out’ risks. The Group Audit 
Committee oversees the reporting of risk 
disclosures in respect of climate change 
and ensures that all external reporting is 
complete, accurate and not misleading.

Groups, allowing for a more holistic 
assessment of our sustainability approach. 
The working groups are chaired by senior 
management experts who lead the 
Group’s activities in their respective areas:

•  Sustainability Positioning 

& Communications

•  Customer & Product

•  Operations, Investments 

& Procurement 

•  Risk, Compliance & Reporting 

•  People, Learning & Development

Green Team: The Green Team is an 
internal colleague-led group which looks 
at initiatives on environmental topics, 
such as minimising our operational 
impact of climate change and engaging 
colleagues directly with solutions. 
The Green Team is also responsible for 
organising environmentally-themed 
events within the workplace in 
association with partners such as Stump 
Up for Trees and Size of Wales. 

Sustainability Steering Committee: 
To support a more holistic and 
co-ordinated approach to sustainability 
issues, in October 2023 the Group Board 
approved the creation of a management 
Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) 
and five supporting Working Groups 
(see below), to replace the former 
Sustainability Working Group and Climate 
Change Committee. 

The SSC provides guidance on the overall 
programme of sustainability-related work 
and ensures a joined-up approach across 
the entire Group. Chaired by the Executive 
Sponsor for sustainability, it meets 
quarterly and comprises the Group CEO, 
AECS CEO, Chief Financial Officer, Group 
Head of Sustainability and Chairs of the 
Working Groups. In addition, the Group 
Head of Sustainability provides updates 
to the Group Board and relevant entity 
Boards and Committees, as required.

The sustainability Working Groups 
are based on the key areas of our 
sustainability strategy. They discuss 
and make decisions on how these areas 
impact and are impacted by all the 
elements of Environment, Social, and 
Governance (ESG). Although the Climate 
Change Committee has been retired, 
climate – along with other ESG aspects 
– is integrated into each of the Working

Material Sustainability Issues

Our approach to 
sustainability materiality 
To capture and address the sustainability 
topics that matter most to Admiral 
Group’s businesses, we ran a materiality 
assessment in 2021. In this assessment, 
internal and external stakeholders ranked 
topics that they believed material to 
Admiral Group’s success. Rankings were 
based on topics’ relative importance 
operations, not Admiral Group’s current or 
historic performance. 

We will undertake a revised assessment 
in 2024 on a double materiality basis in 
readiness for the upcoming EU’s Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). 

Defining materiality via 
stakeholder engagement 
Admiral’s Board has affirmed that 
Admiral has six stakeholder groups: 
Customers, employees, suppliers and 
partners, shareholders, community, 
and the environment. These six groups 
are reflected in the four quadrants of 
our purpose framework. 

Our materiality assessment was 
conducted by reviewing the needs of 
each of the six stakeholder groups and 
surveying over 500 managers, over 2,000 
customers and over 2,000 members 
of our communities. The resulting 
materiality assessment reflects the 
priorities and concerns of stakeholders 
during this work. 

   To view more about our stakeholder 
engagement, see our Section 172 report 
on page 87

Aligning issues with UN Sustainable 
Development Goals 
To better align our engagement 
on material topics with worldwide 
efforts around these topics, in 2023, 
we began mapping the topics in our 
materiality matrix to the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (see table below). 
Whilst the SDGs are a useful tool to help 
evaluate our contributions to sustainable 
development, not all our material issues 
from 2021 are aligned to the 17 goals. 
Only those issues that are aligned are 
included in the below table. 

The UN Sustainable Development Goals

1. No poverty

7. Affordable and 
clean energy

13. Climate action

2. Zero hunger

8. Decent work and 
economic growth

14. Life below water

3. Good health 
and well-being

9. Industry, innovation 
and infrastructure

15. Life on land

4. Quality education

10. Reduced inequalities

16. Peace, justice and 
strong institutions

5. Gender equality

11. Sustainable cities 
and communities

17. Partnerships

Reviewing our materiality assessment 
In 2024, we will revisit our materiality assessment to reflect ‘double materiality’. This will allow us to better understand the risks that 
sustainability topics pose for us both internally and externally.

Our Customers

Customers are at the heart 
of everything we do. 

Our purpose of helping more people to 
look after their future drives us to deliver 
products and services that help our nine 
million customers meet their needs, 
achieve their goals and live resilient lives. 

Implementation of Consumer Duty 
The UK Financial Conduct Authority’s new 
Consumer Duty (‘Duty’) regulation, which 
came into force in July 2023, has helped 
and will continue to help us demonstrate 
how we put customers at the heart 
of everything we do. Under the Duty, 
customers are to receive communications 
they can understand, products and 
services that meet their needs and offer 
fair value, and receive the support they 
need, when they need it. 

The Duty builds on our already strong 
foundations: for example, where we 
undertake regular customer service 
monitoring, assessment of customer 
demands and needs. We have also, 
and will continue to, enhance our 
Management Information (MI), reporting 
against the four Duty outcomes on a 
more granular basis, allowing us to view 
outcomes through a customer lens better. 
In the case where outcomes are not 
as we would like, we make amendments 
and enhancements to improve 
customer outcomes. 

 This is particularly important as we 
continue to refine our product and service 
offerings in line with customers’ changing 
sustainability preferences, so that they are 
able to pursue their financial objectives 
and sustainability goals.

   Read more about Consumer Duty on  
page 111 of this report

Sustainable and quality products 
We strive to create and maintain good 
quality, sustainable products for our 
customers. Target market and fair value 
assessments are undertaken internally, 
to confirm that we aim to, and do, meet 
customer needs. In the very few instances 
where this is not the case, we act quickly 
to make changes and improvements 
where needed. Our Product and Oversight 
Policy also acts as a control to provide 
customers with products that perform as 
expected and meet their needs. 

Financially inclusive products 
The nature of insurance means that 
individuals, families, and households are 
protected from unforeseen financial 
difficulties, with the cost of the insured 
risk shared amongst many, making it 
more accessible to a greater proportion of 
the population. It is important to us that 
we provide accessible, inclusive financial 
products and services that can help more 
people plan for the future and protect 
themselves against adverse events. 

In 2023, this included performing a 
premium finance review to ensure our 
UK product APRs are delivering fair value, 
allowing more customers to finance 
insurance payments. In addition, we 
continued to develop our tiered UK motor 
product offering, which offers an essential 
level of cover accessible at lower prices. 

Sustainable products 
In our UK motor products, we have 
worked to support environmentally 
friendly products like supporting 
our customers with the transition to 
alternative-fuel vehicles. In 2023, we are 
one of the market-leading underwriters 
of electric vehicles by leveraging our core 
pricing strengths and developing new 
product features.

We expanded our electric vehicle (EV) 
insurance proposition by listening to 
customer needs and understanding 
how they have evolved. In 2023, our UK 
motor product launched a range of EV 
specific features, such as free recovery 

if customers’ vehicles run out of charge, 
cover for wall boxes installed at the home, 
cover for EV batteries and charging cables 
already included in our cover. In 2023, UK 
motor launched a partnership with BP 
Pulse testing a free six-month ‘On-The-Go’ 
charging subscription for a subset of our 
EV customers. Our aim was to ease the 
EV transition by providing customers with 
access to charging credit and discounted 
charging rates. 

 As EV adoption continues to evolve in 
2024, we will continue to take a customer-
led approach and develop our offering to 
support UK customers’ EV transitions.

Climate-resilient products 
As a UK insurer, since 2016 our UK 
Household business has taken part in the 
Flood Re scheme, which is designed to 
allow insurers to offer more affordable 
insurance for UK homes built before 
2009 in areas most at risk of flooding. 
Our UK Household business also utilises 
quota share reinsurance arrangements, 
including both catastrophe and aggregate 
cover for the UK household lines. 
These agreements allow us to support 
more customers with home insurance at 
fairer prices. We continue to assess how 
we can better support customers affected 
by extreme weather events as well as 
explore new ways to work with suppliers 
to make properties more resilient.

launched ‘Storm Hub’ in June 2023. 
The Storm Hub aims to improve our 
customers’ awareness of weather 
events and how they can keep 
themselves and their properties as safe 
as possible. It also usefully highlights 
what their insurance cover includes, 
for any subsequent claims they need 
to make.

Storm Hub sends weather warnings 
to our customers to make sure they 
are aware of any extreme weather 
events due to happen in the UK, we 
use this to direct to information in the 
Storm Hub. Our key priority is keeping 
our customers safe and helping them 
better understand the risks around 
extreme weather. 

Transparent claims outcomes
As an insurer, we are committed to 
providing appropriate claims experiences 
that deliver good outcomes for our 
customers in a timely manner. 

We are continually improving claims 
service in all areas. Notable enhancements 
in 2023 include in UK Motor, making 
handling processes clearer, increasing the 
opportunity for additional contact, and 
making it easier for our partner garages 
to provide updates more regularly to our 
customers. These initiatives combined 
helped to provide reassurance to UK 
customers throughout the claims process. 
In Spain and Italy, customers are offered 
‘cash settlements’ to reduce claims 
settlement times and improve service. 
In France, we upgraded our online claims 
feature to make it easier for customers 
to open claims in the channel of their 
preference. Our France-based customers 
can now open almost all claims through 
the customer portal and chatbot, which 
offers automated solutions, in turn 
improving customer service and reducing 
customer wait times. 

Climate-related claims 
The impact of climate change continues 
to affect our customers through extreme 
weather events such as flooding and 
increased subsidence in the UK and 
hailstorms in the US. In these situations, 
it is important that there is clear and 
transparent communication between 
our claims department and customers. 
For example, with our UK insurance 
businesses, we send communication to 
potentially affected customers ahead 
of severe weather events to help them 
take steps to reduce the chance of a 
loss and to remind them how to make a 
claim. In 2023, we launched a ‘Storm Hub’ 
to provide Household customers with 
information on all things storm related. 

Taking care of vulnerable customers 
Financial inclusion is part of our 
sustainability approach. We know 
that individual customers may have 
different requirements when it comes to 
understanding and being informed about 
our products, and to be inclusive, we seek 
to accommodate those requirements. 
Our Vulnerable Customer Policy underpins 
our identification, treatment, and 
monitoring of vulnerable customers 
through their circumstances, whether 
temporary or long-term. The Policy 
aims to ensure that there are sufficient 
controls in place so that these customers 
are treated fairly and appropriately and 
that their needs are considered in the 
development of all products. 

In 2023, in UK Motor, we put new 
vulnerable customer standards in place, 
as well as a process to share the needs of 
vulnerable customers with our suppliers. 
The aim was to our ensure customers 
receive the right level of support 
throughout their journey with us. Also in 
2023, we launched a feature to allow 
customers to update their accessibility 
needs in the UK MyAccount portal. 
In addition, we re-wrote our in-depth 
process guides for customers who need 
varying levels of support and rolled out 
specific agent training and Company-wide 
training to create more awareness. 

One example of taking care of vulnerable 
customers was in October 2023, when 
a fire at Luton Airport affected several 
hundred of our customers. We treated 
all Luton claims customers as vulnerable 
and high need at that stage, due to the 
circumstances they faced.

When considering vulnerable customers, 
it’s important to not take a ‘one-size-
fits-all’ approach. Our UK business has 
dedicated work streams in place to ensure 
changes around customer needs are 
supported, making it easier for customers 
to communicate their needs to us.

Our People

Our ambition is to be one 
of the best places to work 
in the world. 

‘Always striving for better, together’ is 
not only part of our purpose but a key 
pillar when it comes to our approach to 
our people. All of our people have the 
opportunity to shape and contribute 
to our unique culture, evolve our test-
and-learn approach, and support our 
operational excellence. This opportunity 
fosters happier and more productive 
colleagues, ultimately shaping better 
outcomes for our customers and 
other stakeholders.

Diversity and Inclusion
We support Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) 
initiatives across Admiral Group, with 94% 
of our colleagues around the world stating 
in 2023 that they believe that Admiral 
Group is a diverse and inclusive employer. 
We have Group-wide working groups 
focused on maintaining fair processes for 
our people and implementing new, better 
ways to support diversity in our workspace 
(see table below). Cristina Nestares, CEO 
of UK insurance, is the Executive Sponsor 
of D&I and supports these groups from 
the top. Alongside our working groups, 
we run D&I training sessions for all 
colleagues on topics like neurodiversity, 
and also run mandatory D&I training for 
all of our line managers. 

In the UK in 2023, we became a Foster and 
Adoption Friendly Employer. The improved 
UK adoption policy mirrors our maternity 
policy and allows colleagues to attend pre-
adoption appointments throughout their 
journey. Meanwhile, our Foster Carers 
Policy gives colleagues paid time off to 

attend any meetings or training during 
the approval process, and paid leave to 
settle a child or young person when they 
first arrive. We recognise the different 
journeys our colleagues may be on, and 
want to ensure everyone has the right 
support throughout. 

In 2023, we continued to be a Disability 
Confident employer in the UK, giving 
us the recognition for our devotion 
to ensuring that disabled people in 
our workplaces are able to participate 
fully and receive – a fair chance and 
full consideration for job roles, and 
development opportunities. In December 
2023, we marked the ‘Purple Light Up’, 
a global movement celebrating and 
drawing attention to the contributions 
of our colleagues with disabilities. As part 
of our celebration for Purple Light Up, 
we shared an inspirational chat event 
for colleagues, highlighting the positive 
impact of embracing disability at our 
UK headquarters.

Employee engagement 
Part of our culture is making sure our 
people feel part of the bigger picture, 
and that their contributions matter 
and are valued. Our different Employee 
Consultation Groups (ECG) across our 
international locations provide our people 
with a platform to share their views 
and give them a voice at the highest 
level of the organisation. We encourage 
the ECG to share their opinions on any 
topic they feel necessary, to ensure 
transparent and fair conversations are 
happening within Admiral Group, and their 
conversations are regularly debated at 
the Group Board. In 2023 there have been 
four ECG meetings in the UK and many 
more across our European operations, 
addressing topics such as career 
progression, the cost of living crisis, and 
our sustainability approach. 

As well as the ECG, we engage across the 
group with multiple channels, such as 
regular one to ones with line managers, 
Intranet blogs and articles, colleague 
surveys, feedback initiatives such as ‘ 
Ask Milena’ and ‘Have your say’, and our 
global participation in the Great Place 
 To Work® initiative.

Learning and development
One of our five newly-created 
sustainability working groups (see page 57 
for more information) focuses on people, 
learning, and development, with the 
aim of educating colleagues on a range 
of sustainability topics such as climate 
change and sustainable consumption. 
The goal is to support colleagues to 
make changes that will have long-lasting, 
positive impacts on our community 
and planet.

Our specialised Learning and 
Development teams act as the core 
of our training and support across the 
Group. We believe that giving our people 
widespread excellent opportunities 
to learn and grow elevates our culture 
of helping people to love what they 
do, and ultimately makes our business 
better. Our learning tools include internal 
leadership programmes and development 
hubs, as well as mandatory training in 
core areas. 

In 2023 we have made over 5,000 courses 
available on our internal development 
hub for our UK colleagues, plus over 
10,000 courses available globally to 
our colleagues via LinkedIn Learning. 
We run international, Group-wide 
programmes such as Get Discovered, 
aimed at supporting our next generation 
of female leaders. In 2023 a group of 23 
female colleagues took part, getting the 
opportunity to extend their network 
widely and have mentorship support 
from some of our most successful leaders 
across the Group. 

Our new performance management 
tool launched in 2023 across our UK 
and European businesses, providing our 
colleagues with better tools to empower 
their careers, training and progress. 
We also continued work on improving 
global mobility across the group. In 2023 
we set up new global mobility guidelines 
and policies, offering more central support 
to our colleagues with the aim to aiding 
the future mobility of colleagues across 
our entities, as well as making it more 
accessible to our people.

Our Business

We strive to build successful 
businesses with operational 
resilience and deliver on both 
financial and non-financial 
targets.

Our net zero ambition 
We strive to help more people look after 
their future, which includes contributing 
to global efforts on climate resilience 
through limiting our impact upon the 
planet, as best we can.

In 2021, Admiral Group formally 
committed to achieving net zero 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 and 
to cut these emissions in half by 2030.19

By knowing our market-based 
emissions we gain greater control over 
our operational footprint. We have 
demonstrated this via our UK Scope 2 
emissions, which we have reduced to zero. 
This is due to purchasing 100% of our UK 
energy from renewable sources in 2023. 
Across the Group, we purchased 77% of 
our energy from renewable sources in 
2023, up 8% from 2022.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from operations 
In 2023 we were on track to reduce our 
overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 
33%, continuing the downward trend. 
However, due to a one-off fugitive gas 
leak, this was not achieved.

During August 2023, our Admiral Group 
House office in Swansea experienced a 
one-off emissions event during building 
servicing by a third-party vendor. 
During the event, a fire suppression 
system designed to protect our data 
centres was activated, causing a fugitive 
gas leak of 295kg of gas equalling 988.25 
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(tCO2e). Due to this event, we saw an 
increase in our combined Scope 1 and 
2 emissions of 26% compared to the 
previous year, despite the 33% fall in other 
underlying emissions. 

This is the last of our office locations to 
use this type of refrigerant gas in the 
UK. The refrigerant gas system will be 
replaced in 2024, as planned. Otherwise, 
we continue to ensure that changes in 
operational activities are consistent with 
our sustainability objectives. This includes 
our environmental and social targets, and 
how these are seen by agencies outside 
of Admiral.

Successes from our internal 
activities include:

•  Offsetting emissions by purchasing 

Gold Standard carbon offsets 
since 2019

•  Purchasing electricity in the UK from 
100% renewable sources at all sites

•  Our Cardiff headquarters is BREEAM 

Excellent rated and has photopholtaics 
which feed electricity back into the grid

•  We have closed 396,000 sq ft of 
office space in the last 3 years, 
which has significantly reduced our 
carbon footprint

•  We are installing improved Building 
Management Systems (BMS) to 
improve the data reporting and adjust 
controls accordingly.

Climate impact methodology 
In 2017, the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) defined 
a climate-related risks and opportunities 
classification. We have used this as 
our starting point for our qualitative 
methodology to identify climate risks and 
opportunities that might impact Admiral 
Group. We assess these risks using our 
existing Emerging Risk Matrix. 

The output of individual assessments is 
an “expected magnitude”, assessed across 
three distinct timeframes (0-5 years, 
5-10 years, and 10+ years). We apply 
this methodology to all our current and 
potential future lines of business, our 
operations, and our investments. We also 
consider existing and emerging regulatory 
requirements related to climate change. 
Results of this assessment are disclosed in 
our annual TCFD report (see page 73). 

To quantify the impact of climate-related 
issues, we conducted two climate change 
scenarios from the Network for Greening 
the Financial System (NGFS) 2022 phase 
III. Results of these scenarios are disclosed 
in our annual ORSA report (see page 109).

We are continually striving for 
improvement in evaluating our impact 
on climate change. We consistently aim 
to improve our methodology by working 
with third parties to help ensure we are 
matched to industry developments and 
standards. In 2023, we submitted our 
proposal for Science-Based Targets (SBTs) 
to the Science-Based Targets Initiative 
after validating past years’ emissions with 
Carbon Intelligence, an external advisory 
body. Setting SBTs will help us set a clearly 
defined path to reduce emissions in 
line with Paris Agreement goals. We will 
develop further targets and updates 
once validated.

Therefore, for 2024, we aim to draft and 
implement our net zero transition plan 
by leveraging existing work, getting 
our SBTs independently verified, and 
including the potential impacts of our 
identified risks and opportunities on our 
financial statements.

Responsible investment
Admiral Group has a responsible 
investment policy in recognition of our 
duty to protect the interests of our 
customers, society, and environment 
when investing the premiums we collect. 
Our investment portfolio strategy 
is focused on Net zero by 2040 to 
achieve real economic carbon emissions 
reductions. Admiral Group follows the 
Institutional Investors Group on Climate 
Change (IIGCC) Net zero Framework. 
This guides how we decarbonise a range 
of investments we hold.

In 2023, with the help of third parties, 
we revamped our Environmental, Social, 
Governance (ESG) reporting and reviewed 
our carbon emissions methodology. 
We monitor progress towards our 
investment targets by regularly tracking 
and reviewing ESG figures and statistics 
and this ensures they remain the 
most relevant. 

We are confident in our approach to 
sustainable investment as we continue to 
reposition our portfolio to invest in more 
assets that reduce carbon emissions and 
contribute positively to the environment 
and society. Examples of these include 
investments in green bonds and 
renewable energy infrastructure.

Regular shareholder engagement
Shareholder engagement fosters an 
understanding of Admiral Group’s 
strategy and investment case. 
It allows us to explain the business 
and strategic decisions and rationale 
whilst providing opportunities for 
shareholders to comment and challenge 
business priorities. 

Admiral’s management team actively 
engages with the Group’s shareholders to 
promote open and transparent dialogue. 
In 2023, we hosted an investor day in our 
Ty Admiral Cardiff office which allowed 
investors to meet management and 
better understand Admiral’s culture 
and the key to its success. One-to-
one management meetings, annual 
Corporate Governance meetings with our 
Board Chair, IFRS 17 updates, and other 
meetings continued in 2023. 

   Read more about shareholder engagement 
in the Governance section of the report  
on page 136

Sustainable procurement
Admiral Group has embedded 
sustainable business practices across 
all procurement processes. Our due 
diligence questionnaire asks questions 
related to the environment, financial 
crime, data protection, and modern 
slavery, and ensures suppliers are 
aligned to our sustainable procurement 
standards. Suppliers are risk assessed 
throughout the supplier lifecycle process. 
Where suppliers’ responses demonstrate 
no policies or procedures, Admiral 
issues an assessment to the supplier 
to capture further information and to 
encourage improvements. 

   Read more about Admiral’s sustainable 
procurement processes in the TCFD report  
on page 73

Admiral Group’s contract management 
system allows our procurement team to 
better assess the procurement category 
of the supply chain risks. This allows for 
increased visibility throughout the supply 
chain, ensuring we effectively assess the 
business relationships with suppliers. 

In the UK in 2023, we have engaged 
with our motor supply chain partners 
through forums on topics such as electric 
vehicles, carbon emissions reduction, and 
circular economy.

Our community investment strategy 
In line with our business purpose, ‘to help 
more people look after their future’, our 
strategy includes: 

•  Employability 

•  Social mobility and reduced inequalities 

•  Educational opportunities 

•  Financial inclusion 

•  Sports, arts and culture 

•  Partnerships

As a large employer across several 
countries, we want to help improve 
our communities in a sustainable and 
responsible way. Our approach to affecting 
positive change is centred around skills 
development and providing more people 
with access to employment, helping them 
lead more sustainable and inclusive lives. 

We have partnered with expert charities 
and organisations across the world who 
specialise in supporting people into long 
lasting and meaningful employment, 
reducing skill gaps in local economies. 
We are proud that the demographic of 
people we’ve supported ranges from 
young people to ex-offenders, females in 
tech to females in construction, disabled 
adults to those individual most distant 
from employment opportunities. 

Around the world, Generation prepares 
individuals facing unemployment to 
join or re-enter the workforce through 
a career-launching job that provides 
economic mobility with positive 
intergenerational effects. Thanks to 
the generous support from Admiral, 
Generation Italy has supported learners 
like Gianmarco whose inspiring stories 
are shared below. 

Before stepping into the transformative 
world of Generation Italy’s program, 
Gianmarco was navigating 
unemployment, with brief stints as 
a warehouse worker. Yet, deep inside, 
a spark for the realm of IT was always 
glowing. He chose the Junior Java 
Developer course, his enthusiasm 
fuelled by a friend’s success story 
in the same field. 

Impact hours 
Alongside our community investment, 
our Impact Hour programme gives each 
of our colleagues across the world two 
paid volunteering days a year for them 
to use to make positive impacts in 
their communities. 

Globally, from January to December 
2023 our colleagues have volunteered 
over 14,000 Impact Hours to their 
communities reviewing CVs, sharing skills 
and mentoring, planting trees, litter 
picking, working with care homes and 
working at animal shelters to name a few. 
In 2023 we have continued our work to 
find and build meaningful relationships 
with organisations for our colleagues 
to volunteer with. We aim to build and 
encourage more bespoke opportunities 
for our colleagues across Admiral Group. 

Throughout 2023, we have encouraged 
colleagues to share their skills through 
mentoring programmes, teaching 
presentations and inspirational talks 
to people across our community. As an 
example, some of our senior managers 
helped facilitate ‘Admiral 5–9 Club’, a 
programme for female entrepreneurs that 
we funded with Welsh ICE. 

“The educators were truly extraordinary. 
I found the soft skills lessons especially 
invaluable. They’re not just theoretical – 
I’ve been applying them daily in my job. 
This emphasis on behavioural skills sets 
Generation’s programme apart; I’ve never 
encountered it in any other Java course.” 
When Gianmarco completed the course, 
Reactive Almaviva, a Company involved 
in guiding the digital transformation 
of the finance world, recognised 
Gianmarco’s potential and offered him 
a position. There, he’s been refining 
his expertise and scaling professional 
heights, “I’ve recommended this course 
to a friend because Generation provided 
me with the essential foundation to dive 
into this sector. Thanks to Generation, 
I joined a prestigious Company like 
Reactive Almaviva. This course has been 
a turning point in my life.”

Partnerships
Partnerships with philanthropic and 
impact organisations help us to increase 
the breadth and depth of the impact 
we can make with our community 
contributions. In 2023 we are proud to 
have invested over £1.4 million to support 
people outside of our organisation into 
sustainable employment. We have done 
this by partnering with experts such 
as Generation.

In the UK, 2023 was our third year of 
partnership with University of Oxford’s 
Jesus College on their Welsh access 
initiative, which aims to reach more 
academically gifted young people 
across the country who are currently 
underrepresented at Oxford and other 
leading universities across the UK. 
Through our ongoing support, the access 
and outreach teams have been able to 
continue their work improving their 
access programmes, but also finding new 
ways to engage with young people.

Internationally, our partner Generation 
is a non-profit organisation striving to 
transform the education system into an 
employment system. Over 2023 we have 
piloted programmes across the world, 
supporting programmes in technology 
in Italy and programmes in technology, 
service, sales, and health sectors in India.

Global emergency fund
In 2022, we set up our global emergency 
fund, which is dedicated to making 
prompt donations to people and 
organisations who need them the 
most around the world. During 2023, 
we have given over £400,000 to global 
organisations such as International Red 
Cross and the Disasters Emergency 
Committee (DEC), ensuring that funds are 
distributed to those most in need as soon 
as possible. You can read more on about 
our global emergency Fund on page 21.

Environmental engagement 
In 2023 we authorised a donation to the 
environmental organisation Stump Up For 
Trees, part-funding carbon sequestration 
via the planting of 2.75 hectares of new 
woodland creation. The donation enabled 
us to increase tree cover at sites across 
the Bannau Brycheiniog, Brecon Beacons 

Empowering
FEMALE
FOUNDERS

As part of our ongoing commitment 
to help people into jobs, we recently 
worked with the Welsh Innovation 
Centre for Enterprise (ICE) to launch 
the Admiral 5-9 Club for Female 
Founders, a programme designed 
to empower 30 ambitious female 
entrepreneurs who want to turn their 
business ideas into reality. 

The Admiral 5-9 Club sets out to 
provide female entrepreneurs with 
the opportunity to strengthen their 
business skills without having to 
sacrifice their daytime commitments. 
A total of 38 entrepreneurs took part 
in the programme, with businesses 
ranging from doggy daycare centres 
to artificial intelligence and medical 
robotics. Each week different speakers 
from inside and outside of Admiral gave 
presentations on key business topics. 
Each entrepreneur was also allocated 
an ‘Admiral Mentor’, who used their 
Impact Hours to dedicate time to help 
provide guidance and key advice to 
their mentee. 

On conclusion of the nine weeks’ course, 
the entrepreneurs presented their 
business ideas to a ‘Dragons Den’-style 
panel. As a result of this partnership,  
34 women were inspired to pursue 
their business and entrepreneurial 
goals. A total of 13 new businesses have 
already started trading and growing 
thanks to the support and intervention 
of the Admiral 5-9 Club.

and South Wales. Along with Stump Up 
For Trees, we furthered our donations to 
environmental conservation charity Size 
of Wales. During the past nine months, 
the Size of Wales project has worked with 
a community in Boré, Kenya to protect 
four of the kayas (sacred forests) in the 
local area. Over 29,500 native species 
seedlings have also been planted by Kaya 
community members. The project has 
engaged local unemployed youth in forest 
restoration activities, such as building fire 
breaks, while supporting them to earn a 
living. The project therefore had a double 
impact in helping more people look after 
their future. 

We believe in the importance of 
demonstrating responsible business 
behaviour with regards to the 
environment, not just because our 
stakeholders demand it, but because it  
is the right thing to do. 

Colleague-led donations
Our community and match fund 
initiatives continued in 2023, and 
from our colleagues’ nominations we 
supported over 200 organisations with 
grants, spending over £100,000 in total 
with the majority going towards sports 
and art clubs. As a business, we offer our 
match fund for colleagues to request 
their fundraising efforts be matched by 
the business. In 2023, we have helped a 
total of 59 fundraisers totalling around 
£64,000 going towards causes close to 
our colleagues’ hearts.

In 2023 we further expanded outside of our UK Motor insurance 
operations by growing our Home, Pet and Travel Insurance 
businesses, as well as our loans businesses. We supported 
technological upgrades and innovation in mobility by becoming 
a market-leading underwriter of electric vehicles. We support 
decent job creation via our community investment, which 
generates gainful employment as discussed under SDG4.

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure 

Target
9.1: Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, 
including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support  
economic development and human well-being, with a focus on 
affordable and equitable access for all

9.2: Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, 
significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic 
product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in 
least developed countries

9.4: By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make 
them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater 
adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and 
industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance  
with their respective capabilities.

Contribution
•  Our motor insurance product helps make vehicle use and 
ownership safer and more financially accessible for more 
people, ultimately mobilising them to have better access to 
work, school, healthcare, and other essential parts of life which 
promote wellbeing

•  Our household insurance also helps to make housing financially 

accessible for more people by lowering the risk  
of home ownership

•  With our newfound success as an underwriter of electric 

vehicles in the UK, we support our customers as they adopt 
more efficient and sustainable forms of transport, lowering the 
barriers associated with upgrading to an electrical vehicle.

The UN and the World Bank consider insurance itself to be a product that underpins financial inclusion, contributing directly to  
SDG 8 of Decent Work and Economic Growth and SDG 9 of Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. By protecting against risks, 
insurance increases the capacity of individuals, households, and businesses to absorb financial shocks and continue participation in a 
healthy, inclusive economy. In line with our purpose and our work to lower our impact on the environment, we contribute to several  
other SDGs, as outlined in the table below. 

SDG 10: Reduce Inequalities 

Target
10.2: By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and 
political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, 
ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status 

10.3: Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, 
including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices  
and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in 
this regard 

10.4: Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection 
policies, and progressively achieve greater equality.

Contribution
•  Our workplace is a safe environment for colleagues to 
be themselves, access what they need, and have equal 
opportunities across our Group. In 2023, 94% of our colleagues 
around the world stated that they believe Admiral Group is  
a diverse and inclusive employer 

• 

Internal programs that promote equality and a safe working 
environment for all include our Get Discovered Programme for 
women in business, our strong internal social mobility processes, 
and our pledge to be a neurodiversity-friendly employer. For more 
information on these initiatives see our 2023 Sustainability Report

•  Our charity partners help those in economic need into 

employment, as well as helping women into gainful employment 
in industries which are historically excluded such as construction 
and tech. For more information see ‘Our Society’ section on 
page 66.

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities 

Target
11.1: By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable 
housing and basic services and upgrade slums 

11.5: By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the 
number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct 
economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused  
by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on 
protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations 

11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact 
of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and 
municipal and other waste management.

Contribution
•  As mentioned under SDG 9, our home insurance product supports 

access to housing through financial inclusion by lowering the 
risk associated with home ownership, including ever-increasing 
extreme weather events such as flooding and storms 

•  Our UK electric vehicle insurance product mentioned under 

SDG 8 allows greater accessibility to more sustainable methods 
of transport, which helps reduce the environmental impact of 
transport on global climate and local air quality

•  Our Global Emergency Fund has helped communities respond  
to natural disasters. In February 2023, we donated £250,000 to  
the DEC’s Turkey-Syria earthquake appeal, as well as £30,000  
to help the Halifax wildfire response in May of 2023.

SDG 13: Climate Action 

Target
13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related 
hazards and natural disasters in all countries 

13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising and human and 
institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, 
impact reduction and early warning 

13.b: Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective  
climate change-related planning and management in least  
developed countries and small island developing States, including 
focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities.

Contribution
•  Greater adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards is gained 

by our customers through our home insurance product lowering 
the risk associated with home ownership. This includes initiatives 
such as our Storm Hub, which educates and raises awareness of 
these hazards by sending weather warnings and information, 
so our customers are empowered to better react and take 
proactive measures.

•  We promote resilience to climate-related hazards through our 

community initiatives, such as a Sustainable Land Management 
and tree planting project in Boré, Kenya which also employed 
women and local unemployed youth.

Sustainability Ratings and Rankings 

We welcome independent 
external assessment to a 
range of Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) 
ratings providers. We do this 
as a way to engage with the 
wider industry and track 
our performance on various 
sustainability topics.

Our performance in 2023 
In 2023, we maintained our AA ranking 
on MSCI. 

Our Sustainalytics score decreased 
due to changes in ranking for Product 
Governance and Data Protection 
and Security. 

We saw improvement on our 
‘Environmental Dimensions’ scoring in the 
Dow Jones Sustainability Index. However, 
the overall Dow Jones score dropped 
slightly compared to 2022. This was due 
to stricter evidence requirements than 
previous years. 

While we have included previous scores 
from the Tortoise Responsibility100 
index, they have halted their scoring 
as of 2023. As such, we will not include 
it in future reports.

Restatements 
In our 2022 Annual Report, we mistakenly 
published our 2021 Sustainalytics rating 
of ‘21’ as our 2022 rating, and our  
2022 Sustainalytics rating of ‘22.3’ as 
our 2021 rating. Also, the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index for 2022 should have 
read ‘47/100’. We have amended these  
in our 2023 report.

Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

Explanation of movements
Admiral Group PLC report both Scope 2  
market-based emissions and  
Scope 2 location-based emissions. 
A location-based method reflects the 
average emissions intensity of grids on 
which energy consumption occurs (using 
mostly grid-average emission factor 
data). A market-based method reflects 
emissions from electricity that companies 
have purposefully chosen (or their lack 
of choice). Admiral report both figures 
to demonstrate the variance between 
the two reporting methods and to 
report against Admiral’s science-based 
target, baselined on Scope 2 Market-
based emissions.

Overall, our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) 
emissions have increased by 26% against 
last year. Our Scope 1 and 2 (location-
based) emissions have increased by 12% 
against last year. This was due to a fire 
gas suppression system activation used 
to protect data centres from business 
impact and is reported under a fugitive 
gas leakage during the year. This is the 
last location to use this type of refrigerant 
gas in the UK and will be replaced in 
2024. The fire suppression fugitive gas 
leak of 295kg of gas (type HFC-227ea) 
and equalled 988.25 tCO2e. Without this 
leak, our overall Scope 1 emissions would 
have decreased by 7% to 519 tCO2e. 
For further context, without the fugitive 
gas leak, our Scope 1 & 2 market-based 
emissions would have decreased by 33% 
to 1104 tCO2e.

The Scope 1 increase was partially offset 
by the inactivity of one office in the 
USA and two offices in the UK. Due to 
the pandemic and subsequent Return 
To Office and hybrid working, we have 
consolidated offices which were being 
used into a more efficient portfolio that 
has resulted in a reduction in numbers 
of buildings and space. Though we have 
maintained a hybrid work model, the 
past year has seen an increase in staff 
working in the office and subsequently 

Energy consumption (kWh)
Electricity
Fuels1

1  Natural gas and transportation fuels (petrol and diesel).

Methodology
We quantify and report our organisational 
GHG emissions in alignment with the 
World Resources Institute’s Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised version) and 
in alignment with the Scope 2 Guidance. 
We consolidate our organisational 
boundary according to the operational 
control approach, which includes all 
our operations and sites. The GHG 
sources that constituted our operational 
boundary for the year are: 

•  Scope 1: 

–  Natural gas combustion 

–  Diesel vehicle combustion 

•  Scope 2: 

–  Purchased electricity - standard 

–  Purchased electricity - renewable 

•  Scope 3: 

–  FERA 

–  Waste 

–  Water 

–  Business Travel

In some cases, where data is missing, 
values have been estimated using either 
extrapolation of available data or data 
from the previous year as a proxy.

The Scope 2 Guidance requires that we 
quantify and report Scope 2 emissions 
according to two different methodologies 
(“dual reporting”): (i) the location-based 
method, using average emissions factors 
for the country in which the reported 
operations take place; and (ii) the market-
based method, which uses the actual 
emissions factors of the energy procured.

an increase in utilities consumption. 
To mitigate the uplift in consumption, 
we made efficiencies on the existing 
building management system at 
our two largest offices in Cardiff and 
Swansea. The Building Management 
System upgrade for the two offices 
will be completed in H1 2024 and will 
further optimise data, monitoring and 
performance. In addition to improving the 
controls and use of Scope 1 & 2 utilities, 
we have been actively disposing of our 
property portfolio which has further 
contributed to the 33% decrease.

Another increase in Scope 1 is due to 
elephant.com and EUI Halifax reporting 
on Company cars from January 2023. 
In September 2023, we removed leased 
vehicles in the UK and intend to the same 
in Halifax by the end of 2024.

In 2023 we purchased 77% of our 
electricity from renewable sources, an 
increase from 69% in 2022. Scope 2 
(market-based) emissions for the UK have 
reduced to zero due to purchasing 100% 
of our electricity from renewable sources. 
We have also had three buildings in the 
portfolio move over to fully renewable 
resources which has contributed to the 
33% decrease in Scope 1 & 2 emissions 
(excluding fugitive gas leak).

Our Scope 3 emissions are comprised of 
business travel, waste, water, and Fuel 
and Energy-Related Activities (FERA) 
not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2. 
Our measured Scope 3 emissions totalled 
1,977 tCO2e, an increase of 54% from last 
year due to a large increase in business 
travel emissions.

During the year, our total fuel and 
electricity consumption totalled 
11,564,413 kWh, a decrease of 21% from 
last year due to reduction in electricity 
consumption. 77% of fuel and electricity 
consumption was consumed in the UK. 
The split between fuel and electricity 
consumption is displayed below.

Introduction

Recognising Admiral’s part 
in tackling climate change, 
Admiral has reported in line 
with the FCA’s listing rule 
LR 9.8.6R and included in 
its annual financial report 
disclosures consistent with 
recommendations of the 
Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
since 2019. 

This has provided transparency around 
the ways in which climate change impacts 
the Group now and will do in the future. 
In addition, Admiral also reports on the 
Climate-related Financial Disclosure (CFD) 
requirements – introduced in 2022 as part 
of the UK Government’s Greening Finance 
roadmap. The sections below therefore 
involve Admiral making disclosures 
consistent with all 11 recommendations 
and recommended disclosures from 
the TCFD framework, and with all eight 
CFD requirements (as required under 
the Companies (Strategic Report) 
(Climate-related Financial Disclosure) 
Regulations 2022 sections 414CA and 
414CB of the Companies Act 2006). 

During 2023 Admiral has made 
improvements to comply with 
recommendations and recommended 
disclosures relating to TCFD Strategy 
disclosure b – “describe the impact of 
climate-related risks and opportunities 
on the organization’s businesses, 
strategy, and financial planning”, 
and to Metrics and Targets disclosure 
c – “describe the targets used by the 
organization to manage climate-related 
risks and opportunities and performance 
against targets”. 

•  Various activities have been enhanced 
to enable Admiral to better evidence 
the objectives of TCFD Strategy 
disclosure b. To quantify the impact of 
climate-related risks and opportunities, 
the Company has run climate-related 
stress and scenario testing (SST), and 
increased the extent to which physical 
risks arising from climate-related events 
are considered in the financial planning 
process – with projected loss ratios for 
Admiral’s Household business including 
(an increased) allowance for weather 
events with a combined target over 
a five-year period. Indeed, in order to 
meet the increased cost, frequency, and 
severity of claims (including weather-
related events arising from climate 
change) the Company has proactively 
increased average premiums in UK 
Car and UK Household business 
during 2022 and 2023, and has also 
implemented localised rate increases 
in the US motor business. Work will 
continue to be undertaken during 
2024 to consider the potential impact 
of additional climate-related metrics 
and targets in the Company’s financial 
planning and accounting activities. 
Finally, the “Diversification” and 
“Evolution of Motor” pillars of the Group 
strategy, which could mitigate some 
of the climate-risk faced by the Group 
(and capture upside opportunities), 
form a key part of the annual strategic 
planning and dynamic business 
planning processes. 

•  The submission of Admiral’s GHG 

targets to the Science-based targets 
initiative (SBTi) in September 2023 
represents a clear development in 
climate-related metrics and targets 
consistent with cross-industry 
standards, as required by the 
recommended disclosures within 
TCFD Metrics and Targets disclosure 
c. This includes scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG 
emissions (category 1-14 – supply chain 
and category 15 – investments) with 
intermediate performance targets 
against a 2021 baseline. Such targets 
represent the key environmental 
performance indicators required to 
assess Admiral’s progress against its 
net zero ambitions. Other key metrics 
already used to assess the performance 
of Admiral’s products and services 
against climate-related risks include 
key inputs into pricing and reserving 
decisions, and information on “weather-
related losses following natural 
catastrophes” for the UK Household, 
UK car, and US motor businesses. 
Reinsurance programmes are in place to 
mitigate these losses, and the adequacy 
of Admiral’s reinsurance programme, 
the evolution of losses due to natural 
catastrophes, and the performance of 
the Company’s pricing, reserving, and 
claims management approaches, as well 
as the metrics and targets mentioned 
above, are all monitored and reported 
to the Group Risk Committee (GRC) and 
the Group Board in various reports. 

Further discussion and information are 
included in the relevant sections of the 
report and are signposted as such.

Governance

Board and Board Committees
The Admiral Group Board is responsible 
for promoting the long-term 
sustainable success of the Group and 
has ultimate oversight of climate-
related risks and opportunities. 
Responsibility for reviewing climate-
related risks is delegated to the GRC and 
associated disclosures are reviewed at the 
Group Audit Committee. 

Climate-related risks are embedded 
within the business as usual (BAU) 
risk management approach, and any 
developments are reported within 
regular committee reports including the 
Consolidated Risk Report (CRR) and the 
CRO Report, as well as regularly scheduled 
dedicated climate updates. In addition, 
Boards and committees receive numerous 
additional updates as part of other 

presentations (e.g., ORSA Report) or 
discussions on environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) topics. 

Admiral’s climate and sustainability 
governance structure as well as roles and 
responsibilities are summarised in the Table 
1. Such arrangements are proportionate 
to the nature, scale and complexity of the 
Company’s operations and business.

as well as the impact of a changing climate on the 
Group, and for agreeing how this is considered in the 
context of the Group’s governance structure, strategy, 
risk management, and business outcomes, including 
performance against business objectives

•  The Group Board approves the Group ORSA Report,  

which includes consideration of climate-related risks  
and opportunities alongside SST.

•  The GRC has delegated authority from the Group 

Board for overseeing risk management activities, and is 
therefore responsible for reviewing climate-related risks 
and opportunities

•  Developments in relation to climate-related risks and 

opportunities are included in the CRR and the CRO Report 
where appropriate, which are both presented at each of 
the five scheduled GRC meetings annually (as well as at 
some ad hoc meetings)

•  Dedicated agenda items allow a full update of climate-
related activities to be considered, including progress 
towards goals and targets

•  Climate change considerations are also reported within 
the ORSA Report, which is reviewed by the GRC before 
being recommended for approval by the Group Board.

meetings and some ad hoc meetings. Specific focus was 
given to climate-related change during four meetings. 
For example, in April 2023, the Group Board received a 
formal update on climate change including progress made 
across several climate-related areas

• 

In 2023 the Board requested and oversaw the submission 
of GHG targets to the SBTi for official approval

•  The annual strategy review included a review of the 

Company’s approach to sustainability including climate issues. 

•  During 2023, the GRC met nine times (five scheduled and 
four ad hoc meetings) to review, manage and monitor 
all aspects of risk management. Specific focus was given 
to climate-related risks and opportunities during three 
meetings. For example, in June 2023, the Committee 
reviewed the development of Admiral’s EV offering to 
support the transition to a low carbon economy, and 
of Admiral’s carbon offsetting strategy. In addition, the 
Committee reviewed and challenged progress towards 
Admiral’s GHG targets

•  Throughout the year the Committee considered the impact 
from named storms and other weather events (e.g., storms 
Babet and Ciaran), as well as actions taken by Admiral to 
mitigate and manage the impact.

Group Audit 
Committee

•  The Group Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing 
climate-related financial disclosures under TCFD, and CFD, 
as well as any climate-related audits (of which there was 
one in 2023).

• 

In April 2023, the Committee reviewed the ‘Climate Risk’ 
audit report produced by the Internal Audit Team providing 
an independent opinion on key processes and controls in 
place to manage and report climate risk

Investment 
Committee

•  The Investment Committee is responsible for the 
responsible investment strategy and support the 
Company’s effort to achieve net zero by 2040. 

•  The Committee reviews and approves several climate 

related disclosures, including this report, the Streamlined 
Energy and Carbon Reporting Regulation (SECR) report and 
the annual Sustainability Report. 

•  During 2023, the Investment Committee reviewed and 
challenged several reports covering climate change 
(e.g., four reports monitoring the performance of the 
responsible investment strategy, one report proposing

Management and 
management committees
During 2023 the governance surrounding 
sustainability (and therefore climate 
change) was further enhanced and 
embedded, not least by the appointment 
of a Group Head of Sustainability in 
charge of ESG approach, building up 
the Sustainability Team, and setting 
up the new sustainability governance 
framework with the establishment of the 
Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC), 
superseding the existing Climate Steering 
Group and Sustainability Working Group 
(see Table 2). Discussions/outcomes from 
the SSC are escalated to the Executive 
Committee and to the Board and Board 
Committees mentioned in Table 1 above. 
The Group Head of Sustainability reports 
ultimately to the Group CEO.

Senior management from across the 
Group have various responsibilities 
relating to climate-related issues, and 
most sit on appropriate fora, such as 
the SSC or its five Working Groups. 
The reporting at each forum allows 
management to be informed of 
climate-related issues and to monitor 
them closely.

The Group CEO is the accountable 
sustainability representative for the 
Group, with a remit that includes climate-
related risks and opportunities. The SSC 
reports directly to the Group CEO.

The Group CRO has designated Senior 
Manager and Certification Regime 
(SMCR) responsibilities in relation to 
climate change, chairs the SSC, and 
is the day-to-day executive sponsor 
of sustainability activities across the 
Group. They are tasked with developing 
Admiral’s Sustainability Team and ensuring 
effective coverage of sustainability topics 
across all lines of defence.

The Group CFO is responsible for 
investments, including responsible 
investment and climate change 
considerations. They are also responsible 
for the reinsurance programme which 
increasingly considers excess of loss cover 
for extreme weather events.

Climate-related risks and opportunities 
are typically articulated at Group level, 
although the materiality and potential 
exposure of individual lines of business 
are considered and actions relating to 
operations, investments and products 
are actually implemented at entity level. 

The Group Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) Team monitors emerging risks 
and Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
(PR&Us) and identifies and assesses 
climate-related risks and opportunities. 
The output is included in regular and  
ad hoc Board and committee reporting. 

The Group ERM Team, in conjunction 
with the Sustainability Team, also 
coordinates climate risk-related 
work across the Group, including the 
identification of climate-related risks, 
their potential impact, and any resulting 
opportunities. Management teams across 
Admiral are responsible for managing 
areas of the business which may affect 
or be affected by climate change, and 
for reporting progress to the SSC’s five 
Working Groups and other committees. 
They have a key role in identifying climate-
related risks in their respective areas.

Strategy

When considering the 
impacts of climate change, 
Admiral recognises that 
there are two components 
(double materiality): 

(i) 

 its impact on the environment; 
and 

(ii)   the impact of climate change 
on the Group and all its lines of 
business, on its revenues, costs 
and via other non-financial risks.

77

Consideration of the company’s impact on 
the environment and on people’s futures 
is integral to Admiral’s purpose to help 
more people to look after their future. 
Always striving for better, together.” 
Admiral has therefore committed to 
achieve net zero emission across all its 
carbon footprint by 2040 and to achieve 
net zero in operation emissions by 2030. 
To consider the impact of climate change 
on the Group, Admiral’s climate-related 
efforts are aligned to three focus areas – 
operations and supply chain, investments, 
and products and services – each of 
which are potentially exposed to the 
three components of climate-related 
risks (transition, physical, and liability) 
and opportunities, as defined by the TCFD 
framework. During 2023, as agreed by 
the Group Board, Admiral’s sustainability 
approach has been formally embedded 
into the Group strategy. To guide efforts 
towards achieving the company’s net zero 
commitment, the plan to transition to 
a low carbon economy includes:

•  Operations and supply chain: 

Investment has been made to increase 
Admiral’s capacity and capability to 
manage sustainability topics (e.g., 
building out the Sustainability Team), 
improve Admiral’s governance of 
climate- and sustainability-related 
topics (e.g., implementing the SSC 
and its five Working Groups), and align 
business decisions to the company’s 
net zero commitment. GHG targets 
against a 2021 baseline were submitted 
in Q3 2023 for validation by SBTi, 
which will allow Admiral to track the 
performance of its GHG emissions 
reductions on an ongoing basis and 
take tailored action as needed to 
achieve these targets and, later, the 
company’s net zero commitment. 
Initiatives for further reducing the 
Group’s operational footprint have 
been identified (e.g., mechanical 
and electrical (M&E) changes to 
plant and building management 
systems). The introduction of supply 
chain risk controls in Admiral’s 
contract management system has 
allowed the company to better 

assess the procurement category 
of environmental risk, and will allow 
Admiral to engage with key suppliers 
to encourage them to reduce their 
GHG emissions. 

•  Investments: ESG considerations 

are embedded into the investment 
approach, and since 2020 Admiral has 
followed the Institutional Investors 
Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) Net 
Zero Framework to help guide the 
decarbonisation of its investment 
portfolio, set carbon reduction targets, 
and monitor the performance of 
Admiral’s investment metrics.

•  Products and services: To manage the 
transition to a low carbon economy, 
the annual strategic planning and 
business planning processes include 
increased allowance for weather 
events in projected loss ratios, as well 
as the continued development of 
the electric vehicle (EV) offering. The 
“Diversification” pillar of the Group’s 
strategy further supports the transition 
to a low carbon economy by developing 
and launching new products and 
services. Pricing and reserving discipline 
are key metrics used to mitigate 
physical risks impacting Admiral’s 
products and are considered in the SST 
run by the company in 2023.

Outcomes from the analysis done on 
climate-related risks and opportunities, 
as well as from climate-related SST, 
discussed in detail later, and additional 
analysis from the strategic planning, 
business planning and ORSA processes 
confirm that the company’s business 
model and strategy remain resilient 
to potential climate-related impacts 
over the periods considered (2023 to 
2025): no climate-related risks (including 
operational impacts) are assessed as 
being catastrophic, the solvency position 
remains robust, and some opportunities 
offer significant upside. The potential 
impact from climate-related litigations 
(liability risk) is not presented in the 
risk assessment below, as it is currently 
assessed as not material.

Time horizons and  
assessment ratings
Admiral has defined the following time 
horizons for climate-related risks and 
opportunities: short-term (0-5 years); 
medium-term (5-10 years); and long-term 
(10+ years). This is shown graphically in 
Figure 2. The short-term time horizon 
corresponds with the business planning 
horizon, and the medium-term horizon 
coincides with the expected useful life of 
buildings and infrastructure (depending 
on the nature of the infrastructure). 
Both transition risks and physical risks are 
beginning to crystallise in the short-term, 
however the worst physical effects from 
changing weather and climatic patterns 
may materialise in the medium- and 
long-term if a smooth transition to a 
low carbon economy is not achieved. 
Liability risks are highly uncertain, in 
scope and in outcome – the first cases are 
currently being brought against oil, gas 
and energy companies – therefore any 
emergence and timing is less certain.

The potential impact is assessed 
qualitatively using subject-matter 
expert (SME) input and is cross-checked 
against the scenario outputs. At present, 
given the large uncertainty around 
the likelihood and severity of climate-
related issues, only assumptions related 
to changes to claims frequencies and 
claims costs, and the associated impact 
on loss ratios are incorporated into the 
financial planning process, and when 
monitoring financial performance and 
financial position. Work will be undertaken 
during 2024 to consider how Admiral 
Group can add additional climate-
related assumptions and their potential 
impacts in its financial planning and 
accounting activities. 

Figure 2. Time horizons for climate-related risks and opportunities

Short-term (ST): 0-5 years

Detailed five-year financial 
projections are produced as part 
of the business planning process, 
using robust assumptions based 
on current group structure and 
business mix.

Medium-term (MT): 5-10 years

Strategic investments are being 
made now in order to provide a 
material contribution to Group 
results in the medium-term. 
Results are inherently subject to 
more uncertainty, as customer 
demands, consumer behaviour, 
and the external operating 
environment are all subject to 
change, not least from the impact 
from climate change.

Risk ratings are defined as follows:
•  Moderate/minor impact: relates to 
a non-significant impact on revenue 
or profit.

•  Significant impact: relates to a 

potential impact on revenue or profit 
which exceeds normal month-to-
month variance.

•  Severe impact: relates to a potential 
impact on revenue or profits in excess 
of typical annual variance.

Opportunity ratings are 
defined as follows:
•  Moderate: relates to a non-significant 

impact on revenue or profit.

•  Major: relates to a potential impact on 
revenue or profit which exceeds normal 
month-to-month variance.

•  Transformative: relates to a potential 
impact on revenue or profits in excess 
of typical annual variance.

Long-term (LT): 10+ years

Beyond ten years it is possible that 
the Group will look considerably 
different to today and will 
potentially be operating within 
a much-changed environment. 
There is significant uncertainty 
over long-term projections.

Operations and supply chain

Transition risks
Admiral may be exposed to increased 
capital and operating expenditures, 
should legal or regulatory requirements 
designed to reduce GHG emissions, 
and/or increasing climate-related 
expectations from shareholders, 
customers, staff, or other stakeholders 
require environmentally-friendly 
changes to business operations, 
products or focus. 

Admiral has taken steps over a number 
of years to reduce its environmental 
impact, and any remaining operational 
carbon footprint is offset via the 
purchase of Gold Standard carbon 
credits. Admiral’s purpose-built 
Tŷ Admiral building complies with 
BREEAM excellent standards and has 
photovoltaics/solar panels fitted which 
provide energy directly back into the 
grid. Moreover, since 2021, Admiral has 
been working with an external party, 
Arup Group, to baseline its property 
and facilities infrastructure in order 
to consider possible carbon footprint 

improvements. The identified strategic 
initiatives are generally medium-term 
commitments, such as M&E changes 
to plant and building management 
systems, which focus on more 
economical use of utilities, water, and 
waste, improving controls of the main 
M&E plant and associated systems, and 
end-of-life replacement of M&E plant 
and machinery where a significant 
carbon reduction can be achieved. 
All such initiatives should be further 
supported by on-going improvements 
in the accuracy of data produced 
throughout the property portfolio.

Key management actions

•  The Company has set granular GHG emissions targets and submitted its 

GHG targets to SBTi for approval.

Physical risks 
Both acute and chronic physical 
risks could have a significant impact 
on Admiral’s business continuity, by 
restricting staff’s ability to commute to 
the workplace, making Admiral offices 
inaccessible or unsafe, or damaging 
critical infrastructure such as data 
centres, roads and buildings, or causing 
damage to interconnected digital 
technologies (e.g., cloud-based services 
failing due to elevated temperatures 
or floods). While the Group is better 
prepared for such an eventuality 
following the experience of responding 
to Covid and subsequent hybrid-
working model, future climate-related 
events may impact staff working from 

home and/or critical IT infrastructure 
or disrupt key suppliers in a way not 
encountered during the pandemic. 
To mitigate this risk, an improvement of 
the company’s operational resilience is 
ongoing. For example, migrating to the 
latest, cloud-based claims management 
software has included testing for 
the capacity to rollback to an earlier 
version that uses traditional in-house 
data servers. 

Admiral’s supply chain partners will 
also, to a greater or lesser extent, be 
exposed to the same risks from climate 
change as the Group. Therefore, Admiral 
is working with its largest suppliers on 
assessing their exposure to physical risk 

and reducing their carbon footprints. 
During 2023 Admiral has begun to 
account for sustainability factors in 
its procurement process, such as by 
including 16 questions related to the 
environment23 into the due diligence 
questionnaire (48 questions in total). 
The change to the questionnaire allows 
Admiral to tailor questions dynamically 
based on a supplier’s response, allowing 
the response to be risk-assessed. 
The introduction of supply chain 
risk controls in Admiral’s contract 
management system has allowed it to 
better assess the procurement category 
of environmental risk.

major cities, although these are 

medium- to long-term in nature. 
Tactical opportunities for carbon 
footprint reduction are already in force, 
including property downsizing and a

Transition risks
Admiral’s investments will be exposed 
to transition risks, as the move to a low 
carbon future may lead to some assets 
becoming less attractive. To mitigate 
these risks, Admiral has set targets to 
reduce the average carbon intensity 
of its portfolio by 25% by 2025 from 
a year-end 2020 baseline, in line with 
the Group’s overall net zero target for 
2040. In 2023, Admiral has re-baselined 
its GHG emissions using a 2021 baseline 
to be consistent with competitors 

and submitted its GHG targets to SBTi 
for verification (as part of the overall 
Group submission). To date, climate 
considerations have only had a limited 
impact on the Group’s approach to 
acquisitions and divestments, although 
any potential mergers and acquisitions 
(M&A) activity needs to align with the 
Group’s overall strategy including climate 
change. The acquisition of the UK direct 
Home and Pet personal lines insurance 
operations of RSA due in 2024, is in line 
with Admiral’s overall strategy and will be 

incorporated into the company’s net zero 
commitment. Climate-related issues have 
not had any adverse impact on access to 
capital, and indeed the company’s strong 
ESG ratings may actually be positive 
for the availability and costs of funding. 
Similarly, climate-related issues have not 
adversely impacted Admiral’s investment 
in research and development (R&D) but 
have instead shaped areas of priority and 
strategy such as the development of EVs.

Opportunities
While climate change poses a risk to the 
Group’s investments, the transition to a 
low carbon economy should also present 
investment opportunities – Admiral has 
already invested in renewable energy 
infrastructure, green bonds, and other 
corporate bonds with credible transition 
plans, and is considering approving other 
investible asset classes. The company is 

also seeking to secure a sustainability-
linked loan, which will be based on 
hitting environmental and other 
sustainability targets.

The company has targets to grow the 
number of third parties which have a 
credible plan to align emissions with a 
2°C pathway, for example via SBTs. Also, 
Admiral does not allow investments in 

companies generating more than 10% 
of their revenues from coal or tar sands 
and restricts investment in companies 
not aligned to a maximum of 2°C of 
warming, or not subject to engagement 
or stewardship actions. By 2025 the aim 
is for portfolios to also have 5% green 
bonds, with 35% of the portfolio with 
Paris-aligned commitments.

Transition risks
The move away from personal petrol 
and diesel vehicles is the most obvious 
transition risk faced by the Group and is 
one which presents a strategic challenge 
to Admiral as the company may 
experience an erosion of its traditional 
competitive advantages in pricing and 
claims handling. Initiatives to reduce 
aggregate GHG emissions could see a 
move from petrol and diesel vehicles 
to EVs, and/or a concerted move away 
from traditional models of transport 
to a model of integrated and active 
transport, based on EVs and alternatively 
fuelled vehicles (AFVs). The pace of 
transition towards such vehicles is 
unclear, being driven by a number of 
factors including customer preferences

and behaviour, the supply and cost of 
EVs and associated infrastructure, and 
crucially the stance of Government. 
The UK Government’s 2030 ban on sales 
of new petrol and diesel vehicles has 
been postponed for five years to 2035, 
the plug-in car grant scheme was ended 
in June 2022, and the allocated funding 
has been refocused towards extending 
plug-in grants to boost sales of plug-in 
taxis, motorcycles, vans and trucks and 
wheelchair accessible vehicles. 

Admiral monitors company-specific 
and market-wide metrics which

metrics capturing the attractiveness 
and competitiveness of the EV 
proposition, the claims experience, 
and the broader customer experience

ratio – all of which would be considered 
commercially sensitive). Such data helps 
the Group continually assess whether 
it is developing adequate capabilities 
in these innovative technologies.

Key management actions

•  To further support climate-related risks and opportunities being considered in 

key business decisions, work is being undertaken to further embed all aspects of 
sustainability into the Group strategy and activities. This ensures that climate-
related risks and opportunities are consistently considered in the decision-making 
process (e.g., use Admiral’s traditional competitive advantages to develop an EV 
offering in line with the company’s net zero ambition and customers’ expectations)

•  The development of an EV offering has become an explicit target in the Group’s 

strategy and Admiral is already one of the leading insurers for EVs in the UK market.

Physical risks
Admiral is exposed to both acute and 
chronic physical risks mainly impacting 
its Household lines of business. 
Climate change is causing sea levels to 
rise and is also causing more frequent 
and heavier rainfall, increasing the risk of 
flooding. Changes in weather patterns 
may also increase the incidence and 
severity of storm and freeze events, 
as well as hailstorms and subsidence. 
Together these indicate that an 
increase in the volume and value of 
Household claims is likely. The Group 
had experienced a surge in claims in 
early 2023 due to the prolonged freeze 
experienced in early December 2022 in 
the UK. In addition, Admiral was exposed 
to several storm events during 2023 – 
although their impact was relatively low. 

Business Impacted
Impact

Metrics

Key management actions

To mitigate and manage these risks, 
Admiral takes a flexible, proactive, and 
dynamic approach to risk selection and 
pricing, ensuring that written business is 
within risk appetite, and that projected 
loss ratios and combined ratios lead to 
profitability over the cycle.

Admiral also uses reinsurance 
arrangements extensively, including 
quota share and catastrophe cover 
for Household lines. These are in place 
to provide protection against an 
accumulation of claims associated with a 
weather catastrophe event.

Since launching the UK Household 
business in 2012, Admiral has sought 
to control its exposure to flood risk by 
developing an understanding of the risk 
at a granular geographical level, which 
has been coupled with a conservative 

UK household

appetite for underwriting such risk. 
In order to support this, Admiral is 
continually updating and improving 
its risk modelling, including adopting 
perils-based pricing which allows for 
interrogation of specific concentrations 
of risks. In the UK, Admiral takes part in 
the Flood Re scheme, which is designed 
to allow insurers to offer more affordable 
insurance for homes built before 
2009 in areas most at risk of flooding. 
The volume and value of policies ceded 
to Flood Re is monitored on an ongoing 
basis. By participating in the Flood 
Re scheme Admiral can underwrite 
properties which are outside of its 
acceptable flood criteria by ceding the 
flood risk to Flood Re, while still offering 
customers protection via underwriting 
all other perils.

which are considered within the annual Business Plan process and included in the 
annual ORSA Report (including climate-related scenarios and their financial impacts)

LT  Severe

•  Pricing and reserving discipline is applied and regularly re-calibrated to ensure that 

changes in claims frequency, severity, location and cost are appropriately reflected in 
proposed rates, most notably in Motor and Household lines of business

•  Reinsurance is used to mitigate large losses from natural catastrophes. 

Opportunities
There are two types of opportunities 
related to Admiral’s products 
and services:

•  The first relates to the development 
of new climate-related products and 
services. For example, aligned to the 
third of the Group’s strategic pillars, 
“Evolution of motor”, Admiral already 
has a strong and competitive EV 
offering, which will help counteract 
the expected long-term decline in the 
number of petrol and diesel vehicles 
on the road. The offering, which is 
continuously being developed and 
expanded, is discussed further on 

page 26. Related to the Household 
offering, and due to the physical risk 
impacting Admiral’s Household line 
of business, in 2023 the company 
released a Storm Hub website to 
send timely weather warnings to 
customers ensuring they are aware of 
any extreme weather events that may 
affect them.

•  The second is aligned with the 

second pillar of the Group’s strategy 
– “Diversification” – and seeks to 
develop and launch new products 
and services in line with emerging 
customer needs outside its core 
business, and which may be less 

emissions-intensive. These initiatives 
may help counteract any long-term 
move away from private vehicle 
ownership to more integrated 
transport solutions.

Taken together, these areas will help 
support Admiral in the transition to a 
low-carbon economy, by exploring new 
opportunities as well as by shielding 
Admiral from any contraction in its core 
business. The loans business may also be 
affected in the longer-term as increasing 
demand of loans for Household

Stress and Scenario Testing (SST)
While qualitative assessments of the impact from climate 
change are useful, it is also important to quantify the 
impact where possible to better understand the financial 
cost of climate change. Stress and Scenario Testing (SST) is 
conducted as part of the annual ORSA process to understand 
the robustness of the Group’s business model and strategy 
to the impact of various risks. In addition to the standard ORSA 
scenarios, two climate change scenarios from the Network 
for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)25 2022 phase III were 
performed this year.

The two scenarios examined were “disorderly – delayed 
transition” and “hot house world – current policies”, both of 
which were modified and recalibrated to be relevant and 
applicable for Admiral’s climate risk exposure. The period 
modelled is 2023-2025 as the current focus is on short-
term impact, as inherent uncertainty as well as developing 
approaches to assessment mean there is less confidence in 
medium-term and long-term impacts. As modelling capabilities 
are further developed, Admiral will increasingly also focus on 
medium- and long-term assessments.

The NGFS “disorderly – delayed transition” scenario assumes 
that the implementation of policies needed to drive the 
transition to net zero is delayed until 2030, and is then sudden 
and disorderly, resulting in material short-term macroeconomic 
disruption. Under this scenario, global warming is limited to 
an increase of 1.6°C by 2050. This scenario has been applied to 
Admiral by exploring the transition risks from climate change 
relating to the transition of the UK motor book from petrol/
diesel vehicles to EVs, affecting the profitability of the business. 
This scenario impacts Group, AIGL and AICL, and key 
assumptions, linked to the erosion of Admiral’s traditional 
competitive advantages in pricing and claims handling, are: 

•  Mispricing of EV risks by 15% each year.

•  Two large losses per year through ordinary driving totalling 

£30m.

•  Fire catastrophe events caused by an EV in a multistorey car 

park with £25m total losses.

The NGFS “hot house world – current policies” scenario assumes 
that no action is taken on climate change so that global 
temperature levels continue to increase, reaching 3°C above 
pre-industrial levels by 2080. This scenario has been interpreted 
as resulting in increased incidents of extreme weather events, 
impacting the UK Household, Car, and Van books, impacting 
Group, AIGL and AICL. Specifically, it has been assumed that a 
catastrophic windstorm event (i.e., PRA General Insurance Stress 
Test (GIST) 2022 – Scenario A3: UK windstorm and UK flood) 
occurs each year in the UK. 

For both scenarios, it is assumed that excess of loss reinsurance 
would be in place, and the outputs are modelled for Group with 
dividends set to the base capital plan at 90% of profits.

The scenarios performed give comfort that the Group’s business 
model and strategy should remain resilient to potential climate-
related impacts over the period modelled. Under both scenarios, 
the Group solvency ratio is projected to remain above the lower 
trigger (150% on a dynamic capital add-on basis) throughout 
the projection period. Both scenarios were also used to identify 
possible management actions that the business could take 
should similar events to the scenarios actually occur. 

The risks presented by a transition to a low-carbon economy 
are not currently considered substantial in the short term. 
However, as Admiral’s strategy focuses on initiatives which 
should mitigate these risks, Admiral’s activities are considered 
to be aligned to a well-below 2°C world. In such a transition 
scenario, the strategic focus will be to accelerate the Evolution 
of Motor and Diversification pillars of the Group’s strategy. 
For the transition risk scenario, the estimated financial impact 
is a reduction in own funds each year, reducing by over £90m 
in 2025 under the no management actions assumptions, due 
to reduced profits from increased claims and reduced profit 
commissions. Physical risks may have the greatest potential 
impact on the Group’s Household insurance business in the 
long-term – in such a hot house world, the focus will be on 
ensuring robustness of the core business via pricing discipline 
and appropriate reserving. For the physical risk scenario, 
with no management actions, the overall financial impact 
at YE25 is ~£150m for Group Solvency II own funds. In the 
short term, the impact on the company’s financial positions 
(own funds, SCR) is limited and management actions available 
(e.g., dividend retention) further mitigates the financial impact 
on the company.

The financial impact assessment of the scenarios does not 
allow for Government/scientific responses or management 
and mitigating actions (e.g., annual repricing of insurance 
policies, greater or different use of reinsurance, changes 
to asset allocation in the investment portfolio), except for 
changes to dividends. However, potential mitigating actions 
are discussed qualitatively.

The output of this scenario analysis has been used in discussions 
at GRC, Group Audit Committee, and Group Board about future 
strategic direction.

Risk management

The four-step risk management process 
for climate-related risks is the same 
process as that employed for other 
risks and is therefore embedded into 
Admiral’s Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (ERMF). Climate-related 
risks are captured in the emerging risk 
horizon scanning process, are subject 
to the same materiality assessments 
as emerging risks, are represented on 
the emerging risk radar, and have their 
expected magnitudes assessed annually. 
They are discussed at and reported in 
the management and Board committees 
described in the “Governance” section of 
this disclosure.

Identification
The identification of potential climate-
related risks, as well as any opportunities, 
is embedded into Admiral’s existing 
three Lines of Defence model. It follows 
a multi-stage process which incorporates 
internal viewpoints and forecasts (e.g., 
from departmental expertise, insight 
from working groups, committees, and 
Boards) with those from external sources, 
both insurance-specific and more broadly. 
Management teams across Admiral, 
whose business areas may affect or be 
affected by climate change are a source 
in identifying climate-related risks in their 
respective areas, and act as an input to 
work coordinated by the Sustainability 
Team and the Group ERM Team, who 
articulate risks and opportunities at 
the Group level. Existing and emerging 
regulatory requirements related to 
climate change and sustainability are 
also considered. 

Materiality assessment
The nature, magnitude and timing 
of climate-related risks are all highly 
uncertain. As a result, such risks do not fit 
naturally into standard risk assessment 
approaches, and so a hybrid approach, 
which comprises both qualitative and 
quantitative components, is utilised. 
The assessment is performed at Group 
level considering transition, physical, and 
liability risks, as well as microeconomic 
and macroeconomic transmission 

channels26 applicable to each business 
line. This allows the Group to identify 
any potential impacts and opportunities 
from climate change on all current and 
potential future products and services, 
as well as on operations and investments. 
The impact of existing and emerging 
regulatory requirements related to 
climate change are also assessed. 

Climate-related risks, and any resulting 
opportunities, are initially evaluated 
qualitatively. A risk matrix approach is 
employed, whereby the potential impact 
of the risk (scored between minor and 
catastrophic) is considered alongside the 
likelihood of impact (scored between 
rare and almost certain), assessed across 
short-, medium- and long-term horizons. 
The “expected magnitude” is defined as 
the product of magnitude of impact on 
Admiral and the likelihood/plausibility 
of impact.

Where appropriate, a quantitative 
approach to assess climate-related risks 
can also be taken, and two scenarios from 
the NGFS were included as part of the SST 
section of the 2023 Group’s ORSA report 
(as shown in the box above).

Management and mitigation
The primary approach to risk mitigation 
is the ongoing successful execution 
of the Group strategy, which seeks to 
diversify the Group’s revenue and profit 
streams, thus reducing the Group’s 
reliance on UK Car, which is exposed 
to transition risk. Considerable efforts 
have been made to mitigate the risk 
of a transition to EVs, both via new and 
existing businesses, which have invested 
in developing and testing new products 
and product features to meet developing 
customer requirements. Regulatory and/
or reputation risks from climate change 
is managed through efforts made to 
reduce the Company’s GHG emissions and 
by submitting GHG targets to SBTi for 
official approval. 

The Group’s approach to managing 
the risk that climate change poses to 
insurance book is similar to its approach 
to managing other insurance risks: 
disciplined pricing and assessment 
of impact by peril, clear underwriting 
criteria, regular assessment of the 
reserving approach, and risk transfer 
via reinsurance. Admiral uses industry-
standard flood and catastrophe models 
to understand its underlying physical 
underwriting risk, and hence what amount 
of risk is accepted, what amount of risk is 
mitigated, and the reinsurance protection 
deemed appropriate for risk transfer. 
Admiral’s approach to pricing is the key 
tool for managing climate-related risks 
but given its commercial sensitivity, the 
approach is not disclosed.

Monitoring and reporting
Climate-related risks and opportunities 
are monitored by the Group ERM Team 
and are reported to the GRC via the 
CRR and CRO Report, and annually 
as part of the Group’s ORSA Report. 
They are also reported to the Group 
Board, management committees, and 
to subsidiary Boards and committees as 
required. This monitoring and reporting 
ensures that the highest level of Company 
Management is aware of the risks and 
opportunities, can account for them in 
future business planning and strategy 
setting, and can devise management 
actions to mitigate their effects or to 
capture any resulting opportunities. 

The Regulatory Compliance Team, part of 
Group Compliance, monitors and reviews 
publications and pronouncements from 
various regulators, supervisors, and 
transnational bodies, including but not 
limited to the FCA, the PRA, the Bank 
of England, and EIOPA. Summaries are 
distributed to relevant stakeholders 
as and when material is published, a 
monthly round-up is distributed more 
broadly across the Group, and regulatory 
developments are discussed in the 
SSC’s Risk, Compliance, and Reporting 
Working Group.

Metrics and targets

Substantial progress has been made in 
2023 regarding the collection, verification, 
and reporting of climate-related data. 
Most notably, Admiral’s GHG targets for 
Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 emissions, which 
support the achievement of Admiral’s 
net zero ambitions across all of its 
carbon footprint by 2040, were approved 
by the Board and submitted to SBTi 
for verification. 

Metrics relevant to operations and supply 
chain, investments, and products and 
services disclosed in this section are 
aligned to the risks and opportunities 
presented above. However other 
numerical values that may be considered 
commercially sensitive are not included. 
Other cross-industry climate-related 
metrics are not disclosed in this report as 
they are not considered to be materially 
relevant to the Company’s performance – 
given the nature, scale and the complexity 
of its operations and business. 

Operations and supply chain
As a global financial services Company, 
Admiral has a low operational footprint 
when compared to its complete carbon 
footprint, including the supply chain 
and investment portfolio. This has been 
aided by the efforts made over the past 
decade to mitigate the physical risk on its 
operations and supply chain. Efforts have 
led to improvements in the efficiency of 
buildings, critical IT infrastructure, the 
procurement process, and has helped 
the strengthening of the evaluation and 
monitoring of its energy consumption 
with support from Accenture.

Since 2019 Admiral has offset its 
remaining Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as 
well as some Scope 3 emissions. However, 
Admiral recognises that offsetting 
emissions is not enough, and Admiral 
should seek to further reduce its GHG 
emissions. Therefore, Admiral is working 
hard to reduce the absolute level of its 
operational GHG emissions.

85

GHG emissions are quantified in 
alignment with the World Resources 
Institute’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard and are discussed further in the 
SECR section of the annual report on page 
71. Unverified emissions data, including 
for 2023, as well as a description of the 
methodology used to estimate metrics 
if data is missing, is also included in that 
section, as are further operational metrics.

Investments
As a financial services company, a 
significant part of Admiral’s emissions are 
category 15 emissions (part of Scope 3), 
from the investment portfolio. Admiral has 
therefore committed to achieving a 
reduction in investment-related GHG 
emissions of 25% by 2025, and of 50% by 
2030, reaching net zero GHG emissions 
by 2040 at the latest – aligned to the 
overall target.

To mitigate the transition risk of having 
an obsolete investment approach and/or 
holding unattractive assets, and to ensure 
that above targets are met, Admiral has 
developed an investment proposal to 
align its corporate bond mandates to the 
Paris Agreement, following the Net zero 
Investment Framework. This is a practical 
blueprint for achieving net zero emissions 
by 2050 which has been endorsed by the 
UN’s Race to Zero campaign. The proposal 
has several features, including reducing 
emissions over time and increasing 
investment in sustainable assets and 
funds (green bonds and holdings with 
confirmed SBTs, as per Admiral’s climate-

related investment metrics). There will not 
be blanket divestment rules, but instead 
Admiral’s investment managers are 
expected to be engaging with companies 
which could, as a last resort, possibly lead 
to divestment and reinvestment in less 
carbon-intensive names over time.

Several challenges should be noted: 
sourcing reliable and consistent data; 
avoiding unintentional consequences 
such as under-diversification; and reliably 
determining the expected risk and return 
impact of such a strategy. However, 
in order to guide and review progress 
towards overall targets, a number of 
metrics are tracked, shown in Table 3. 
Investment metrics are calculated by 
identifying in-scope non-cash assets and 
applying MSCI ESG data on a per security 
basis. Various metrics are subsequently 
calculated at a whole portfolio level.

Weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) 
is calculated by taking the most recently 
available carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2) 
per million USD of revenue for all in-scope 
securities, and weighting that by the 
individual security’s market value relative 
to the in-scope portfolio (in scope refers 
to public corporate bonds as defined by 
EIOPA’s Complementary Identification 
Code (CIC)). The WACI shows how carbon 
intense (how much carbon per million 
USD of revenue) the average company 
in which Admiral holds investments is 
(of the in-scope investments); it is a 
measure of Admiral’s exposure to carbon 
intense companies.

Products and services
As discussed above, the effects of 
climate change may impact all of 
Admiral’s business lines. Physical risks, 
which may be managed via risk selection 
and reinsurance protection, might be 
more prominent in Admiral’s Household 
businesses, while transition risks may be 
felt more keenly in the Motor businesses. 
The “Diversification” pillar of the Group’s 
strategy should mitigate such impacts 
from physical and transition risks.

Admiral tracks a number of climate- and 
diversification-related metrics in order 
to assess its exposure to climate-related 
risks, such as modelled burn cost per peril, 
the number and value of weather-event-
related claims, or times top27 and loss 
ratios for the EV offering. However, in the 
main, these are considered commercially 
sensitive. Admiral is able to disclose the 
metrics shown in table 4 opposite, as per 
the Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board Standard.

Probable Maximum 
Loss (PML) of 
insured products 
from weather  
related natural 
catastrophes

•  Admiral utilises various methods and evaluations to make 
underwriting and reinsurance decisions that manage the 
Group’s exposure to catastrophic events. Across the Group’s 
insurance book, the main weather-related risks pertain to 
Admiral’s UK Household book, as well as the US Motor book

•  Admiral’s Household excess of loss reinsurance provides 

catastrophe cover with a limit above the estimated 1-in-200 loss. 
As of January 2024, this was estimated to be £560-580 million 
from floods and storms, etc. for the UK Household insurance 
business. Admiral’s excess of loss deductible is £65 million, and 
the 70% quota share leads to a net event loss of £19.5 million

• 

• 

In relation to Admiral’s UK Car insurance business, the 1-in-200 
estimated possible loss as of December 2022 was £90-115 million. 
Admiral currently has up to £80 million of cover from the motor 
excess of loss reinsurance and a further £6 million from the 
property excess of loss reinsurance. Therefore, after the £12 million 
deductible, Admiral is covered up to a £98 million single event

In relation to the US Motor insurance business, the 1-in-200 
estimated possible loss as of June 2023 was $22-26 million. 
The US business has $21.5 million of cover from the motor excess 
of loss reinsurance. Therefore, after the $3.5 million deductible, 
the US business is covered up to a $25 million single event.

Admiral Group does not separately identify losses by modelled 
and non-modelled catastrophes. However, the table below 
provides some details on the weather-related losses following 
natural catastrophes in relation to the UK Household book, 
which represents the main weather-related risk from across 
the Group’s operations. The table covers property catastrophe 
losses above £5.0m across 2018-2023. The most notable change 
compared to data disclosed in the 2022 TCFD report is for Storm 
Eunice and the freeze event from 2022, which now have an 
incurred cost of >£50m.

Fulfilling
THE BOARD’S s172 DUTIES 
TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS 
AND STAKEHOLDERS

The Board balances the 
occasionally conflicting 
needs and priorities of 
Admiral’s key stakeholders, 
whilst ensuring all decisions 
taken promote the long-term 
success of the Group.

In accordance with their duties under 
s172(1) of the Companies Act 2006, 
the Board of Directors individually 
and collectively confirm that, during 
the year under review, they have acted 
in a way that they consider, in good 
faith, is most likely to promote the 
long-term success of the Company 
for the benefit of its members as a 
whole, whilst having due regard to the 
matters set out in section 172(1)(a) to 
(f) of the Companies Act 2006, being:

•  a) the likely consequences of any 

decision in the long-term;

•  b) the interests of the 
Company’s employees;

•  c) the need to foster the Company’s 

business relationships with 
suppliers, customers and others;

•  d) the impact of the Company’s 
operations on the community 
and environment;

•  e) the desirability of the Company 
maintaining a reputation for high 
standards of business conduct; and

•  f) the need to act fairly between 

members of the Company.

Pages 87 and 128 set out how the 
Admiral Board has met its obligations 
under s172. 

How the Board fulfils its 
duties under s172
Our Directors and the Board collectively 
are bound by the duties set out under 
section 172(1) Companies Act 2006 and 
are required to confirm in a statement 
how these obligations have been fulfilled 
during the year. Our s172 statement 
detailed on page 87 explains how, during 
the year, the Board has acted in a way 
that it considers, in good faith, would 
be most likely to promote the success 
of the Company for the benefit of our 
shareholders, whilst having due regard to 
those stakeholders identified under s172. 
The principal decisions taken by the Board 
during the year, which take into account 
s172 considerations, can be found on 
page 128.

Understanding the requirements, 
concerns and ambitions of Admiral’s 
stakeholders is important to inform 
the Board’s creation of an effective and 
sustainable business strategy. The Board 
takes into consideration the views of all 
stakeholders both when formulating, 
and also when implementing this strategy. 
In doing this, in conjunction with our 
values and our culture, the Board is 
confident that it will ultimately fulfil 
our purpose and drive the long-term 
sustainable success of the Admiral Group. 

The Board understands that relevant 
stakeholder considerations should be 
integral to Board discussions and its 
decision-making process. It is mindful 
in all its deliberations of the long-term 
consequences of its decisions, as well 
as the importance of the Admiral 
Group maintaining its reputation for 
high standards of business conduct. 
Engagement with our stakeholders 
is key to this process, allowing the 

Board to obtain comfort that relevant 
stakeholders have been identified, their 
positions considered and understood, 
and that different stakeholder groups 
have been treated fairly. The feedback 
we receive through our engagement 
with stakeholders is detailed in our Board 
reports and forms a key part of Board 
discussions, ensuring the Board can focus 
on running the business for the benefit 
of all our stakeholders for the long-term. 

During 2023, the Board reviewed its 
key stakeholder profiles and confirmed 
that of the six groups identified within 
s172; people, shareholders, customers, 
suppliers and partners, community, 
and the environment, all remained 
material stakeholders for the Admiral 
Group and continued to be strategically 
important to the long-term success of 
Admiral’s operations. As part of its 2023 
review, the Board considered the current 
approach to engagement with, and 
governance around, each stakeholder 
group. In addition, the internal stakeholder 
relationship owners within the Admiral 
Group provided detail to the Board 
on existing engagement methods, 
feedback processes and the activities 
and plans for stakeholder engagement 
for the year ahead.

Further information on wider stakeholder 
engagement across the Admiral Group can 
be found within the Sustainability Report 
on page 56, and the Corporate Governance 
Report on page 113. A description of the 
principal decisions taken by the Board 
during the year, taking into account s172 
considerations, are set out on page 128. 
Key stakeholder engagement channels

Section 172 Statement 
continued

The Board promotes the long-term success of the Admiral Group by ensuring the highest standards 
of business conduct, understanding the long-term implications of its decisions, and ensuring all 
stakeholders are treated fairly. It does this through: 

Defining Admiral group’s purpose, culture, values and strategy: 
The Board has defined Admiral’s purpose and sets and monitors 
the culture and values of the Group. Our purpose, culture and 
values alongside engagement with, and an understanding of, the 
requirements of our stakeholders, assist in guiding the strategic 
direction and long-term interests of the Group, informing Board 
discussion, and ensuring decisions are taken in line with the 
agreed strategy, giving equal regard to all our stakeholders. 
See pages 14 and 132 for further information. 

Understanding the required Board skills, knowledge and 
experience: Directors have wide ranging, relevant expertise 
and experience that they are able to use to inform and guide 
decision-making to ensure this is of the highest quality, whilst also 
incorporating a balanced consideration of the expectations of 
all relevant stakeholders. Significant time is spent inducting new 
Board members along with annually assessing and implementing 
educational programmes. This allows for educated and informed 
decisions being made to promote the long-term sustainable 
success of the Group in the best interests of all stakeholders. 
See page 146 for further information.

Ensuring high quality Board meetings: Board and Board 
Committee agenda planners set out matters to be considered 
by the Board and Board Committees during the year. These are 
regularly reviewed and updated during the year to ensure that 
the Board continues to meet the evolving demands of the Group. 
Standardised Board reporting templates are in place and training 
has been provided to those producing Board papers to ensure 
consistency, clarity and conciseness in approach. See pages 144 
and 145 for further information. 

Considering stakeholder interests and impact: Board papers 
are accompanied by a covering document outlining; i) which 
stakeholders could potentially be impacted by a Board decision, 
ii) an explanation of how stakeholder interests have been 
considered, iii) the likely consequences for those stakeholders, 
and iv) how the impact on stakeholders could be monitored. 
This process ensures the Board is aware of and gives due regard 
to its s172 obligations during the Board discussion and decision-
making process. See pages 144 and 145 for further information.

Open Board discussion and decision-making process: Our 
Board environment encourages an open, honest and accountable 
decision-making culture, which is subject to rigorous risk 
management and challenge to ensure any decision taken is of the 
highest standard and supports the long-term sustainable success of 
the Group. The Board is aware that in some situations stakeholder 
interests may be conflicted and it may have to prioritise interests, 
however the Board ensures that, as part of those considerations 
evaluated through its decision-making process, all stakeholders are 
taken into account and are treated fairly. 

Effective Board review process: The Board is regularly updated 
on the implementation and results of key decisions through the 
Board and Committee reporting framework. This is carried out 
through regular management reports and shareholder and wider 
stakeholder feedback submitted to the Board as part of the 
engagement process. The Board’s performance in its decision-
making processes are monitored and appraised through its 
annual Board and Committee performance evaluation to ensure 
it maintains the highest standard of conduct. Further details on 
this process can be found on page 158.

The principal decisions taken by the Board during the year and how the requirements set out under s172 were taken into account 
are set out in the Governance Report on page 128.

People

Through our culture and 
values, we are committed to 
providing a diverse, inclusive 
and supportive working 
environment. During the year 
Admiral has been recognised 
as being one of the best places 
to work in the UK, and in  
the other countries in which 
we operate.

Why engaging with our 
employees is important
We believe that people who like what 
they do, do it better. Our c.13,000 
colleagues’ well-being and positive 
engagement in their roles is essential 
to the long-term success of Admiral. 
Our team has always been a powerful 
source of competitive advantage and, 
as such, Admiral takes great pride in 
looking after its employees and helping 
them look after their future. The Board’s 
engagement with the Admiral team 
fosters a happier and more productive 
workforce, supports operational 
excellence, and ultimately shapes 
better outcomes for our customers 
and other stakeholders. In 2023, 95% of 
our colleagues around the world stated 
their belief that the Admiral Group 
was a diverse and inclusive employer.

How the business engages 
with our employees 
Admiral employees are encouraged to 
engage across multiple channels, virtually 
and face-to-face. Examples of this include:

•  Regular communication through a 

variety of internal channels and social 
communication tools

•  UK and International employee 

consultation groups providing an 
employee voice and input into how 
the business operates

•  Employee surveys capturing feedback 
and engagement across the business

•  A wide variety of employee forums 

and working groups around diversity 
and inclusion – see page 56 for 
further information

•  One to ones with managers and regular 

development meetings

•  Feedback schemes such as ‘Ask Milena’ 

and ‘Have your say’

•  Regular employee education and 

compliance courses 

•  Whistleblowing channels.

Further examples of how we engage with 
our colleagues can be found on page 132.

How the Board engages 
with employees
The Board recognises the importance 
of engaging with its workforce and does 
so through a combination of formal 
and informal channels. The Board has 
established a UK Employee Consultation 
Group (ECG) and an International 
Employee Consultation Group (IECG). 
Board Directors are invited to participate 
in these meetings. The Chairs of the 
employee forums report directly to 
the Board on key areas discussed to 
give an ‘employee voice’ at the Board 
table, and subsequently report back to 
the employee forums with updates on 
Board discussions. The Board also regularly 
meets employees through visits to office 
sites, presentations at Board meetings, 
and is regularly updated by management 
on people matters, employee 
engagement, survey results and culture. 

For further information see:

Diversity and inclusion 
Principal decisions

Awards

Outcomes and impact of  
Board decision-making 
The Board discussed the output received 
from several ECG and IECG engagement 
sessions during the year for the purposes 
of understanding those issues that were 
of interest or concern to employees. 
Significant topics addressed included the 
impact of the increased cost of living, 
working practices and sustainability/
ESG issues. The Board also received and 
considered reports and updates from the 
Head of People Services and subsidiary 
boards. The Board discussed financial 
measures to support employees and, 
as a result, were supportive of a five 
percent pay increase to all UK based 
employees, approved by the EUI Board, to 
help mitigate the impact of inflationary 
costs. In addition, the Board confirmed 
a share award to employees to ensure 
a sense of shared ownership in the 
success of the business. As a result of the 
Board’s approval of the acquisition of 
the More Than home and pet personal 
lines insurance operations from RSA, 
Admiral is delighted to welcome c.300 
new colleagues to the Admiral Group. 
The Board was pleased that the significant 
work ongoing around the building of 
a diverse and inclusive culture was 
recognised through the results of the 
Great Place To Work Survey with 87% 
of employees believing Admiral was a 
great place to work. This was further 
demonstrated through several awards 
received during the year including the 
best big company to work for at the Best 
Company Awards. The Board ensured that 
the significant activity streams already in 
place would continue and evolve, and that 
the Group would continue to focus on 
building its unique culture through these 
multiple channels.

Shareholders

We aim to protect and manage 
our shareholder capital in a 
responsible and accountable 
manner, whilst generating 
long-term sustainable value 
for the Group.

Why engaging with our 
shareholders is important
Shareholder engagement fosters an 
alignment of interests between the 
owners of the business and the Board. 
It allows the Board to explain the rationale 
behind business and strategic decisions 
whilst providing opportunities for 
shareholders to comment and challenge 
business priorities.

How the business engages 
with shareholders
Admiral aims to have regular and 
constructive engagement with our 
shareholders through a varied number 
of channels, examples of which include: 

•  Investor site visits, conference calls 

and meetings

•  Market disclosures, including interim 
and full year results announcements 
and presentations

•  The Annual Report and 
Sustainability Report

•  Investor and analyst presentations, 
roadshows (in person and remotely) 
and corporate governance meetings, 
for example, to discuss the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy

•  Regular analyst engagement, including 
ad hoc sessions on topical issues, for 
example the implementation of the 
IFRS 17 accounting standard 

•  The 2023 Annual General Meeting

•  Admiral’s corporate website, which 
is regularly updated and contains all 
relevant shareholder information. 

How the Board engages 
with shareholders
The Board enjoys long-standing 
relationships with Admiral’s largest 
shareholders, including the founders of 
the Group, and receives regular updates 
on the activities of the Investor Relations 
team as well as meetings with investors 
held with the Board and management 
team. The Board also receives investor 
feedback (post roadshows results/
conferences) and uses this to help shape 
its approach to corporate governance 
and strategy, ensuring that any issues or 
concerns raised are considered during 
Board discussions. During 2023, there 
were over 80 separate engagements held 
with institutional shareholders, including 
significant engagement with shareholders 
regarding the Remuneration Policy to 
be voted on by shareholders at the 2024 
AGM. The Board also receives regular 
updates on market dynamics, share price 
performance and share register changes. 
The Board engages with Admiral’s retail 
shareholders through the AGM process. 

Outcomes and impact of 
Board decision-making 
As part of the new Chair’s induction 
process, Mike Rogers met with significant 
shareholders to understand their views 
on various aspects of the business, 
including Admiral’s strategy and corporate 
governance. This engagement assisted 
the new Chair in shaping the direction 
of Board discussion and decision-
making processes. The Remuneration 
Committee incorporated feedback 
received through direct engagement 
with significant shareholders to assist 
in formulating a revised Remuneration 
Policy, ensuring there was an alignment 
of interests. The Board considered the 
views received through its shareholder 
engagement programme, which fed into 
its Board strategy sessions and assisted 
in formulating the framework for Group 
strategy. The Board’s engagement 
with stakeholders regarding Admiral’s 
£250 million Tier 2 bond issue along with 
a tender for the existing £200 million 
5.5% subordinated Tier 2 notes ensured 
this process was concluded without issue. 
The Board also considered feedback 
from shareholders as part of its process 
when considering interim and final 
dividend approval.

Customers

We aim to provide a great 
customer experience.

Why engaging with our 
customers is important
Our customers are at the heart of 
our business and the focus of our 
purpose to ‘help more people to look 
after their future. Always striving for 
better together’. As a customer-centric 
organisation, we seek to provide more 
people with the opportunity to access 
good financial services products. 
The needs of our customers shape the 
products we deliver, and their feedback 
and expectations inform the design 
of our customer distribution channels 
and platforms. 

In 2023, we implemented the new 
Consumer Duty regulation with the 
goal of monitoring and evidencing 
good customer outcomes and making 
enhancements, where required, to drive 
even better outcomes. We continue to 
use data and insights to inform these 
processes thinking seriously about the 
outcomes we deliver for our customers 
and continually making improvements to 
our products and services where needed. 
For more information see pages 60, 111 
and 130.

How the business engages 
with our customers
There are opportunities for the business 
to communicate and engage with our 
customers, and vice versa, throughout the 
different points in the customer life cycle. 
Some of these mechanisms include: 

•  Discussions with our customer 

service teams, new business and 
renewals teams, claims teams, and 
complaints teams

•  Online customer portals: During 2023, 
we built more functionality into the UK 
customer portal to make services easier 
for customers to access

•  Live chats with agents and ‘Admiral App’ 

messages

•  Social media: In 2023, we increased 
engagement through simplified 
wording and website updates

•  Customer feedback through comment 

forms, surveys, SMS, along with 
customer focus groups and panels

•  Perception studies: Frequently 
reviewing the engagement 
mechanisms across our customer base, 
particularly throughout digital journeys, 
allows us to understand what is most 
important to our customers and helps 
us to continually refine and improve our 
service to customers.

How the Board engages 
with our customers
Whilst not having significant direct 
exposure to customers, the Board 
continues to receive updates from 
management on the treatment of its 
existing customers and the various 
processes that are designed to ensure 
fair outcomes throughout the customer 
journey. Customer satisfaction levels 
are fed into Board discussions which 
ultimately helps shape strategic decision 
making, including plans related to 
digital investment and future product 

For further information see:
Strategic Report

Business model 

diversification. The Board receives annual 
feedback on the conduct risk framework 
through the Group Risk Committee. 
Board members also took part in call 
listening in the customer claims area as 
part of this year’s Board strategy meeting. 

Outcomes and impact of Board 
decision-making 
During the year the Board, through 
its reporting framework, oversaw the 
implementation of the new Consumer 
Duty regulations within the Group’s 
relevant regulated subsidiary entities, 
and received detailed updates as to 
the progression against agreed plans. 
The FCA were invited to the April 2023 
Board meeting, where constructive 
discussions were held around the 
FCA’s expectations in terms of the 
implementation of the new Consumer 
Duty regime and how Admiral’s plans 
met with these expectations. The Board 
ensured that mechanisms were in place 
to monitor the treatment of, along with 
the outcomes for, our customers, and 
oversee that appropriate changes in 
products and services would be made 
where required. The Board was able to 
oversee the further alignment of Admiral’s 
processes as a result of its engagement 
with the FCA and feedback through 
customer surveys. The Board oversaw the 
successful migration of over 6.5 million 
customer policies to a new policy and 
billing centre on Guidewire during the 
year, which will integrate technological 
improvements with enhanced security 
measures, providing an improved 
customer experience. The Board approved 
the acquisition of the More Than direct 
Home and Pet personal lines insurance 
business from RSA in December 2023. 
Once completed this will both support the 
Board’s objective of diversification, whilst 
offering existing and new customers a 
strong multi product proposition.

Communities 

We aim to ensure that 
Admiral’s impact on society  
is positive.

Why engaging with our 
communities is important
Giving back to our communities is an 
integral part of Admiral’s culture. As a 
large employer across several countries, 
we believe it is our responsibility to 
provide employment opportunities for 
those in the local areas whilst at the same 
time, training and developing our people. 
We are committed to recognising and 
promoting diversity both within Admiral 
and within the communities in which 
we operate. Issues identified through 
engagement with our communities 
include employability, social mobility, 
educational opportunities, financial 
inclusion, and support for sports, arts, 
and culture. By addressing these, we 
demonstrate a genuine commitment 
to the well-being of our community 
stakeholders. This strategic engagement 
not only reflects our values, but also 
positions us as a responsible corporate 
citizen, who contributes to long-term 
positive change both within and beyond 
the Group.

How the business engages 
with our communities
Our engagement with communities 
is driven by our people, who actively 
participate in nominating and selecting 
initiatives that align with local community 
needs. This culture of giving and shared 
responsibility is embedded across our 
entire Group. Our approach to community 
engagement includes:

•  Colleague volunteering: 

Through initiatives like our ‘Impact 
Hours’ scheme, where our colleagues 
contribute their time and skills to 
support various community projects

•  Charity initiatives: We are involved 

in a range of charity initiatives, 
demonstrating our commitment 
to financial and resource-
based contributions

•  Partnerships: We foster partnerships 

with organisations across the 
world, recognising the importance 
of collaboration in addressing key 
community issues

•  Sponsorship and fundraising: 
We support community events 
through sponsorships, fundraising 
efforts, and the funding of projects 
via our Community Fund and Match 
Fund processes. 

To manage risks and capitalise on 
opportunities as they evolve, our 
Community Strategy is continuously 
reviewed and adapted. Monitoring the 
impact of our actions is integral to our 
approach, with feedback mechanisms 
from our partners, our people, our 
communities, and external entities 
such as the Welsh Government. 
This comprehensive system of monitoring 
ensures that our community engagement 
remains effective, responsive, and 
aligned with our strategic goals. 
This objective will be further enhanced 
going forward by moves to combine our 
programmes to support community and 
environmental issues.

For further information see:
Strategic Report
Business Model 
Sustainability 

How the Board engages with 
our communities 
The Board believes Admiral should be seen 
as a force for good within its communities 
and has oversight over the implementation 
of initiatives in line with this ambition 
and receives updates as to their progress. 
Locally, through our UK charitable giving, 
the Board oversaw Admiral volunteering 
14,000+ impact hours during 2023 and has 
set the ambitious target of volunteering 
25,000 impact hours in 2024 – see 
page 66. Alongside this are numerous 
community and sponsorship initiatives, 
further details of which can be found 
at www.admiral.com/community-and-
sponsorship. Further afield, internationally 
our Global Emergency Fund, supported 
by the Board, has enabled Admiral to 
make fast donations when people and 
organisations need it most, for example, 
significant donations were made to assist 
charities involved in the Turkey-Syria 
earthquake appeal, the Canadian wildfires 
and flooding in Italy. In 2023, Admiral 
donated over £400,000 to a number 
of urgent appeals through our Global 
Emergency Fund – see pages 21 and 66  
for further information.

Outcomes and impact of Board 
decision-making 
The Board received updates on key 
community initiatives across the Group, 
providing strategic direction and 
approving innovative programs such as 
our Community Investment Strategy 
discussed on page 66. The Board reviewed 
progress on the ‘Together for Better’ 
programme, Admiral’s commitment 
to transforming futures in the local 
community. This programme pledged, 
over a five-year period, a percentage of 
Group profit as a financial commitment 
to enable our Community Investment 
Strategy to focus on helping local people 
obtain employment, filling gaps in the 
labour market, and an ambitious target 
to cumulatively complete 100,000 
volunteering hours in our communities.

Environment

We are committed to 
achieving net zero greenhouse 
gas emissions by 2040, 
across all three scopes of 
emissions, and to cut these 
emissions in half by 203028.

Why engaging with environmental 
issues is important
Engaging with environmental issues is 
strategically important to Admiral and 
reflects our commitment to responsible 
business behaviour and our recognition 
of the importance of addressing climate 
challenges. It also aligns with our purpose 
of ‘helping more people to look after 
their futures; always striving for better, 
together’. This commitment is driven by 
several key stakeholder considerations:

•  Our people seek assurance that 
they are part of a Company 
that actively contributes to the 
protection of the natural world and 
addresses the climate emergency. 
Demonstrating responsibility 
towards the environment is integral 
to maintaining a motivated and 
engaged workforce

•  Our customers not only expect 
protection for their property but 
also want assurance that we are 
safeguarding their future by adopting 
environmentally responsible practices. 
This builds trust and enhances 
our reputation

•  Our shareholders and regulators 

are increasingly concerned with how 
businesses respond to environmental 
challenges – both how the environment 
impacts the business and how the 
business impacts the environment. 
Demonstrating resilience to 
climate-related events and seizing 
opportunities aligns with their 
expectations and contributes to the 
Group’s overall robustness

•  Our commitment is to minimise our 

•  Green Team initiatives: Our internal 

direct environmental impact, including 
reducing our carbon footprint, and 
also support our customers with the 
transition to a greener society. This not 
only aligns with regulatory and societal 
expectations but positions us well 
for changes in markets and customer 
expectations and also highlights 
Admiral as a conscientious and forward-
thinking organisation.

How the business engages with 
environmental issues
Our engagement with environmental 
issues is multifaceted and reflects 
a proactive approach to increasing 
awareness and taking concrete actions. 
Key initiatives include:

•  Sustainability Steering Committee: 
To support a more holistic and co-
ordinated approach to sustainability 
issues, the former Sustainability 
Working Group and Climate Change 
Steering Committee were replaced 
in 2023 by the Sustainability Steering 
Committee (SSC) in Q4 2023. 
Supported by five working groups, 
the SSC is a management committee 
that provides guidance on the overall 
programme of sustainability-related 
work and ensures a joined-up approach 
across all Group functions and Group 
entities. This includes environmental 
issues such as climate change

•  Operational sustainability: Admiral is 
a carbon neutral entity. Key initiatives 
to achieve this milestone included 
investments in solar panels on our 
headquarters in Cardiff, purchasing of 
energy from 100% renewable sources 
(in the UK), and purchasing of Gold 
Standard carbon credits since 2019 
to offset its operational emissions. 
This covers Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
and partially covers Scope 3

•  Net zero ambition: We have formally 
committed to achieving net zero 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2040  
at the latest, across all three scopes  
of emissions, and to cut these emissions 
in half by 2030.28 We are currently in  
the process of securing verified  
science-based targets that will enable 
us to hit both targets.

Green Team is a working group 
dedicated to green initiatives. 
Regular internal updates from this 
team drive awareness and action to 
lessen the impact of climate change 
– both within the business and within 
employees’ own lifestyle choices

•  Internal promotion: Special events 
such as Green Week and Earth Day, 
promoted internally, serve to raise 
awareness and engage employees in 
environmentally responsible practices

•  Employee engagement: We actively 
engage with employees through 
forums, CEO updates, and various 
recycling initiatives across our offices. 
This ensures that our commitment 
to environmental responsibility is 
embedded within our Group culture

•  Monitoring and reporting: We 
recognise that environmental 
disclosures are increasingly requested 
by investors, shareholders, customers, 
regulators and other stakeholders. 
For 2023, Admiral made disclosures 
consistent with the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), against the Streamlined 
Energy and Carbon Reporting 
Framework (SECR) and against the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB) Standards. In addition, 
Admiral also reports on the Climate-
related Financial Disclosure (CFD) 
requirements introduced in 2022 as 
part of the UK Government’s Greening 
Finance roadmap.

To read more on how the business 
engages with environment issues see 
our Sustainability Report on page 56, our 
SECR disclosures on page 71, and  
our TCFD disclosures on page 73.

28  Proposed baseline year for emissions cuts is 2021,  

still to be verified by SBTi.

How the Board engages with 
environmental issues 
The Board is the principal governing body 
overseeing sustainability-related issues 
and takes ownership of sustainability and 
climate-related topics and associated 
stakeholder engagement. The Board 
approves the Group’s sustainability 
approach and our Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) ambitions which 
can have a material impact on Admiral. 
Milena Mondini, Group CEO, is the 
accountable sustainability representative 
on the Group Board. The Board receives 
regular updates on climate and wider ESG-
related topics, providing feedback, and 
ensuring alignment with our Responsible 
Investment Policy. 

Outcomes and impact of  
Board decision-making 
The Board reaffirmed the Group’s 
sustainability agenda as part of a 
2023 strategy refresh, overseeing the 
appointment of a new Group Head of 
Sustainability and enhancements to 
the sustainability governance structure. 
The Board also confirmed Admiral’s 
commitment to achieving net zero 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, across all 
three scopes of emissions, and to cut these 
emissions in half by 2030, and reviewed 
progress in relation to these ambitions. 
Updates were received on requirements 
from regulators and government initiatives 
with regards to sustainability and climate 
change. This included a review of the 

PRA’s position on climate change and 
the financial system. The PRA notified 
businesses that climate change presented 
an increasing, material risk to firms and 
the financial system and confirmed that it 
was taking a more active role in supervising 
firms in relation to its expectations on 
climate change. To address the increasing 
sustainability agenda, the Board oversaw 
the introduction of the Sustainability 
Steering Committee in October 2023 
to provide a joined-up approach across 
all Group functions. More information 
on how the Board assesses climate 
related risks and opportunities along 
with the implementation of climate and 
sustainability initiatives is included in our 
climate-related disclosure section on 
page 71.

Partners and Suppliers

We aim to build strong, 
mutually beneficial working 
relationships with our 
partners and suppliers.

Why engaging with our partners 
and suppliers is important 
Our partners and suppliers comprise a 
mix of financial partners, reinsurance 
partners, IT hosting, distribution, claims 
management and services partners, and 
many others. It is crucial that the Group 
manages these relationships effectively 
to mitigate the associated third-party 
risks across the supply chain. Our partners 
and suppliers are considered strategically 
important to us either because (i) the 
supplier is a material outsourcer, (ii) the 
supplier or partner is integral to achieving 
future strategic goals, (iii) there are 
particularly preferential rates or terms in 
place, or (iv) another factor which makes 
the relationship hard to replicate or 
replace. Admiral’s supply chain supports 
our global operations in delivering services 
to our customers and involves over 1,100 
contracted suppliers.

We act responsibly when dealing with 
our suppliers, choosing to support local 
and regional providers where possible. 
We also choose and encourage an ethical 
and environmentally friendly supply chain 
and also making sure we pay in a timely 
manner to support the financial resilience 
of our suppliers.

How the business engages with 
our partners and suppliers
To ensure strong third-party supplier 
management there are dedicated 
processes across the Group to govern 
end-to-end relationships. Key business 
units have internal relationship managers 
responsible for ongoing performance 
management, which would include 
ensuring active contract renewals, 
negotiations, business reviews and service 
improvement. Business continuity and 
exit plans are in place and are actively 
managed. Admiral uses a dedicated 
contract management system to 
monitor and support the governance 
of procurement, provide tender 
management, contract management, 
supplier management and due diligence 
under a single platform. The Group’s 
dedicated regulatory relationship teams 
maintain channels of communication 
with the FCA and PRA in the UK, and 
the Group’s international regulated 
intermediaries and insurers have similar 
teams in place.

How the Board engages with 
our partners and suppliers 
Whilst not having direct engagement with 
partners and suppliers, the Board receives 
updates from management on: 

•  All proportional risk-sharing 

agreements, including co-insurance 
and reinsurance contracts

•  Relationships with key partners and 
procurement, including Admiral’s 
payment policies and practices

•  Matters relating to partnerships 

and opportunities

•  Customer-facing suppliers 

•  Third-party risk management 
regulatory, technological and 
consumer trends

•  Modern slavery risks in the supply chain.

Principal decisions
SECR and TCFD disclosures

The Board takes all updates into account 
when considering the long-term 
consequences of its strategies and 
business plan. The CFO provides updates 
on the activities related to the renewal 
of the Group’s co-insurance, reinsurance 
and quota share contracts, including 
maintaining Admiral’s ongoing strategic 
relationship with Munich Re.

Outcomes and impact of  
Board decision-making 
The Board received updates on the 
performance of our business partners 
and suppliers through reporting from 
management and the risk function, it also 
reviewed supplier payment metrics in line 
with the Prompt Payment Code of which 
Admiral is a signatory. The Board had 
oversight of the monitoring of Modern 
Slavery provisions with key suppliers. 
The Board also oversaw training rolled out 
for relevant employees on conduct with 
suppliers/partners including anti-bribery 
and corruption and modern slavery.

The Board approved Admiral’s Modern 
Slavery Statement for 2023 which sets 
out the business’ zero tolerance approach 
to modern slavery in all its forms. This is 
enacted through our policies, training 
and risk management – for more details 
around how we do this, our Modern 
Slavery Statement is set out in full on 
our website.

employee can raise their concerns without fear of victimisation, subsequent discrimination, 
disadvantage, or dismissal. This policy details internal and external reporting lines for any 
employee concerns. 
Our Financial Crime policy ensures that robust systems and controls are in place to detect, 
prevent and deter financial crime across the Group and ensures we remain compliant with 
applicable laws and regulations in our operational jurisdictions. All areas of financial crime 
are captured by this policy, including money laundering, market abuse and insider trading, 
sanctions regime, modern slavery, tax evasion and bribery and corruption.
Our Anti-Bribery policy strictly prohibits the solicitation or acceptance of any bribe, to or from 
any person or company, by an individual employee, Board member, agent or other person or 
body on Admiral’s behalf, in order to gain any commercial, contractual, or regulatory advantage 
for Admiral in an unethical way or to gain any personal advantage for the individual or anyone 
connected with the individual.
Our Gifts and Gratuities policy recognises that sometimes customers, suppliers or business 
associates offer gifts or gratuities to staff and confirms that all such gifts must be made and 
received openly and fairly, must not include cash, must be reported and be in line with the policy.
Our Tax Strategy policy documents our approach to taxation. The policy confirms that the 
Group’s primary objective is to be compliant with all tax legislation requirements in all the

Principal Risks and Uncertainties

99

The Board, with support from 
the Group Risk Committee 
and the Group Risk Function, 
undertakes a regular and 
robust assessment of the 
principal and emerging 
risks facing the Group 
alongside engaging with the 
management team on the 
Group Strategy. These risks 
have been summarised as 
those which would threaten 
its business model, future 
performance, solvency or 
liquidity, and reputation.

Identification of risks

Principal risks (A–L)
Insurance Risk:
A    Reserving risk 

B   Premium risk and catastrophe risk

C    Reduced availability of co-insurance 
and reinsurance arrangements

D    Potential diminution of 

other revenue

The table below sets out the principal 
risks and uncertainties (PR&U) which 
Admiral has identified through its 
Enterprise Risk Management Framework 
(ERMF). The impact of those risks, 
development of the risks during 2023, 
and actions taken to mitigate them 
are explained below. This section also 
includes a description of Admiral’s 
approach to identify, manage, and govern 
emerging risks.

Risk appetite: The Admiral Group 
risk strategy contains strategic risk 
statements for the relevant risks which 
help deliver the Group’s business 
objectives. The Group risk appetite is 
owned and approved by the Admiral 
Group Board. The responsibility for the 
Group risk appetite is delegated to the 
Group Risk Committee which reviews all 
components prior to Board approval and 
monitors the performance of the business 
against the approved Group risk appetite 
through the consolidated risk report and 
other risk reporting. 

Group Risk:
E    Erosion of competitive advantage 

in UK Car insurance

F    Failure of geographic and/or 

product expansion

G    Reliance on price comparison

Non-Financial Risk:
J    Legal and regulatory risk

K    Operational risk

L    Reputation risk

Principal risks and uncertainties reflect 
the main risks faced by the Company 
in achieving its strategic objectives. 
The strategic objectives have been 
listed with the links to the strategy 
noted against each principal risk and 
uncertainty (for more information on 
the strategy refer to page 22). 

Strategic objectives:
1     Admiral 2.0: Continuing to build on historical strengths whilst becoming 
even more agile, digital and technology-focused. Admiral 2.0 puts the 
customer first and leverages data and advanced analytics to constantly 
be more efficient to improve their overall experience

2    Diversification: Building a sustainable and resilient business. 

Admiral’s approach is to leverage the capabilities and knowledge from 
the established businesses to build future successful propositions

3     Motor Evolution: Evolving the proposition for changes in mobility.

Insurance Risk

A Reserving risk

Possible impact 
on the strategic 
initiatives
1   2

Risk
Admiral is exposed to reserving risk through its underwriting 
of Motor, Household and other insurance policies. 
Claims reserves in the financial statements may prove 
inadequate to cover the ultimate cost of claims which are by 
nature uncertain. 

This is a particular risk for motor insurance liabilities, where 
the estimated amount payable for bodily injury claims 
(particularly large claims) can change significantly during 
lifetime of the claim as a result of various factors including 
external risks such as changes in Ogden rates (expected in 
2024), impacts of increased levels of Periodical Payment 
Orders (PPOs) and claims inflation. 

During this period, increased uncertainty in forecasting both 
the level and duration of the impact of higher inflation rates 
on claims reserves may lead to adverse development and 
higher claims costs than projected. 

PPO claims are capital intensive owing to increased 
uncertainty of the cost of these claims over a longer term. 
There is therefore a risk of higher claims costs and loss ratios, 
resulting in reduced profits or underwriting losses. 

Risk development in 2023
The risk has reduced during the year as the uncertainty 
caused by the inflationary environment has fallen, in 
particular during the second half of the year, and more 
favourable expectations with respect to the future Ogden 
rate have emerged.

Mitigating factors
The Group continues to reserve conservatively, setting 
its IFRS 17 risk adjustment in the financial statements 
between the 85th and 95th percentiles which is aligned 
to Group risk appetite. 

Best estimate reserves are estimated both internally 
and externally by independent actuaries.

For very large claims Admiral purchases excess of loss 
reinsurance, which mitigates a portion of the loss. 

Regular reviews of both settled and potential PPO cases 
are undertaken by the Claims and Actuarial teams, with 
independent actuarial analysis provided as part of the 
external reserving process. 

Admiral’s investment strategy is the result of a structured, 
disciplined and transparent investment process. Long-
dated inflation linked assets are held to partly hedge the 
risks associated with PPO claims.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
continued

Insurance Risk continued

B Premium risk and catastrophe risk

Possible impact 
on the strategic 
initiatives
1   2   3

Risk
The Group is exposed to the risk that inappropriate 
premiums are charged for its insurance products leading 
to either insufficient premiums to cover claims costs or 
uncompetitive rates leading to reduced business volumes. 
This risk is increased during periods of high inflation 
leading to greater market uncertainty. 

The risk of increased claims costs and/or reduced 
business volumes could be driven by potential economic, 
social, environmental, regulatory or political change 
such as the slowdown in China or the Russia-Ukraine and 
Israel-Hamas conflicts, impacting supply chains and inflation, 
or new entrants to the market.

Admiral is exposed to the risk of higher losses 
than anticipated due to the occurrence of 
manmade catastrophes or natural weather events, 
potentially increased in frequency and severity due 
to climate change. 

Acute physical climate risks include changes in the 
frequency of both large catastrophe events and severe 
weather events, where trends are difficult to identify, 
and which have large claims costs associated with them. 

Impact
Higher claims costs, reduced business volumes and/
or higher loss ratios, resulting in reduced profits or 
underwriting losses. 

A large flood or windstorm, causing extensive property 
damage (both Motor and Household) to a significant 
proportion of the portfolio, could lead to a larger than 
anticipated total claims cost. 

Risk development in 2023
The risk has trended broadly stable in 2023 as Admiral has 
continued to manage the challenging external environment 
with a disciplined, long-term approach to pricing and 
growth, with a focus on building the business for the long 
term. The risk remains subject to increased volatility in 
weather patterns, as demonstrated by the ten named 
UK storms experienced between September 2023 and 
January 2024.

Mitigating factors
There are a number of aspects which contribute to 
Admiral’s strong UK underwriting results, including: 

•  Experienced and focused senior management and 
teams in key business areas including pricing and 
claims management. 

•  Highly data-driven and analytical approach 
to the regular monitoring of claims and 
underwriting performance.

•  Capability to identify and resolve underperformance 
promptly through rapid and dynamic changes to key 
performance drivers, particularly pricing. 

•  Continuous appraisal of and investment in employees, 

systems and processes. 

•  Monitoring the impact arising from climate change 
risks, covering both physical and transitional risks, 
as well as other Emerging Risks which may impact 
premium or catastrophe drivers. 

Admiral purchases excess of loss reinsurance, which is 
designed to mitigate the impact of very large individual 
or catastrophe event claims. 

101

Insurance Risk continued

C Reduced availability of co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements

Mitigating factors
Admiral mitigates the risk to its reinsurance arrangements 
by ensuring that it has a diverse range of financially secure 
partners, and that contract maturities are staggered to 
prevent a cliff-edge ending of a large reinsurance cover.

Admiral continues to enjoy a long-term relationship with 
several different co- and reinsurers, some of which are 
amongst the world’s largest. 

Quota share and co-insurance arrangements are contracted 
over a number of underwriting years. These long-term 
arrangements are in place throughout the UK and 
international businesses. 

Possible impact 
on the strategic 
initiatives
1   2   3

Risk
Admiral uses proportional co-insurance and reinsurance 
across its insurance businesses to optimise the use of 
capital, to increase the return on the capital it does hold, 
and to mitigate the cost and risk of establishing new 
operations. There is a risk that co- and/or reinsurance 
cover will not be available or that it will be available at 
an uneconomical price in the future if the results and/
or prospects of either the UK businesses or other less-
established operations are not satisfactory to the co- 
and/or reinsurers. 

Inflationary uncertainty and other factors could result 
in a change in reinsurer appetite and an increased cost 
of reinsurance protection for insurers. Climate change 
and the increased frequency and severity of extreme 
weather events, as well as increased chronic physical 
risks, could adversely impact the availability and cost 
of reinsurance protection for insurers. 

Impact
A potential need to raise additional capital to support 
an increased underwriting share. Return on capital 
might reduce compared to current levels. 

Unavailability of co- and/or reinsurance or at an 
uneconomical price may mean that Admiral does not 
co- and/or reinsure all the desired risks, leading to 
increased costs should an adverse event arise.

Risk development in 2023
The risk has increased during the year with reduced 
appetite of reinsurers in some areas leading to a 
hardening market. The recent January UK motor 
reinsurance renewal was positive, however, but pressure 
is likely to remain on other product lines in 2024.

D Potential diminution of other revenue

Possible impact 
on the strategic 
initiatives
1   2   3

Risk
Admiral earns other revenue from a portfolio of products 
and services in addition to the core insurance products. 
The level of this revenue could diminish due to political, 
regulatory, legal, social/customer behaviour, strategic, 
market or economic changes. 

Impact
Lower profits from business operations and lower return 
on capital. 

Risk development in 2023
The risk has trended broadly stable and within appetite 
for the year. The risk has the potential to increase going 
into 2024 due to a heightening market-wide regulatory 
focus on ancillary and premium finance products.

Mitigating factors
Admiral continuously assesses the value to its customer 
of the products it offers and makes changes to ensure 
the products continue to meet customer needs and offer 
good value. 

Admiral seeks to minimise reliance on any single source 
by earning revenue from a range of products. This would 
mitigate the impact of regulatory or market changes, 
or changes in consumer behaviour, which might affect 
a particular product or income stream.

Admiral works closely with its regulators and other key 
industry bodies to understand potential developments.

Group Risk

Group Risk continued

E

Erosion of competitive advantage in UK Car insurance

G Reliance on price comparison distribution channel

Possible impact 
on the strategic 
initiatives
1   2   3

Risk
Admiral typically maintains a significant combined ratio 
advantage over the UK Car market. This advantage and/
or the level of underwriting profit (and associated profit 
commission) could be eroded by unfavourable loss or 
expense ratio results, irrational competitor pricing, new 
competitors or technologies used within the insurance 
market and/or regulatory intervention. 

Impact
A worse insurance result and lower return on 
capital employed. 

A sustained and uncorrected erosion of competitive 
advantage could affect the ability of Admiral to 
maintain its customer base, profitability and reinsurance 
arrangements, which might in turn require Admiral to 
hold more capital. 

Risk development in 2023
The risk has reduced during the year as Admiral’s 
competitiveness has increased despite making 
significant price increases. 

Mitigating factors
Admiral’s focus remains on the wide range of factors that 
contribute to Admiral’s combined ratio outperformance of 
the UK Car market. Some are set out earlier in the Strategic 
Report, but other factors include: 

•  A track record of innovation and ability to react quickly to 

market conditions and developments. 

•  A focus on maintaining a low-cost infrastructure, efficient 

acquisition costs, and strong expense controls.

•  An experienced and focused management team.

•  A robust and agile pricing discipline to ensure 

prudent behaviour to try and protect Admiral’s 
competitive advantage.

•  A strong Admiral brand and customer orientated culture 

to attract and retain customers. 

F

Failure of geographic and/or product expansion

Possible impact 
on the strategic 
initiatives
1   2   3

Risk
In line with the Group’s diversification strategy, Admiral 
continues to develop its UK insurance businesses, UK 
non-insurance businesses such as Admiral Money, and its 
international businesses. Admiral Pioneer is the vehicle 
for the development and launching of new products and 
services, other than those already covered by existing 
established Group businesses. 

Mitigating factors
Admiral’s approach to expansion and product development 
remains conservative, applying the test-and-learn philosophy 
that has proven successful for previous operations. 
International insurance businesses have generally executed 
cautious launch strategies and are usually backed by 
proportional reinsurance support which provides substantial 
mitigation against start-up losses in the early years. 

One or more of the operations could fail to become 
a sustainable, profitable long-term business, with the 
result that the businesses do not collectively deliver the 
profit diversification required. 

The Group has developed a capital allocation framework 
which seeks to allocate funding to those businesses most 
likely to add to the diversification of profits or contribute to 
the strategic objectives of the Group. 

The Directors are mindful of management stretch and any 
other key interdependencies that may strain the business, 
regularly assessing the suitability of the infrastructure 
in place for Admiral’s UK and international operations, 
alongside oversight and challenge from appropriate boards 
and committees. 

The Group has established a sufficiently large and diverse 
portfolio to mitigate the risk of failure of individual 
new operations.

Product expansion into new areas or expansion through 
M&A activity could lead to unprofitable business, could 
increase regulatory risk, and may introduce new risks  
into the Group. 

Growth in developing businesses could exceed the scale 
of infrastructure of the operation. 

Impact
Higher than planned losses and potentially closure costs, 
and distraction of key management. 

A collective failure of these businesses could threaten 
Admiral’s objective to diversify its earnings by expanding 
into new markets and products, though the failure of a 
single product or geography is expected to be tolerable. 

Risk development in 2023
The risk has reduced during the year, noting the strong 
results from Admiral Money and improved performances 
in most overseas markets. In addition, the acquisition 
of the UK direct Home and Pet personal lines insurance 
operations of RSA due in 2024 is expected to accelerate 
diversification going forward.

Possible impact 
on the strategic 
initiatives
1   2   3

Risk
Admiral utilises comparison websites as an important 
source of new business and growth. Growth in this 
distribution channel could slow, cease or reverse, or 
Admiral could lose one or more of the websites as a 
source of customers. 

Impact
A potentially material reduction in UK insurance new 
business volumes, in particular for UK Motor. 

Mitigating factors
Admiral contributes materially to the revenues of all four 
major UK comparison businesses, and has a strong brand 
presence, and therefore it is not considered probable that 
a material source of new business would be lost. 

Admiral continues to grow its MultiCover and MultiCar 
products which promotes retention. It also has a direct 
offering to new and existing customers, with continuing 
investment made to improve its online/digital offering. 

Less profitable new business or slower growth in Europe.

However, a more competitive market might benefit the 
insurance businesses through lower acquisition costs. 

Risk development in 2023
The risk has trended broadly stable during the year 
with no material movement in the share of new business 
coming from aggregators.

Admiral continually looks to improve its customer experience 
and business optimisation by sharing comparison distribution 
learnings throughout the Group, leveraging applicable 
experiences with brokers, and implementing additional 
controls to enhance selection and underwriting criteria.

Distribution channels other than price comparison are 
explored and used as and when deemed necessary. 

Credit Risk

H Credit risk

Possible impact 
on the strategic 
initiatives
1   2

Risk
Admiral is primarily exposed to institutional credit risk in 
the form of: (a) reinsurance counterparty credit risk; (b) 
banking counterparty credit risk and/or (c) the credit risk 
of the investment portfolios. 

One or more counterparties could suffer significant 
losses leading to a credit default and the loss of 
reinsurance cover or banking deposits, while a 
downgrade or default of investments could erode 
their value. 

In addition, Admiral Money’s loan portfolio exposes 
the Group to retail credit risk in relation to customer 
defaults on its unsecured personal loan and secured car 
finance business.

Impact
The impact of a major credit event could be realised 
losses and reduced capital, dependent on its nature 
and severity. 

Admiral would also need to ensure that it continues to 
have sufficient liquid assets to meet its claims and other 
liabilities as they fell due. 

Increased defaults could impact future profitably and 
lending capabilities. 

Risk development in 2023
The risk has trended broadly stable during the year 
with no material movement in the credit quality of 
significant counterparties.

Mitigating factors
Admiral monitors the credit quality of its reinsurance and 
banking counterparties within Board approved limits. 

The Group reinsurance policy is to contract with reinsurers 
that are rated ‘A-‘ or above (taking the highest rating from 
any applicable external rating agency such as S&P, AM Best  
or Fitch), though there are circumstances where a lower 
rating could be tolerated. In addition, major reinsurance 
contracts are operated on a funds withheld basis, which 
substantially reduces credit risk, as Admiral holds the cash 
received from policyholders as collateral.

The credit risk in Admiral’s investment portfolio is managed 
through diversification and appointing high-quality third-
party asset managers. Limits on counterparties and certain 
credit ratings ensure that credit risk is managed within 
risk appetite, and produces a high quality credit portfolio. 
The Group invests in a range of liquidity funds which hold 
a wide range of short duration, high quality securities, and 
in fixed income funds holding primarily investment grade 
assets. Cash balances and deposits are placed only with 
highly rated counterparties. Most long-term investments are 
held in Government bonds to further mitigate the exposure 
to credit risk. 

Admiral considers counterparty exposure frequently 
and in significant detail, and has in place appropriate 
triggers and limits to mitigate exposure to individual 
investment counterparties. 

Admiral Money’s credit risk appetite is set to ensure that 
the risk taken is commensurate to the expected returns 
whilst also considering customer affordability. Admiral Money 
continuously monitors its criteria for new business pricing 
and the performance of its portfolio.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
continued

Market Risk

I Market risk

Possible impact 
on the strategic 
initiatives

1

Risk
Market risk arises due to developments in economic 
and financial market conditions that result in 
movements in interest rates, credit spreads and foreign 
exchange rates, or regulatory/legislative changes to the 
basis of internal assumptions or methodologies. 

Impact
Market volatility (notably significant changes in risk free 
interest rates or material increases in credit spreads) 
can adversely impact the value of the Group’s assets. 
The Group’s solvency can also be adversely impacted 
due to an increased regulatory valuation of claims 
liabilities, in particular in relation to longer-dated 
potential PPO claims. 

Continued growth of the Group’s businesses outside the 
UK has altered the exposure to net assets and liabilities 
in currencies other than pounds sterling, increasing the 
Group’s exposure to Euros and Dollars in particular. 

Risk development in 2023
The risk has trended broadly stable over the course 
of the year, despite the market volatility seen early 
on, following the collapse of SVB and the takeover of 
Credit Suisse. As observed with these banking failures 
and increased geopolitical instability, event risk remains 
heightened, however.

Mitigating factors
A dedicated Investment Committee, a Group Management 
Committee, advises each Subsidiary Board and oversees 
the investment management of funds as well as advising 
on effective treasury and foreign currency exposure 
management of the Group and each entity’s non-
invested funds.

The Group policy relating to the managing of cash and 
invested assets supports the Group’s compliance with the 
Solvency II Prudent Person Principle and PRA expectations.

The investment strategy focuses on preservation of 
the amount invested, low volatility of returns, matching 
duration and currency of liabilities, and strong liquidity. 
The majority of the portfolio is invested in high quality fixed 
income and other debt securities, and money market funds 
and other similar funds in order to achieve these objectives. 

The Group’s mitigation for interest rate risk resulting from 
long duration PPO liabilities includes reinsurance cover and 
a continuing focus on appropriate investment strategies, 
such as asset/liability matching, hedging options for 
these liabilities, including of certain risks associated with 
PPO claims. 

105

Mitigating factors
Ongoing line one, two and three monitoring of the Group’s 
compliance with current and proposed requirements. 

Interaction with regulators and consultation with internal 
and external subject matter experts by Executive 
Management and the Board. 

Assurance gained through external reviews and 
benchmarking exercises ensuring compliance with legal and 
regulatory requirements. 

Strong change governance is a key control in managing 
regulatory change. 

Non-Financial Risk

J

Legal and regulatory risk

Possible impact 
on the strategic 
initiatives
1   2   3

Risk
As Admiral operates globally, across various business lines 
and products, it is exposed to differing political regimes, 
legal jurisdictions, regulatory expectations and tax systems.

Legal and regulatory risk may arise where Admiral fails 
to identify, interpret, or fully comply with legal, tax 
and/or regulatory requirements, in a timely manner. 
Current examples include interpretation and compliance 
with General Insurance Pricing Practices, the FCA’s 
Consumer Duty regulations, updates to the Corporate 
Governance Code by the Financial Reporting Council, 
mandatory climate-related financial disclosures, and the 
EU Whistleblowing Directive. This risk may also arise where 
previous industry, tax, regulatory and/or legal compliance 
standards are revisited with negative consequences and 
applied retrospectively, for the industry and/or the Group. 

Failing to meet increasing expectations from regulators, 
legislators, and shareholders around climate change and 
broader environmental, social and governance matters 
could potentially lead to exposure to legal and regulatory 
risk and potentially adversely impact other stakeholders’ 
perceptions.

A legal and regulatory risk could arise through incorrect 
or delayed regulatory reporting.

Impact
Exposure to regulatory intervention, censure and/or 
enforcement action through fines and other sanctions. 

Potential criminal and/or civil enforcement action. 

Possible customer detriment, as well as negative 
reputational and brand impacts.

Risk development in 2023
The risk has increased during the year due to the 
heightened regulatory environment, for example via the 
implementation of the FCA Consumer Duty regulation.

K Operational risk

Possible impact 
on the strategic 
initiatives
1   2   3

Risk
Operational risk arises within all areas of the business. 
The principal categories of operational risk for Admiral 
are conduct risk, change risk, people risk, technology 
risk, business continuity and operational resilience, data 
governance risk, information security/cyber risk, process 
risk, and outsourcing and procurement risk. 

Impact
The following are a limited number of examples of the 
potential impacts of operational risks:

Customer detriment, customer dissatisfaction, regulatory 
censure/enforcement, and/or reputational damage as 
a result of Admiral’s action or inaction. 

Being unable to service customers with the level of 
distinction associated with the Admiral brand.

Mitigating factors
Admiral operates a three lines of defence model, and 
internal controls are in place and are monitored to mitigate 
risks. The control framework is regularly reviewed, and the 
Internal Audit function has an agreed cycle of testing of 
the adequacy and effectiveness of controls. The following 
are a limited number of examples of how operational risks 
are mitigated:

•  Conduct: Monitoring, managing and reporting on 

customer outcomes, including the ongoing enhancement 
of Admiral Group Customer Outcomes MI; robust project 
governance around legislative and regulatory change 
such as Consumer Duty implementation and monitoring; 
attracting, retaining and motivating quality employees 
to deliver superior customer service and to achieve 
business objectives.

•  Change: Employing change governance and oversight at 
a Group and Entity level; with external specialist support, 
review and assurance utilised where required.

Impact continued
The move to a hybrid working world poses risks to 
the culture that has underpinned Admiral’s historical 
successes, both by increasing labour mobility and 
reducing the office-based activity that has been a 
cornerstone of Admiral’s historic ways of working.

Making poor business decisions due to lack of system 
availability and data integrity and/or data confidentiality. 

Cyber events leading to loss of service, loss of data and 
potential ransom demands. 

Reductions in earnings and/or value, through financial 
or reputational loss, from inadequate or failed internal/
outsourced projects, processes and systems, or from 
people related, hybrid working or external events. 

Risk development in 2023
The risk has reduced during the year as hybrid working 
has been further embedded and large change projects 
have been navigated successfully. 

Mitigating factors continued
•  People: Employing targeted recruitment and identifying 
potential leaders through internal development, talent 
management and retention processes for the purposes 
of succession planning; an ongoing commitment to 
diversity and inclusion.

•  Culture: Admiral has embraced more flexible ways of 
working to hire, motivate and retain employees and is 
evolving hybrid working practices in ways that support 
and maintain the unique culture.

•  Technology: Continuous investment in the Group’s 
IT infrastructure, coupled with regular Executive 
Management and Board review of effectiveness given 
the strategic importance of technology in improving 
the customer journey and enhancing business 
decision making. 

•  Information security/cyber: Ongoing enhancement 
of the control environment to protect the Group from 
the continuously evolving cyber threat landscape. 
Significant investment continues to be made in ensuring 
that people, processes, and technologies are resilient 
to the wide-ranging tactics, techniques and procedures 
employed by threat actors. Focus is also given to ensuring 
there are robust mitigation plans in place to effectively 
handle any incident, with simulations completed to 
ensure prompt and effective response, containment, 
and recovery.

•  Business continuity and operational resilience: Staffing 
a Line-1 major incident team within IT which is tasked 
with maintaining system availability; business continuity 
and disaster recovery plans are in place and are regularly 
tested, alongside completion of an operational resilience 
work stream; data is regularly backed-up to allow for its 
recovery in the event of corruption.

•  Data Governance: The Group is enhancing and further 

embedding its approach to data ownership, the ongoing 
review of data quality including responding to issues 
when they are identified, as well as having a consistent 
approach to the recording of data definitions and lineage 
so that the data is better understood.

•  Process: Admiral’s internal control framework is regularly 

monitored and reviewed within the three lines of 
defence model. 

•  Outsourcing and Procurement: Strategic reviews 

are periodically undertaken to align procurement and 
outsourcing arrangements with the wider business 
strategy and also in response to ongoing macroeconomic 
challenges; monitoring outsourced activities through 
ongoing supplier relationship and performance 
management and regular due diligence reviews. 

Admiral also purchases a range of insurance covers to 
mitigate the impact of a number of operational risks; 
including Cyber Liability insurance subject to market 
capacity, Civil Liability insurance, and Employers’ 
Liability insurance.

Risk
Admiral could be exposed to an erosion in trust as a result 
of decisions, associations, actions or inactions, such that 
Admiral does not meet stakeholder expectations. 

A negative reputation could have a significant impact 
on customer trust, the share price and brand value, 
which can be difficult to recover from. 

Reputational risk can be a secondary impact caused 
by failures in any part of the Group such as operational 
events. However it can also be a primary risk should the 
firm’s perceived behaviours or communications not meet 
stakeholder expectations. In either case, a reputation 
event could impact Admiral’s standing with customers, 
regulators, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders 
and could reduce profitability and investor support. 

Impact
The impact can be wide ranging and reputational risk can 
impact customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers, 
regulatory bodies and/or the community and media.

Depending on the type of reputational risk event, the 
impact could include reduced sales, reduced profitability, 
a decline in share price, difficulty in recruiting and 
retaining talent, and increased regulatory focus. 

Risk development in 2023
The risk has trended broadly stable during the year with 
no notable issues having a discernible impact. 

Mitigating factors
Admiral has in place risk appetite statements that set out 
the level of risk the Group is willing to accept for each key 
risk, and the Group monitors associated metrics that inform 
reputational risk analysis for different stakeholder groups. 
This analysis includes social media metrics, staff surveys, 
and investor relation reports.

The Executive Management team is experienced, and 
reputational impact is considered across key decisions and 
major external events.

Given the breadth of events that could impact on Admiral’s 
reputation, a number of the mitigating factors captured 
in the other principal risks and uncertainties would also 
mitigate reputational risk. 

Admiral has a crisis response and communications plan that 
seeks to minimise the reputational and other impacts of an 
event once it has materialised. 

Emerging Risks
The management of emerging risks is 
a key element of Admiral’s strategic risk 
management, and emerging risks and 
opportunities continued to be reviewed 
throughout 2023. 

Admiral Group identifies and monitors 
emerging risks, issues which may be 
potentially significant, but may not be 
fully foreseen, assessed or allowed for in 
insurance terms and conditions, pricing, 
reserving or capital setting, or strategic 
and business decisions. By their very 
nature, emerging risks are many and 
varied, with a high degree of uncertainty 
around the likelihood of occurrence, 
severity and/or timing. The broad analysis 
of a wide range of emerging risks and 
opportunities may lead to a change in 
strategy, management behaviour, ways 
of working or risk management and 
in turn, to a stronger and more robust 
business which better delivers on its 
commitments to customers, employees, 
and other stakeholders.

Emerging risks are identified via horizon 
scanning. This involves an extensive 
literature review, consultations with 
internal working groups, and interviews 
with internal stakeholders, subject 
matter experts, and external specialists. 
Emerging risks are assessed using an 
internally-developed framework, which 
includes qualitative and quantitative 
analysis to grade each emerging risk 
on a scale designed to be comparable 
across entities and compatible with 
management of operationalised risks. 
Evaluation of the potential impact to 
Admiral includes consideration of how 
the risk may interact with existing 
principal risks and uncertainties (PR&Us), 
as well as any new risks that could 
arise. It also covers the precautionary 
deployment of management actions and 
mitigating controls.

Admiral’s Emerging Risk Radar captures 
an assessment of potential impact and 
time to crystallisation for emerging risks. 
It categorises each risk into four broad risk 
segments: (a) social, political & economic, 
(b) legal & regulatory, (c) technology and 
(d) environmental. Plotting emerging risks 
in this way can shed light on the macro 
trends with common drivers and effects. 

Reporting on emerging risks and 
opportunities is provided to the GRC and 
relevant Boards, is incorporated into the 
Group ORSA Report, and is discussed 
with the senior management and entity 
risk teams.

Reflecting
ON INTERNAL 
MOBILITY AT ADMIRAL 

Hola! I’ve been in the Admiral 
Group for 12 years and spent the 
last 8 of those years as CEO of 
our Spanish insurance business – 
Admiral Seguros. 

As CEO of Admiral Seguros, I oversee a 
fantastic team of people, based mostly 
in Seville. We serve our 440k Spanish 
customers through the Qualitas Auto, 
Qualitas Classic and Balumba brands. 

I originally joined Admiral as a Business 
Development Manager, reporting into 
Henry Engelhardt. Previous to Admiral 
I had been a senior manager in PwC 
Madrid, also completing an MBA at 
INSEAD. In my first day on the job Henry 
asked me if I would mind delaying my 
training and flying to the US, to support 
a team investigating what would later 
become Compare.com. Thus started an 
intense but fun-packed three years during 
which I worked closely with both Henry 
and David Stevens, running group projects 
and launching the UK telematics product. 

In 2014 I had the chance to move to Paris 
and support the in-sourcing of our French 
operation, L´olivier. From there I moved to 
Seville and transitioned into leadership 
of the Admiral Seguros team at the time 
Cristina Nestares moved to the UK. 

What struck me about Admiral when I 
first joined was its open culture, combined 
with a strong willingness to do things 
differently and to trust in people as a 
driver of results. I’m pleased to say that 12 
years on, the Admiral culture is still very 
much prevalent across the Group. 

It’s been great to reflect during 2023 on 
everything the Group has achieved in the 
last 30 years. I look forward to continuing 
to build together on this success.

Viability Statement

In accordance with 
provision 31 of the 2018 
UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have 
assessed the prospects of the 
Company over a three-year 
period, having referenced 
the Group’s Own Risk and 
Solvency Assessment (ORSA), 
the Capital Plan, risk strategy, 
risk appetite, principal risks 
and uncertainties, key risk 
drivers, and ongoing risk 
management activities. 

As per provision 31, Admiral considers 
three years to be a period of assessment 
over which it has a reasonable degree of 
confidence. Although the Group reviews 
financial projections that extend beyond 
the three-year time horizon covering the 
years up to 2028, Admiral considers that 
there is an inherent risk and uncertainty 
in projecting beyond this three-year 
period, as the degree of certainty in 
the impact of internal and external 
developments reduces greatly due to 
the nature of Admiral’s primary business 
(one-year insurance policies). However, 
these financial projections contain no 
information which would cause different 
conclusions to be reached over the long-
term viability of the Group.

At least annually, the Group produces an 
ORSA report, which is one of the sources 
of evidence used by the Board to assess 
viability. The ORSA report sets out a 
detailed consideration of the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group 
and considers current and projected levels 
of solvency and liquidity over the short to 
medium term.

In addition to the ORSA, the Board utilises 
other relevant reporting, some of which 
is longer term in nature. Notably these 
include five-year financial projections 
reviewed twice a year, three-year solvency 
projections reviewed at least twice a year, 
and a one-year financial budget for the 
forthcoming 12 months approved on an 
annual basis.

Another source of evidence is the 
alignment of the financial and business 
planning process and the solvency 
assessment, referred to within Admiral 
as the capital plan. This makes sure that 
Admiral is appropriately capitalised at 
a fixed point in time as well as over the 
future planning time horizon, given 
Admiral’s principal risks and uncertainties 
and a plausible range of potential stressed 
conditions. The capital plan is a key 
consideration for Group and Subsidiary 
Boards in assessing and approving the 
business strategy, business/financial 
plan, capacity to pay dividends, and 
key business decisions.

The quantitative assessment considers 
how the regulatory capital requirements, 
economic capital needs, own funds 
and solvency position of the Group are 
projected to change over the three-year 
horizon, with a requirement to maintain 
a solvency ratio above the approved 
capital risk appetite buffer throughout 
the projection. 

As part of the ORSA process, a series 
of sensitivity, stress and scenario tests 
(S&STs) and reverse stress tests (RSTs) 
are examined and quantified based 
on the regulatory capital basis (which 
is the standard formula method with 
adjustments tailored to reflect Admiral’s 
risk profile) to understand the potential 
impact on the Group’s solvency, liquidity 
and profitability over a three-year period. 
In addition to these Group tests, there are 
also entity-specific scenarios, considered 
of lower materiality to the Group, that are 
performed by each subsidiary insurance 
entity as part of their ORSA processes. 

The results of the stress tests form part 
of the process to set the Group’s capital 
risk appetite, which seeks to hold a buffer 
on top of the Group’s regulatory capital 
requirement that is sufficient to protect 
its regulatory capital position against a 
range of significant but plausible potential 
shocks and stresses.

Key strategic decisions, including the 
setting of dividend payments, consider 
the solvency impact against the Board-
approved capital risk appetite of 150%, 
which is a key criterion for the Board in 
assessing viability. Refer to the Strategic 
Report (page 54) for information on 
sensitivities to the reported 2023 solvency 
ratio position.

To assess the robustness of the Group 
to the impact of various risks, 13 S&STs 
and two RSTs have been quantified to 
understand the potential impact on the 
Group’s solvency ratio. In 2023 a range of 
scenarios have been performed, capturing 
insurance risk, market/credit risk, strategic 
risk, natural catastrophe, climate change 
and cyber/operational risk.

The results provide comfort that Admiral 
has sufficient capital to withstand the 
extreme scenarios. Whilst the 150% lower 
trigger is breached in five instances – 
three severe inflation-based scenarios, a 
US banking crisis scenario and a liquidity 
stress, should such scenarios actually 
occur there are a number of management 
actions, including adjustments to 
shareholder dividends, that would be 
called on to alleviate capital pressures and 
improve the solvency ratio to bring it back 
above the 150% buffer. Another exception 
is an extreme RST, combining severe 
and extreme insurance and market 
risk scenario combinations with credit 
and liquidity risk. In the absence of 
management actions, this would result 
in a breach of the 100% solvency ratio 
but, as is the intention of the RST, it is 
considered to be an extremely remote 
outcome, being well in excess of a  
1-in-200-year event. Overall, the Group 
is likely to remain adequately capitalised 
and liquid in future, given the results of 
the S&STs.

Viability Statement
continued

Risk management is an essential part of 
Admiral’s operations, and successful risk 
taking is key to the Group achieving its 
business objectives. Risk management 
is therefore a key consideration when 
setting the Group’s strategy, managing 
performance, and rewarding success. 
The current risks that are faced by the 
Group are captured in the Risk Universe, 
with the most notable risks captured 
in the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties (page 98)29. In addition to 
these principal risks and uncertainties, 
the Group also considers a range of 
emerging risks that could impact the 
Group to varying degrees in the future, 
but which are not yet fully understood, 
including those related to climate change 
(page 107). 

The Admiral Group Risk Strategy is 
considered and approved by the Board. 
The strategy is directly linked to the 
business plan and seeks to ensure that 
all risks are managed effectively to 
allow the Group to meet its strategic 
aims (page 22). Supporting this is the 
Admiral Group Risk Management Policy, 
which sets out Admiral’s approach to risk 
management, as well as the governance 
of risk management across the Group. 
This approach ensures that there is 
appropriate oversight of the Group’s risk 
profile, and that the Group remains within 
risk appetite in all its operations.

While each of Admiral’s principal risks 
and uncertainties could have potentially 
impacted the Group’s performance, 
during 2023 the following key risk drivers 
were seen to be of notable importance: 
changing economic outlook, geopolitical 
instability, technology, cyber and 
operational resilience, Consumer Duty, 
and climate change. 

Changing economic outlook: 
Admiral has reviewed and continues 
to monitor the Group’s solvency and 
liquidity positions in response to market 
volatility and wider economic uncertainty, 
considering factors such as sustained high 
inflation, banking uncertainties resulting 
from the collapse of regional US banks 
and the UBS rescue of Credit Suisse, 
the wider impact of continued supply 
chain disruption, high energy prices, 
high interest rates, and the pressures 
on individual Household finances which 
have led to a cost of living crisis in many 
countries. Some of the current trends 
in risks most impacted by the changing 
economic outlook are highlighted below:

Premium Risk and Catastrophe 
Risk: Global uncertainties, supply 
chain pressures and increasing vehicle 
repair and replacement costs have 
all contributed to claims inflation. 
While labour shortages have generally 
eased, wages have also grown quickly 
to keep up with inflation, impacting large 
bodily injury claims. In most insurance 
markets, motor claims frequency has 
increased but is still noticeably below 
pre-pandemic levels. Admiral continues 
to manage these challenges with a 
disciplined, long-term approach to 
pricing and growth, with a focus on 
building the business for the long term.

Credit Risk: Cost of living pressure has 
seen growing demand for the “essentials” 
insurance product and a modest increase 
in the number of loan customers 
falling into arrears. Controls are in place 
to identify and support vulnerable 
customers on a case-by-case basis. 
Within Admiral Money, the screening 
process has been adjusted to include 
stricter creditworthiness and affordability 
checks to ensure that customers are 
resilient to ongoing inflation. The loan 
portfolio is subject to regular stress tests 
and the risk adjusted returns achieved 
indicate a resilient portfolio.

Reserve Risk: The Group has a prudent 
approach to reserving, which helps to 
minimise the impact of inflation and helps 
build strong, resilient businesses for the 
long term. Provision has been made for 
the impact of inflation on unsettled bodily 
injury (BI) claims, for which cost of care is 
the primary driver, ensuring that reserves 
capture excess inflation for all large BI 
heads of damage exposed to inflation, 
but particularly for wage inflation over 
the average time it takes for BI claims to 
settle. This continues to be reviewed, with 
best-estimates of these impacts being 
reflected in the reserves recognised as at 
the balance sheet date.

Operational Risk: While 2023 has seen 
the relative normalisation of working 
conditions following the pandemic-era, 
the business has continued to review 
the impacts and level of operational 
risk in the context of a modern, hybrid 
workforce. Admiral received real living 
wage accreditation in the UK in July which 
helped to support colleagues through 
cost of living concerns.

Geopolitical instability: 
The escalation of geopolitical risk 
following the Russian invasion of Ukraine 
led to a review of potential exposure 
across the Group’s PR&Us. At that time, 
both market risk and insurance risk were 
flagged as key areas to monitor. 

Market Risk: The initial investment 
spread shock was of brief duration 
and there was very limited indirect 
exposure across the investment portfolio. 
Market risks are reviewed by the 
investments team and asset managers 
to ensure Admiral is adequately positioned 
in this rapidly changing environment.

Insurance Risk: The risk of reduced 
availability of co-insurance/reinsurance 
arrangements remains heightened due 
to tensions between Russia-Ukraine and 
an anticipated Ogden rate change in 2024, 
however monitoring is being undertaken 
to adequately react to any scenario. 

More recently, Admiral reviewed its 
exposure to geopolitical conflict in 
response to the outbreak of the 2023 
Israel-Hamas war. Initial analysis suggests 
there is no reason to believe Admiral will 
be materially impacted as a result of the 
conflict. The position is being monitored.

Strategic Report Approval
The Strategic Report is approved for issue 
by the Board of Directors, and signed on 
behalf of the Board:

Group Chief Executive Officer

Cyber and operational resilience: 
Admiral’s strategy to drive continuous 
delivery of good customer outcomes 
includes effective and safe usage of 
technology and data. In support of this 
the Group Risk function has specialist 
staff which: 

•  Complete oversight, challenge 

and escalation of Technology and 
Information Security risks through 
regular engagement with each of the 
businesses within the Admiral Group;

•  Monitor the risk position through 
setting and review of specific KRIs, 
with reporting and, where appropriate, 
escalation through to Committees;

•  Ensure that there is an embedded 
Group Cyber Crisis management 
plan which includes all necessary 
stakeholders to ensure the effective 
response to a cyber crisis; and

•  Work with the businesses to undertake 
deep-dive reviews of specific topics 
highlighted through threat intelligence 
and the key cyber risks facing 
the Group.

Consumer Duty:
The FCA’s Consumer Duty came into 
effect on 31 July 2023. The Duty 
introduces higher and clearer standards 
of consumer protection across financial 
services and requires firms to focus on 
customer outcomes. This aligns with 
the Group purpose and commitment to 
delivering good customer outcomes for 
all customers. Admiral has worked hard to 
review critical customer communications 
and interactions, products and services, 
and customer journeys to align with the 
requirements of the Consumer Duty. 
Admiral has also had close engagement 
with external third parties and the FCA 
throughout the year on the Consumer 
Duty implementation and requirements. 
There is an ongoing focus to ensure that 
the Consumer Duty is fully embedded 
within the business and Admiral 
continue to monitor this to ensure that 
good outcomes are being delivered 
to customers.

Climate change:
Admiral remains committed to 
recognising and understanding the 
risks and opportunities posed by 
climate change to the Group, as 
well as to mitigate its impact on the 
environment. Climate-related risks can 
impact on all of Admiral’s business lines, 
operations, investments, and reinsurance 
arrangements. Admiral Group recognises 
that while there are risks from delayed 
action, there are also opportunities from 
considering the challenges, including 
the potential to accelerate the Group’s 
transformation, to build resilience, and to 
gain competitive advantage in new and 
existing markets. 

As part of this work there is an ongoing 
Group focus on:

•  Ensuring full compliance with 

existing and emerging regulatory and 
disclosure requirements

•  Researching climate-change trends and 
assessing the risks and opportunities 
arising from climate change

•  Incorporating climate-related risks into 
business-as-usual risk management 
and financial planning, such as 
enhancing Admiral’s climate scenario 
testing capabilities, linking climate-
related targets and achievements 
against the directors’ remuneration, 
and better reflecting climate change 
considerations in projections from the 
Business Plan and

•  Continuing efforts to further reduce the 

Group’s carbon footprint.

Admiral Group’s strategy linked to climate 
change is discussed in more detail in the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures disclosure (page 73).

Based on the results of this analysis, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due, for the period up to and including 
December 2026.

Celebrating
ADMIRAL’S CUSTOMER 
CHAMPIONS

We love to celebrate when our 
colleagues go the extra mile for 
a customer, to ensure we recognise 
and reward exceptional service. 
Every month our UK CEO Cristina 
selects a customer champion, a 
colleague that has gone above and 
beyond for a customer. 

Nancy from our Canadian operation 
was awarded this title for her amazing 
service to a customer who had been in 
an accident. The customer was still on the 
roadside with a car that couldn’t be driven 
and feeling very shaken up. The initial 
contact with our customers is usually 
a brief call to get them and their car 
home safely. 

However, in this instance the customer 
had no one else to call for comfort so 
Nancy called the customer back after 
their initial call. She stayed on the line 
with the customer for 30 minutes 
supporting them until the recovery 
vehicle arrived.

We understand that customers can be 
in a state of anxiety or shock when they 
initially contact us, we accompany them 
on some of their worst days, which is why 
we always try to help make the process 
easier with a friendly voice at the end of 
the phone.

Building
A DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS 
WITHIN AN EFFECTIVE 
GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present Admiral’s Governance Report 
for the financial year ended 31 December 
2023, my first as Chair of the Board. 
Through the course of my first year,  
I have been impressed with the focus 
that Admiral places on ensuring that 
an effective governance framework 
complements its unique culture and 
that both are embedded throughout 
the Group. This report describes the 
framework in place to ensure our Board 
and its Committees are operating 
effectively by supporting and challenging 
management to maintain high standards 
of governance across the Group as we 
continue to drive long-term value for 
all our stakeholders. 

Board changes
2023 has been a year of considerable 
change for the Board of Admiral. I was 
honoured to take over the responsibility 
of Chair of the Board following Annette 
Court stepping down as Chair at the 2023 
Annual General Meeting. You can find a full 
description of my appointment process 
in last year’s Annual Report. Following the 
announcement of my appointment in 
January 2023, I went through a bespoke 
and comprehensive induction, details 
of this process are set out on page 151. 
Again, I would like to express my gratitude 
to Annette for her exemplary leadership 
of the Board. I can confirm that my fellow 
Board members and the wider Admiral 
Team are equally grateful for Annette’s 
dedication and thoughtful guidance. 

Jean Park retired from the Board and all 
her Admiral commitments with effect 
from 20 January 2023, having spent nine 
years on the Board. As I have previously 
mentioned, it was with great sadness 
we learnt that Jean had passed away 

change across the Group. Following his 
resignation from the Board, Keith chaired 
and served on a number of subsidiary 
boards until he retired as a director in 
2019. Keith then continued to undertake 
mentoring roles to many of the Admiral 
management team until shortly before 
his untimely death. Keith was universally 
liked, respected and admired by so 
many across South Wales and beyond 
and will be deeply missed by the whole 
Admiral community.

We were delighted to welcome Fiona 
Muldoon who joined the Board on 
2 October 2023. Fiona was appointed 
as a new independent Non-Executive 
Director and member of the Audit 
Committee. Fiona’s biography can be 
found on page 123. A description of the 
appointment process undertaken to find 
and recruit Fiona is set out on page 149. 

People and culture 
One of the most significant and enduring 
observations from my first year as Chair 
is the sheer quality of people we have 
at Admiral and the passion they show 
for the business, this is demonstrated 
every day in the work they do. There is a 
special culture embedded throughout 
the Group, which I believe is unique to 
Admiral. We build our culture through 
our purpose and our values, these are not 
just words on paper, they are lived daily 
by our teams and integrated through 
everything we do as a business. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank all our 
employees for the hard work, dedication 
and enthusiasm they have shown 
throughout the year. Our people and our 
culture are what sets us apart from other 
companies and are the reason why in 
2023, Admiral was acknowledged as the 
best large Company to work for in the UK, 
and our Chief Executive Officer, Milena 

“The Board is focused on 
delivering Admiral’s  
purpose and building its  
culture through a 
framework of good 
governance and established 
values which, in turn, 
will deliver long-term, 
sustainable returns  
to our shareholders.”

Mike Rogers
Group Chair

in May 2023. Whilst Jean left prior to 
my joining the Board, I am well aware 
of the invaluable contribution she made 
to Admiral and the Board throughout her 
nine years’ service, as well as the esteem 
within which she was held by her fellow 
Board Directors and our colleagues across 
the business. 

Sadly, we also learned that our former 
Board colleague Keith James passed 
away in May 2023 after a short illness. 
Keith joined the Board in 2002 and served 
until 2012 overseeing huge growth and

the best leader of a big Company at the 
Best Companies to work for awards, see 
more at www.b.co.uk. You can find out 
more about our culture and why Admiral is 
considered a great employer throughout 
this report.

ESG and sustainability
ESG and sustainability considerations form 
part of the narrative to every decision 
we take as a Board and are integral 
to the formation of our wider Group 
Strategy. During the year, the Board 
considered the effects of the cost of living 
situation and, amongst other financial 
and non-financial measures taken to 
keep employees healthy, motivated 
and productive, declared a 5% salary 
increase for all our UK based employees. 
Further information on this can be found 
on page 129.

With regards to diversity, I am pleased to 
report that the Admiral Board exceeds 
the FTSE Women Leaders Review targets, 
with a range of 45% to 55% female Board 
representation during the year. We have 
a female CEO and Senior Independent 
Director and have met The Parker Review 
target for Director ethnicity at Group 
Board level. Whilst this is positive, we 
cannot rest on our laurels, there is still 

much work we can do to ensure a fully 
inclusive environment sits alongside 
a diverse pipeline of talent to drive 
the business forwards. You can read 
more about our diversity and inclusion 
initiatives on pages 62 and 154. 

Climate change and the wider 
environment are important considerations 
we take into account as a Board. You can 
read about how Admiral has taken steps 
to meet its environmental obligations 
through its TCFD and SECR reporting 
disclosures set out on pages 71 and 73.

As Chair, I am conscious that the Board 
is accountable to all our shareholders 
and wider stakeholders such as our 
employees, customers, partners, 
suppliers, communities and the 
environment. We maintain an active 
dialogue with our shareholders and have 
regular interaction with all our wider 
stakeholders. How we do this is set out 
in our section 172 statement on page 87 
along with further details on page 136.

Effectiveness
The Board conducted an evaluation 
of its own performance and those of 
its committees in December 2023. 
In line with its three-year cycle, this 
review was conducted internally by 
the Company Secretary in conjunction 

with myself. The findings from the 
2023 evaluation along with an update 
on the progress made against those 
recommendations from the previous 
year’s external review process can be 
found on page 158. This process gives 
a clear focus on what we can do as a 
Board to improve during the forthcoming 
year, however it did confirm that the 
Board and its committees are working 
effectively in ensuring the business 
is managed for the long-term benefit 
of all our stakeholders. 

I would like to thank my fellow Board 
members for their insight and support 
during my first year as Chair. I look 
forward to our 2024 AGM, which will 
once again be held in person on 25 April 
2024. Further details will be published 
in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, 
which will be sent or made available to 
shareholders on the Company’s website.

Q&A with the Chair

117

How important is diversity 
and inclusion to the success 
of the business?
Embracing people from all areas of society 
and walks of life brings with it different 
experiences, skills and perspectives. This in 
turn delivers a stronger, more creative 
and capable workforce. Inclusive and 
diverse workplaces foster a keen sense 
of belonging and create an environment 
where employees feel their contributions 
are valued and respected, this enhances 
the culture of the Company. High quality 
candidates are attracted to diverse and 
inclusive companies and employees feel 
more comfortable and satisfied within 
inclusive environments, creating loyalty 
and reducing attrition. Equality is one of 
the four pillars of Admiral’s culture and 
I’ve been impressed with the seriousness 
and focus the Group gives to ensuring 
diversity and inclusion, from the Board 
through to all levels within the Company. 
We have many forums throughout 
Admiral which focus on all aspects of 
diversity and inclusion, this is key to 
enhancing our culture and ultimately the 
success of our business. The team is proud 
of its diverse working culture – it’s what 
makes us Admiral.

  See page 154 for further information

Why is stakeholder engagement 
important to Admiral? 
Stakeholder engagement is a key 
responsibility for the Board, we value 
all our stakeholders and through 
understanding their individual needs 
the Board is able to create a balanced 
and fair approach to their varying, 
sometimes conflicting, interests. 
Engagement through effective 
communication builds trust, credibility 
and confidence, and we take into account 
our various stakeholder views and 
opinions to build a shared vision for the 
future. Engagement also brings clarity 
and alignment as to what the business 
wants to achieve and consensus as to how 
it should do this. Our stakeholders have 
a huge wealth of relevant knowledge 
and experience which we are able to tap 
into to help Admiral be more impactful, 
sustainable and successful, whilst at the 
same time assist in mitigating potential 
risks, conflicts and resistance to change. 
The Board understands the importance 
of these relationships and Admiral has 
an in depth understanding of who our 
stakeholders are and how best to engage 
with them for the benefit of the Company 
in the long-term.

  See pages 56, 87 and 136 for  

further information

What does being a sustainable 
business mean to the Admiral Board?
As a Board we understand that having 
an understandable, transparent and 
sustainable approach to business has 
environmental, economic and social 
benefits, not just for our stakeholders but 
for society as a whole. We have a duty to 
promote sustainable working practices 
and, where possible, to mitigate the 
negative aspects of any impact we have 
on our environment. Everyone benefits 
from working in a more sustainable 
environment and by doing our best to 
reduce emissions and promote equality, 
as a couple of examples amongst 
many, we can do our small part to help 
secure and build a society for future 
generations. As a Board, we understand 
that the perception from our stakeholders 
around Admiral’s commitment to being 
a sustainable business has a bearing on 
our reputation, our customer loyalty, 
employee engagement and investment 
decisions. By continuing to integrate and 
embed sustainability and ESG practices 
throughout our business we are ensuring 
Admiral’s success and resilience over the 
longer-term.

Helping
PEOPLE LOOK AFTER 
THEIR FUTURE

We asked Mike Rogers 
to share some of his 
initial impressions and 
observations from his first 
year as Chair of Admiral.

How valuable did you find your 
induction process in preparing 
you for your role as Chair?
My induction process was incredibly 
helpful and insightful. One of my 
overwhelming impressions of Admiral is 
how knowledgeable and collaborative 
colleagues are across the UK and beyond. 
Admiral staff generally have a very long 
tenure and therefore the knowledge 
that they build up and are able to share 
is incredibly valuable. I believe that the 
way that Admiral colleagues collaborate 
so closely really adds to the overall 
competitive advantage that Admiral has 
been able to maintain for so many years. 
Meeting with management during my 
induction process has really reinforced 
this in my mind. On top of meeting 
management, I have also spent time 
listening to customer calls as well as 
spending time in a number of call centres 
with our front-line staff. Everyone I have 
met has been generous with their time 
and it is clear that people at Admiral love 
working here.

  See page 151 for further information

What does effective governance 
mean to you and how is this 
demonstrated at Admiral?
Throughout my career I have seen how 
embracing effective governance, initiated 
at the most senior levels of a Company 
and cascaded down through the business, 
builds a culture where integrity and 
values are put at the very heart of how 
that business operates. This in turn allows 
trust to be built through accountability 
and transparency, which encourages 
investment and the building of 
stakeholder relationships with confidence 
and mutual respect. At Admiral, I have 
seen this integrity demonstrated through 
a strong sense of purpose and values, led 
by an effective Board who understand 
and espouse the benefits that effective 
governance can have on building a positive 
workplace culture and, ultimately, on the 
performance of the business. Whilst this in 
itself cannot guarantee Admiral’s success, 
it certainly can create a strong base from 
which the Company is given the best 
opportunity to flourish.

  See page 113 for further information

What have been your initial 
impressions of Admiral’s culture 
during your first year? 
Before I joined as Chair, I was aware of 
Admiral’s reputation for its unique culture, 
this was a factor in guiding my decision 
to join the Company. Having spent my 
first year visiting all areas of the business 
and meeting a large cross-section of our 
colleagues, I can honestly say that I have 
not been disappointed. I believe I can sum 
up Admiral’s culture with the following 
words: engaging, innovative, collaborative, 
inclusive, focused, conscientious and 
fun. The Board and senior management 

team view our culture as the heart of 
what Admiral is, and what it stands for as 
a business. Admiral’s culture is key to why 
the Company has been so successful in 
growing over the past 30 years to where 
we are today and, for this reason, should be 
protected at all costs. Amongst the many 
awards received which reflect our culture, 
we were delighted to be named Best Large 
Company to work for in 2023 and our CEO, 
Milena, was awarded Best Leader of a Big 
Company at the Best Companies Awards.

  See page 132 for further information

How much consideration should 
the Board give to Admiral’s 
purpose and values during its 
decision-making process?
On joining the business, Admiral’s 
philosophy was explained to me in simple 
terms, we want to help people to look 
after their future, always striving for 
better together. This is our purpose, 
and in my relatively short time with the 
business I’ve been impressed in seeing 
how our colleagues embody this purpose 
every day through our values. With every 
discussion and decision we take as a 
Board, our purpose and values are at 
the forefront of our minds. Simply put, 
if the Board believes something does 
not measure up to the high bar we have 
set ourselves then it will be rejected. 
Our values are embraced through an open 
and inclusive workplace, where people can 
have fun, work hard, and be rewarded for 
their achievements. The Board and our 
senior management team lead from the 
front, truly believing that people who like 
what they do, do it better, and it is our 
customers and wider stakeholders who 
benefit as a result.

UK Corporate Governance Code
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
(‘the Code’) available at www.frc.org.uk, 
applied to Admiral throughout the year 
ended 31 December 2023. At the heart 
of the Code is a set of principles which 
emphasise the value that good corporate 
governance can have on the long-
term sustainable success of a business. 
By applying the principles, and following 
the more detailed provisions of the Code, 
the Board can demonstrate to Admiral’s 
stakeholders how the creation of an 
effective, transparent and accountable 
corporate governance framework, 
aligned to the purpose and values of the 
Company, assists the Board in building our 
special Admiral culture and delivering the 
business strategy within the relevant legal 
and regulatory landscapes in which the 
Group operates. 

Admiral is required to report to 
shareholders on how it has applied the 
principles and provisions of the Code 
during the year and, where we have not, 
the reasons for not doing so. The Board 
confirms that Admiral has complied 
with all of the provisions set out in the 
Code for the year ended 31 December 
2023, with the exception of Provision 19. 
This is explained in further detail below. 

Details on how Admiral has applied the 
principles set out in the Code and how 
governance operates throughout the 
Group have been summarised throughout 
this Governance section and elsewhere 
in this Annual Report and are set out in 
the table below.

Provision 19 of the Code states that 
‘The chair should not be in post beyond 
nine years from the date of their first 
appointment to the Board.’ Annette 
Court was appointed as Board Chair 
in April 2017, having spent five years as 
a Non-Executive Director of the Board. 
Annette reached her nine-year tenure 
as Non-Executive Director on the Board 
in March 2021. As reported in the 2021 
Annual Report, the Board considered and 
agreed, having consulted shareholders, 
that Annette should remain in post to 
facilitate an effective succession process 
for both CEO in 2021 and Chair in 2023. 
Mike Rogers was appointed Chair at 
Admiral’s AGM held on 27 April 2023, 
at which time Annette stood down from 
the Board.

Provision 19 of the Code states that ‘To facilitate effective succession planning and the development of a diverse board, this period can 
be extended for a limited time.’ Annette’s re-election was supported by shareholders at the 2022 AGM (99.3% votes in favour) and her 
2022 performance review, led by the Senior Independent Director, concluded that she continued to perform effectively as Board Chair, 
continued to exercise objective judgement and promoted constructive challenge amongst Board members. Following Annette stepping 
down and the appointment of Mike Rogers as the new Chair in April 2023, Admiral has been in full compliance with the Code.

Strategic
THINKING AT 
ADMIRAL

Whilst a significant proportion of 
the Board’s time is focused towards 
addressing the short to medium term 
business considerations required in 
managing a business such as Admiral, 
it is also important that the Board is 
allowed the opportunity to take a step 
back and assess the bigger picture, 
to promote discussion and strategic 
planning over the medium to long term 
in order to identify and address those 
significant opportunities and risks 
that may present themselves. As well 
as being part of every Board meeting, 
Admiral annually dedicates two full days 
to focus on its strategy. In 2023, the 
Board was taken to Admiral’s Swansea 
office for their annual strategy meeting, 
at this meeting the following items are 
examples of some of those issues the 
Board addressed.

•  Group-wide strategy and objectives

•  Admiral 2.0

•  Diversification strategy

•  Motor evolution strategy

•  UK insurance strategy

•  Organic versus inorganic growth

•  International business strategy

•  Five-year plan

•  Strategic opportunities

•  Organisational requirements.

Principal decision 1
Acquisitions 
and disposals
The strategic objectives the Board 
considers when evaluating potential 
acquisitions and disposals are:

1. To accelerate Admiral’s diversification 

strategy: to increase the pace of 
growth of non-motor products, such as 
Household, Pet and Travel in the UK

2. To build new capabilities: acquiring 
knowledge in fields where Admiral 
has not yet developed the 
required competencies

3. A path to scale: opportunities 

identified where Admiral is able to drive 
incremental value through pricing 
and claims expertise and driving 
cost efficiencies 

4. To divest from non-attractive markets: 
generating value from adjusting the 
portfolio to focus on markets where we 
see long-term growth potential.

In alignment with Admiral’s strategy of 
diversification of its product offering 
into insurance products beyond Motor, 
the Board was pleased to announce 
the acquisition of the More Than direct 
Home and Pet personal lines insurance 
business from RSA in December 2023. 
This transaction will see Admiral welcome 
c.300 new colleagues as well as the 
transfer of the renewal rights and the 
‘More Than’ brand.

The proposal to engage in the process to 
acquire the More Than business was first 
presented to the Board in September 
2023, and then on a number of occasions 
at milestone points throughout the 
process. Board deliberations focused on:

•  Strategic fit: The Board concurred with 

management that the acquisition 
represented a strong strategic fit and 
achieved the objective of diversification 
in the UK by accelerating the scale and 
market share of both Admiral’s Home 
and Pet products

•  Impact on core business: The Board 
considered the impact on the core/
existing business, particularly in terms 
of management time, and felt that 
this could be mitigated by a properly 
structured, funded and resourced 
integration team

•  Comparison of organic versus inorganic 

growth: An alternative approach 
of investing in organic growth was 
considered. The Board agreed that 
there was no alternative opportunity 
equivalent to the increase in scale for 
the Home and Pet businesses which 
would be achieved by this acquisition

•  Brand reach: The Board agreed to 
offer RSA customers an Admiral 
Home product and discontinue the 
More Than brand for home insurance. 
Admiral would continue to offer 
the More Than brand to RSA Pet 
customers at renewal and to sell new 
business under this brand, whilst also 
maintaining the Admiral brand.

A key consideration for the Board in 
respect of the More Than acquisition was 
the impact on all stakeholders in the short 
and the longer terms. This was factored 
into the Board’s evaluation and decision-
making process. In such situations, 
key stakeholders will be identified, for 
example, employees, customers and 
shareholders, and analysis is undertaken 
to understand any relevant issues specific 
to each stakeholder group. The Board will 
balance the often-conflicting interests 
of stakeholders whilst, at the same 
time, ensuring all receive equitable 
treatment. In the case of the More Than 
business, after in-depth analysis the 
Board agreed that this was a strategic 
fit with the existing Admiral business 
and its stakeholders, and approved the 
acquisition as being in the long-term best 
interests of the Admiral Group. 

During the year, Admiral said goodbye 
to our colleagues at Compare.com in 
the US, as the final step in our exit from 
the comparison market. The sale of 
Compare.com Insurance Agency LLC to 
Insurify, Inc., a US-based virtual insurance 
agent, was completed in March 2023 and 
demonstrated the Boards divestment 
strategy to focus on markets Admiral 
has identified as having the potential for 
longer term growth.

Relevant stakeholders considered

resulting in 743 free parking spaces. 
The Board also approved a free share 
award to employees to ensure a sense 
of shared ownership in the success of 
the business. As a result of these and 
multiple other initiatives overseen by 
the Board, attrition rates continued to 
see improvements, overall absenteeism 
continued to see small reductions 
and recruitment performed well with 
increases in application volumes and 
strong acceptance of offers. The Board 
was also pleased to see an increase in 
the hiring of internal candidates for 
senior positions. 

Employees were able to feedback 
to the Board through the Employee 
Consultation Group (ECG), where topics 
such as the cost of living, employee 
engagement and morale were discussed. 
Engagement scores across the Group 
remained strong, signposting areas for 
continued focus. Pleasing results were 
noted around inclusion, bolstered by 
external recognition and accreditation 
across several areas such as the 
government’s Disability Confident Leader 
and the gold Corporate Health Standard. 
The Board was delighted that the work 
carried out by the team during the year 
was recognised with Admiral achieving 
multiple awards for its workplace culture - 
see page 13.

Principal decision 2
Liquidity/ 
Refinancing of 
subordinated debt
In June 2023, Admiral Group successfully 
priced a GBP £250 million 10.5-year Tier 
2 bond issue, this was the second bond 
issue in its history. The bond issue was 
accompanied by a tender for Admiral’s 
existing £200 million 5.5% subordinated 
Tier 2 notes, due to mature in July 2024, 
which attracted participation in line 
with expectations.

The Board considered the Tier 2 bond 
issue to be an important part of the 
Company’s active management of its 
debt profile and capital base and took 
the opportunity to refinance, prudently 
well ahead of the maturity date in July 
2024. The proceeds of the new notes 
were to be used to fund general business 
and commercial activities of the Group 
and to allow the Group to refinance 
its existing notes well in advance of 
maturity. The success of the new bond 
issue, which was oversubscribed, and the 
refinancing demonstrated the strength of 
Admiral’s credit and investor confidence in 
the Group. 

The Board sought external advice as 
to the most opportune timing for the 
proposed new issue and tender given 
the maturity date of the existing Tier 2 
notes. The Board approved the refinance 
of the notes in June 2023 subject to 
favourable market conditions and pricing, 
given inflationary pressures and an 
uncertain global economic backdrop, in 
the best interests of the business and 
its stakeholders.

Principal decision 3
Employee 
welfare and the 
cost of living
Admiral takes great pride in looking 
after its colleagues by helping them to 
look after their future, this is especially 
important in challenging economic times. 
In 2023 the Board continued its focus 
on maintaining a workforce which was 
healthy, motivated and productive, whilst 
also ensuring that the required talent 
and skills were built on to equip Admiral 
for the future. During the year, the Board 
oversaw investment in multiple initiatives 
to build on pre-existing employee 
engagement, believing that employees 
who feel supported during uncertain 
times, were better equipped to deal 
with them. 

In H1 2023, conscious of the ongoing cost 
of living situation in the UK, the Board 
oversaw a one-off maximum salary uplift 
of 5% to all directly employed UK based 
colleagues. In addition, the timing of 
this increase was accelerated to ensure 
colleagues received benefit from the 
uplift for the majority of the year rather 
than awaiting the annual pay review 
date. Admiral also committed to paying 
the Real Living Wage for all of UK roles, 
to continue to support those impacted 
by the ongoing increased cost of living. 
This rate was paid from March 2023 and 
Admiral will be making the increase to 
£12, effective from 1 March 2024. This was 
approved at the EUI Board, the main UK 
trading business. 

In addition to multiple health, wellbeing, 
diversity and inclusion and career 
initiatives - see pages 62 and 132, 
examples of additional initiatives overseen 
by the Board to specifically assist 
employees with the cost of living have 
included a canteen subsidy of 50% for 
food and drink covering approximately 
2000 people a day and a car park subsidy

Board Leadership and Company Purpose
continued

Moving to Admiral 2.0 is a strategic 
priority for the Board. Board oversight 
around the introduction of new 
technology and the migration of systems 
to the cloud will assist the business 
in meeting this objective. The roll out 
of new technologies brings modern, 
capable platforms that allow Admiral to 
create great features and experiences 
for customers, a faster time to 
market, improved scalability, stability 
and resilience, whilst also assisting in 
addressing the increasing risks around 
the protection of customer data and 
cyber security. The Board received 
updates and presentations from the 
business in addition to oversight of 
project milestones and agreed targets. 
As a result of the changes made as part 
of this transformation journey, Admiral 
aims to become a much more digitally 
diverse business both to customers and 
employees and the changes will also help 
in meeting sustainability targets.

Principal decision 4
New technology 
New technology 
A strategic priority for the Board is to 
accelerate the evolution of Admiral’s 
core business and competencies toward 
‘Admiral 2.0’, leveraging the Group’s 
historical strengths whilst being even 
more agile and technology focused 
to ensure that it continues to put the 
customer first. To support the journey to 
Admiral 2.0 the Board is overseeing the 
building of next generation architecture, 
leveraging cloud, data, analytics and 
digital to continually improve the 
customer experience. 

Following the implementation of the 
Guidewire Claims Centre platform in 2022, 
this year the Guidewire Policy Centre and 
Billing Centre were migrated to the cloud 
and at the same time updated to the 
latest version. Policy Centre and Billing 
Centre has been used by Admiral in the 
UK since 2016 but the cloud deployment 
and updates to the latest version allows 
the business to benefit from new features, 
mitigate technology and security risk, 
further improve the speed of release by 
shifting to an ‘environments on-demand’ 
model, and reduce the overall total cost 
of ownership of the estate. There were 
also improvements in customer contact, 
supported by the scaled deployment 
across the business of a new cloud contact 
centre platform which allows Admiral 
to utilise new technologies to enhance 
the customer telephony experience. 
In addition to telephony, Admiral is also 
modernising the customers’ digital 
experience through a new web portal 
and mobile applications. Work has also 
commenced on the implementation of a 
new customer master database, which will 
provide a single customer view across the 
Admiral Group. 

The Board oversaw the implementation 
of the Consumer Duty regime through its 
relevant regulated subsidiary entities who 
fell under the scope of the new regime. 
Subsidiary board Non-Executive Directors 
were appointed as Consumer Duty 
“champions” in their respective businesses 
and implementation plans were approved. 
The FCA attended a Group Board 
meeting in April 2023 where constructive 
discussions were held around Consumer 
Duty implementation expectations, 
which were then fed back to the relevant 
subsidiary boards. The Group Board 
attained oversight and assurance through 
reports from the Group Risk Committee, 
Group Compliance Committee and 
Consumer Duty Steering Committee that 
appropriate implementation plans were in 
place to ensure the Group would meet its 
obligations which came into effect in July 
2023, and that monitoring processes were 
in place to ensure effective embedding 
within the business and the continued 
delivery of requirements to customers in 
line with the Group’s purpose and values. 

Internal model
The Board along with the Group Risk 
Committee continued its focus on the 
Admiral internal model during the year, 
receiving regular reporting to help drive 
key discussions and decisions in relation 
to the model. The Board oversaw the 
updating of the UK Car model in 2023 
to address limitations identified during 
prior independent validation reviews. 
This will help to ensure that the model 
is well placed to support a regulatory 
pre-application – see pages 33 and 169 for 
further information.

Regulatory 
decisions 
IFRS 17
IFRS 17, the new insurance contracts 
accounting standard, which establishes 
the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and 
disclosure of insurance contracts, 
including information about a Company’s 
financial position and enhanced 
disclosures in respect of claims reserves, 
was effective from 1 January 2023. 
The new standard applies to the Group 
and its insurance subsidiaries in the UK 
and Gibraltar.

During 2023, the Group Board continued 
to closely monitor the implementation 
of IFRS 17 and discuss and approve key 
information including accounting policy 
decisions, the impact on the transition 
balance sheet, 2022 comparatives, 
and projected future results, proposed 
revisions to key performance indicators.

In August 2023 the Board, in conjunction 
with the Audit Committee oversaw the 
successful conclusion of the IFRS 17 
implementation programme, delivering 
the first external reporting under IFRS 
17 as part of Admiral’s interim results. 
Given the significance of the changes in 
reporting, external stakeholders were 
provided with supplementary information 
within the presentation, and additional 
opportunities to discuss the results 
in order to clarify the impact of the 
reporting changes. 

Consumer Duty
The FCA’s Consumer Duty regime came 
into effect on 31 July 2023. The Duty 
introduced higher and clearer standards 
of consumer protection across financial 
services and required firms to focus 
on customer outcomes. This new 
requirement aligned with Admiral’s wider 
Group purpose and commitment to 
delivering good customer outcomes for 
all our customers.

Board Leadership and Company Purpose
continued

Culture
An important part of the Board’s role is 
to lead from the front in promoting and 
safeguarding Admiral’s unique culture. 
This is achieved through establishing 
purpose and values and is especially 
important in times where there may be 
significant challenges and changes to how 
the business operates.

The Code emphasises the importance of 
the role of the Board regarding culture, 
with specific recommendations that the 
Board assesses and monitors culture, and 
ensures that workforce policies, practices 
and behaviours are aligned with the 
Company’s purpose, values and strategy.

At Admiral we believe that our culture 
is the real essence of what our business 
is; how we act, what makes us different, 
our character and personality, and how 

we treat our employees, customers and 
other key stakeholders. Our culture is a 
culmination of the implementation of our 
purpose through our values. The Board 
sets the tone and leads by example, this 
permeates through the business and 
creates a culture lived daily by colleagues 
as well as our wider stakeholders. 
We strongly believe that Admiral’s culture 
is unique as we aim to demonstrate 
throughout this report. It is fundamentally 
important that Admiral’s culture evolves 

Implementing our purpose through our four pillars of culture

At Admiral we implement  
our purpose through our  
unique workplace culture.  
This is reinforced by our  
values – the ‘Four Pillars  
of our Culture’.

Recognition and reward
85% of employees believe that good work and 
 extra effort is appreciated. All colleagues in 
 the business will receive up to the equivalent of 
£3,600 of shares in Admiral during the year. 

Equality
95% of employees  
believe Admiral is a diverse 
and inclusive employer  
and 96% believe that 
Admiral’s culture is open 
to different sensibilities 
and backgrounds.

Our Purpose  
 “Help more people to 
look after their future. 
Always striving for

in the Company. The Group’s 
approach to investing in and 
rewarding its workforce can be 
found in our Strategic Report on 
pages 17, 89, 129 and 172.

Striving
TO BE A 
GREAT PLACE 
TO WORK

Admiral has been recognised as the 
best big Company to work for in the 
UK in 2023 by the Best Companies 
awards, as well as being in the top 15 
best multinational companies to work 
for in Europe by ‘Great Places to Work’ 
a global authority on workplace culture. 

Sharing
OUR 
EXPERIENCES

In October 2023, Jayaprakasa 
Rangaswami (JP), our Group 
Non-Executive Director, held an 
all-employee forum on diversity and 
inclusion along with a question-and-
answer session at our head office in 
Cardiff. This included his experiences 
growing up from an ethnically diverse 
background and the challenges and 
opportunities he faced throughout his 
career. This session was well attended 
by colleagues across the business, both 
in-person and online.

and adapts as the business environment 
changes. It is even more critical that those 
parts of our culture that we see as our 
competitive advantage and a key driver of 
our success to date, are fiercely protected, 
especially during continuing periods 
of change.

Aligning our culture with our 
purpose, values, strategy, 
policies and practices
Admiral’s culture is strongly aligned to 
our purpose to ‘Help more people to 
look after their future. Always striving for 
better, together’. Providing customers 
with great products and services, whilst 
caring for our people and other important 
stakeholders is key to what we do.

Our Four Pillars of Culture are built into 
the fabric of our training, communication, 
policies and the way we do business. 
During the year, the Board received 
assurance from management that 
the Group purpose continued to be 

Admiral’s cultural initiatives

embedded within the operational process 
and policies and that there continued 
to be alignment with its rewards and 
incentives. Maintaining culture was a 
key part of Admiral’s Board discussion 
throughout the year and will continue to 
be at the forefront of its decision-making 
rationale through the year to come. 

Guiding and promoting culture 
Our Board has the responsibility to act 
with integrity, to lead by example and to 
promote the desired culture. The Board 
does this through its governance 
framework, its decision-making processes 
and its everyday interactions. We also 
ensure that any policies which apply 
to Directors are consistent with those 
equivalent policies for the workforce.

Many initiatives take place during the 
year to promote Admiral’s unique culture, 
examples of these are shown below: 

Fun and inclusive activities: Our 30th 
anniversary celebrations included, 
amongst other things, an all-
employee ‘Admiral Olympics’ and  
staff music festival called ‘MultiFest’

Flexible working arrangements. 
Empowering teams to define their own 
optimum working blueprint and self-organise in 
the most effect way, whilst coming together to

How the Board monitors  
and assesses culture
People and culture scorecard 
The people and culture scorecard 
continues to provide a good analysis 
of the key people and culture metrics 
in order to help management and the 
Board’s assessments of the overall health 
of the Group’s culture. It also supports 
the identification of any trends in the 
evolution of the Group’s workforce and 
culture, including any associated risks 
which could impact the execution and 
support of the Group’s strategy.

The Group continues to view the following 
people and culture metrics that are 
derived from the annual Great Place 
To Work® (GPTW) survey and Admiral’s 
regular internal pulse surveys as the 
lead indicators for people and culture at 
Admiral. The GPTW survey is an external 
survey which collates anonymised 
question responses from all colleagues 
to provide an overall result, as well as 
departmental results. 

Score

85%

2022: 84%

Index

GPTW Trust Index: 
The Trust Index comprises 60 questions from 
the GPTW survey, which are stable over time, 
benchmarked against the best companies in each 
market, and highly representative of the overall 
people sentiment of a positive culture.

GPTW Engagement Index: 
The Engagement Index is a specific measure 
comprising nine questions from the GPTW 
survey relating to willingness to go the extra mile, 
intention to stay with the business and likelihood 
of being an employer brand promoter. It is also 
benchmarked and stable over time and has a proven 
correlation with business performance. According 
to the GPTW institute research, the drivers that are 
most correlated to higher engagement scores are: 
(i) teamwork, (ii) career development, (iii) values 
and ethics, (iv) empowerment and accountability, 
and (v) innovation.

GPTW Culture Index: 
The Culture Index is a specific measure comprising 
of eight questions from the GPTW survey relating 
to employee perception of the workplace as friendly, 
fun and welcoming.

2022: 89%

Pulse surveys: 
Pulse surveys are undertaken four times a year 
and ask the same questions of our people to 
enable management to track any trends.
Pulse survey results in 2023 demonstrated that 
colleagues at Admiral continued to feel well 
supported by their managers. Hybrid working 
arrangements were welcomed by employees 
and communication was scored highly. 

Other people metrics:
Recruitment, gender balance, headcount, 
absence, attrition.

Scores pertaining to culture continue 
to be very high across the Group 
demonstrating the strength and impact 
of the Admiral culture. During the year 
Admiral was recognised as the best big 
Company to work for in the UK in 2023 
by the Best Companies awards, as well 
as being in the top 15 best multinational 
companies to work for in Europe by 
‘Great Places to Work’ a global authority 
on workplace culture. Admiral was also 
placed 3rd in the UK’s Best Workplaces for 
Women award in 2023.

The Board received an update on the 
people and culture scorecard metrics 
during the year, this included a review as 
to how hybrid and remote working were 
impacting on Admiral’s unique culture and 
how this potential risk to the Company’s 
culture should be managed. This oversight 
was achieved by focusing on several 
key metrics across the Group, including 
recruitment, engagement, productivity, 
absence and attrition trends, which 
were closely associated with the risks to 
culture heightened by a move to a more 
permanent model of hybrid working. 

The Board agreed that a hybrid working 
model was an effective working model for 
Admiral in the current climate, however 
close attention should be maintained as 
to the effects that this was having on the 
culture of the business, and more ‘office 
based moments’ should be encouraged 
whilst, at the same time, empowering 
teams to set their own blueprint for 
working patterns and avoiding mandated 
days in the office. 

How Admiral retains its unique 
culture whilst offering flexibility 
in working practices
For a Company of Admiral’s size there 
can be no ‘one size fits all’ solution 
to working practices. The Board 
understands that a post Covid world 
has increased the opportunity and 
expectation for greater flexibility 
within the working environment, with 
a hybrid working model becoming 
more common practice. At Admiral, 
individual business functions and 
departments are empowered to define 
their own blueprint and self organise 
their teams in a manner which they 
believe creates maximum benefit for 
the business, whilst, at the same time, 
ensuring that our special culture is 
retained and enhanced. For example, 
at a Group level a guide as to where 
and when colleagues should be 
spending time together is driven by 
our ‘Admiral Moments’ model, these 
are key moments when it matters for 
colleagues to be together in-person. 
The Board enables each business 
division to interpret these principles in 
their own way to maximise workplace 
efficiencies and enhance culture 
throughout the Group. 

Admiral Moments 
Admiral promotes a hybrid working model, empowering business functions and 
departments to organise their own working arrangements in a manner that creates 
maximum benefit for the Group. However, our ‘Admiral Moments’ model below 
sets out examples where we encourage in-person or ‘face to face’ engagement 
amongst our teams, to ensure that Admiral’s unique culture is retained 
and enhanced.

Board Leadership and Company Purpose
continued

Other tools 
In addition to employee participation in 
regular monthly surveys and the annual 
GPTW survey, there are several other 
mechanisms used by the Group and the 
Board to monitor and assess culture. 
For example, culture audits conducted 
by the internal audit function; ‘Meet 
the Manager’ meetings; the ‘Ask Milena’ 
scheme; regular online manager chats; 
ECG and IECG meetings (see page 137), 
mandatory training completion rates; 
health and safety data; whistleblowing 
and grievances; and customer net 
promoter score (NPS). All are felt to be 
valuable methods of capturing the mood 
of our people and to gauge the health of 
our culture.

The Board Committees also help the 
Board monitor and assess culture through 
their respective responsibilities, some 
examples of which are highlighted below.

Nomination and Governance Committee 
– Succession and talent management 
strategies, along with a diversity and 
inclusion strategy and policies and 
progress against targets to ensure 
alignment with the Group’s strategy 
and values.

Remuneration Committee – Monitoring 
of alignment of workforce remuneration 
policies to culture and strategy, risk 
events reported to it by the Risk 
Committee under the malus and claw 
back framework.

Audit Committee – Whistleblowing, 
Internal Audit, Group Minimum Standards.

Group Risk Committee – Risk events that 
would impact remuneration from a malus 
and claw back perspective, financial crime 
and misconduct risks.

As well as receiving updates on the 
Group’s culture at Board meetings, 
Directors utilise other mechanisms 
to assess and monitor culture, such 
as attending meetings of the UK ECG, 
subsidiary boards and performing site 
visits across the different entities within 
the Group which, during their discussions 
with a cross-section of colleagues, enables 
the Directors to gauge the culture for 
themselves. In 2023, Mike Rogers, the 
Board Chair visited L’olivier offices in 
Paris and Lille, the Admiral Seguros office 
in Seville and Madrid, and the Admiral 
Europe Compañía de Seguros S.A.U. 
(AECS) in Rome for meetings with the 
management team and employees. 

Whistleblowing
The Board has in place arrangements by 
which employees can raise concerns in 
confidence and, if necessary, anonymously. 
During the year, the Board received an 
update on the Group’s whistleblowing 
arrangements from the management 
team. The Audit Committee, chaired 
by the Group’s Whistleblowing 
Champion, Karen Green, was satisfied 
that the update was proportionate for 
independent internal investigation of the 
matters raised and supported an ethical 
business culture where colleagues felt 
safe raising concerns. In addition, and on 
an exceptions basis, the Board is updated 
in respect of reports arising from matters 
that have been raised by employees 
under the Policy. The Audit Committee 
receives more regular updates in respect 
of whistleblowing matters, see page 161 
for further information.

Shareholder engagement
The Board has continued to focus 
on effective engagement with its 
stakeholders during the year, to ensure 
that their interests are taken into 
account in its decision-making processes. 
Detailed information is set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 56 and 87 
outlining how the Board has discharged 
its duties under s172(1) of the Companies 
Act, including further information on 
the ECG and IECG see page 137, which 
constitute formal workforce advisory 
panels under the Code.

Communication and interaction with 
shareholders remains very important 
and engagement occurs on a regular 
basis. Open and frequent dialogue 
enables shareholders to fully understand 
the Group’s strategy, objectives and 
governance processes. The Investor 
Relations team has day-to-day 
primary responsibility for managing 
communications with institutional 
shareholders through a combination of 
briefings to analysts and institutional 
shareholders, both at the half-year and 
full-year results and on other occasions 
such as roadshows and conferences. 
Meetings, briefings and conferences 
with investors have taken place both 
in-person and virtually, with investor 
visits generally taking place twice a year. 
In addition, the Chair, CEO and Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee held meetings 
during the year with major shareholders 
to understand their views on governance, 
for example the proposed Remuneration 
Policy, and also Admiral’s performance 
against strategy and reported to the 
Board on any significant issues raised 
with them. During 2023, there were over 
80 separate engagements held with 
institutional shareholders. 

Meetings with investors are 
supplemented by regular feedback to 
the Board. The Investor Relations team 
produces a report on their activities in 
the previous quarter which is circulated 
to the Board for their consideration. 
The report contains an analysis of share 
price performance, a summary of analyst 
reports received during the month, and 
of meetings that have been held with 
investors and analysts, together with 
details of any significant changes to the 
shareholders’ register.

The Senior Independent Director has 
specific responsibility to be available to 
investors who have any issues or concerns, 
and in cases where contact with the Chair, 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer has either failed to resolve their 
concerns, or where such contact is 
inappropriate. No such concerns have 
been raised in the year under review.

All shareholders are invited to attend the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
in person. The 2023 AGM was held on 
27 April 2023 with the required quorum. 
Shareholders were able to vote on the 
important customary annual business 
and encouraged to submit questions 
to the Board in advance of the AGM. 
The Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration, 
Nomination and Governance, and Group 
Risk Committees attend the AGM along 
with the other Directors and are available 
to answer shareholders’ questions on 
the activities of the Committees they 
chair. Shareholders are also invited to ask 
questions during the meeting and have an 
opportunity to meet with Directors after 
the formal business of the meeting has 
been concluded. Details of proxy voting by 
shareholders, including votes withheld, are 
made available on request and are placed 
on the Company’s website following 
the meeting.

The Group maintains a corporate website 
(www.admiralgroup.co.uk) containing 
a wide range of information of interest 
to institutional and private investors. 
The major shareholders of the Company 
are listed in the Directors’ Report on 
page 199.

The regular channels of communication 
with both the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority 
(PRA) that existed throughout the year 
were supplemented by the regulators 
being invited to attend Board meetings. 
The FCA attended the Board remotely 
in April 2023, which gave the Board an 
opportunity to directly hear their views 
on specific areas such as Consumer Duty, 
as well as wider market issues. The PRA 
had previously attended a meeting of 
the Board in December 2022. The Board 
is also kept up to date with the regular 
communications between the Admiral 
Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited Board 
and the Gibraltar Financial Services 
Commission as well as contact between 
the Group’s other insurance subsidiaries 
and respective regulators.

Employee Consultation Group
Purpose
The Board recognises the importance of 
engaging with its workforce and does 
so through a combination of formal and 
informal channels. To ensure a two-
way communication platform and an 
effective means by which the views of 
the workforce can be heard, the Board 
established a UK Employee Consultation 
Group (ECG) in 2019 with the aim of 
enhancing and formalising its pre-existing 
employee engagement arrangements. 
For the purposes of Provision 5 of the 
Code, the ECG is a formal workforce 
advisory panel.

Membership and attendance
Membership of the UK ECG comprises 
elected colleague representatives and 
the remit of the ECG is to act as a forum 
for employee consultation, gathering 
colleague opinion and fostering a safe 
environment to raise matters of interest 
and generate ideas. There is a democratic 
member election process and members 
are provided with an induction to ensure 
that there is clarity about the role and 
remit of the ECG, as well as their role 
as members.

Non-Executive Directors are invited to 
attend ECG meetings on a rotational basis 
and report back to the Board on matters 
discussed, as well as actions agreed at 
the ECG meeting. Taking this approach 
ensures that each of the Non-Executive 
Directors can engage with the workforce 
directly and hear first-hand the issues and 
matters that are affecting the workforce.

To ensure that the meetings remain a 
two-way mechanism, Non-Executive 
Directors are also asked to comment on 
any insights from ECG meetings at the 
following Board meeting and the Chair of 
the UK ECG is regularly invited to attend 
Board meetings to report on matters 
discussed by the ECG and highlight any 
areas of concern. Minutes of the ECG 
meetings are also published on the 
intranet for all employees to view. Non-
Executive Directors also provide an update 
at ECG meetings on recent matters 
discussed by the Board.

Areas of focus for the Employee Consultation Group 
During 2023, the Employee Consultation Group (ECG) forum remained focused on important issues for employees, such as hybrid 
and remote working, remuneration and the cost of living, the performance management and appraisal processes, ideas on how to 
improve engagement, employee morale, attrition and absence, proposals to support mental health and wellbeing, staff survey results 
and improving diversity. There were four scheduled ECG meetings during 2023, with a wide range of topics discussed. There were also 
a number of ad hoc meetings where important one-off items were brought to the ECG’s attention that required an ‘employee voice’ 
prior to being presented to the Board. Presentations on the following topics were given to the ECG during the year, the results of these 
discussions were presented to the Board by the ECG Chair:

CEO to gain a greater understanding of how business strategy was aligned 
with Admiral’s purpose and values. 

The Chair of the Remuneration Committee took the meeting through 
the current Director’s Remuneration Policy to ensure the ECG had full 
transparency around executive reward structure. Questions were asked 
around alignment with the wider workforce.

The ECG was updated on the steps Admiral was taking to deliver first class 
customer outcomes and experience, how these were benchmarked, and 
measures taken to ensure the customer was always treated fairly.

A discussion was held around Admiral’s ability to prevent, adapt, respond 
to, and learn from operational disruptions in line with FCA and PRA 
requirements. Admiral’s important business services were identified 
together with what the priorities were for the remainder of the year.

New employee appointed representatives were welcomed and inducted to 
the ECG. 

A presentation and discussion was held around share dividends and how 
new tax treatment may impact employees, along with focus on Admiral’s 
dividend reinvestment scheme.

The ECG discussed the impact of hybrid working on the business and 
actions being taken to preserve the Admiral culture in an evolving 
working environment.

A presentation was made on the proposed amended Remuneration Policy 
to be put to shareholders at the 2024 AGM for approval.

A presentation was made on the increasing expectations and regulatory 
reporting requirements for banks and insurers on climate change, the 
ambitious targets Admiral had set itself on net zero and the initiatives 
being rolled out to meet these targets.

The meeting discussed how Admiral had a long track record of delivering 
on key sustainability and ESG issues. A new Group wide approach was 
being embedded into the core strategy and governance framework of the 
business led by a recently appointed new Group Head of Sustainability. 

*  Ad hoc ECG meetings to address important one-off items that required an ‘employee voice’ prior to being presented to the Board.

Whilst recognising that this engagement mechanism will evolve over time, the Board continues to believe that the operation of the 
ECG has been, and continues to be, an effective means of engaging with the workforce, to help the Board understand matters that 
concern the workforce and their specific interests, whilst having regard to these matters in the discussions and decisions that take place 
at the Board. The Board will ensure that the ECG continues to develop as an effective, formal workforce advisory panel and that regular 
interaction between the Board and the ECG is maintained. 

International Employee Consultation Group (IECG)
The International Employee Consultation Group has been formally meeting since 2022, and is Chaired by Costantino Moretti, Head of 
International Insurance. 

This year, five IECG meetings took place in-person across the international offices of ConTe, L’olivier, Admiral Seguros together with 
Admiral Tech, AECS and Elephant alongside the Admiral Europe Compañía de Seguros (AECS) Board meetings. The meetings were 
attended by candidates chosen on a voluntary basis, with an agenda created to incorporate employee interests, questions and proposals.

Board roles and responsibilities
The Chair is primarily responsible for 
leading the Board, setting its agenda, 
promoting a culture of openness and 
debate and monitoring its effectiveness. 
The Chair is supported by the Senior 
Independent Director, who acts as 
a sounding board and serves as an 
intermediary for the other Directors 
if required. Neither are involved in the 
day-to-day management of the Group. 
Save for the matters reserved for the 
Board, the Chief Executive Officer 
(with the support of the Chief Financial 
Officer and the senior executives) is 
responsible for proposing the strategy 
to be adopted by the Group, running the 
business in accordance with the strategy 
agreed by the Board and implementing 
Board decisions.

It is the Non-Executive Directors’ role to 
provide constructive challenge, strategic 
guidance, offer their respective specialist 
advice and hold management to account.

It is the role of the Company Secretary 
to support the Chair and administer the 
workings of the Board and Committees, 
ensuring Directors have precise and 
timely information to enable an effective 
decision-making process, whilst providing 
governance, legal and statutory advice 
and ensuring a record of decisions and 
actions is clear and attributable. 

The Board has approved a statement 
that sets out the clear division of 
responsibilities between the Chair,  
Chief Executive Officer and SID. This and 
Matters Reserved for Decision by the 
Board are reviewed annually and are 
available to review on Admiral’s website  
at www.admiralgroup.co.uk.

Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for promoting 
the long-term, sustainable success of the 
Group, generating value for shareholders, 
taking into consideration all of its 
stakeholders and contributing to the 
wider society in which Admiral operates 
its business. The Board is the principal 
decision-making forum for the Group, 
providing entrepreneurial leadership, both 
directly and through its committees, and 
delegating authority to the Executive 
Directors and the senior management 
team for the day-to-day operation of 
the business.

The Board has determined the Group’s 
purpose, to ‘help more people to look 
after their future. Always striving for 
better, together’. This is embedded in 
the culture of the business through our 
aligned values and strategy. Part of the 
Board’s role is to promote the Group’s 
culture and, in particular, ensure that its 
uniqueness is safeguarded. This has been 
especially important in recent years where 
there have been significant challenges to 
how the business operates and its culture, 
such as the recent Covid-19 pandemic 
(see page 132).

The Board is responsible for organising 
and directing the affairs of the Group in 
a manner that generates and preserves 
value over the long-term. Through the 
strong governance framework that it has 
in place, the Board is able to deliver on its 
strategy of providing strong sustainable 
financial and operational performance. 
The Board is also accountable for ensuring 
that in carrying out its duties, the Group’s 
legal and regulatory obligations are being 
met; and for ensuring that it operates 
within appropriate risk parameters.

The Group’s UK-regulated entities are 
accountable to the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) and the Prudential 
Regulatory Authority (PRA) for ensuring 
compliance with the Group’s UK 
regulatory obligations and that dealings 
with the FCA and PRA are handled 
in a constructive, co-operative and 
transparent manner. Similar provisions 
apply in respect of the Group’s 
international businesses with regard 
to the relevant regulatory authorities, 
such as the Gibraltar Financial Services 
Commission and Dirección General de 
Seguros y Fondos de Pensiones in Spain.

Board and Committee meetings 
Directors are expected to attend all 
meetings of the Board and the Board 
committees on which they serve and to 
devote sufficient time to the Group to 
perform their duties. Where Directors are 
unable to attend meetings, they receive 
papers for that meeting, giving them 
the opportunity to raise any issues with 
the Chair in advance of the meeting. 
The number of scheduled Board and 
Board committee meetings attended by 
each Director during 2023 is provided in 
the table below.

In addition to the scheduled meetings 
of the Board set out in the table 
below, the Board also held a number of 
additional late notice, ad hoc meetings 
to discuss matters that were of sufficient 
importance that they could not wait until 
the following scheduled Board meeting. 
All Directors are invited to participate in 
such meetings which, by their nature, 
are arranged at short notice. Where they 
are unable to do so due to pre-existing 
commitments, Directors are given the 
opportunity to contribute their views to 
the Chair prior to the meeting. The Board 
also delegates authority to a Board 
sub-committee for the approval of final 
drafts of announcements and proposals 
which had already been considered by the 
Board or its committees. The Board met 
in-person for all seven of its scheduled 
meetings held during the year, including 
its strategy meeting (and October Board) 
which was held over two days in the UK.

Group conflicts of interest
In compliance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 regarding 
Directors’ duties in relation to conflicts 
of interest, the Group’s Articles of 
Association allow the Board to authorise 
potential conflicts of interest that may 
arise and to impose such limits as it 
thinks fit. The Group has a Conflicts of 
Interest Policy which deals with conflicts 
of interest, and this was reviewed and 
approved by the Board in October 2023. 
The Policy sets out the process and 
procedure by which the Board manages 
potential conflicts of interest that 
may arise at Board level, within Board 
Committees, and within the Group’s 
Subsidiary Boards. Following this review, 
the Board concluded that the process 
continued to operate effectively.

In addition, each Board member is asked 
to complete, annually, a conflicts of 
interest questionnaire that sets out any 
situation in which they, or their connected 
persons, have, or could have, a direct or 
indirect interest that could conflict with 
the interests of the Company. Any current 
directorships that they, or their 
connected persons hold, any advisory 
roles or trusteeships held, together with 
any companies in which they hold more 
than 1% of the issued share capital are 
also disclosed. The Board is satisfied that 
none of the Directors had any potential 
conflicts of interest during the year which 
could not be authorised by the Board.

Matters reserved for the Board
The Board has adopted a formal schedule 
of matters reserved for the Board’s 
consideration. This is monitored by the 
Company Secretary and reviewed by the 
Board on an annual basis. Specific matters 
reserved to the Board include the 
approval of:

•  The Group’s long-term objectives and 

corporate strategy

•  Operating and capital budgets, financial 
results, and any significant changes to 
accounting practices or policies

•  The Group’s capital structure

•  Results and financial reporting

•  The system of internal control and 

risk management

•  The Group’s overall risk appetite

•  Changes to the structure, size and 

composition of the Board, including 
new appointments

•  Succession plans for the Board and 

senior management

•  Dividend policy and proposals for 

dividend payments

•  Major acquisitions, disposals, and other 
transactions outside delegated limits

•  The annual review of its own 
performance and that of its 
Board Committees

•  Annual review of selected 

Group policies

•  The review of the Group’s overall 

corporate governance arrangements.

Board Committees
The Board has delegated authority 
to several permanent committees to 
deal with matters in accordance with 
written Terms of Reference. The principal 
committees of the Board – the Audit, 
Remuneration, Risk, and Nomination and 
Governance Committees all comply with 
the requirements of the Code.

All committees are chaired by an 
independent Non-Executive Director, 
except for the Nomination and 
Governance Committee, which is chaired 
by the Chair of the Board, and comprise a 
majority of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. In accordance with the Code, 
all members of the Audit Committee are 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Appointments to the Committees are 
made on the recommendation of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
and are for a period of up to three 
years, which may be extended for two 
further three-year periods, provided 
the Director remains independent and 
they are annually reappointed to the 
Board by shareholders. The committees 
are constituted with written Terms of 
Reference that are reviewed annually 
to ensure that they remain appropriate 
and reflect any changes in good 
practice and governance. These Terms 
of Reference are available on request 
from the Company Secretary and can 
also be found on the Company’s website: 
www.admiralgroup.co.uk.

Directors are fully informed of all 
committee matters by the committee 
Chairs who report on the proceedings 
of their committee at the subsequent 
Board meeting. Copies of committee 
minutes are also distributed to the 
Board. Committees are authorised 
to obtain outside legal or other 
independent professional advice if they 
consider it necessary. The Chair of each 
committee attends the Annual General 
Meeting to respond to any shareholder 
questions that might be raised on the 
committee’s activities. An evaluation 
of the performance of each committee 
against the duties set out in each Terms of 
Reference is carried out annually.

Information flows to 
and from the Board
Agendas and papers
Agendas and papers are circulated to 
the Board electronically in a secure 
manner in preparation for Board and 
Board committee meetings. The Board 
agenda is structured by the Chair 
in consultation with the Company 
Secretary and CEO. An annual schedule 
of agenda items is reviewed and updated 
regularly to ensure that items are 
considered at the appropriate point 
in the financial and regulatory cycle. 

Meetings are structured so as to allow for 
consideration and debate of all matters. 
Routine Board papers are supplemented 
by information specifically requested by 
the Directors from time to time.

At each scheduled meeting, the Board 
receives updates from the Chair, the 
CEO and CFO as to the financial and 
operational performance of the Group 
and any specific developments of which 
the Board should be aware. In addition, 
there is an update provided at each Board 
on the matters discussed and considered 

Board and Board committee meeting preparation process

at each of the Group’s principal subsidiary 
Board meetings. Additional meetings 
are called as and when required and 
there is contact between the Board, 
Board committees, subsidiary boards 
and management, where necessary, 
to progress the Group’s business. 

The Company Secretary manages a yearly planner 
of scheduled agenda items for the Board and 
Board Committees.

The Company Secretary liaises with the Chair, 
Executive Directors, committee Chairs and key 
members of senior management in advance 
of each respective meeting to confirm agenda 
items and required attendees.

Board and committee papers are drafted  
by relevant authors throughout the business  
and are subject to an established  
review process ahead of submission.

Board and committee papers are circulated 
electronically at least one week prior to the meeting.

The Chair will meet with Executive Directors and  
Non-Executive Directors ahead of the meeting to 
ascertain any areas of particular concern or focus.

Standardised Board reporting 
templates and report cover 
sheets are in place and 
training has been given to 
those producing Board and 
Committee reports to ensure 
there is consistency, clarity and 
conciseness in approach.

Attendees
The CEO of UK Insurance (Cristina 
Nestares), together with the Chief Risk 
and Compliance Officer (Keith Davies), 
the Head of International Insurance 
(Costantino Moretti) and the CEO of 
Admiral Money (Scott Cargill) are invited 
to attend every Board meeting and 
regular Board dinners. This has proved 
an effective means of ensuring that 
senior managers below Board level have 
exposure to and gain experience of the 
operation of the Board. 

Dynamics
All Board and committee meetings during 
the year were held in an open atmosphere 
conducive to robust and constructive 
challenge and debate. All Directors have 
therefore been able to bring independent 
judgement to bear on issues such as 
strategy, risk management, performance, 
and resources.

Cross-committee membership
As shown on pages 118 and 142, 
committee membership is composed 
in a way that ensures that there is 
cross-committee membership, which 
allows items of importance to be flagged 
from committee to committee in a 
timely manner. This complements the 
committee briefings that the Board 
receives on the key points of discussion 
following each committee.

Advice
All the Directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary, 
who has responsibility for ensuring that 
Board procedures are followed and for 
advising the Board, through the Chair, 
on governance matters. The Company 
Secretary provides updates to the Board 
on regulatory and corporate governance 
issues, new legislation, and Directors’ 
duties and obligations. The appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary 
is one of the matters reserved for the 
Board. Dan Caunt has held the position 
of Company Secretary since 1 May 2022, 
his biography can be found on page 124. 

The Directors are also given access 
to independent professional advice 
at the Group’s expense, should 
they deem it necessary to carry out 
their responsibilities.

Training and professional 
development 
The development and training of Directors 
is an ongoing process and is considered 
throughout the year. The Directors are 
regularly updated on the Group’s business; 
legal matters concerning their roles and 
duties; the competitive environments 
in which the Group operates; and any 
other significant changes affecting the 
Group and the industry of which it is a 
part. During the year, the Board received 
deep dive updates, briefings and training 
on the following topics: Admiral internal 
model (AIM), IFRS 17, Chat GPT education 
session (Large Language Models), Pioneer 
Toolbox SME Market overview, Consumer 
Duty training provided by KPMG, amongst 
several business deep dives.

Other information flows
The Board Chair met with a wide range 
of Admiral colleagues and visited various 
parts of the business during 2023 as 
part of his induction process. The Non-
Executive Directors are invited to visit 
areas of the business for in-person on 
site visits to meet employees and review 
business functions. 

As referenced within the commentary 
on employee consultation on page 
137, the Non-Executive Directors are 
invited to attend ECG meetings and 
participate in the two-way engagement 
with employees. 

The Non-Executive Directors met 
in-person during the year without the 
Executive Directors being present. 
From April 2023, Non-Executive Directors 
individually met with the Chair for 
discussion ahead of each Board meeting 
and also met with the CEO for a debrief 
at the conclusion of each scheduled 
Board meeting. 

The Chair holds one-to-one meetings 
with members of the Group’s senior 
management team either in-person 
or on a virtual basis. Members of the 
senior management team were invited 
to join Board dinners which allows the 
opportunity for informal interaction 
between Directors and the senior 
management team.

Nomination and Governance Committee Report

Overseeing 
OUR BOARD
COMPOSITION

Dear Shareholder,

On behalf of the Board, 
I am pleased to present my 
first report as Chair of the 
Nomination and Governance 
Committee (the Committee). 
The Committee plays a key 
role in overseeing Admiral’s 
Board composition, ensuring 
it has the optimum balance 
of skills, experience and 
knowledge, as well as ensuring 
diversity in the broadest sense 
on the Board and all of its 
committees. The Committee 
also ensures that the 
Group operates within 
a robust and transparent 
governance framework. 
This report sets out the 
Committee’s main activities, 
along with how it has 
discharged its responsibilities 
throughout the year ended 
31 December 2023.

As a Committee, we have 
continued our focus on 
the composition, skills and 
experience of the Board 
and Board committees 
to ensure these reflect the 
current requirements of the 
Admiral business and meet 
the expectations  
of our stakeholders.

Six committee 
meetings 
held in 2023.

Succession planning was a key focus 
for the Committee during 2023. 
As I discussed on page 114, I succeeded 
Annette Court as Chair following the 
2023 AGM in April. My induction process, 
which began following the announcement 
of my appointment in January 2023, 
was bespoke and comprehensive. 
Further details on this are set out on 
page 151. In addition to myself as 
Chair, the Board, on recommendation 
from the Committee, also appointed 
Fiona Muldoon as a new Non-Executive 
Director in October 2023. The full search 
and recruitment process for Fiona’s 
appointment is set out on page 149. 

As a Committee, we have continued 
our focus on the composition, skills 
and experience present on the Board 
and Board committees to ensure these 
reflect the current requirements of 
the Admiral business and meet the 
expectations of our stakeholders. 
To effectively oversee this process, the 
Committee has maintained and refined 
a skills matrix which maps those skills 
currently present on the Board and those 
required to ensure the effective delivery 
of our business strategy. Where gaps 
in skills and experience are identified 
these are reviewed and addressed by 
the Committee and the necessary 
recommendations are made to the Board. 

Diversity and inclusion were key topics for 
Committee discussion during the year. 
The Committee ensured that the Board 
continued to meet the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review target that 40% of the 
Board should be female, in addition to 
The Parker Review’s target that the 
Board should include at least one director 
from an ethnic minority background by 
2024. The evolving requirements of The 
Parker Review at a senior management 
level were discussed in detail, and the 
Committee ensured that the Group’s 

policy on diversity and inclusion was 
reviewed during the year and continued 
to be embedded throughout the 
Group. Where necessary, changes were 
implemented to the appointment 
and succession processes to ensure 
that evolving diversity considerations 
were key to discussions during these 
processes. More details on this and wider 
considerations around diversity and 
inclusion in the workplace are set out on 
page 154.

Following an external review of the Board 
and Board Committee’s effectiveness 
in 2022, the 2023 annual review of the 
Committee’s effectiveness, which took 
place in December, was carried out by 
way of an internal review led by myself 
in conjunction with the Company 
Secretary. This review concluded that, 
overall, the Board and its committees 
remained effective but noted some areas 
for improvement for 2024. These are 
outlined on page 160 of this report, along 
with progress against the previous year’s 
recommendations set out on page 159.

In line with the requirements of Solvency 
II, the Senior Insurance Manager Regime, 
and in accordance with the Group’s Senior 
Managers & Certification Regime Policy, 
I have also carried out the process of 
assessment for the Group CEO, Group 
Non-Executive Directors, and the Chairs 
of the Group’s material, regulated 
subsidiaries; EUI Limited, Admiral 
Insurance Company Limited, Admiral 
Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited, and Admiral 
Financial Services Limited (Admiral 
Money), Able Insurance Services Limited 
(Admiral Pioneer), Elephant Insurance 
Company (USA), and Admiral Europe 
Compania de Seguros - AECS (Europe) to 
ensure they meet the requirements in 
terms of qualifications, capability, honesty 
and integrity. 

The rest of this Report sets out in more 
detail the activities of the Committee 
during 2023. I would like to thank the 
Committee members for their continued 
contributions and support throughout 
the year.

Nomination and Governance Committee Report 
continued

The Nomination and Governance Committee is primarily responsible for: 

Reviewing the structure size and composition of the Board as a whole, along with consideration of the balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience, time commitment and diversity of the Board and its committees.
Succession planning for Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors and leading the process for Board appointments by making 
recommendations regarding Board vacancies.
Make recommendations to the Board on refreshing the membership of the Board’s principal committees.
Overview of succession planning at executive and senior management level throughout the Admiral Group, ensuring there is an 
experienced and diverse pipeline for succession.
Devising the selection criteria for the role, skills, capabilities and experience required for a particular appointment and engagement  
with independent, third-party recruitment experts.
Consideration of results of the Board evaluation and consideration of the proposed annual re-election of Directors to the Board  
at the AGM.
Review of Admiral’s governance framework to ensure transparency and accountability, and to consider developing corporate governance 
matters to bring to the attention of the Board where necessary.
Consideration of the Committee’s draft report for inclusion in the Annual Report and Accounts.

The Committee is regularly updated on proposed senior appointments and governance changes across the Group, as well as key 
developments within the corporate governance landscape. The terms of reference of the Committee include all the relevant matters set 
out under the UK Corporate Governance Code, they are reviewed annually by the Committee and are available to view on the Company 
website in the investor relations section.

Key activities of the Committee during the year
A description of the activities the Committee has focused on during the year ended 31 December 2023 is outlined under the 
following headings:

Non-Executive Director appointment process and appointments made during 2023
Appointments to the Board are the responsibility of the Board as a whole, acting on the advice and recommendations of the Nomination 
and Governance Committee. The Committee seeks to balance the retirement and recruitment of Non-Executive Directors well ahead 
of relevant deadlines so as to avoid a dislocation of Board process by losing experience and skills. The Committee is mindful of the need 
to promote diversity and inclusion in appointments to the Board and throughout the Group. Appointments are made on merit and 
against objective criteria, having due regard to the benefits of diversity, and with a view to ensuring the Board has the appropriate mix of 
personalities, skills and experience.

The policy on Board appointments involves the Committee developing an appropriate job specification that identifies the required skills 
and experience for the role and, in most instances, engaging external recruitment consultants, to lead the search process and identify 
suitable candidates. Interviews of the shortlisted candidates are held with the Chair and members of the Committee. After consideration 
by the Committee, a recommendation is made to the Board to appoint a preferred candidate. Further details of how this process 
worked effectively during the year are set out below. The Committee is satisfied that this constitutes a formal, rigorous and transparent 
process for the appointment of new Directors to the Board and its subsidiaries, embracing a full evaluation of the skills, knowledge and 
experience required of new Directors. 

Mike Rogers, Chair: Appointed 27 April 2023. Mike Rogers joined the Board as Chair following the 2023 AGM. Mike was also appointed 
as Chair of the Nomination and Governance Committee at this time. The search and recruitment process for Mike was set out in detail 
in the Committee Report in the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. Annette Court, the Board and Committee Chair until the 2023 
AGM, played no part in the recruitment process of the replacement Board Chair. This process was led by Justine Roberts, the then 
Interim Senior Independent Director. Justine was appointed as the Senior Independent Director on a permanent basis with effect from 
31 January 2023.

Fiona Muldoon, Non-Executive Director: Appointed 2 October 2023. Fiona Muldoon joined the Board as Non-Executive Director and, 
having specific and relevant financial experience, became a member of the Audit Committee on 2 October 2023. A summary of the 
recruitment process for Fiona is set out below.

External Recruitment Consultant
Heidrick and Struggles (‘H&S’) was engaged as the external independent recruitment search consultant in the appointments of both 
Mike Rogers and Fiona Muldoon. H&S is committed to promoting diversity in the candidates that it presents on an annual, global 
and cumulative basis and this was reflected in the candidates it identified for the appointments of Mike and Fiona. H&S has no other 
connection with the Admiral Group or its Board Directors.

Shortlist and interview
March – June 2023

Approval and appointment
July – October 2023

STEP 4
Shortlisting candidates
H&S prepared an initial longlist of 
candidates which was presented 
to the Committee in March 2023. 
Shortlisted candidates were then 
reviewed at the Committee meeting 
held in April 2023. Following the 
meeting, shortlisted candidates were 
contacted to establish interest and 
an initial interview was undertaken 
by H&S.

STEP 6
Committee recommendation 
and Board approval 
Following the satisfactory receipt of 
references, the Committee met to 
discuss a proposal to recommend 
to the Board the appointment of 
Fiona Muldoon as Non-Executive 
Director and member of the Audit 
Committee. The Board considered 
and accepted the recommendation 
of the Committee. A formal offer was 
put to, and accepted by, Fiona.

STEP 7
Appointment 
Fiona was appointed to the Admiral 
Board and as a member of the 
Audit Committee with effect from 
2 October 2023. Fiona immediately 
embarked on a personalised 
and in-depth induction process. 
Her appointment will be put before 
shareholders for approval at the 
2024 AGM.

STEP 5
Interview process
Following further discussions, the 
leading three candidates were 
interviewed by the sub-committee 
and two additionally met the CFO. 
The merits and suitability of the 
candidates were scrutinised at 
each stage during this process 
against the candidate specification. 
Fiona Muldoon emerged as being 
the Committee’s preferred candidate 
given her strong and relevant skills 
and experience, including relevant 
financial experience. It was agreed 
that she would be a good cultural fit, 
and had the capability to contribute 
effectively to the Group Board. 
Fiona subsequently met with the 
Group CEO.

STEP 1
Identification of role 
requirements
The Committee, led by the Chair, 
gave consideration as to the skills, 
experience, knowledge and diversity 
of the Board and those required 
for optimal Board and Committee 
composition. During this process 
the Committee canvased the views 
of the Board and senior Admiral 
management. From this, Non-
Executive Director (NED) candidate 
criteria requirements were agreed 
at the Committee meeting in 
January 2023. 

STEP 2
Engagement of third party 
advisor
Heidrick and Struggles (‘H&S’), 
experts in the field of search and 
recruitment, were engaged by the 
Committee to assist with the search 
for potential NED candidates. H&S 
was asked to ensure the search 
identified candidates from a diverse 
range of backgrounds and industries. 
Alongside the Committee, H&S 
prepared the Admiral Group plc Non-
Executive Director role specification, 
this included a requirement for 
relevant financial experience to allow 
the candidate to be considered for 
membership to the Audit Committee.

STEP 3
Initial search process
A sub-committee of the Committee 
was formulated consisting of the 
Chair, Non-Executive Directors and 
the Head of People Experience to 
oversee the recruitment process. 
H&S commenced a wide-ranging 
search process and regular updates 
on progress were given to the  
sub-committee.

Non-Executive Director induction
Upon appointment, our Non-Executive Directors embark on a bespoke and comprehensive induction programme, comprising common 
elements for all Non-Executive Directors, as well as elements tailored to the individual depending on their role, skills, knowledge and 
experience. The induction process, led by the Company Secretary, covers topics such as the role of a Non-Executive Director and their 
responsibilities, the workings of the Board and the Group’s subsidiary boards, and the Company’s operations. Non-Executive Directors are 
provided with a suite of background reading materials before induction sessions are arranged with individuals from each of the Group 
businesses, again, depending on the individual’s induction requirements. Ongoing professional development needs of newly appointed 
Non-Executive Directors are then monitored via annual individual Director evaluations and the Committee’s oversight of the Non-
Executive Director skills matrix. 

Inductions took place for both Mike Rogers, Chair, and Fiona Muldoon, Non-Executive Director, during the year. Outlined opposite is 
a summary of Mike Rogers’ induction process at Admiral. Fiona also received a comprehensive and bespoke induction similar to that 
outlined opposite.

Board Committee changes, term extensions and internal appointments addressed by the Committee during 2023
The Board, on recommendation from the Committee, agreed to the following proposals/changes during the year:

•  Jean Park retired from the Board including all of her committee memberships on 20 January 2023

•  The appointment of Justine Roberts as permanent Senior Independent Director and permanent member of the Remuneration 

Committee was made effective from 31 January 2023

Annual re-election
As set out in the Group’s Articles of Association, all Directors should retire and offer themselves for re-election at each AGM, in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) and the Company’s current practice. Therefore, all Directors will be submitting 
themselves for election or re-election by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.

Following a full review and evaluation during the year, the Board is satisfied that all Directors are properly qualified for their election or 
re-election by virtue of their skills and experience and their contribution to the Board and its committees. Further details of why each 
Director’s contribution is, and continues to be, important to the Company’s long-term sustainable success is provided on page 118 and 
within the notes to the Notice of the 2024 Annual General Meeting.

Mike Rogers

Prior to Annette Court stepping 
down as Chair, she met with Mike to 
facilitate the smooth transition of 
the responsibilities of Chair. She gave

Code requirements, Board policies, 
the results of the most recent Board 
evaluation and areas of Board focus 
for the coming year.

Non-Executive Directors 
Mike met and has continued to 
meet individually with each of the 
Non-Executive Directors who gave 
their insight into Board dynamics, 
culture and governance as well as 
highlighting their backgrounds and 
areas of expertise. Mike also met 
with the Chairs of our subsidiary 
Boards and overseas businesses. 
Board Committee Chairs brought 
Mike up to speed on their respective 
Committee’s business. 

Site visits 
Mike undertook various site visits 
during his first year and met with 
management and colleagues across 
the business as part of his induction 
process, this included our UK sites in 
South Wales, as well as L’olivier offices 
in Paris and Lille, the Admiral Seguros 
office in Seville, AECS in Madrid and 
ConTe in Rome.

Significant shareholders 
Mike has met with a number of 
Admiral’s significant shareholders, 
including the founders of the 
Company, Henry Engelhardt and 
David Stevens, to understand their 
views on the business. Mike regularly 
meets with employee shareholders 
throughout the business and the 
opportunity for individual retail 
shareholders to meet the Chair takes 
place annually at the AGM.

Information and educational 
materials 
A comprehensive suite of educational 
materials was provided to Mike by 
the Company Secretary including, 
for example; Admiral’s business 
plan and strategy, key roles and 
responsibilities of the Board, its 
committees, Directors, guidelines 
and policies for a UK Listed insurance 
Company regulated by the FCA and 
PRA, minutes of meetings, terms of 
reference etc.

Our Board composition and how we plan for succession
The composition of the Board is kept under constant review by the Committee. As at 31 December 2023, the Board comprised 11 
Directors: The Chair (who was independent on appointment), two Executive Directors, and eight independent Non-Executive Directors – 
see page 118.

The Committee carefully considers the independence, composition and balance of skills and knowledge of the Board. As a result, 
the requirement to refresh Board and committee memberships in an orderly manner is continually monitored so as to maintain the 
continuity of Board process and the strength of personal interaction which underlies the effectiveness of the Board.

Our Board has a 
broad range of 
skills and experience 
which it uses to 
bring independent 
judgement to bear 
on issues of strategy, 
performance, 
risk management, 
resources and 
standards of conduct 
which are integral 
to the success of 
the Group.

Executive Director

The Chair, Senior Independent Director and independent Non-Executive Directors are currently appointed for fixed periods of three 
years, subject to election by shareholders. The initial three-year period may be extended for two further three-year periods subject 
to performance review and annual re-election by shareholders. JP Rangaswami’s term of appointment as Non-Executive Director was 
extended by a further three-year period during the year, subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Letters of appointment may be 
inspected at the Company’s registered office or can be obtained on request from the Company Secretary.

The tenure of the previous Group Board Chair, Annette Court, came to an end at the 2023 AGM held on 27 April 2023. Annette had no 
involvement in the recruitment of her successor, Mike Rogers, as Chair. An explanation as to why Annette’s tenure extended beyond 
the nine years recommended by the Code is provided on page 125. Mike Rogers appointment as Chair of the Board became effective 
following the AGM held on 27 April 2023. On appointment, the Board considered that Mike met the independence criteria set out in 
provisions 9 and 10 of the Code. The Chair’s biography can be found on page 118.

The independence of each Non-Executive Director has been assessed during the year, in line with the independence criteria contained 
within provision 10 of the Code. The Board has identified on page 152 which Directors it considers to be independent. The Board 
considered all the Non-Executive Directors to be independent during the year. For the year ended 31 December 2023, 80% of the Board, 
excluding the Chair, were considered independent Non-Executive Directors. The number of independent Non-Executive Directors meets 
the requirements set out under provision 11 of the Code which requires that at least half of the Board, excluding the Chair, should be 
Non-Executive Directors whom the Board considers to be independent.

Balance of skills, knowledge and experience
The Directors have a broad range of skills, knowledge and experience and can bring independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, 
performance, risk management, resources and standards of conduct which are integral to the success of the Group.

The Committee understands that a wide range of complementary skills on the Board will assist in the meeting of Board objectives and 
the delivery of Company strategy. The Committee regularly reviews the Board skills matrix, particularly in the context of succession 
planning and skills that are potentially lost at the end of a Director’s tenure on the Board. The current skills and experience on the 
Board are outlined below and an explanation regarding how this feeds into succession planning follows later in this report.

Nomination and Governance Committee Report 
continued

Time commitment and external appointments
On appointment, all Directors are advised of, and requested to make, the necessary time commitment required to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively. This time commitment is also outlined in the letters of appointment issued to the Chair and Non-Executive 
Directors. When making new appointments, the Committee takes into account other demands on the Directors’ time. Prior to 
appointment, significant commitments are disclosed by Directors to the Committee and the Board. 

As part of the annual performance evaluation each Director is appraised on their time commitment dedicated to the Company. 
The Committee also reviews the time commitment required of all Non-Executive Directors at least annually to consider whether the 
guidance on time commitment of certain roles needs to be extended due to market or responsibility changes. The Board is satisfied that 
all Directors have dedicated the required amount of time to the Company to effectively fulfil their roles, and that the Company has given 
the Non-Executive Directors sufficient time to perform the duties required of them. 

As well as considering the demands of a Director’s time upon appointment, as required under provision 15 of the Code, there is in 
place a formal procedure for the approval of additional external appointments for Directors through the Committee and the Board. 
The Committee and the Board are satisfied that the external commitments of all the Non-Executive Directors do not conflict with their 
duties and commitments as Directors of the Company. 

Overall assessment of composition
The Board, through ongoing assessment and annual performance review, remains satisfied that it has the appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Group to enable it and its committees to discharge their duties and responsibilities 
effectively, as required by the Code. In addition, the Directors are aware of their legal duties under s172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act 
in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the success of the Company for its shareholders, as well as considering 
the interests of wider stakeholders. Further details of how the Board fulfils its duty in this regard are outlined on page 87.

Board and senior management diversity and inclusion
The Listing Rules and Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules were amended to include new disclosure requirements for listed 
companies for financial years starting on or after 1 April 2022. As required under the amended requirements, a table setting out gender 
and ethnicity diversity at Board and senior management level is included on page 156. The Board diversity targets, which are in-line with 
the targets set by the FTSE Women Leader’s Review and the Parker Review, are: at least 40% of the board are women; at least one of 
the senior board positions (Chair, SID, CEO and CFO) is held by a woman; and at least one member of the Board is from a minority ethnic 
background. As set out below, the Committee is content that Admiral meets the targets set out in the Listing Rules and Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules 9.8.6(9)(a).

Gender diversity
Diversity and inclusion and the variety of perspectives that it brings has been proven in studies to increase innovation and creativity, and, 
as a result, improves performance. It also has other positive impacts, such as providing greater awareness, widens the talent pool and 
challenges the views or practices that may have become embedded over time. Admiral depends on all of the above, which are enhanced 
through having a diverse workforce, to successfully implement its business strategy.

During the year, the Committee reviewed the Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy and discussed the appropriateness of the measurable 
targets to increase diversity and inclusion at Board, Subsidiary board and senior management level. The wording of our policy has been 
updated to increase the breadth of diversity we aim to see in our business, this includes wording explicitly referencing additional diversity 
aspects such as “ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and socio-economic background (in addition to the aspects of age, gender 
or educational and professional backgrounds)” and “approach, skills and experience, race, age, gender, educational and professional 
background and other relevant personal attributes”. The Committee seeks to ensure that a clear recruitment strategy for Board and 
senior management appointments is in place and is aligned to this policy.

Measures that are covered under the Policy, including progress updates against each, include:

(i) 

 Having one member of the senior executive team who is responsible and accountable for gender diversity and inclusion at Group 
level. Cristina Nestares (EUI CEO) is the accountable executive for gender diversity

(ii)   Setting internal targets for gender diversity in senior management. Progress against the Group’s target of 40% of women in senior 

management by 2023 is detailed below

(iii)   Publishing progress annually against these targets in reports on the Group’s website. Progress updates on the UK business’ progress 

against the HM Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter commitments are provided on an annual basis on the Group’s website

(iv)   Linking the pay of the EUI CEO to the progress made against internal targets on gender diversity. The Remuneration Committee has 

also approved the linkage of progress against the Women in Finance target within the non-financial performance measures of the EUI 
CEO, Cristina Nestares. 

Women on the Board represented five (46%) of its 11 Director membership as at 31 December 2023, compared with six (55%) as 
at 31 December 2022. Admiral continues to be one of only a few FTSE 100 companies where the Board positions of CEO and Senior 
Independent Director are held by women, demonstrating Admiral’s continued strong support for the progression of women in senior 
leadership roles. Official data published by the FTSE Women Leaders (succeeding the Women on Boards Report and Hampton Alexander 
Review), issued in February 2023, reported that the percentage of women on FTSE 100 Boards was 40.5% improving from 39.1% in 2022, 
this demonstrates Admiral’s outperformance when compared with the average of the FTSE 100.

As a result of the continued progress to balance gender diversity at Board level and to align with the Women in Finance Charter’s aim of 
increasing female representation at the UK senior executive level to 40% by the end of 2023, and the FTSE Women Leaders target of 
40% representation by 2025, the Committee has aligned the annual target of women in senior management positions at 40%. The aim 
is to achieve this level of gender diversity at an aggregate level across the subsidiary boards too. As at 31 December 2023, women 
represented 33% of all of the subsidiary board appointments. Focus will continue to improve gender diversity at this level during 2024. 
Female representation was 40% of our Senior Executives (Executive Committee equivalent) and 34.4% of their direct reports. Admiral is 
working to ensure it continues to achieve the 40% target by the end of 2025. As at 31 December 2023, the gender diversity split across 
the Admiral Group was 50% female / 49% male. The remaining 1% included non-binary and other genders, and colleagues who’d prefer 
not to say. 

Ethnic diversity
The Committee continues to monitor the requirements of The Parker Review’s report on ethnic diversity in the context of the 
composition of its Board and the new reporting requirements for senior management. It also monitors the initiatives that are being 
implemented across the Group to increase diversity, along with consideration as to how measures to develop a diverse pipeline of talent 
for Board and senior management appointments should be developed and monitored. The Board includes one Director from an ethnic 
minority background, which meets one of The Parker Review’s key recommendations for FTSE 100 companies, as well as Listing Rules 
and Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 9.8.6(9)(a). Further information on how the Group is developing a pipeline of ethnically 
diverse candidates is outlined below. 

The Group remains strongly supportive of the principle of boardroom diversity, of which gender and ethnicity are important, but not the 
only, aspects. What is also important is diversity of thought, experience and approach and each new appointment must complement 
what already exists around the Board table.

Ethnic diversity amongst senior management and the wider workforce is something that Admiral continued to focus on throughout 
2023. Admiral produced its first ethnicity pay gap report in the UK during the year, further demonstrating its commitment to ethnic 
diversity in the workplace. Whilst the Committee recognises that the workforce is not always comfortable with voluntarily sharing such 
personal information, there have been initiatives introduced to encourage more people to make such voluntary disclosures. As a result, 
we have seen an increase this year to 84% disclosure in the UK. As set out in the table below, the percentage of ethnic diversity at senior 
management levels is 3%. The Committee has discussed The Parker Review recommendations to implement a target for ethnic diversity 
representation at senior management level within the Group by 2027 and will be updating shareholders in this regard in due course.

Admiral’s recruitment strategy 
aims to increase the number of 
candidates from ethnically diverse 
backgrounds and women onto 
shortlists for leadership roles. 
The ‘Get Discovered’ programme 
focuses on developing talented 
women within the Group to become 
the leaders of tomorrow.

Admiral is designing a talent 
and development program, in 
partnership with McKinsey which 
focuses on finding talented 
employees from ethnically diverse 
backgrounds at different levels and 
supporting these employees into 
leadership roles.

Admiral has signed several pledges 
such as the Menopause Pledge, 
Endometriosis Friendly Employer, 
Neurodiversity Friendly Employer 
and continued a commitment to the 
Race at Work Charter by signing up 
to their extended initiatives.

Admiral has completed its third year 
of the Admiral Aspire Programme, 
an internship aimed at offering 
students from ethnically diverse 
backgrounds and Women in STEM 
(Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Mathematics) valuable work 
experience over 12 weeks.

Admiral has partnered with a global 
diversity and talent consultancy 
called Green Park to undertake an 
in-depth ‘Culture and Inclusion’ 
audit, focused on Equality, Diversity 
and Inclusion (EDI). 

Admiral’s focus on culture and 
inclusion was demonstrated by 
winning the best UK Company 
at the 2023 Best Companies 
awards, being named the 6th best 
super large workplace (1,001+ 
employees) in the UK by the Great 
Place To Work® Institute, the global 
authority on workplace culture. 
Admiral also placed 3rd in the UK’s 
Best Workplaces for Women award 
in 2023.

Succession planning
The Committee oversees the succession planning strategy and appointment procedure for new Director’s on behalf of the Board. 
The Committee reviews those skills present on the Board in order to understand where there are strengths and potential weaknesses, 
and where there may be the opportunity to bring in complementary skills to improve the functionality and depth of experience 
of the Board. These requirements are then fed through to an independent consultant who will seek out candidates matching the 
skillset provided and draw up a diverse shortlist of candidates for the Committee to review. The Committee will also consider senior 
management appointments on behalf of the Board and consider where these appointments fit in with established Board succession 
planning strategy. Any new recruitment process for the Board is based on merit and assessed against objective criteria. The Committee 
considers diversity in all of its forms as a central consideration to this process. Further information around Admiral Board’s recruitment 
process can be found in the appointment process for Fiona Muldoon set out on page 149.

Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Director succession planning is split into short, medium and longer-term horizons to ensure that all eventualities, as far as 
possible, are planned for.

Horizon: Emergency cover

Description
There are emergency succession plans to ensure that there is sufficient short-term cover or a plan in place for key roles of the Board, 
namely, the Chair, the SID, committee Chairs and, in turn, Committee members if a Committee Chair’s absence is longer than expected. 
These plans take account of any requirements under the respective Committee’s Terms of Reference, as well as any Code requirements.

Horizon: Medium term (3–6 year tenure)

Description
The Committee’s medium-term succession planning involves considering the replacement of Non-Executive Directors over time to 
refresh the Board. The Committee considers (i) each Director’s period of tenure and aims to have staggered departure dates, (ii) the 
skills and experience gaps that will be created as each Director’s tenure comes to an end, and (iii) the diversity gaps that might also 
become present.

Horizon: Longer term (6–9 year tenure)

Description
The Committee’s longer-term succession planning involves the consideration of the skills, experience, and diversity that the Board 
will need over the longer-term, taking into account the Group’s strategy and the main trends and factors that are likely to affect the 
Group’s long-term success.

The regular review of these succession plans provides an opportunity for the Committee to discuss the insights provided by the data 
in order to inform the desired mix of skills, experience and diversity that the Board needs now and in the future, in the context of the 
Group’s strategic objectives.

Executive Directors and senior management
The responsibility for making appointments within senior management rests with the CEO, with direction from the Committee. 
Talent management continues to be a key area of focus for the Committee to ensure that there is a diverse pipeline of talent for senior 
management and Executive Director succession.

During 2023, the Committee considered progress in improving talent management and succession planning within the Group. 
The Committee strongly believes that an effective internal talent management process will ensure the preservation of Admiral’s unique 
culture as far as possible. During the year, the Committee received an update on the succession planning framework which is used across 
the Group. This framework encourages more structured thinking about opportunities across departments and internationally, even in 
circumstances where this is a well embedded practice already within Admiral. Discussions on success profiles have also helped to visualise 
how success will look in the future for the critical senior management roles, whilst also providing future talent with visibility on what 
future development might look like for them.

Nomination and Governance Committee Report 
continued

The review of succession planning undertaken during the year concluded that there was a healthy pipeline of talent across the Group, 
with no immediate risk in respect of leadership continuity, and the right level of talent to execute our ‘internally grown leaders’ strategy. 
The Group continues to work to ensure that all areas of the business are working to achieve Admiral’s commitment to diversity at 
all levels in all its forms. The Committee will continue to monitor levels of diversity across the business through 2024 and will work 
to improve the ethnic diversity of entities located in geographies where such diversity should be better represented. For further 
information as to what the Company is doing in relation to diversity see page pages 62 and 154. 

The Committee remains satisfied that effective succession plans for Directors and senior management are in place to ensure the 
continued ability of the Group to implement strategy and compete effectively in the markets in which it operates.

Governance
The Committee also regularly reviews the Group’s governance arrangements, including any changes to the subsidiary board or 
committee structure, changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code and FCA Listing Rules, as well as oversight of the regulatory 
applications made under the Senior Managers Regime.

Committee effectiveness review
The Committee’s 2023 annual review was conducted by way of a self-assessment, overseen by the Company Secretary, this involved 
completion of a wide-ranging questionnaire. The questionnaire asked a set of questions designed to provide objective assessment of the 
Committee’s performance, including its effectiveness in monitoring Board composition, consideration of Executive and Non-Executive 
Director succession, overseeing talent management, senior management succession planning and developing directors’ knowledge.

The Committee discussed the output from this performance review at its meeting in December 2023 and concluded that, overall, 
the Committee had performed effectively during the year under review. Areas of focus for the Committee in 2024 were identified, 
this included ensuring effective governance around Admiral’s subsidiary board structure and further oversight in the areas of talent 
management and executive succession planning. 

Evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board, Board committees and individual Directors
How we assess our Board’s effectiveness 
Each year Admiral conducts an evaluation to assess the skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Board to confirm  
it has been able to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively. The composition and diversity of the Board and its 
committees and how well the Directors are working together is considered, as well as the individual performance of the Directors 
and the Chair. In line with the provisions of the Code, Admiral undertakes an externally facilitated evaluation every three years.  
In the two intervening years, internal reviews of the Board, its committees and individual Directors are carried out. This year the 
process was facilitated internally by way of questionnaire led by the Chair in conjunction with the Company Secretary. The 2022 
Board evaluation was conducted by way of external evaluation by Bvalco Ltd. Progress against the Board objectives that stemmed 
from the 2022 Board evaluation process are set out opposite.

Progress against 2022 Board evaluation recommendations
In December 2022, the Board undertook an externally facilitated Board, Board Committee and individual Director evaluation of its 
performance for the year ended 31 December 2022, carried out by Bvalco Ltd. Bvalco Ltd had no other connections with the Group or its 
Directors. The results of the evaluation were discussed at the Board meeting in January 2023, they demonstrated a Board that appeared 
to be functioning well, with some identified opportunities for improvement. The recommendations from the Board evaluation fed into 
the Board’s agreed objectives for 2023 and were detailed in the 2022 Annual Report as “Principal areas of focus for the Board in 2023”. 
At the June 2023 Board meeting, the Board received a six-month update on progress against these agreed areas for focus. The Board 
discussed the 2022 Board evaluation recommendations at their meeting in December 2023 and agreed good progress had been made 
against all recommendations during the year. This progress is set out in the table below. It was agreed that, where appropriate, the Board 
would continue to focus on these recommendations during 2024 to ensure these were fully implemented and embedded.

Areas of focus during 2023

Progress update 

To review the quality of information 
presented to the Board to ensure 
improved decision-making processes.

Review the balance of allocated 
Board agenda time between strategy 
and governance/regulatory matters.

To ensure Non-Executive Directors have 
opportunities to meet together outside 
of scheduled Board time and also with 
executive management.

Review the value of Board strategy 
sessions and ensure the Board has early 
involvement in the development of 
strategic proposals.

The overall quality of information presented to the Board in terms of clarity and 
context continued to improve throughout the year enabling improved Board 
discussions and effective challenge around key items of business resulting in better 
decision-making processes.

Agenda planners for the Board and Board committees were reviewed and redrafted 
during the year to ensure that the balance between strategic and governance/
regulatory matters was appropriate. Terms of reference were reviewed and updated 
to allow for further delegation of non-strategic matters to Board committees and 
subsidiary boards where appropriate.

Non-Executive Directors have the opportunity to meet with the CEO following each 
Board meeting and also have a separate Non-Executive Director only debrief session. 
Board members and other senior management are invited to attend Board dinners, 
this allows for informal conversations to take place outside of normal Board activities. 
A Non-Executive Director session on mobility took place during the year. Opportunities 
for further engagement continue to be considered.

The October Board strategy session was well received with Directors having the 
opportunity for early involvement in the strategic planning process along with the 
option to contribute to the development of the specific proposals. The Board provided 
constructive feedback on individual presentations and topics. The format of Board 
strategy sessions will continue to be reviewed and updated to ensure alignment with 
the requirements of the business.

Ensure required metrics and milestones 
are present to allow the Board to hold 
executives to account on strategic 
implementation.

The Capital Allocation Framework alongside budgets and the five-year plan were 
presented to the Board and discussed in detail during the year to enable the 
measurement of the implementation of strategy against plan and ensure management 
was held to account. 

Consideration of the value of an 
overarching approach to ESG initiatives.

A new Group Head of Sustainability was recruited during the year to ensure the 
co-ordination of ESG initiatives. Significant focus was given to ESG through strategy 
discussions, reporting and risk management which will continue throughout 2024.

The executive team should be canvased 
on key skills required when considering 
Board appointments.

Executive management’s views had been canvassed in respect of the key skills required 
when considering all new Group Non-Executive Director appointments and senior 
management hires during the year. 

Review how hybrid meeting arrangements 
could be improved to allow the full 
participation of all participants in 
meetings.

Scheduled Board and Board committee meetings generally take place in person, 
therefore it is rare for Board members to attend virtually. However, where this is 
necessary, for example where ad hoc, late notice meetings are required, updates to 
technology allow for effective attendance and participation where a member cannot 
attend in person. Where Board members were unable to attend meetings, they were 
able to submit questions and comments in advance to the Chair. 

Contributors to Board agenda items to 
be reminded of the guidelines as to form, 
content and paper submission deadlines. 

The Company Secretary and his team continued to drive improvements in the content 
and delivery of Board papers throughout the year. Improvements in the Board and 
committee meeting preparation process were acknowledged by the Board.

Audit Committee Report

2023 Board evaluation
Having carried out an external Board evaluation in 2022 in accordance with the Code requirement that FTSE 350 companies should 
carry out an externally facilitated evaluation of the Board at least every three years, the 2023 Board evaluation process was facilitated 
internally, led by the Chair with the support of the Company Secretary. The evaluation used a questionnaire developed by the external 
consultancy Independent Audit, who has no other connection with the Group or its Directors. The online questionnaire was used to 
evaluate the Board’s performance and dynamics throughout 2023 and was sent to all Board members as well as regular Board attendees 
in November 2023, it considered:

•  Board dynamics and the interaction between the Chair, Non-Executive Directors and executive management to achieve the 

Board’s objectives

•  Leadership and succession planning, including the oversight of the Group’s processes for managing, developing and retaining talent

•  Understanding by the Board of the prevailing culture within the Group

•  Quality, timeliness of delivery and presentation of Board papers and Board support

•  Time management and operational performance of Board and Committee meetings

•  Risk management and the effectiveness of the Board in considering the Group’s risk management framework and internal controls

•  The effectiveness of the Board’s strategic and operational oversight

•  Priorities for change that would enhance Board performance.

The results of the evaluation were collated by the Company Secretary and discussed at the December 2023 Board meeting. The overall 
impression from the evaluation process was that the Admiral Board and its committees continued to be performing strongly and 
function effectively. The Board was open and inclusive and supported the culture of the Admiral Group with some opportunities for 
improvement identified. A summary of the main recommendations resulting from the 2023 Board evaluation process are set out in the 
table below. Recommendations have fed into the Board’s agreed objectives for 2024 and are detailed under the ‘Principal areas of focus 
for the Board in 2024’ section on page 127.

2023 Board Committee effectiveness reviews
Further information on each of the Board Committee’s evaluations of their own performance can be found within the respective Board 
Committee reports.

Individual Director evaluation
The performance of the CFO is appraised annually by the CEO, to whom he reports. The Chair, taking into account the views of the other 
Directors, reviews the performance of the CEO. The Chair also carries out the performance assessments of each of the Non-Executive 
Directors. Each of the Directors were determined to have continued to effectively contribute to the work of the Board in 2023.

The performance of the Chair is reviewed by the Board led by the Senior Independent Director. The latest review took place in December 
2023 and was reported to the December Board. The Senior Independent Director considered and discussed with the Chair the comments 
and feedback that had been received from the Directors as part of the Chair’s evaluation questionnaire and was able to confirm that the 
performance of the Chair from his time of appointment in April 2023 was effective. 

Overseeing
THE IMPLEMENTATION 
OF IFRS 17

Dear Shareholder, 

I am pleased to set out 
in this report an update 
on the main activities of 
the Committee in 2023. 

Areas of focus in the  
reporting period
The Committee considered the economic 
backdrop facing the Group, including 
the geopolitical backdrop and supply 
chain challenges. It gave particular 
consideration to current UK inflationary 
pressures and the impact on the key 
accounting and actuarial judgements 
made by management in relation to the 
valuation of insurance contract liabilities 
and credit loss provisions, as well as the 
potential impact on going concern and 
viability assumptions. The Committee 
also dedicated a significant amount of 
time to understanding and assessing the 
impact of the new IFRS 17 (Insurance 
Contracts) accounting standard on the 
Group’s financial results and ensuring 
appropriate disclosure in the financial 
statements. The Committee monitored 
the continued effectiveness of the 
Group’s key internal controls in a hybrid 
working environment, in particular given 
the implementation of various new 
important systems. 

Significant financial reporting issues 
The setting of insurance contract 
liabilities in accordance with the Group’s 
agreed reserving methodology is a key 
accounting judgement in the Group’s 
financial statements (as set out in 
note 2 to the financial statements), 
and the Committee continues to 
place considerable focus on this area. 
The Committee challenged the key 
reserving assumptions and judgements, 
movements, emerging trends and 
analysis of uncertainties underlying 
the analysis of outstanding claims for 
the UK Car Insurance business proposed 
by management alongside that of the 
Group’s external independent actuarial 
advisers. In 2023, this included the 
impact of inflation on the claims reserves 
as set out in more detail below, future 
scenarios for the Ogden discount rate 
and ensuring the accuracy of claims data 
following the transition to the new claims 
management system. It also focused on 
management’s selection of a confidence 
level for the IFRS 17 risk adjustment held 
within the liability for incurred claims. 
The Committee also received reports on 
the claims reserving processes performed 
for insurance businesses other than UK 
Car and recommended to the Board the 
aggregate claims reserves for inclusion 
in the Group’s financial statements.

In addition to claims reserving, the 
Committee spent time reviewing 
management’s support for a number 
of other significant financial reporting 
matters including the expected credit 
loss provision held in relation to the Loans 
receivable balance held by the Group’s 
consumer lending business Admiral 
Money, other potential provisions and 
contingent liabilities, and the results 
of impairment testing performed in 
relation to the Group Parent Company’s 
investments in Group subsidiaries.

“The Committee 
dedicated a significant 
amount of time to 
understanding and 
assessing the impact  
of IFRS 17 on the 
 Group’s results.”

IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts) 
The Group successfully implemented 
the new IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts) 
accounting standard ahead of the 
1 January 2023 implementation date. 
Given the fundamental changes to 
the Group’s financial statements, the 
Committee dedicated a significant 
amount of time to understanding 
and assessing the impact of the 
standard on the Group’s financial 
results. The Committee reviewed 
and challenged key judgements and 
accounting considerations, as well as 
the financial statement disclosures on 
the impact of the new standard required 
by IAS 8 (Accounting Policies, Changes 
in Accounting Estimates and Errors) 
and related accounting disclosures. 

Corporate governance and  
reporting changes
The Committee was kept informed 
of the Group’s engagement with the 
Department for Business, Energy & 
Industrial Strategy (BEIS) consultation on 
‘Restoring trust in audit and corporate 
governance: proposals on reforms’ 
during 2023 including the proposed 
changes to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and will continue to monitor 
developments in this area. The Committee 
also oversaw, in conjunction with the 
Group Risk Committee, the Group’s 
progress in further aligning reporting 
with the Taskforce on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) published 
recommendations. The Committee 
received a report from the Group’s 
external auditor on TCFD and other 
climate-related reporting and trends in 
the market.

Internal controls
The Committee has continued to review 
the effectiveness of the internal control 
systems across the Group, in particular 
given the implementation of various 
system changes, including areas of 
potential weakness highlighted through 
audit and other assurance reports.

I hope you find the above summary, and 
the more detailed report, both useful 
and informative.

Karen Green
Chair of the Audit Committee

6 March 2024

How the Committee operates
Membership
Membership of the Committee at the 
end of the year was: Karen Green (Chair), 
Andy Crossley, Michael Brierley and 
Fiona Muldoon.

Two of the Committee’s members are 
Fellows of the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants in England and Wales, 
and one is a Fellow of the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants in Ireland. 
Given the insurance and financial services 
experience of the members of the 
Committee, the Board considers that they 
have a broad range of skills, experience 
and knowledge of the insurance and 
financial services sector, which represents 
the principal market in which the Group 
operates, and also the area of consumer 
lending in which the Group has a growing 
business, such that they are able to 
effectively analyse, challenge and debate 
the issues that fall within the Committee’s 
remit. The Board is satisfied that the 
Committee as a whole has competence 
relevant to the sectors in which the Group 
operates and further considers that a 
number of its members have recent and 
relevant financial experience.

Attendance at meetings
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary 
to the Committee. The Group Chief 
Financial Officer, Group Chief Risk Officer, 
Director of Group Finance & Chief 
Actuary and Group Head of Internal Audit 
routinely attend all Committee meetings 
(other than certain private sessions). 
Other individuals, such as the Chair of the 
Board, Chief Executive Officer, Head of 
Group Compliance, and representatives 
of different parts of the Group, may be 
invited to attend all or part of any meeting 
as and when appropriate. The Chairs of 
the Audit Committees of the Group’s 
European insurer and US subsidiary also 
attend at least one meeting each year to 
present on their activities. 

The external auditor was invited to 
attend all of the Committee’s meetings 
held in 2023, except in respect of those 
agenda items when its own performance, 
reappointment and fees were reviewed 
and discussed, or where any other conflict 
was identified.

Meetings held
The Committee meets at least six times 
per year and has an agenda planner linked 
to events in the Company’s financial 
calendar and other significant issues that 

arise throughout the year, which fall for 
consideration by the Committee under its 
remit. The Chair of the Audit Committee 
agrees the agenda for each meeting.

There were eight scheduled Committee 
meetings held during the year (with 
two of these meetings focused on 
reserving matters in conjunction with 
the half year and full year reporting and 
another on the approval of the Group’s 
Solvency and Financial Condition Report). 
Two additional meetings were held during 
the year, focused on various matters 
relevant to the Committee’s remit. 

Details of member attendance at the 
Committee meetings held during the year 
are outlined on page 162.

How the Committee  
keeps up to date
The Committee is kept up to date with 
changes to Accounting Standards and 
relevant developments in financial 
reporting, Company law, and the 
various regulatory frameworks through 
presentations from the Group’s external 
auditor, Group Chief Financial Officer, 
Group Chief Actuary and Group Company 
Secretary. In addition, all members 
attend relevant seminars, briefings and 
conferences provided by external bodies. 
The Committee also receives tailored 
reports from management and the 
Group’s external auditors from time to 
time. Topics included the Task Force on 
TCFD and other climate-related reporting 
proposed changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in 2023.

The Terms of Reference of the audit 
Committee include all the matters 
required under the Code and are reviewed 
annually by the Committee.

The Chair of the Audit Committee meets 
with the Group Head of Internal Audit, 
Group Chief Financial Officer, Director 
of Group Finance & Chief Actuary, Head 
of Reserving, the external auditors and 
UK Head of People Services (who has 
overall responsibility for coordinating the 
Group’s whistleblowing arrangements) on 
a regular basis. The Committee also held 
(i) two private meetings with the Group 
Head of Internal Audit, (ii) one private 
meeting with the Chief Financial Officer, 
and (iii) two private meetings with the 
external auditor during the year.

Significant issues considered  
by the Committee 
After discussion with both management 
and the external auditor, the Audit 
Committee determined that the key risks 
of misstatement of the Group’s financial 
statements, as in prior years, related 
to the valuation of insurance contract 
liabilities under IFRS 17. This key risk of 
misstatement can be separated into 
the best estimate of future cashflows 
required to fulfil insurance contracts, 
and the methodology and measurement 
of the risk adjustment for non-financial 
risk. In addition, given the inflationary 
environment referenced above, a specific 
significant risk was agreed in relation to 
inflation assumptions applied to UK Car 
bodily injury claims reserves given the 
long-tail nature of the claims and the 
current higher inflationary environment.

The implementation of IFRS 17 in 
the period also gives rise to a key 
audit matter given that the standard 
introduces a number of new key 
accounting judgements. 

Furthermore, the IFRS 9 provision for 
expected credit losses in relation to 
the Group’s lending business, Admiral 
Money, and the impairment testing 
exercise performed in relation to the 
Group Parent Company investments 
in Group subsidiaries were significant 
financial reporting issues considered by 
the Committee. 

These significant issues were discussed 
with management during the year and 
with the external auditor at the time 
the Committee reviewed and agreed 
the external auditor’s Group audit plan, 
when the external auditor reviewed 
the interim financial statements in 
August 2023 and also at the conclusion 
of the external audit of these full year 
financial statements.

Valuation of insurance 
contract liabilities   
The Committee continued to spend 
significant time reviewing and challenging 
the approach, methodology and key 
assumptions adopted by management 
in setting reserves for insurance liabilities 
in the financial statements to ensure 
consistency with the Group’s stated 
accounting policies, which have been 
updated following the implementation  
of IFRS 17. 

In this context, the Committee challenged 
management on the important 
judgements and assumptions used in 
estimating the best estimate of future 
claims cashflows, including specific 
focus on inflation assumptions applied in 
relation to UK Car bodily injury claims, and 
the measurement of the risk adjustment 
for non-financial risk. Further information 
is set out in more detail in the critical 
accounting estimates section of note 2 to 
the financial statements.

As in previous periods, the Committee 
held meetings specifically focused on 
reserving, receiving presentations on UK 
Car Insurance reserves from the internal 
actuarial reserving and finance teams, as 
well as the independent external actuarial 
advisors. At these meetings management 
provided further information on the 
projected best estimate claims reserves, 
as well as payment patterns used to 
estimate the resulting future claims 
cashflows. Management also presented 
to the Committee on the measurement 
of the risk adjustment for non-financial 
risk including the methods used to 
estimate the reserve risk probability 
distribution and the selection of the 
confidence level in line with the Group’s 
stated 85th – 95th percentile accounting 
policy. The Committee also received 
presentations from the external actuarial 
firm that performed independent 
validation of the best estimate claims 
reserves and the external Big Four 
firm that performed independent 
validation of the reserve risk distribution 
and the appropriateness of the risk 
adjustment at the target confidence 
level. Management were challenged by 
the Committee on the key assumptions 
and judgements made in these processes 
and justification for the movement 
in confidence level since the start of 
the year. 

The Committee reviewed and discussed 
the effects of inflationary pressures on 
claims reserves in relation to both damage 
and bodily injury claims. In addition, 
the move to a new claims system was 
considered as well as scenarios in relation 
to the future Ogden rate and updates 
regarding the FCA’s multi-firm review of 
motor total loss claims. The Committee 
also reviewed management’s assessment 
of the level of uncertainty inherent in 
the claims reserves, and changes to that 
assessment from previous periods as well 
as the results of management’s reserve 
stress and scenario testing.

165

The Committee also received updates 
from the Group’s external auditor, 
Deloitte, on its work in relation to this 
significant audit risk. This included 
reviewing management’s actuarial data 
quality assessments, best estimate 
reserve projections and the risk 
adjustment for non-financial risk, as well 
as assessing management’s qualitative 
and quantitative support for gross 
insurance contract liabilities included 
in the financial statements. Based on 
this work, the auditor was satisfied that 
the financial statement reserves remain 
appropriate and consistent with the 
Group’s accounting policy.

The Committee also received reports on 
the reserving processes for the Group’s 
insurance businesses other than UK Car 
Insurance. Management presented an 
overview of the claims reserving processes 
and resulting recommendations for 
the UK Household and UK Van lines of 
business as well as European and US 
motor businesses, including the results 
of actuarial best estimate reserving 
processes and justification for the risk 
adjustment for non-financial risk for 
each business.

Whilst acknowledging that the setting 
of reserves for claims which will settle in 
the future is a complex and judgemental 
area and having had the opportunity 
to challenge management’s proposal 
in respect of both best estimate 
reserves and risk adjustment held above 
best estimate to cover unforeseen 
deteriorations in the best estimate, 
the Committee is comfortable that an 
appropriate process has been followed, 
and that there has been sufficient 
scrutiny, challenge and debate to give 
confidence that the reserving levels set 
incorporate a risk adjustment for the 
uncertainty in the best estimate which is 
consistent with the Group’s stated IFRS 17 
accounting policies. 

Inflation assumptions applied  
within valuation of UK motor  
bodily injury claims reserves 
The Committee placed focus during the 
year on reviewing and challenging the 
approach, data inputs, methodology 
and key assumptions adopted by 
management in determining an 
allowance for excess inflation on 
bodily injury claims, included in claims 
reserves. Whilst acknowledging that 
ultimate outcome is highly uncertain, 
the Committee had the opportunity to 

challenge management’s judgements 
in respect of selected projections of 
inflation, in particular future wage 
inflation as well as the elements of 
bodily injury claims that will be subject 
to this excess inflation. The Committee 
concluded that the data and underlying 
methodology used in calculating excess 
inflation was reasonable, and in line with 
market practice and that the inflation 
assumptions adopted were appropriate.

Other financial reporting issues
IFRS 17 implementation
IFRS 17 is the new insurance accounting 
standard that came into effect from 
1 January 2023. Given the fundamental 
changes to the Group’s financial 
statements and systems and processes 
that have arisen because of the new 
standard, the Committee dedicated 
a significant amount of time during 
previous financial reporting periods 
to understanding and assessing the 
impact of the standard on the Group’s 
financial reporting process and the 
progress of implementation of chosen 
software solutions.

In 2023, the Group presented interim 
and full year financial statements under 
the new standard, including a transition 
balance sheet as at 1 January 2022, a full 
restatement of 2022 primary financial 
statements and related notes to the 
financial statements as well as revised 
accounting policies and other disclosures. 

Throughout the year the Committee 
continued to dedicate significant time to 
the subject and received regular updates 
on implementation activities, as well 
as reviewing and approving accounting 
policies, methodologies and judgements 
relating to the new standard. Activities of 
the Committee included:

•  Regular updates as to the programme 
status, ahead of the first reporting 
under IFRS 17 in the Group’s interim 
financial statements including 
progress against plans for individual 
workstreams and other issues such as 
resourcing levels

•  Review and approval of the Group’s 

transition balance sheet as at 1 January 
2022, including the work of the 
external auditor Deloitte in respect of 
the transition 

•  Review and approval of the Group’s 
restated 2022 interim and full year 
financial statements under IFRS 17, 
including the work of the external 
auditor Deloitte in respect of 
the restatement 

•  Review and approval of all IFRS 17 

related policies including accounting 
policies and those related to accounting 
judgements and materiality 

•  Review and approval of the Group’s 
revised methodology for estimating 
co-insurance profit commission, which 
is recognised under the accounting 
standard for revenue, IFRS 15. 
Whilst not directly impacted by IFRS 17, 
the loss ratio inputs to the calculation 
were amended to ensure consistency 
with the new standard 

•  Reports setting out management’s 

assessment of key technical accounting 
matters as part of the review of 2023 
interim and final financial statements, 
including the status of the work of the 
external auditor Deloitte in respect of 
those technical issues

•  Updates from the Group’s external 

auditor on their audit of the Group’s 
IFRS 17 work and IFRS 17 developments 
in the market generally.

The critical accounting judgements 
reviewed by the Committee in relation 
to IFRS 17 included management’s 
justification for the use of the simplified 
‘Premium Allocation Approach’, the 
lowest unit of account under IFRS 17 
and the classification and presentation 
of reinsurance contracts under the 
standard. The Committee, having 
reviewed management’s supporting 
papers and hearing from external auditor 
Deloitte on the matters, concluded 
that the judgements were reasonable 
and appropriate. 

The Committee was pleased to note the 
positive findings of the FRC’s thematic 
review of companies’ disclosures relating 
to IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ in the 
interim accounts, which highlighted the 
Group’s disclosures as an example of 
better practice. 

Corporate GovernanceCorporate GovernanceAdmiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Audit fee
During 2023, the Committee reviewed 
and approved the audit fee proposal 
for the 2023 year end Group audit. 
The agreed fee for the audit and other 
assurance related services for 2023 is 
£3.48 million (2022: £2.76 million), with 
the increase reflecting inflation in line 
with market increases, the impact on 
ongoing audit work required relating 
to IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts) and 
the impact on audit work required 
in relation to new financial systems. 

The Committee approved the fee increase 
having discussed with the auditor the 
rationale for the proposal.

In addition to the agreed fee for 2023, 
the Group incurred a one-off audit fee 
during 2023 of £0.83 million relating 
to the transition to IFRS 17 and the re-
presentation of the Group’s 2022 financial 
statements under the new standard. 

Safeguarding the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity
The Committee reviewed and approved 
its policy on non-audit services in February 
2023 and was satisfied that it continued 
to align with current regulatory guidance. 
Under the policy, the Group’s statutory 
auditor will only be engaged to carry 
out non-audit services in prescribed 
circumstances or where there is a 
regulatory request, and where agreed 
by the Committee. This is to ensure that 
the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditor is safeguarded.

The Committee will continue to monitor 
regulatory developments in this area to 
ensure that its policy on non-audit fees 
adheres to current guidance.

Audit Committee Report
continued

The Committee challenged 
management’s proposal for recognition 
of impairment losses as well as 
conclusions for other subsidiary entities 
where indicators for impairment were 
present but no impairment was deemed 
necessary as a result of recoverable 
amounts being in excess of the carrying 
value of investments.

Misstatements
No material unadjusted audit differences 
were reported by the external auditor. 
The Committee confirms that it is 
satisfied that the auditor has fulfilled 
its responsibilities with diligence and 
appropriate professional scepticism.

After reviewing the presentations 
and reports from management and 
consulting, where necessary, with the 
auditor, the Committee is satisfied that 
the financial statements appropriately 
address the critical judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty (both 
in respect to the amounts reported and 
the disclosures). The Committee is also 
satisfied that the significant assumptions 
used for determining the value of assets 
and liabilities have been appropriately 
scrutinised, challenged and are 
sufficiently robust.

External audit
External auditor appointment
The Group last completed an audit 
tender during 2020/21 when, following 
the completion of a transparent and 
independent audit tender process, 
Deloitte LLP were recommended to 
shareholders as the Group’s auditor at 
the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 
April 2021 and a resolution was passed 
to that effect. Deloitte LLP’s overall tenure 
up to and including the 2023 financial 
year is eight years. The Committee 
confirms it is in compliance with the 
provisions of the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation Order 2014.

On the recommendation of the 
Committee, the Board approved that 
Deloitte should be recommended 
to shareholders for reappointment 
as the Group’s auditors at the 2024 
AGM. A resolution to that effect will be 
proposed at the AGM.

IFRS 9 provision for  
expected credit losses
During the year, the Committee has 
continued to review and challenge the 
IFRS 9 provision for expected credit loss 
arising through the Group’s loans business, 
Admiral Money. Areas of focus included 
the potential impact of UK inflationary 
pressures and the increase in UK market 
interest rates on default experience, 
the assessment of circumstances 
indicating a significant increase in credit 
risk and underlying forward-looking 
economic assumptions.

Further information on the provision and 
key assumptions are found in note 7 to 
the financial statements.

On the basis of the work performed and 
having had the opportunity to challenge 
management’s proposal in respect of 
the provision for expected credit losses, 
the Committee was comfortable that an 
appropriate process has been followed, 
noting the continued enhancements 
made to the provisioning methodology 
reflecting the increasing maturity of 
the business, and that there has been 
sufficient scrutiny and challenge to give 
confidence that the provision has been 
set in line with the IFRS 9 requirements 
and included appropriate allowance for 
uncertainties arising from the current 
macro-economic environment.

Impairment testing for the Group’s 
investment in subsidiaries
During the year, the Committee considered 
management’s work in relation to the 
Group Parent’s investment in subsidiary 
entities. Under the relevant accounting 
standard, IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ 
management identified entities with 
indicators of impairment and performed 
detailed impairment testing in relation to 
those investments, calculating recoverable 
amounts primarily through the use of 
discounted cashflow calculations. 

Management proposed the recognition 
of non-cash impairment losses in 
respect of investments in Elephant, the 
Group’s US insurer, as well as subsidiary 
entities supporting the Group’s newer 
growth businesses in the UK and in 
Italy. The impairment charge relating 
to Elephant followed a similar approach 
to previous periods and was the more 
material of the impairment losses, 
reflecting the reduction in net assets 
of the business (used as a proxy for fair 
value less costs to sell) arising from losses 
incurred during 2023. 

167

The Committee discussed the results of 
the review at its meeting in December 
2023 and concluded that the Committee 
continued to operate effectively and 
within its remit. There were a number of 
areas identified for further improvement, 
such as ensuring that issues and 
risks were prominently presented in 
Committee papers. 

Priorities for the Committee for 2024 
include ensuring that the Committee 
is appropriately briefed on the UK 
Corporate Governance Code change and 
climate-related reporting, requesting the 
relevant business managers to attend 
Committee meetings to answer questions 
on significant internal audit reports and 
reinforcing the use of more effective 
summaries to highlight the issues and 
risks that the Committee needs to 
focus on. 

Whistleblowing
On behalf of the Board, the Committee 
considered and reviewed the 
Group’s whistleblowing policy and 
received quarterly updates on the 
use and effectiveness of the policy, 
whistleblowing metrics and the 
instances of whistleblowing that had 
been raised across the Group during the 
year. During the year, the Committee 
concluded that the Group’s current 
whistleblowing arrangements were an 
appropriate means by which employees 
could raise concerns in confidence 
and anonymously.

Effectiveness of the external  
audit process
The Committee undertakes an annual 
review to assess the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor and the 
effectiveness of the audit process, taking 
into consideration relevant professional 
and regulatory requirements, the progress 
achieved against the agreed audit plan, 
and the competence with which the 
auditor handled the key accounting and 
audit judgements.

As part of its review, the Committee 
considered, among other things, 
the following: submissions by the 
external auditor relating to their 
continued independence, the output 
of a questionnaire completed by all 
Committee members and relevant 
members of the Group’s Finance and 
Internal Audit functions and the findings 
of the FRC Audit Quality Reviews (AQR) 
published in July 2023. Following this 
review, the Committee concluded that 
the external auditor, Deloitte LLP, 
remained independent and that the 
external audit process remained effective.

Internal audit
The Group Head of Internal Audit 
attended all Audit Committee meetings 
and provided a range of presentations 
and papers to the Committee, through 
which the Committee monitored the 
effectiveness of the Group’s material 
internal controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls on 
behalf of the Board.

The Group Head of Internal Audit also 
carries out an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal control and risk management 
and reports on the outcome of this review 
to the Committee. In February 2024, the 
Group Head of Internal Audit reported 
an adequate level of assurance in relation 
to the Group’s arrangements for risk 
management, control infrastructure, 
governance and fraud prevention controls. 
This was supported by a summary of the 
assurance activity performed by the Line 
2 Risk and Compliance functions and an 
annual assessment of internal controls  
by Line 2. 

The Committee reviewed and approved 
the Group Internal Audit Policy, which 
includes the Group Internal Audit Terms of 
Reference setting out the role, objectives, 
reporting lines and accountability, 
authority, independence, and objectivity 
of the Internal Audit function. 
The Committee also monitored and 
discussed the evolution and development 
of the Internal Audit function, and 
considered the role, competence and 
effectiveness of each internal audit 
function across the Group. The Group 
Head of Internal Audit continues to have 
responsibility to ensure the quality of the 
internal audit activities in the Group’s 
overseas locations. The Chairs of the 
European and US Audit Committees 
each updated the Committee on their 
respective activities during the year. 

Members of the Committee also 
receive all issued internal audit reports, 
enabling them to challenge the reports’ 
content, including the rating, and related 
recommendations. The Committee 
approves the internal audit plan at the 
start of each calendar year and any 
inflight amendments to that plan, whilst 
the effectiveness and workload of the 
internal audit functions and the adequacy 
of available resources are monitored 
throughout the year.

The European operations in Spain, Italy 
and France have a dedicated internal 
audit team and the US business also has 
its own locally based team. All reports 
are evaluated by the Group Head of 
Internal Audit to ensure the quality and 
effectiveness of the reported findings, 
and a summary of the key findings of 
each completed audit is provided to the 
Committee as part of the Group Head 
of Internal Audit’s regular Committee 
update. In addition, the UK internal audit 
function carries out high-level governance 
reviews of all foreign operations, assessing 
the internal control frameworks and 
system of risk management.

Committee effectiveness review
As part of the Committee’s annual review 
of its own performance and processes, 
each Committee member completed a 
comprehensive questionnaire designed 
to provide objective assessment of the 
Committee’s performance, including its 
effectiveness in monitoring internal and 
external audit.

Managing
RISK EFFECTIVELY

Dear Shareholder, 

As Chair of the Group Risk 
Committee, I am pleased 
to present the Committee’s 
report for 2023.

The Committee has received updates 
on each of the Group businesses as 
part of the Group’s Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework (ERMF). 
Developments considered by the 
Committee throughout the year included: 

•  Admiral’s risk strategy and approach 

to risk management including regular 
reviews of the Group’s risk strategy and 
risk appetite, monitoring a suite of  
Key Risk Indicators, and oversight of the 
management of material risk events

•  Ongoing risk assessment and 

monitoring of the impact of inflation, 
market volatility, and economic outlook 
on capital and liquidity risks across the 
Admiral Group

•  The implementation of Consumer Duty

•  Oversight of work required to ensure 

Admiral is prepared to meet the 
challenges of climate change

•  Oversight of material projects and 

change programmes

•  Oversight of Admiral’s technology and 
Information Security work, including 
the future technology strategy

•  Discussions on people risk and 

risk culture

•  The continuing development of the 

Admiral internal model. 

Risk strategy and approach to risk 
management: During the year the 
Committee has discussed and considered 
proposals to enhance the risk strategy 
and the approach to risk management 
in order to continue supporting the 
effective and efficient delivery of the 
Group’s overall strategy. The Committee 
continues to monitor a suite of Key Risk 
Indicators with associated triggers and 
limits against the Group risk appetite. 

The ongoing focus on monitoring and 
reporting customer outcome risks 
continues with the Committee reviewing 
the Group Conduct Risk Framework 
(aligned with the ERMF). The Committee 
also received updates on the Group 
Minimum Standards which continue 
to be enhanced and embedded. 

The Committee has spent time on 
key risks that affect the Group as well 
as reviewing the management and 
outcomes of notable risk events reported 
during the year.

Capital management: The Committee 
has reviewed the Group’s proposed 
dividend level, capital plan and capital 
buffer in line with the Capital Policy. 
The review considered the expected 
impact on the Group’s solvency ratio 
due to a range of different sensitivities, 
and stress and scenario tests. The Group 
continues to make use of Undertaking 
Specific Parameters (USPs) in Admiral 
Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited (AIGL) and 
the Volatility Adjustment (VA) in AIGL and 
its UK insurance entity, Admiral Insurance 
Company Limited (AICL). The Committee 
discussed the capital add-on, and received 
updates on the process and outcome 
during the year. 

“The Group Board is of 
the view that the Group’s 
risk management and 
internal control systems 
have operated effectively 
during the year.”

Jean Park retired from the Board and all of her Committee 
memberships on 20 January 2023.

The Committee held eight scheduled 
meetings, with an additional meeting also 
taking place.

Economic uncertainty: The Committee 
has reviewed and continues to monitor 
the Group’s solvency and liquidity 
positions in response to market volatility 
and wider economic uncertainty, 
considering factors such as changes in 
inflation, the wider impact of supply chain 
disruption, banking events, high interest 
rates, and the pressures on individual 
household finances. 

Consumer Duty: The Committee received 
regular updates on the delivery of 
Consumer Duty implementation during 
2023. Since the Duty came into effect in 
July 2023, the Committee has continued 
to receive regular updates, focusing on 
how the Duty is embedding and on the 
delivery of good customer outcomes.

Climate change: The Committee has 
received updates on the work being 
undertaken relating to climate change to 
ensure that Admiral is meeting current 
requirements and is appropriately 
preparing to meet future challenges. 
These updates include commentary 
on risk management, ongoing climate-
related strategic developments, and 
the changes that may be necessary for 
compliance with emerging regulatory 
requirements. This is further described 
in the Viability Statement (page 109), 
and additional information on Admiral’s 
approach to climate change can be found 
in the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (page 73). 

Geopolitical instability: The Committee 
has been apprised of geopolitical 
developments over the course of the 
year. In particular, the Committee has 
considered the effects of the 2022 Russian 
invasion of Ukraine, which continues 
to drive cost of living pressures and 
put supply chains under strain, and the 
added uncertainty from the more recent 
Israel-Hamas conflict. The Committee 
has also considered potential exposure to 
disruption in the global electric vehicle 
(EV) manufacturing industry, which is 
dominated by China, if a geopolitical 
conflict were to develop between China 
and Taiwan or the United States.

Material projects and change 
programmes: As a result of the 
Committee’s oversight of individual 
Group entities, combined with the 
oversight afforded by the Group’s project 
governance framework, the Committee 
has considered and challenged updates 

relating to material projects and change 
programmes within the Group, including 
those designed to accelerate existing 
products. The Guidewire migrations in 
the Group have been the topic of focused 
sessions at GRC, in particular to ensure 
consideration of the published lessons 
learnt from an incident at a peer.

Technology and information security: 
The level of oversight of technology 
risks including operational resilience has 
continued to increase over the year with 
regular reporting and discussion of the 
risk position at GRC. The Committee 
has received regular updates on 
relevant topics including the future 
technology strategy.

People risk and risk culture: The 
Committee has considered the potential 
impact on people and culture when 
reviewing strategic decisions. In addition, 
a number of the Key Risk Indicators and 
supporting commentary are focused on 
people risk.

Progress of Admiral internal model 
(AIM): The Group Risk Committee and 
Board have maintained their focus in 
relation to the Admiral internal model 
during 2023, and have continued to 
receive regular reporting to help drive 
key decisions in relation to the model. 
The UK Car model has been updated in 
2023 to address limitations identified 
during prior independent validation 
reviews. This will help to ensure that the 
model is well placed to support a planned 
regulatory pre-application. The new UK 
Car model will be subject to another 
cycle of independent validation to ensure 
that the updates have been successfully 
implemented prior to the pre-application 
regulatory submission. In parallel, the 
project is continuing a programme to 
expand the model to produce Solvency 
Capital Requirements for Admiral Group, 
AIGL and AICL and to expand its scope 
to include UK Household, UK Van, 
Travel and Pet products. This expanded 
scope partial internal model will be the 
basis of a regulatory full application. 
Regular communications with the PRA 
and GFSC are being held both at senior 
management and project levels to align 
delivery for the pre-application and full-
application regulatory reviews.

Group Minimum Standards Framework 
and required standards

•  Reviewing compliance with Group 
policies, including the Group’s 
Reinsurance Policy, Group ORSA Policy, 
and Group Underwriting Policy

•  Reviewing the proposed risk-based 

adjustments to remuneration for senior 
managers and making subsequent

transactions and/or strategic proposals, 
and the Taskforce on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures. 

The Committee Chair reports formally 
to the Board on the Committee’s 
proceedings after each meeting, 
on all matters within its duties and 
responsibilities, as set out in previously 
circulated minutes to the Board. 
The Committee Chair also reports on the 
activities of the Committee in a formal 
written report that is submitted to and 
discussed by the Board annually.

The work of the Committee is supported 
by more detailed work undertaken by 
subsidiary Boards and/or executive 
Risk Management Committees in each 
of the Group’s operational entities. 
At each meeting, the Risk Management 
Committees consider notable: 
movements in the operation’s risk 
profile; risk events; and emerging risks. 
Risk Management Committees also assess 

and monitor regulatory issues, ensuring 
that their resolution and the actions 
taken are appropriately recorded. The Risk 
Management Committees receive 
regular information on Conduct Risk, 
such as complaint handling reports and 
other related management information. 
The Group Risk Management function 
reviews and collates information from 
across the Group for consideration by 
the Committee.

In addition, to ensure that the Committee 
is operating effectively, it conducts a 
periodic review of its performance (last 
reviewed in November 2023) and at 
least annually reviews its constitution 
and terms of reference (last reviewed 
in December 2023). Any changes it 
considers necessary are recommended 
to the Group Board for approval. As part 
of the Committee’s annual review of 
its own performance and processes, 
all Committee members and regular 
attendees were invited to complete an 
online evaluation designed to provide 
objective assessment of the Committee’s 
performance, including its effectiveness.

The Committee discussed the results 
of the review at its meeting in January 
2024 and concluded that, overall, the 
Committee remained effective with 
feedback from the Committee being 
largely positive. Areas of focus and 
improvement for the Committee in 2024 
included greater focus on change risk 
and further examination of the business’s 
ability to manage key/strategic risks. 

Summary of key Group Risk

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board of Directors confirms that it 
has performed a robust assessment of 
the Group’s principal and emerging risks. 
These risks, along with explanations 
of how they are being managed and 
mitigated, are included in the Strategic 
Report, page 98.

Information on how key risk drivers have 
impacted on the Group’s principal risks 
has been included within the Viability 
Statement, page 109. 

171

Risk management and internal 
control systems
The system of risk management and 
internal control over Admiral’s insurance, 
operational, market, credit and group 
risk is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and breaches of 
risk appetites. 

Furthermore, risk management can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. The Group Board is ultimately 
responsible for the Group’s system of 
risk management and internal control 
and the Group Audit Committee (GAC) 
has reviewed the effectiveness of this 
system (a summary of GAC duties and 
responsibilities, as well as key GAC 
activities in 2023 is available on page 161.

The Group Board is of the view: that there 
is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the Group’s risks 
and internal controls; that it has been in 
place for the year ended 31 December 
2023 and that it has operated effectively; 
and that, up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts, it is regularly 
reviewed by the Group Board and accords 
with the internal control guidance 
for Directors provided in the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 

The Group Board confirms that it has 
performed a robust assessment of the 
Group’s principal and emerging risks. 
These risks, along with explanations 
of how they are being managed and 
mitigated, are included in the strategic 
report on page 98, with key risk drivers 
impacting Admiral’s principal risks and 
uncertainties being further discussed 
in the Viability Statement on page 
109. The Group Board is responsible for 
determining the nature and extent of 
the principal risks it is willing to take 
in achieving its strategic objectives. 
This assessment supports the Group 
Board in monitoring the integrity of the 
Group’s reported financial statements.

The Group Board meets at least seven 
times a year to discuss the direction of 
the Group and to provide oversight of the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems. 

The Group Board has delegated the 
development, implementation and 
maintenance of the Group’s overall risk 
management framework to the Group 
Risk Committee (GRC). The GRC reports 
on its activities to the Group Board and 
the GAC, supporting the overall opinion 
provided by the GAC that the Group’s 
internal control, risk management 
and compliance systems continue to 
operate effectively.

The Group Board has delegated to the 
GAC the review of the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
financial controls, and internal control and 
risk management systems.

The Group operates a “three lines 
of defence” approach to Risk and 
Internal Control.

1st Line of Defence: The Group 
Board recognises that the day-to-day 
responsibility for implementing policies 
for risk identification, assessment 
and management lies with the senior 
management, whose operational 
decisions must take into account risk and 
how it can be controlled effectively.

2nd Line of Defence: The “second line of 
defence” is led by the Group Chief Risk 
and Compliance Officer and comprises 
the Corporate Governance functions and 
Committees that are in place to provide 
oversight of the effective operation of the 
internal control framework. The Corporate 
Governance functions facilitate the 
oversight and operation of the Group 
Policy Framework and Group Minimum 
Standards, covering risk management and 
controls for all notable risks to the Group. 
The Corporate Governance functions 
perform second line reviews, including 
reviews of the capital modelling and 
business planning processes to support 
the Group Board’s assessment of the 
Group’s ongoing viability. Regular reviews 
of risks are undertaken in conjunction 
with senior management, with the 
results of these reviews recorded in risk 
registers and reported to the appropriate 
governance forums and Boards. 

3rd Line of Defence: The “third line of 
defence” comprises the independent 
assurance provided by the Group Internal 
Audit function, overseen by the GAC. 
Internal Audit undertakes a programme 
of risk-based audits covering all aspects 
of both the first and second lines of 
defence. The findings from these 
audits are reported to all three lines, i.e. 
Management, the Executive and oversight 
Committees, and the GAC.

The Subsidiary Boards, GRC, and entity 
Risk Committees receive reports setting 
out key performance and risk indicators 
and consider possible control issues 
brought to their attention by early 
warning mechanisms that are embedded 
within the operational units. They, 
together with the GAC, also receive 
regular reports from the Internal Audit 
function, which include recommendations 
for improvement of the control and 
operational environments.

The Chair of the GRC provides a written 
report to the Group Board of the activities 
carried out by the Committee on an 
annual basis (a summary of GRC duties 
and responsibilities, as well as key GRC 
activities in 2023 is available on page 168). 
In addition, the Group Board receives 
regular reports throughout the year from 
the Chairs of the GRC and GAC as to their 
activities, together with copies of the 
minutes from Subsidiary Board meetings, 
the GRC and the GAC. 

The GAC’s ability to provide an opinion 
to the Group Board depends on the 
provision of periodic and independent 
confirmation, primarily by Group Internal 
Audit, that the controls established by 
Management are operating effectively 
and where necessary provides a high-
level challenge to the steps being 
taken by the GRC to implement the risk 
management strategy.

Remuneration Committee Report

Ensuring
OUR PEOPLE  
ARE SUPPORTED

Dear Shareholder,

On behalf of the 
Remuneration Committee, 
I am delighted to present 
the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 
31 December 2023.

I would like to thank shareholders for 
supporting Admiral’s Annual Report 
on Remuneration at the April 2023 AGM 
with a vote of 88.5%. I look forward 
to welcoming you at our AGM in 2024 
and to your continued support.

2023 business context 
2023 has been a landmark year for 
the Group, celebrating thirty years 
in business, however, it has not 
been without its challenges – both 
macroeconomic and geopolitical.

As Milena has made clear in her statement 
this year, we have continued to deliver 
the right products and service to our 
customers. This is evidenced in 6% growth 
in customer numbers and profit of £443m, 
a solid performance given the challenging 
context. We have been able to deliver 
this performance due to reacting quickly 
and navigating the changing market 
conditions well.

During 2023 we have continued to ensure 
that our people are supported through 
the ongoing cost-of-living challenges. 
We are clear that the continuing success 
of Admiral is possible due to the hard work 
and dedication of the people who work 
for us, and we will continue to ensure they 
are supported for the year ahead.

1.  Justine Roberts joined the Remuneration Committee on 

31 January 2023, she missed two meetings to pre-existing 
engagements made prior to her joining the Committee.

2.  Karen Green was appointed to the Remuneration 

Committee on 2 October 2023.

Remuneration for 2023
Taking into account the approved 
remuneration structure and Admiral’s 
business performance, the Committee 
made the following decisions during 2023.

2021–23 Discretionary Free Shares 
Scheme (DFSS)
Based on our performance for the period 
2021-2023, 43.76% and 43.73% of the 
DFSS award granted in 2021 will vest to 
Milena Mondini de Focatiis and Geraint 
Jones, respectively. This is the lowest 
vesting performance in recent times.

As the 2021 DFSS awards were granted 
during the pandemic period, we needed 
to consider whether windfall gains have 
occurred, as this was a period where share 
prices were generally lower than prior 
years for most companies. The Committee 
is satisfied that no such windfall occurred 
on the basis that the share price at 
the end of the performance period is 
materially lower than the grant price, 
and that DFSS awards are allocated as a 
fixed number of shares, as opposed to a 
percentage of salary.

The full details of the vesting outcomes 
are on page 187.

2023 DFSS bonus
Milena Mondini de Focatiis and Geraint 
Jones will receive a DFSS bonus of 
£296,071 and £172,676 respectively. 
This bonus is equivalent to dividends 
which would have been paid during 
the year on all outstanding DFSS and 
salary shares awarded, but not yet 
vested, plus a 6.43% adjustment for 
performance against a scorecard of 
Non-Financial Metrics. In addition, the 
DFSS bonus is subject to a potential 
downward adjustment to take account 
of any risk events considered to have a 
material customer, regulatory or financial 
impact. For this year there were no such 
risk adjustments. The full details of the 
DFSS bonus calculations are on page 189.

“We are recommending 
policy changes which  
we believe make 
the Executive Directors’  
packages more competitive, 
while reinforcing the 
strong alignment with 
shareholders’ interests and 
maintaining fairness of 
reward approach to reinforce 
Admiral’s unique culture.”

2023 DFSS award
On 28 September 2023, Milena Mondini 
de Focatiis was granted an award of 
90,000 shares and Geraint Jones was 
granted an award of 52,500 shares 
under the DFSS. Using the share price 
on the date of the grant of £23.72, 
this is the equivalent to £2,134,800 
or 290% of Milena’s base salary and 
£1,245,300 or 287% of Geraint’s base 
salary respectively. 

The awards will vest based on: 

•  EPS - 26.67% weighting; 

•  TSR vs. FTSE 350 (excluding investment 

companies) – 26.67% weighting; 

•  RoE – 26.67% weighting; and 

•  the average outcomes of the scorecards 
of Non-Financial Metrics used to assess 
DFSS bonus adjustments over the 
performance period – 20% weighting. 

There will also be the potential for 
downwards adjustment subject to an 
assessment which will take account of 
risk events considered to have a material 
customer, regulatory or financial impact 
over the course of the performance 
period. Further details can be found 
on page 187. 

2024 Remuneration Policy review
The Remuneration Policy was last 
approved by shareholders at the 2021 
AGM, effective for a maximum of three 
years. Consequently, the Committee is 
seeking shareholder support for a revised 
Remuneration Policy at the 2024 AGM. 

In arriving at the planned changes to 
the Remuneration Policy the Committee 
sought to maintain the positioning of 
fixed pay towards the lower end of the 
market while ensuring that the variable 
elements would deliver significant extra 
reward for outperformance. The Chair 
of the Committee consulted extensively 
with shareholders, who were generally 
very supportive of the changes. 

There are three proposed changes 
to highlight:

•  Annual bonus – we propose to remove 
the DFSS Cash bonus in favour of an 
annual bonus plan. The maximum 
bonus potential for the Executive 
Directors is proposed to be 200% of 
base pay, with 40% of any bonus earned 
being deferred into shares for a period 
of three years. Bonus payments will 
be subject to potential downwards 
adjustments to take account of risk 
events, and are subject to malus 
and clawback provisions, in line with 
the Group’s Malus and Clawback 
Framework. Full details of the plan can 
be found on page 193.

•  Pension – there is no change proposed 

to the contribution rate (which is 
consistent with that available to UK 
employees), but we propose the 
removal of the absolute cap on the 
amount of Company contributions.

•  Dividend equivalent on unvested 
DFSS and invested annual bonus 
share awards – we propose to give 
the Committee the flexibility to apply 
dividend equivalent shares to the 
Executive Directors’ unvested awards. 
This would only be deployed for 
Executive Directors if it were also being 
applied across the whole population 
who receive DFSS awards.

2024 remuneration arrangements
Executive Director remuneration 
arrangements for 2024 will operate in 
line with the 2024 Remuneration Policy, 
subject to shareholder vote.

We propose to increase Milena Mondini 
de Focatiis’ salary by 4.97% to £774,000 
and Geraint Jones’ salary by 7.27% to 
£465,000, effective from 1 January 2024. 
For Milena, this increase is in line with 
the proposed base pay changes across 
the UK workforce of the Group, where 
we anticipate the average increase for 
colleagues to be of the order of 5% as we 
continue to support our people through 
the impact of the high inflationary 
environment. For Geraint, the increase 

begins to address the competitiveness 
of his base pay relative to the lower 
quartile of the market. The Remuneration 
Committee intends to increase his salary 
to the lower quartile of the market by the 
end of this policy period, in increments. 
The Remuneration Committee will review 
his increase each year to ensure it is 
appropriate and moves his positioning 
as intended. This means that the increase 
for Geraint may be ahead of those 
generally given to colleagues for the 
duration of the policy.

We propose that Milena Mondini de 
Focatiis be granted an award of 95,000 
shares and Geraint Jones be granted 
an award of 55,000 shares under the 
DFSS for 2024. The Committee will review 
these awards prior to the September 
grant date to ensure the quantum 
remains appropriate.

The Committee reviewed the metrics 
that will apply to DFSS and Annual Bonus 
awards for 2024. Further details are shown 
on page 191.

In summary
The proposed Remuneration Policy will 
be put to shareholders at the AGM in 
2024 and is subject to a binding vote. 
Both the Committee and the Board 
strongly believe that the proposed 
Remuneration Policy will continue to 
serve the Group’s strategic ambitions and 
incentivise executives to create value for 
our shareholders. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration (subject to an advisory 
vote) will also be put to a shareholder vote 
at the AGM. The Committee and I hope 
that you vote in favour of both the report 
and policy. I am happy to discuss our 
Remuneration Policy and Annual Report 
on Remuneration with shareholders.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy

Compliance Statement
This Remuneration Report has been prepared according to the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), Regulation 11 
and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2018, the 
Companies (Directors’ Remuneration Policy and Directors’ Remuneration Report) Regulations 2019 and other relevant requirements 
of the FCA Listing Rules. In addition, the Board has adopted the principles of good corporate governance set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) and the guidelines issued by its leading shareholders and bodies such as ISS, the Investment Association, 
and the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association. 

Unless otherwise stated, information contained within this Remuneration Report is unaudited. 

The following Remuneration Policy (the “2024 Policy”) will come into effect, subject to shareholder approval, from the April 2024 AGM. 
The policy table below summarises the changes from the Remuneration Policy approved at the 2021 AGM (the 2021 Policy). 

Key Principles of Admiral Remuneration Arrangements
The Group is committed to maximising shareholder value over time in a way that also promotes effective risk management, excellent 
customer outcomes while ensuring that there is a strong link between performance and reward. This is reflected in the Group’s stated 
Remuneration Policy of paying competitive, performance-linked and shareholder-aligned total remuneration packages. These comprise 
basic salaries coupled with participation in performance-based share schemes to generate competitive total reward packages for 
superior performance. 

This policy has been reviewed in 2023 as part of the usual three-year cycle and will be put to a shareholder vote at the 2024 AGM.

The Board is satisfied that this revised policy continues to meet the objectives of attracting and retaining high quality executives  
across the Group.

The Committee reviews the remuneration framework and packages of the Executive Directors and senior managers and recognises the 
need to ensure that the Remuneration Policy is firmly linked to the Group’s strategy, including its risk management approach. In setting 
the Policy and making remuneration decisions, the Committee takes into account pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group. The main 
principles underlying the Remuneration Policy are:

•  Competitive total package – the Group aims to deliver total remuneration packages that are market-competitive, taking into account 

the role, job size, responsibility, and the individual’s performance and effectiveness. Prevailing market and economic conditions 
and developments in governance are also considered, as are general salary levels throughout the organisation. There is sufficient 
opportunity within the variable pay of Executive Directors to reward outstanding levels of performance, taking into account the 
market context, with upper quartile remuneration outcomes;

•  Significantly share-based – our base salaries are typically targeted towards the lower end of market but are combined with 
meaningful annual share awards that vest on long-term performance to ensure strong alignment with shareholders and the 
long-term interests of the Group. Executives are also encouraged to build up significant shareholdings in the Group to maximise 
shareholder alignment;

•  Long-term perspective – a significant part of senior executives’ remuneration is based on the achievement of appropriate but 

stretching performance targets that support the delivery of the Group’s strategy and shareholder value. The extended performance 
and vesting horizons promote a long-term perspective that is appropriate to the insurance sector; 

•  Effective risk management – incentives are designed to ensure they do not encourage excessive risk-taking. They are aligned with the 

delivery of positive customer outcomes and reinforce the Group’s risk policy;

•  Open and honest culture – the Group has a strong culture of focussing on collective success, whilst recognising individual contribution 

to the Group’s performance, and this is reflected in our remuneration structure across the business; and

•  Transparency for stakeholders – the remuneration structure is designed to be easy to understand, and all aspects are openly 

communicated to employees, shareholders, and regulators.

Remuneration Policy table
This table describes the key components of the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors.

Purpose and link to strategy

Operation

Opportunity and performance metrics

Base Salary 
To attract and retain 
talent by setting 
base salaries at levels 
appropriate for the 
business.

Salaries are reviewed annually or 
following a significant change 
in responsibilities.

Salary levels/increases take account of:

•  Scope and responsibility of 

the position.

•  Individual performance and 

effectiveness, and experience of the 
individual in the role.

•  Average increase awarded across 

the Group.

Pension 
To provide retirement 
benefits.

The Group operates a Personal Pension 
Plan, a Defined Contribution Scheme. 
This is available to all employees 
following completion of their 
probationary period.

Any salary increases are applied in line with 
the outcome of the review.

For current Executive Directors, that 
increases in cash salary will not normally 
exceed the increase for the general 
employee population over the term of this 
Policy. More significant increases may be 
awarded in certain circumstances including, 
but not limited to: where there has been a 
significant increase in role size or complexity, 
to apply salary progression for a newly 
appointed Executive Director, or where 
the Executive Director’s salary has fallen 
significantly behind market.

Where increases are awarded in excess of 
that for the general employee population, 
the Committee will provide the rationale 
in the relevant year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration.

Executive Directors may receive an employer 
contribution consistent with that received 
by UK employees (currently matched 
contribution up to 6% of base salary)  
or the equivalent value in cash. Base salary  
is the only element of remuneration that 
 is pensionable.

The pension provision and rules are the same 
for Executive Directors and the main body  
of UK staff.

Changes

No changes.

No change to 
contribution rate 
(which is consistent 
with that available 
to UK employees) 
but the absolute 
GBP cap has 
been removed.

Other Benefits 
To provide competitive 
benefits.

Includes (but not limited to):

Benefits may vary by role. 

No changes.

•  Death in service scheme

•  Private medical cover

•  Permanent health insurance

•  Relocation, at the 

Committee’s discretion

All benefits are non-pensionable

None of the existing Executive Directors 
received total taxable benefits exceeding 
5% of base salary during the most recent 
financial year, and it is not anticipated that 
the cost of benefits provided will exceed this 
level over the term of this Policy.

The Committee retains the discretion 
to approve a higher cost in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g., relocation), or in 
circumstances driven by factors outside the 
Company’s control (e.g., material increases in 
healthcare insurance premiums).

Maximum annual bonus potential for 
Executive Directors is 200% of base salary.

For a Threshold level of performance, 
a bonus of 25% of the maximum 
potential award is payable and for target 
performance 50% of maximum is payable.

The annual bonus is 
a new arrangement 
which will replace 
the previous 
DFFS Bonus 
arrangement.

Bonuses will be based on a combination of 
financial and non-financial performance 
targets. The Committee has the ability to 
determine the relevant metrics, weightings 
and targets each year based on evolving 
business priorities.

Discretionary Free 
Share Scheme (DFSS) 
To motivate and 
reward longer term 
performance, aid 
long term retention 
of key executive 
talent, use capital 
efficiently, grow profits 
sustainably and 
further strengthen 
the alignment of 
the interests of 
shareholders and staff.

Annual Bonus 
To motivate and 
reward the delivery of 
stretching near-term 
financial and non-
financial targets 
based on the  
business strategy.

Bonus payments are determined after 
the year end and will be based on 
performance achieved against targets 
over the financial year.

40% of any bonus will be deferred into 
shares for a period of three years, with 
the remaining portion paid in cash. 
Any bonus earned is non-pensionable. 
Where any bonus is deferred, dividend 
equivalent shares may be accrued on 
awards during the deferral period, only 
receivable on shares which vest at the 
end of the period.

Bonus payouts are subject to a 
potential downwards adjustment 
based on an assessment of risk events 
considered to have a significant 
customer, regulatory or financial 
impact over the course of the 
performance period. 

Bonus payouts are subject to malus 
and clawback provisions, i.e., forfeiture 
or reduction of unvested awards and 
recovery of vested awards. Events 
which may lead to the application 
of malus and clawback are set out 
in the Group’s Malus and Clawback 
Framework and include material 
financial misstatement, responsibility 
for conduct which results in 
significant losses, material failure 
of risk management, misconduct, 
reputational damage and  
corporate failure. 

The Remuneration Committee has 
discretion to adjust the formulaic 
vesting outcome to ensure the final 
outcome is a fair and true reflection  
of underlying business performance, 
both financial and non-financial.

No changes other 
than providing 
flexibility for 
dividend equivalent 
shares to be 
provided.

Maximum opportunity: A maximum face 
value on award of 500% of base salary 
applies. Threshold performance will result 
in vesting of up to 25% of the maximum 
award.

DFSS shares are granted as a fixed number 
of shares (subject to the quantum limits of 
the plan, as described above). The number 
granted is reviewed and may be adjusted 
by the Committee, for example, if there 
has been a significant change in share price. 
Vesting of DFSS awards is subject to the 
Group’s performance over a three-year 
performance period. The performance 
measures may include EPS growth, ROE, 
relative TSR and a scorecard of non-financial 
metrics selected by the Committee. 
Details of the measures, weightings and 
performance targets used for specific DFSS 
grants are included in the relevant year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.

Executive Directors may be granted 
awards annually at the discretion of  
the Committee. 

Awards may be in the form of nil or 
nominal priced options or conditional 
shares. Awards are normally granted 
on an annual basis and vest after a 
minimum of three years subject to 
Group performance and continued 
employment.

A two-year holding period applies 
to vested awards, during which time 
Executive Directors may not sell 
 the vested awards except to cover  
tax liabilities.

Awards are subject to a potential 
downwards adjustment based on an 
assessment of risk events considered  
to have a material customer, regulatory 
or financial impact over the course of 
the performance period.

Awards are subject to malus and 
clawback provisions, i.e., forfeiture or 
reduction of unvested awards and 
recovery of vested awards. Events 
which may lead to the application 
of malus and clawback are set out 
in the Group’s Malus and Clawback 
Framework and include material 
financial misstatement, responsibility 
for conduct which results in significant 
losses, material failure of risk 
management, misconduct, reputational 
damage, and corporate failure.

The Remuneration Committee has 
discretion to adjust the formulaic 
vesting outcome to ensure the final 
outcome is a fair and true reflection of 
underlying business performance, both 
financial and non-financial.

Dividend equivalent shares may be 
accrued on awards during the vesting 
period, only receivable on shares which 
vest at the end of the period.

Approved Free Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP) 
To encourage share 
ownership across all 
employees, using HMRC 
approved schemes for 
eligible UK employees.

All eligible UK employees participate 
in the SIP after completing a minimum 
of 12 months’ service. Grants are 
made twice a year based on the 
results of each half year and vest after 
three years subject to continued 
employment.

The SIP is an all-employee scheme and 
Executive Directors participate on the same 
terms as other employees. The acquisition 
of shares is therefore not subject to the 
satisfaction of a performance target.
Maximum opportunity is in line with  
HMRC limits.

No changes.

The Committee is satisfied that the above Remuneration Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive 
risk-taking. The Committee retains discretion to make changes required to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements and other non-
significant changes to the Remuneration Policy without reverting to shareholders.

Notes to the Remuneration Policy table
Payments from Existing Awards
Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the 2024 
Remuneration Policy. This includes all outstanding awards under the previous 2018 and 2021 Remuneration Policies, or any awards made 
prior to appointment to the Board. Details of any such payments will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.

Selection of Performance Measures
Vesting under the DFSS is linked to the following financial measures: EPS growth, ROE, and relative TSR. 

EPS growth has been selected as a performance measure as the Committee feels it is a strong indicator of both long-term shareholder 
return and the underlying financial performance of the business. It is transparent and highly visible to executives. 

ROE has been selected as the Committee believes that a returns metric reinforces the focus on capital efficiency and delivery of strong 
returns for our shareholders, thereby further strengthening the alignment of incentives with Admiral’s strategy. 

Relative TSR has been selected to reflect value creation for Admiral’s shareholders as compared to comparative alternative investments. 

Since the 2019 award, vesting of DFSS awards is also linked to non-financial measures which may include strategic, customer and other 
measures. The Committee believes that the additional emphasis on these measures reinforces Admiral’s focus on our customers and 
on other non-financial Group priorities, whilst also more clearly demonstrating alignment of Group remuneration practices with the 
requirements of Solvency II.

The specific performance measures and their respective weightings for each DFSS award may vary to reflect the strategic priorities at 
the time of the award.

For the annual bonus, forward-looking performance measures, weightings and targets are selected near the start of the year covering 
financial and non-financial measures to align with the Group’s strategic objectives. 

Performance targets are set taking into account the Company’s strategic priorities and the economic environment in which the 
Company operates. The Committee believes the performance targets are stretching and motivational, and that maximum outcomes are 
available only for outstanding performance.

Remuneration Policy for Other Employees
The Company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the role size, complexity, 
experience required, individual performance and pay levels in comparable companies.

In general, the Remuneration Policy which applies to other senior executives is consistent with that for Executive Directors. 
Remuneration is typically linked to Company and individual performance in a way that reinforces shareholder value creation.

Around 4,300 employees from across the Group, including the Executive Directors, participate in the DFSS. The Committee determines 
DFSS awards for those executives within its remit and on an aggregate basis for all other participants in the DFSS. For the Executive 
Directors, all DFSS share awards are subject to performance conditions. For other senior managers and employees, a proportion of awards 
(ranging from half to two-thirds) are subject to performance, with performance conditions either in line with those described above 
or set based on key performance drivers of the individual’s relevant business unit, and the remainder has no performance conditions 
attached other than the requirement that the recipient remains an employee of the Group at the date of vesting. Award sizes vary by 
organisational level and an assessment of both financial and non-financial performance. 

Most holders of DFSS awards receive a DFSS cash bonus, which is equivalent to the dividend on unvested DFSS share awards. The bonus 
for a number of senior managers is adjusted for performance against a scorecard of customer and other non-financial metrics. 

The Company operates a personal pension scheme which is available to all UK employees once they have completed their probationary 
period. For all employees, including the Executive Directors, the Company matches the employee contribution up to a maximum of 6% 
of salary or provides the equivalent value in cash. 

All UK employees who have served a minimum tenure at Admiral are eligible to participate in the SIP on the same terms. Most overseas 
employees receive an equivalent award to the UK SIP awards and these awards have no performance measures attached.

Service Contracts and Leaver/Change of Control Provisions
The Company’s Policy is to limit payments upon termination of employment to pre-established contractual arrangements. In the event 
that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms 
of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans. Under normal circumstances, 
Executive Directors are entitled to receive termination payments in lieu of notice based on base salary and compensation for loss of 
benefits. The Company has the ability to pay such sums in instalments. The notice period for all Executive Directors is one year.

There is no provision in the Executive Directors’ contracts for compensation to be payable on early termination of their contract over and 
above the notice period element. The Executive Directors’ service contracts are available to view at the Company’s registered office.

When considering termination payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both 
shareholders and participants. The table below summarises how the awards under the DFSS and Annual Bonus scheme are typically 
treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Committee’s discretion.

Fee levels are set by reference to NED fees at 
companies of a similar size and complexity.

In the event that there is a material 
misalignment with the market or a change 
in the complexity, responsibility or time 
commitment required to fulfil a NED role, the 
Board has discretion to make an appropriate 
adjustment to the fee level.

The maximum aggregate annual fee for 
NEDs is capped at the limit provided for 
in the Company’s Articles of Association.

Fees are reviewed annually.

The Group Chair fee is determined by the 
Committee after consultation with the 
Executive Directors. The NED fees are 
determined by the Group Chair together 
with the Executive Directors.

Additional fees are payable for acting as  
Senior Independent Director or as Chair or  
member of a Board Committee and may be  
payable as appropriate in relation to other 
additional responsibilities (e.g., attending 
meetings overseas).

Fees are paid in a mix of cash and Company 
shares for the Company Chair, and in 
cash for other Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board retains discretion to vary the mix 
or determine that fees are paid entirely in  
cash or Company shares.

There are no changes to the 2024 Policy on NED fees from the 2021 version.

Approach to Remuneration Relating to New Executive Director Appointments
External Appointments
When appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee’s policy is to set the remuneration package for a new Executive Director in 
accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy at the time of the appointment.

In determining the appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will consider all relevant factors to ensure that 
arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Where an individual is appointed on an initial base salary that 
is below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of time, subject to the individual’s performance and 
development in the role. This may result in above-average salary increases during this period.

The Committee may also make an award to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the 
Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to the forfeited awards and the likelihood of 
those conditions being met to ensure that the value of the buy-out award is no greater than the fair value of the awards it replaces. 
The Committee may also avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.2 R if appropriate for the buy-out of incentive arrangements (i.e., if the terms of 
participation for the prospective Executive Director are similar to all, or substantially all employees who participate in the plan, then 
approval by ordinary resolution of the shareholders of the listed Company in general meeting is not required).

Internal Appointments
Remuneration for new Executive Directors appointed by way of internal promotion will similarly be determined in line with the Policy for 
external appointees, as detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, 
the Company will continue to honour these arrangements. Incentive opportunities for below-Board employees are typically no higher 
than for Executive Directors, but measures may vary if necessary.

Other Directorships
Executive Directors are permitted to accept appointments as Non-Executive Directors of companies with the prior approval of the Group 
Board. Approval will be given only where the appointment does not present a conflict of interest with the Group’s activities, and where 
the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual. 

Considerations of Conditions Elsewhere in the Group 
The Committee considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining remuneration for 
Executive Directors.

Considerations of Shareholder Views 
When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account best practice guidelines issued by institutional shareholder bodies. 
The Committee is open to feedback from shareholders on the Remuneration Policy. It will continue to monitor trends and developments 
in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the remuneration structure for our Executive Directors remains appropriate.

Considerations of Regulatory Requirements 
The Committee regularly reviews the Remuneration Policy and structure in the context of Solvency II remuneration guidance, and EBA, 
PRA, and FCA expectations regarding the supervision of insurance firms. The Group Chief Risk Officer periodically attends Committee 
meetings as part of this process and provides support to the Committee in understanding any risk-related implications of remuneration 
decisions. Whilst the Remuneration Policy includes several features which help ensure compliance with current regulatory guidance, the 
Committee reserves the discretion to adjust the Remuneration Policy, and its execution, to take into account any developments in such 
regulatory guidance.

Annual Report on Remuneration

This section of the report provides details of how Admiral’s Remuneration Policy was implemented in 2023 and 
how the Remuneration Committee intends to implement the proposed Remuneration Policy in 2024 (subject to 
shareholder approval).

Remuneration Committee Membership in 2023
The Board sets the Group’s Remuneration Policy and, through the authority delegated to it by the Board, the Committee is responsible 
for making recommendations to the Board on the implementation of the Remuneration Policy. Its remit includes recommending 
the remuneration of the Group Board Chair and the Executive Directors; approving the remuneration of senior management; and 
determining the composition of and awards made under the performance-related incentive schemes.

At the end of 2023 the Committee comprised Evelyn Bourke, Michael Brierley, Justine Roberts and Karen Green. The Committee had 
seven scheduled meetings and it also held a number of ad hoc/late notice meetings to deal with specific issues in a timely manner.

The Group Chair, CEO, CFO and CRO are invited to meetings where the Committee considers it appropriate to obtain their advice on 
Group strategy and performance and senior executive pay strategy. The Group CEO typically attends all meetings. No director is involved 
in deciding their own remuneration outcome. The members of the Committee do not have any personal financial interests (other than 
shareholdings), or any conflicts, that relate to the business of the Committee. The Committee members do not have any day-to-day 
involvement in the running of the Group.

Committee activities
During the year ended 31 December 2023, in addition to its regular activities, the Committee also:

•  Reviewed and proposed revisions to the Remuneration Policy in anticipation of the upcoming binding vote by shareholders at the AGM 

in 2024; 

•  Reviewed the implementation of a set of group-wide non-financial performance measures for the DFSS;

•  Reviewed the performance ranges for the financial measures for the 2023 DFSS; and

•  Reviewed the design of annual incentives as part of the ongoing work on the Group’s reward strategy.

As mentioned in the Governance Report, during the year ended 31 December 2023, the Committee also performed its regular activities:

•  Reviewed the DFSS vesting and bonus arrangements for Executive Directors, senior management and relevant staff (Material Risk 

Takers) covered under Solvency II;

•  Reviewed Admiral’s Gender Pay Gap reporting statistics;

•  Reviewed risk events and their impact on variable pay;

•  Undertook an evaluation of the Committee’s performance during the year;

•  Reviewed the Committee’s terms of reference;

•  Reviewed the Group’s Malus and Clawback Framework; and

•  Reviewed external remuneration trends and market conditions.

Remuneration topics were discussed with employees at the Employee Consultation Group (ECG), which met four times over the year. 
Key themes discussed at the ECG were: Executive Director compensation, Real Living Wage, the ongoing cost of living crisis, employee 
benefits and changes to the HMRC dividend allowance.

On 1 March 2024, the Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Group Head of Reward met with the ECG to discuss the remuneration 
for the Executive Directors and the proposed changes to the 2024 Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The detail of the Policy was be covered 
in depth, with time set aside for members of the ECG to give feedback and ask any questions they felt were relevant. There was some 
good discussion about how the remuneration for Executive Directors linked to wider colleague pay. 

Shareholder engagement on the 2024 Directors’ Remuneration Policy
In October of 2023, we wrote to our top 35 shareholders, outlining the proposed changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and 
the rationale for the changes. This distribution covered around 70% of the shareholder base. Our brokers considered this level of 
engagement to be very thorough. We consulted with our brokers on the list and overall coverage before issuing the letter.

The Committee Chair held follow up meetings with eight investors, received with written responses from two shareholders, and ‘no need 
to meet or positive’ responses from a further five. A further meeting was held in February 2024 with one investor. Additionally, a letter 
was issued to the four main proxy agencies, with meetings happening in January and February 2024.

The overall summary of the feedback from shareholders shows broad support for the policy changes which are being proposed. 
There was a good deal of feedback focusing on the implementation of the policy changes, including ensuring that measures and targets 
in the DFSS and new Annual Bonus Plan are relevant and stretching. Shareholders commented on the distinctive culture of Admiral with 
its high level of share ownership and wanted assurance that the Policy would not lead to unfairness between Executive Directors and the 
wider population. This has been taken into consideration.

Committee effectiveness review
As part of the Committee’s annual review of its performance and processes, each Committee member and regular attendee completed 
a questionnaire designed to assess the Committee’s performance, including the activities and general operation of the Committee. 
The Committee discussed the results of the review at its meeting in December 2023 and concluded that, overall, the Committee 
remained effective. 

To help improve its performance over the coming year, the Committee highlighted the importance of discussing key issues in a timely 
fashion and getting management engagement earlier to ensure sufficient time for management to change direction where needed or 
implement a new plan. It was noted that Committee support had improved.

Advisors to the Committee
During the year, to enable the Committee to reach informed decisions, we obtained advice on market data and trends from independent 
consultants Willis Towers Watson (WTW). WTW reported directly to the Committee Chair and are signatories to and abide by the Code of 
Conduct for Remuneration Consultants (which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). WTW also provided advice to 
the Company on capital modelling, claims metrics, and pricing.

The fees paid to WTW for work supporting the Committee in 2023 (based on time and materials) totalled £75,818.

The Committee undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure that advisors remain independent of the Company and that the advice 
provided is impartial and objective. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by WTW is independent.

 DFSS: the value at vesting of shares vesting on performance over the three-year periods ending 31 December 2023 and 31 December 
2022. For the 2023 figures, given that vesting occurs after the 2023 Directors’ Remuneration Report is finalised, the figures are based 
on the average share price in the last three months of 2023 of £25.69. The 2022 figures have been trued up based on the actual 
share price on vesting of £22.62 for Milena Mondini de Focatiis and £23.92 for Geraint Jones. For 2023, unfavourable movements 
of -£348,942 and -£203,408 are included in the DFSS value, attributable to a decrease in the share price over the vesting period for 
Milena Mondini de Focatiis and Geraint Jones, respectively. For 2022, an increase of £9,567 of the DFSS value is attributable to share 
price appreciation over the vesting period for Milena Mondini de Focatiis. For Geraint Jones, a decrease of £100,981 is attributable 
to share price depreciation over the vesting period. For the purpose of clarity, it should be noted that the awards for the Executive 
Directors were made at different points in 2020, which has led to the difference in these figures.

6. 

 DFSS bonus: the bonus is equivalent to dividends that were paid in respect of the performance year on all outstanding DFSS shares 
awarded but not yet vested. The bonus is paid in two tranches annually: 

i)  for H1 2023: a bonus of £144,778 was paid to Milena Mondini de Focatiis, based on 270,000 unvested shares, a scorecard outcome 

of 105.14% and the interim dividend of 51p per share; and a bonus of £84,454 was paid to Geraint Jones based on 157,500 unvested 
shares and a scorecard outcome of 105.14% and the interim dividend of 51p per share.

ii)  for H2 2023, due for payment in May 2024: a bonus of £148,330 is due to Milena Mondini de Focatiis, based on 270,000 unvested 
shares, a scorecard outcome of 107.72% and the final dividend of 52p per share; and a bonus of £86,526 is due to Geraint Jones 
based on 157,500 unvested shares and a scorecard outcome of 107.72 % and the final dividend of 52p per share.

The payments for H2 2023 are subject to completion of internal governance procedures.

Financial performance outcomes
The performance measures applicable to these awards are, EPS growth, TSR vs. FTSE 350 (excluding investment companies), and ROE, 
weighted equally and all measured over the three-year period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023. 

Over this period there was solid return for our shareholders, with TSR slightly above median vs the FTSE350 benchmark, and with ROE 
of 41.60%. This is in contrast to an EPS growth of -37.7%, which was impacted by the very high EPS for 2020, which was impacted by the 
pandemic period. The combination of these shareholder returns, and EPS growth contributes to a vesting of 37.20% for the financial 
measures. The Committee reviewed this vesting outcome and concluded that it was appropriate.

DFSS bonus for 2023 
In line with the Remuneration Policy, the Group paid a bonus to all holders of DFSS shares in 2023, which was equivalent to the dividend 
payable on all outstanding DFSS shares awarded but not yet vested. The 2023 Bonus for Executive Directors also includes a potential +/- 
20% adjustment to the DFSS bonus based on performance of a set of non-financial performance metrics, which for 2023 was grouped 
into three categories: Strategy, customer and ESG. 

For the customer and ESG strategic pillars, relevant quantitative data was used to assess performance and an outcome was determined. 
For the strategy, the Board members derived a collective view on the progress against the strategic priorities. 

The table below details the Company’s performance against the performance range.

Based on performance and scorecard outcomes the total amount that will vest in September 2024 to Milena Mondini de Focatiis will 
therefore be 43.76% (i.e., 39,384 shares), and the total amount that will vest to Geraint Jones will be 43.73% (i.e., 22,958 shares), subject to 
their continued employment on the vesting date. 

Vested DFSS awards are subject to clawback provisions. Events which may lead to the application of clawback are set out in the Group’s 
Malus and Clawback Framework and include material financial misstatement, responsibility for conduct which results in significant losses,

The Admiral Group Board makes an annual judgment based on its collective view of progress against the stated strategic measures. 
The Board was satisfied that progress against strategic aims continued to be solid, and having reviewed business context and supporting 
data, assessed this progress was worthy of 76.67% of maximum. 

Customer outcome and feedback scoring is measured against entity set targets, with results assessed for each half year. 
Customer outcomes for the UK business improved markedly in H2 2023 to 70% of maximum vs. 20% for H1 2023, as the pressure on 
claims processing and staff numbers eased through the year. Customer feedback was generally steady through the year, with a slight fall 
in outcomes for Admiral Money and Elephant between the half years; Admiral Seguros’ outcomes for H2 fell below threshold, with 0% 
outcome, compared with 55% for H1.

Trust Index scores are measured relative to the benchmark from the Great Place To Work® (GPTW) survey annually, with outcomes 
determined mechanically relative to benchmark. For 2023, the Group’s score was up 1% compared with 2022, moving to 85% from 84%. 
However, the GPTW benchmark score also increased by 1% from 2022 to 87% for 2023. This means that the score remains 2% below the 
benchmark, giving an outcome of 50% for the 2023 performance year.

The Inclusion survey results are scored on a similar basis to the Trust Index, relative to the GPTW benchmark. Scores improved for 2023 in 
comparison to 2022, with all responses coming at or above the benchmark, meaning 100% outcome for this element.

The Diversity measure outcome based on mechanical scoring against set targets – is slightly down on last year due to headcount 
movements, with a year-end position of 35.29%, which equates to an outcome of 75% of maximum.

The overall outcome of the scorecard was assessed as a 105.14% multiplier to the DFSS bonus paid for H1 2023 and a 107.72% multiplier 
to the DFSS bonus for H2 2023 (to be paid in 2024) for Milena Mondini de Focatiis and Geraint Jones.

In addition, the Executive Directors’ DFSS bonus is subject to a further risk adjustment (downwards only) to take account of risk events 
considered to have a material customer, regulatory or financial impact. 

During the year, and in addition to the above, the Committee took into account relevant trigger events as part of the established risk 
adjustment process, and determined it was not appropriate to apply a downwards adjustment on that basis.

DFSS bonus payments are subject to malus and clawback provisions.

Scheme Interests Granted in 2023 (audited)
DFSS
On 28 September 2023, Milena Mondini de Focatiis was granted an award of 90,000 shares and Geraint Jones was granted an award of 
52,500 shares under the DFSS. Using the share price on the date of the grant of £23.72, this is the equivalent to £2,134,800 or 290% of 
Milena’s base salary and £1,245,300 or 287% of Geraint’s base salary respectively. 

The three-year period over which performance will be measured is 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025. The award is eligible to vest on 
the third anniversary of the date of grant i.e., September 2025, subject to performance and to continued employment. Vested awards will 
be subject to an additional two-year post-vest holding period. 

The award will vest on EPS growth, TSR vs. FTSE 350 (excluding investment companies), ROE and a scorecard of strategic, customer 
and other non-financial measures, inclusive of customer outcomes, ESG and strategic measures. There will also be the potential for 
downwards adjustment subject to an assessment of risk events considered to have a material customer, regulatory or financial impact 
over the course of the performance period. The performance conditions are summarised in the table below:

Setting the 2023 DFSS Financial Performance Ranges
The financial performance targets for the 2022 DFSS scheme were changed more significantly than in previous years due to the 
exceptional earnings per share achieved during 2021 and the impact of the Group’s diversification strategy on ROE. The Remuneration 
Committee chair met with a number of shareholders to hear their views. While understanding the unique circumstances of 2020 and 
2021, most shareholders preferred reversion to the target setting approach of the past. The proposed 2023 DFSS financial performance 
targets are set out below:

Earnings Per Share
The EPS measure was changed to an absolute EPS target range for the 2022 DFSS scheme because a growth target was considered 
unsuitable due to the exceptionally high EPS achieved during 2021. Following feedback from shareholders, the proposed target for the 
2023 scheme has reverted to an EPS growth target.

Return on Equity
The 2023 scheme performance range has been set considering the Group’s strategic objective of long-term growth and diversification, 
which is projected to increase equity and result in a flatter ROE over the next few years. Recognising shareholder feedback, the proposed 
ROE targets for the 2023 scheme are more challenging than the 2022 scheme, with higher targets set for threshold, stretch and 
maximum in the performance range, moving from 20-40% for 2022 to 25-45% for 2023.

Total Shareholder Return
TSR is assessed on relative performance and is therefore considered an appropriate measure of the Group’s return to shareholders. 
Consequently, no changes to the measure were proposed for the 2023 scheme.

SIP
In March 2023, Milena Mondini de Focatiis and Geraint Jones were granted awards under the SIP of 95 shares with a face value of 
£1,787.43, which will mature on 13 March 2026, subject to continued employment.

In August 2023 Milena Mondini de Focatiis and Geraint Jones were granted awards under the SIP of 77 shares with a face value of 
£1,817.97, which will mature on 21 August 2026, subject to continued employment.

Exit Payments (audited)
No exit payments were made to an Executive Director during the year.

Payments to Past Directors (audited)
Following stepping down from the role of CEO on 31 December 2020, David Stevens has continued as an adviser to the Group in a part-
time capacity. During 2023, he earned a salary of £60,090.

He also sits as a Non-Executive Director on the Board of Admiral Financial Services Limited for which he receives no fee.

Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2024
Executive Directors
Salary, Pension and Benefits
Salaries for the Executive Directors in 2024 have been determined in line with the proposed Remuneration Policy, subject to shareholder 
approval. Milena Mondini de Focatiis’ salary was increased by 4.97% to £774,000 effective 1 January 2024 and Geraint Jones’ salary was 
increased by 7.27% to £465,000 effective 1 January 2024. 

Consideration was given to ensure these increases are fair relative to the proposed increases for employees across the Group for 2024. 
The average pay review in 2024 is expected to be in the region of 5% as we continue to support our people through the impact of 
the cost of living challenges. The benchmarking of the fixed elements of remuneration for Milena and Geraint indicated that their 
salaries were significantly lower than the lower quartile of peer companies across the FTSE 100 and major UK and European insurers. 
The proposed salary increases are designed to align their salaries more towards the lower quartile of peer salaries.

The Remuneration Committee notes the increase for Geraint Jones is above that which is expected for most colleagues. This increase 
begins to address the competitiveness of his base pay relative to the lower quartile of the market. The Remuneration Committee intends 
to increase his salary to the lower quartile of the market by the end of this policy period, by increments. The Remuneration Committee 
will review his increase each year to ensure it is appropriate and moves his positioning as intended. This means that the increase for 
Geraint may be ahead of those generally given to colleagues for the duration of the policy.

The Executive Directors will continue to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan on a consistent basis with other employees, where 
employee contributions are matched up to a maximum 6% of base salary. The Company will offer individuals a choice between pension 
contributions and cash in lieu. Both Executive Directors will continue to receive benefits in line with the Policy. Both will benefit from the 
removal of the cap of £15,000 on the absolute amount of contribution.

DFSS
The Committee intends to make awards under the DFSS to Milena Mondini de Focatiis and Geraint Jones in September 2024 of 95,000 
and 55,000 shares, respectively. The Committee will confirm the size for each of the 2024 DFSS awards closer to the award date. 
In determining whether the award size should differ from the above number of shares, the Committee will consider any large share price 
change over the prior year, and in particular whether this is due to external factors out of management control. The actual 2024 DFSS 
awards will be disclosed in the 2024 Annual Report on Remuneration.

It is currently anticipated that the vesting of 2024 DFSS awards for Milena Mondini de Focatiis and Geraint Jones will continue to be 
assessed across the three-year performance period using an 75% performance weighting on EPS growth, TSR (measured on a relative 
basis, equally split between the FTSE100 and a subset of insurance peers with substantial general insurance segments) and ROE, and a 
25% weighting on a scorecard of strategic, customer and other non-financial metrics. The measures and performance ranges for the 
2024 DFSS are set out in the table below.

The Committee intends that this set of financial measures applies to the DFSS awards made throughout this policy period, which is to say 
the awards for 2024, 2025 and 2026.

It has been an aim of the Committee to include carbon emissions targets as part of the NFM scorecard to support the delivery of the 
Group’s net zero targets. For the 2024 scheme, the non-financial measures will comprise, Group NPS, Diversity, Inclusion and carbon 
emissions targets. This is subject to the work of base lining the Company’s carbon emissions which has been delayed due to the agency 
having a back log.

There will be the potential for downwards adjustment subject to an assessment of risk events considered to have a material customer, 
regulatory or financial impact over the course of the performance period.

Annual Bonus
Under the 2024 Policy, subject to shareholder approval, Milena Mondini de Focatiis and Geraint Jones will be eligible to participate in an 
Annual Bonus in 2024. The bonus opportunity will be 0-200% of base pay for the Executive Directors, with an on-target award of 100%. 
Performance will be based on the following measures and weightings:

Measure
Financial Measures (75% of total)
Profit

Trust Index (people)
Customer Outcomes (CRMI)
Total

Weighting

67.5%

The profit measure will be profit before tax. Turnover is the total value of the revenue generated by the Group. Both Profit and 
Turnover values are reported in the ARA annually, and the values used to determine Annual Bonus outcomes will be consistent with the 
reported figures. 

Customer Outcomes comprise customer measures and associated outcomes from the Group entities for the performance year, in which 
outcomes are scored relative to entity-set performance ranges, with mechanical outcomes based on performance for each month. 
The Trust Index is the average of employee responses to the core survey questions in the Great Place To Work® (“GPTW”) survey. This is 
scored relative to the benchmark of the world’s 25 best workplaces provided by GPTW. 

The Remuneration Committee will follow a two-phase methodology for determining Executive Director Annual Bonus outcomes; the 
formulaic outcome against the measures detailed above followed by a holistic review of the extent to which that formulaic outcome is 
reflective of the overall performance of the Group.

Phase 1: Formulaic Review. At the end of the performance period, the final performance against each measure is assessed on a 
standalone basis. Data for the measures is taken from the Group’s financial reports which are reviewed by the Audit Committee and 
approved by the Board.

Phase 2: Holistic Review. The Committee will then consider the overall fairness of the formulaic Group scorecard outcome in the context 
of the business performance in the prevailing market conditions, which can be assessed against a non-exhaustive basket of measures 
such as:

•  Executive Director personal performance

•  Dividend and/or share price performance

•  Impact on strategic delivery 

•  Risk appetite adherence

•  Loss and/or combined ratio outcomes

•  Financial stability of the Group 

•  Wider ESG performance

•  Inclusion and diversity measures 

•  Delivery of technology milestones. 

The Committee will be able to carefully determine a final bonus outcome for each Executive Director that is fair and appropriate for the 
year’s performance and is in the best interests of shareholders. 

A detailed summary of the factors used to determine bonus outcomes for the Executive Directors will be disclosed in the DRR following 
the performance period.

In line with the position set out in the Policy, 40% of any bonus earned will be subject to deferral into Admiral Group shares for a period  
of three years.

There will be the potential for downwards adjustment subject to an assessment of risk events considered to have a material customer, 
regulatory or financial impact over the course of the performance period.

2  The fee payable for 2024 for Chairing the Group Risk Committee continues to include an additional fee in recognition of the increased time commitment required due to the Admiral Internal 

Model process. It comprises a base fee of £26,250 and an additional fee of £18,900.

New Group Chair Arrangements
It was announced on 31 January 2023 that Mike Rogers was to be appointed as Admiral Group Chair subject to regulatory approval 
and shareholder approval at the Admiral AGM. His fee was set at £375,000. In June 2023, Mike Rogers entered into a Share Acquisition 
Agreement with the Group to purchase an annual amount equal to 30% of the gross amount of the fee, which will continue on this 
basis until he achieves a shareholding equal to 150% of his annual fee. This will be assessed annually, and the agreement contains a top 
up mechanism; if the value of the purchased shares is less than 150% of the gross amount of the fee, the Chair will purchase additional 
shares to maintain a shareholding of 150% of the gross fee.

CEO pay ratio
The table below sets out the pay ratios for the CEO for the periods ended 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2023.

The lower quartile, median and upper quartile employees were determined using calculation methodology A which involved calculating 
the actual full-time equivalent remuneration for all UK employees for 2023. From this analysis, three employees were then identified 
as representing the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile of the UK employee population. Admiral chose this method as it is the preferred 
approach of the Government and investor bodies and Admiral had the systems in place to apply this method. It is also consistent with the 
approach used to calculate the ratios for 2018 to 2022.

The Committee has considered the pay data for the three employees identified and believes that it fairly reflects pay at the relevant 
quartiles amongst our UK workforce. The three individuals identified were full time employees during the year. None received an 
exceptional incentive award which would otherwise inflate their pay figures. No adjustments or assumptions were made by the 
Committee with the total remuneration of these employees calculated in accordance with the methodology used to calculate the single 
figure of the CEO. It should be noted that the lower quartile employee was in receipt of DFSS bonus and/or DFSS vesting in the year.

The employee pay levels for 2023 are detailed below: 

Salary 
Total Remuneration1

CEO
£737,326
£2,064,178

P25 (lower quartile)
£21,392
£27,382

P50 (median)
£26,164
£32,050

P75 (upper quartile)
£42,000
£48,397

1  The single figure of remuneration for the CEO includes actual salary and pension costs paid during 2023, in line with The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) regulations 2018. For other 

employees, salary and pension costs are included on an FTE basis, in line with the legislation. While the basis of calculation differs between CEO and other employees, management considers this a 
fair comparison of remuneration. 

The pay ratio has fallen over the course of 2023. This is due to the slight fall in CEO pay in 2023, compared with 2022. The underlying data 
for employee pay levels is broadly flat compared with 2022, despite an increase in population of c.9%, the majority of which will have 
been at more junior levels of the workforce.

195

A significant proportion of Milena Mondini de Focatiis’ remuneration is dependent on the Company’s performance and therefore it may 
vary more materially, resulting in movements in the CEO pay ratio from year to year. However, the reward policies and structures applying 
to the CEO are broadly aligned with those of the wider workforce and therefore consistent performance is likely to lead to a broadly 
consistent CEO pay ratio.

Relative Importance of Spend on Pay

The following graph sets out a comparison of Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for Admiral Group plc shares with that of the FTSE 100 and 
FTSE 350 indices, of which the Company is a constituent, over the ten-year period to 31 December 2023. The Directors consider these 
to be the most appropriate indices against which the Company should be compared. TSR is defined as the percentage change over the 
period, assuming reinvestment of income.

1  Henry Engelhardt stepped down from the Board on 13 May 2016. His 2016 remuneration includes salary and benefits for his service as CEO. 
2  David Stevens was appointed as the CEO on 13 May 2016. His 2016 remuneration includes salary, pension and benefits for his service as CEO.
3  Geraint Jones was appointed to the Board as CFO on 13 August 2014. His 2014 remuneration includes salary, pension and benefits for his service as CFO, his full year DFSS and his full year 

DFSS bonus. 

4  Milena Mondini de Focatiis was appointed as the CEO on 1 January 2021. Her 2021 remuneration includes salary, pension and benefits for her service as CEO.
5  This figure has been trued up since the 2022 report for the value of the 2020 DFSS based on the actual share price on vest of £22.43.
6  This figure has been trued up since the 2022 report for the value of the 2020 DFSS based on the actual share price on vest of £27.71.
7  43.76% of Milena Mondini de Focatiis’ and 43.73% of Geraint Jones’ 2021 DFSS award will vest in September 2024, subject to their continued employment on the vesting date.

There are no annual bonus outcomes to report in the table as the Admiral DFSS bonus is not structured as a traditional annual bonus 
scheme and consequently a vesting outcome (as a percentage of maximum) is meaningless. This will be different for the 2024 Annual 
Report with the new structure of Annual Bonus

The percentage increases for the Non-Executive Director taxable benefits relate to expenses for travel, accommodation and subsistence.

The percentage change in employee base pay is a view across the whole group and is inclusive of colleague internal movements and 
promotions throughout 2023.

Dilution
The Company has previously used newly issued shares to fund the DFSS and SIP shares. The Company has controls in place to ensure that 
shares awarded under the incentive schemes operated by the Company within any rolling ten-year period do not exceed 10% of the 
number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company in issue at the time of each award. It is currently anticipated that a combination 
of attrition and actual vesting will result in dilution of less than 10%. As required by the rules of our share schemes, the Company will in 
any event ensure that the actual dilution level does not exceed 10% in any rolling ten-year period by funding of any vested (and future) 
share scheme awards as appropriate with market-purchased shares. 

In 2024 the Company will change the way the employee share schemes are funded. Initially shares already assigned to the trust will be 
used to fund the schemes and then the Company will move to a market purchase funding model (likely from 2026 onwards).

Interests held by Directors (audited)
The Company has adopted Executive Director shareholding guidelines whereby all Executive Directors are required to acquire and retain 
a beneficial shareholding in the Company equal to at least 400% of base salary (excluding salary shares, where applicable), which can 
be built up over a period of five years from the later of the introduction of the guidelines and the individual’s date of appointment. 
Both Executive Directors meet the shareholding requirement.

As at 31 December 2023, the Directors held the following interests:

Directors’ Report

199

The Directors present their Annual Report and audited Financial Statements for the year ended  
31 December 2023.

Group results and dividends
The profit for the year, after tax but before dividends, amounted to £337.2 million (2022: £285.3 million, restated following the adoption 
of IFRS 17). The Directors declared and paid dividends of £307.1 million during 2023 (2022: £658.3 million). Refer to note 12b for 
further details.

The Directors have proposed a final dividend of £156 million (52 pence per share). Subject to shareholders’ approval at the 2024 Annual 
General Meeting (AGM), the final dividend will be paid on 7 June 2024 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 
10 May 2024.

Further information on the Group’s dividend policy is located in note 3 on page 236 and on page 37 of the Strategic Report.

Research and development
Details of costs incurred in respect of research and development can be found in note 11c on page 297.

Political donations
No political donations were made during the year.

Interest capitalised
No interest was capitalised by the Group during the year. 

Significant contracts of material interest to shareholders
The Group considers its co-insurance and reinsurance contracts to be significant and of material interest to shareholders. A number of the 
Group’s contractual arrangements with reinsurers include features that, in certain scenarios, allow for reinsurers to recover losses incurred 
to date. The overall impact of such scenarios would not lead to an overall net economic outflow from the Group. No other contractual 
arrangements are considered to be significant to the running of the Group’s business.

Financial instruments
The objectives and policies for managing risks in relation to financial instruments held by the Group are set out in note 2 to the 
Financial Statements.

Directors and their interests
The present Directors of the Company are shown on page 118 of this Report, whilst Directors’ interests in the share capital of the 
Company are set out in the Remuneration Report on page 196. A list of Directors in the financial period to 31 December 2023 is shown on 
page 142.

Going concern 
Under Provision 30 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board confirms that it considers the going concern basis of 
accounting appropriate. In considering this requirement, the Directors have taken into account the factors below. 

In particular, as part of this assessment the Board considered updated projections of performance and profitability a number of times 
throughout the year, with some key highlights including:

•  The Group’s profit projections, including:

–  Changes in premium rates and projected policy volumes across the Group’s insurance businesses

–  The impacts of the continued elevated inflationary environment on the cost of settling claims across all of the Group’s 

insurance businesses 

–  The return of motor claims frequency towards pre-pandemic levels 

–  Projected trends in other revenue generated by the Group’s insurance business from fees and the sale of ancillary products 

–  Projected contributions to profit from businesses other than the UK Car insurance business 

–  Expected trends in unemployment in the context of credit risks and the growth of the Group’s consumer lending business

–  The More Than acquisition due to complete in the first half of 2024

–  Assessment of wider market risk and changes in investment performance given the changing interest rates toward the end of 2023.

•  The Group’s solvency position, which has been closely monitored through periods of market volatility. The Group continues to maintain 

a strong solvency position above target levels

•  The adequacy of the Group’s liquidity position after considering all of the factors noted above

•  The results of business plan scenarios and stress tests on the projected profitability, solvency and liquidity positions including the 

impact of severe downside scenarios that assume severe adverse economic, credit and trading stresses

•  The regulatory environment, focusing on regulatory guidance issued by the FCA and the PRA in the UK and regular communications 

between management and regulators

•  A review of the Company’s principal risks and uncertainties and the assessment of emerging risks, including climate related risks. 

Following consideration of all of the above, the Directors have reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operation for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report, and that it is therefore 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Further information is shown in the Viability Statement on page 109.

Shares held in Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
The EBT does not use its voting rights in respect of the shares it holds in the EBT at general meetings, however, it may choose to do so if 
recommended by the Company via a letter of wishes. If any offer is made to shareholders to acquire their shares, the trustee will not be 
obliged to accept or reject the offer in respect of any shares which are at that time subject to subsisting awards, but will have regard to the 
interests of the award holders and will have power to consult them to obtain their views on the offer. Subject to the above, the trustee may 
take action with respect to any offer it thinks fair. The trustee has waived its right to dividends on the shares held in the trust.

Directors’ Report

201

Additional information for shareholders
The following provides the additional information required for shareholders in accordance with the Takeovers Directive and the 
respective UK law.

The Board is of the view that it is in the best interests of the Group to attract and retain the services of the most able and experienced 
Directors by offering competitive terms of engagement, including the granting of such indemnities. Neither the Deed Poll of Indemnity 
nor insurance cover would provide any coverage in the event that a Director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.

At 31 December 2023, the Company’s issued share capital comprised a single class of shares referred to as ordinary shares. Details of the 
share capital and shares issued during the year can be found in note 12d. The rights and obligations attached to the Company’s ordinary 
shares are set out in the Articles of Association of the Company, copies of which can be obtained from Companies House.

Annual General Meeting (AGM)
It is proposed that the next AGM be held at Tŷ Admiral, David Street, Cardiff, CF10 2EH on Thursday 25 April 2024, notice of which will be 
available to shareholders alongside, or at a date near to the publication of the Annual Report.

If a poll is called at a general meeting, every member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for every ordinary 
share held. The notice of the general meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights either by proxy notice or present in person or 
by proxy in relation to resolutions to be passed at general meeting. All proxy votes are counted and the numbers for, against or withheld in 
relation to each resolution are announced at the Annual General Meeting and published on the Company’s website after the meeting.

There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than:

•  Certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws)

•  Pursuant to the Listing Rules of the FCA whereby certain employees and Directors of the Company require the approval of the 

Company to deal in the Company’s securities.

The Company has not purchased any of its own shares during the period.

There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that occur because of a takeover bid.

There are a number of agreements that alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, such as 
commercial contracts (entered into in the normal course of business). None are considered to be significant in terms of their impact on 
the business of the Group as a whole.

Powers of the Company Directors
The Directors are responsible for managing the business of the Company and may exercise all powers of the Company subject to 
the provisions of relevant statutes, to any directions given by special resolution and to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles. 
The Articles, for example, contain specific provisions and restrictions concerning the Company’s power to borrow money. Powers relating 
to the issuing of new shares and buyback of shares are also included in the Articles and such authorities are renewed by shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting each year.

Power to issue shares
At the last Annual General Meeting, held on 27 April 2023, authority was given to the Directors to allot unissued relevant securities in the 
Company up to a maximum nominal amount of £202,157 representing the Investment Association’s Guidelines limit of approximately 
two thirds of the issued share capital as at 17 March 2023. This authority expires on the date of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
25 April 2024 and the Directors will seek to renew this authority for the following year.

A further special resolution passed at that meeting granted authority to the Directors to allot equity securities in the Company (up to 
a maximum of 5% of the issued share capital of the Company) for cash, without regard to the pre-emption provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006. This authority also expires on the date of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 April 2024 and the Directors will seek to 
renew this authority for the following year.

The Board is aware of the principles published by the Pre-Emption Group in November 2022, and their template resolutions published on 
4 November 2022, allowing a Company the ability to seek authority over a further 10% of the issued ordinary share capital on a non-pre-
emptive basis subject to certain conditions. The Board has set out its proposal, in line with the Pre-Emption Group principles, regarding its 
requested authority to allot shares in the Notice of Meeting for the 2024 AGM. 

Appointments of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles) give the Directors power to appoint and replace Directors. Under the Terms of 
Reference of the Group Nomination and Governance Committee, any appointment must be recommended by the Group Nomination 
and Governance Committee for approval by the Board of Directors. The Articles provide that all Directors will retire and offer themselves 
for re-election at each Annual General Meeting, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Company’s current 
practice. Therefore, all Directors will be submitting themselves for either election or re-election by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.

Articles of Association
The Articles may only be amended by special resolution of the shareholders.

Directors’ indemnities and insurance
Directors and Officers insurance cover is in place for all Directors to provide cover against certain acts or omissions on behalf of the 
Company. A Deed Poll of Indemnity was executed in October 2015, indemnifying each of the Directors, and Company Secretary, in 
relation to certain losses and liabilities that they might incur in the course of acting as Directors of the Company. The Deed Poll of 
Indemnity is categorised as qualifying third party provisions as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006 and remains in force 
for all past and present Directors of the Company.

Reporting, accountability and audit
UK Corporate Governance Code
Admiral is subject to the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code), published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in July 2018 and 
available on their website, www.frc.org.uk. The Company’s Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, addresses the requirements  
of the 2018 Code.

The Code was applicable for the Group during the year under review, and the Group has applied the principles and complied with the 
provisions of the Code except with regard to non-compliance with provision 19 for part of the year from 1 January 2023 to 27 April 
2023, from this date to the 31 December 2023 the Company was in full compliance with the requirements of the Code, as set out in the 
Corporate Governance Report on page 113.

Admiral has reviewed the changes to the revised Code which the FRC published on 22 January 2024 and intends to be effective for 
companies with financial reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Admiral intends to be fully compliant with the revised 
Code from 1 January 2025 and will disclose the measures introduced to ensure compliance with the new Code in the 2025 Annual Report 
and Accounts to be published in 2026.

The Directors confirm that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy.

The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of risk management and internal control and, through the Audit Committee, 
has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and risk management arrangements relating to the financial reporting 
process and the principal risks facing the business. The Board is satisfied that the Group’s internal control and risk management 
framework is prudent and effective and that, through the Audit Committee and Group Risk Committee, risk can be assessed, managed 
and assurance given that all material controls are reviewed and monitored.

Information on the composition and operation of the Board and its Committees is located in the following sections:

•  Group Risk Committee Report on page 168

•  Remuneration Committee Report on page 185.

out in the Strategic Report on page 62 and in the Nomination and Governance Committee Report on page 154.

Company’s subsidiaries, associated undertakings and branches are contained in note 12e.

Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting 
standards and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK accounting 
standards and applicable law, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.

Under Company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:

•  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently

•  Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent

in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website.

Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

Responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:

•  The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and

•  The Directors’ Report and the Strategic Report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company, and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties.

Disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information.

Auditor
Following the Board’s approval of the Audit Committee’s recommendation to reappoint the Company’s auditor, Deloitte LLP has 
indicated willingness to continue in office and resolutions to reappoint it and to authorise the Directors to fix its remuneration will be 
proposed at the AGM.

Index of disclosures

of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

2. Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of 
our report. 

We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services 
provided to the Group for the year are disclosed in note 9c to the financial statements. We confirm that we have not provided any  
non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard to the Group or the Parent Company.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

3. Summary of our audit approach

Key audit matters

The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:

•  Valuation of UK motor large bodily injury reserves within the liability for incurred claims; 

•  Inflation assumptions applied to UK motor bodily injury claims within the liability for incurred claims; and

•  Initial adoption of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. 

Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows:

Newly identified

Increased level of risk

Similar level of risk

Decreased level of risk

Materiality

Scoping

Significant changes  
in our approach

The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £22.1 million which was determined 
on the basis of 5% of profit before tax (‘PBT’).

We identified five reporting components which we determined should be subject to full scope audits 
this year.

Specific audit procedures were completed in respect of five further components which, although not 
financially significant, did present some specific audit risks which needed to be addressed.

The components within the scope of our audit procedures account for 98% of the Group’s profit before tax, 
99% of the Group’s revenue and 99% of the Group’s net assets.

IFRS 17 became effective on 1 January 2023, thus we have also identified the impact of the Group’s 
adoption of IFRS 17 on the restated comparative information presented for the year ended 31 December 
2022 as an additional key audit matter, as this is a new and complex accounting standard which has 
required considerable judgment and interpretation in its implementation.

4. Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting included:

•  We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls relating to the Board’s going concern assessment process;

•  We inspected the Group ORSA (‘Own Risk and Solvency Assessment’) to support our understanding of the key risks faced by the Group, 

its ability to continue as a going concern, and the longer-term viability of the Group;

•  We evaluated management’s going concern assessment in light of the current macroeconomic uncertainties;

•  We considered the available cash and cash equivalents balance at year-end and assessed how this is forecast to fluctuate over a period 
of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements in line with management’s forecast performance. This analysis 
included assessing the amount of headroom in the forecasts considering cash and regulatory liquidity requirements;

•  We assessed management’s reverse stress testing over the projected profitability, solvency and liquidity positions and the likelihood of 

the various scenarios that could adversely impact upon the Group’s liquidity and solvency headroom; and

•  We obtained and inspected correspondence between the Group and its regulators, as well as reviewed the Group Risk Committee 

meeting minutes, to identify any items of interest which could potentially indicate either non-compliance with regulation or potential 
litigation or regulatory action held against the Group.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a 
period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In relation to the reporting on how the Group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of 
this report.

5. Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 

5.1. Valuation of UK motor large bodily injury reserves within the liability for incurred claims 

Key audit  
matter description

The Group’s gross liability for incurred claims totalled £3,452m as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 
2022: £3,174m). Judgments made in determining the valuation of claims reserves are by far the most 
significant in terms of their impact on the Group’s financial position. Setting these claims reserves is 
an inherently subjective exercise and small changes in underlying assumptions may have a material 
impact on the overall year-end result reported.

Specifically, our significant areas of focus are the Group’s selection of the frequency and severity 
assumptions for large bodily injury claims arising in the UK motor insurance business. These particular 
claims result in higher individual claims reserves and are more judgmental, in terms of the 
development of the ultimate losses, due to the longer-term nature of the Group’s exposure (compared 
to property damage claims). Therefore, we determine this as a key audit matter.

Refer to page 164 in the Audit Committee report where this is included as a significant issue and note 
3 and note 5f in the financial statements which refer to this matter.

How the scope of our 
audit responded to the  
key audit matter

We obtained an understanding, and tested the relevant controls governing the selection of the 
frequency and severity actuarial assumptions identified for large bodily injury claims in the UK 
motor insurance business, as well as the wider process supporting the valuation of the liability for 
incurred claims. 

We obtained and inspected the reports from management and involved our internal actuarial 
specialists to support our assessment of management’s frequency and severity assumptions for UK 
motor insurance business. 

We benchmarked the frequency assumptions against available industry data and considered the 
comparison in the context of the risk profile of the Group’s portfolio and the year-on-year changes in 
these assumptions.

We undertook a graphical analysis of incurred development patterns to assess and challenge the 
severity assumptions. We benchmarked the average cost per claim assumptions against available 
third-party industry data in the context of this incurred development analysis.

Based on the procedures described above, we concluded that the selection of the frequency and 
severity assumptions for large bodily injury claims arising in the UK motor insurance business within 
the gross liability for incurred claims is appropriate.

5.2. Inflation assumptions applied to UK motor bodily injury claims within the liability for incurred claims 

5.3. Initial adoption of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts

209

Key audit  
matter description

How the scope of our  
audit responded to the  
key audit matter

Given the ongoing uncertainty associated with the UK’s current and future inflationary environment, 
the impact of future inflation assumptions requires the application of significant judgment which 
has a material impact on the liability for incurred claims. In the current macroeconomic environment, 
there is a greater level of uncertainty associated with projecting future assumptions than in previous 
periods owing to the uncertainty in forecast future inflation and the extent to which this will impact 
claims inflation. 

The most significant impact of such inflation assumptions relates to bodily injury claims given the 
relatively low implicit inflation in historical data trends and the time it takes for such claims to develop 
and settle. Therefore, the effect of such inflationary pressures will not be observable in the claims 
data for some time, unlike for damage claims where the impact of inflation is already arising due 
to inflationary trends in historical data, their faster development, and is more closely linked to the 
Consumer Price Index (‘CPI’). 

Our audit work to respond to the specific risks associated with inflationary assumptions in the UK 
motor bodily injury claims reserves required significant input from our actuarial specialists and was the 
focus of a significant amount of audit effort therefore, we considered this a key audit matter. 

Refer to page 165 in the Audit Committee report where this is included as a significant issue and note 
3 and note 5f in the financial statements which refer to this matter.

We obtained an understanding of and tested relevant controls relating to the key inflation 
assumptions identified.

We obtained and inspected the reports from both management and with involvement of our actuarial 
specialists we assessed the key inflation assumptions.

We benchmarked management’s inflation assumptions against available industry data and considered 
the results of this comparison.

We inspected and challenged the methodology applied in determining the impact of excess inflation 
on the year-end liability for incurred claims, including challenging the future inflation assumptions 
with reference to current and future expectations of market wage inflation.

Key observations

Based on the procedures described above, we concluded that the inflation assumptions applied to UK 
motor bodily injury claims reserves are appropriate.

Key audit 
matter description

How the scope of our  
audit responded to the  
key audit matter

With effect from 1 January 2023, the Group transitioned to IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts which replaced 
the existing standard for insurance contracts, IFRS 4. The new standard establishes the principles 
for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts which are 
significantly different to those required under IFRS 4. The Group’s financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2023 are the Group’s first set of financial statements to include the adoption 
of the new standard. As a result, comparative financial information has been restated from 1 January 
2022, with the first-time adoption of IFRS 17 resulting in a decrease in equity of £125.6 million upon 
transition as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.

The application of IFRS 17 to the Group’s insurance contracts requires significant management 
judgment in developing the valuation methodology, defining the related accounting policies and 
implementing those policies appropriately within the relevant calculation models. The judgments, 
policy choices and elections made have the potential to significantly impact the financial results of the 
Group and its key performance indicators.

We have concluded that the impact of the adoption of IFRS 17 on the restated 2022 comparative 
financial information forms a key audit matter as this is a new and complex accounting standard which 
has required considerable judgment and interpretation in its implementation. Furthermore, the new 
standard has introduced a number of significant changes, including new requirements regarding the 
recognition and measurement of insurance contracts and related account balances and classes of 
transactions. In order to meet the requirements of the new standard, significant changes have also 
been made to the systems, processes and controls with effect from 1 January 2023. This resulted in an 
increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of our internal actuarial and IT specialists.

Refer to page 165 in the Audit Committee report where this is included as a significant issue and note 
1 in the financial statements which sets out the qualitative and quantitative IFRS 17 information, 
including the relevant recognition and measurement requirements of the Standards, and the 
accounting policies applied on its adoption.

To respond to the key audit matter we have performed the following:

•  Obtained an understanding of and tested the relevant controls governing the restated 2022 
comparative financial information and, in particular, those controls over the assumptions and 
methodologies applied in the new IFRS 17 models in valuing the liability for incurred claims;

•  Evaluated the appropriateness of key technical accounting decisions, judgments, assumptions 
and elections made in determining the impacts to assess compliance with the requirements of 
the standard; 

•  With the involvement of our internal actuarial specialists we performed procedures to assess the 

Group’s implementation of the defined methodology and IFRS 17 calculation models;

•  We evaluated the data and other information required for the IFRS 17 calculations, including the 

data inputs to the calculation of the fulfilment cashflows and the risk adjustment within the liability 
for incurred claims; and

•  We tested the new disclosures and the disclosures related to the transition impact and reconciled 

the disclosures to underlying accounting records and supporting data.

Key observations

Based on the procedures described above, we are satisfied that the Group’s insurance contracts are 
appropriately recognised under IFRS 17.

6. Our application of materiality
6.1. Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Group financial statements

Parent Company financial statements

Materiality

£22.1 million (2022: £23.4 million)

£4.4 million (2022: £4.2 million)

Basis for determining 
materiality

Rationale for the  
benchmark applied

5% of profit before tax  
(2022: 5% of profit before tax).

We consider profit before tax to be the critical 
benchmark of the performance of the Group and 
consider this benchmark to be suitable having 
compared to other benchmarks. Our materiality 
equates to 1% of insurance revenue and 2%  
of equity (2022: 1% of insurance revenue and  
2% of equity).

3% of two-year average of net assets  
(2022: 3% of two-year average of net assets).

The Parent Company primarily exists as the 
holding company which carries investments 
in Group subsidiaries and is the issuer of listed 
securities. We consider that net assets is the 
critical benchmark for the Parent Company. 
The measure uses a two-year average of net 
assets which we consider appropriate given the 
inherent volatility associated with the timing of 
dividend payments.

6.2. Performance materiality
We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole.

70% (2022: 70%) of Group materiality

Basis and rationale for 
determining performance 
materiality

In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors: 

•  our risk assessment, including our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment and that 

we consider it appropriate to rely on controls over a number of business processes; and

•  our past experience of the audit, which has indicated a low number of uncorrected misstatements 

identified in prior periods.

6.3. Error reporting threshold
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £1.1 million 
(2022: £1.1 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.

7. An overview of the scope of our audit
7.1. Identification and scoping of components
The five (2022: five) significant components of the Group which were identified in our audit planning are Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) 
Limited, Admiral Insurance Company Limited, EUI Limited, Admiral Europe Compañía de Seguros, and the Parent Company, Admiral 
Group plc. 

Each of these significant components was subjected to a full-scope audit, completed to individual component materiality levels 
which ranged from £3.2 million to £17.6 million (2022: £2.9 million to £22.2 million) dependent upon the relative significance of each 
individual component.

We have completed specific audit procedures, designed to address specific audit risks, for five (2022: eight) further components. 

The components within the scope of our audit procedures account for 98% (2022: 98%) of the Group’s profit before tax, 99% 
(2022: 99%) of the Group’s revenue and 99% (2022: 99%) of the Group’s net assets. 

For the remaining components which were not subject to full-scope audits or specified audit procedures, we performed analysis 
at an aggregated Group level to re-assess our evaluation that there were no significant risks of material misstatement in any of 
these components. 

Finally, we performed audit procedures over the consolidation process by testing the material consolidation adjustments made by 
management in calculating their consolidated financial statements.

7.2. Our consideration of the control environment 
We obtained an understanding of and tested the relevant controls within the Group, including controls over the following business 
processes: financial reporting, insurance revenue, other revenue, insurance service expenses, liability for incurred claims, liability for 
remaining coverage, reinsurance and coinsurance, cash and investments. We also identified the key IT systems in the Group that were 
relevant to the audit, and involved our internal IT specialists to support our testing of general IT controls over these systems, including 
the policy administration system, claims administration systems and the data warehouse.

7.3. Our consideration of climate-related risks
In planning our audit, we have considered the impact of climate change on the Group’s operations and subsequent impact on its financial 
statements. The Group sets out its assessment of the potential impact on page 107 of the Emerging Risks section.

In conjunction with our climate reporting specialists, we have held discussions with the Group to understand management’s:

•  process for identifying affected operations, including the governance and controls over this process, and the subsequent effect on the 

financial reporting of the Group; and

•  long-term strategy to respond to climate-related risks as they emerge including the effect on the Group’s forecasts.

Financial StatementsFinancial StatementsAdmiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023212212

Independent Auditor’s Report

to the members of Admiral Group plc
continued

In addition, our audit work also involved:

•  challenging the completeness of the physical and transition risks identified based on our understanding of the Group, and considered 
in the Group’s climate risk assessment and the conclusion that there is no material impact of climate change risk on the current year 
financial reporting;

•  assessing the Group’s qualitative analysis which supports the Group’s conclusion that there is no material financial statement impact of 

climate risk on expected credit losses;  

•  assessing disclosures in the Annual Report against the requirements of the TCFD framework, paragraph 8(a) of Listing Rule 9.8.6R, as 

well as the mandatory climate-related financial disclosure requirements (“CFD”) ; and

•  evaluating the appropriateness of disclosures included in the financial statements in Note 2.

We have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of TCFD disclosures set out on page 73 of the annual report. As part 
of our procedures, we are required to read these disclosures and to consider whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit. We did not identify any material inconsistencies as a result of 
these procedures.

7.4. Working with other auditors
We engaged local component auditors, being Deloitte member firms in Spain and the US, to perform the audit work over entities 
residing in these respective territories. We also engaged component auditors in the Deloitte UK firm to perform the audit work over 
the Admiral Money segment of the Group. We directed and supervised the work of Deloitte Spain and Deloitte UK, including through 
in-person visits and through remote communication and review of their work.

For the US auditors we concluded it was not necessary to undertake in-person visits to this component, rather we directed and 
supervised the work of the component auditor by having frequent phone calls with the component audit team, participating in video 
conferences and reviewing key audit documentation remotely.

8. Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to 
a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

9. Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so.

10. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our 
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. 

11.1. Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and 
regulations, we considered the following:

•  the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the Group’s 

remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;

•  the Group’s own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error;

•  results of our enquiries of management, internal audit, the directors and the Audit Committee about their own identification and 

assessment of the risks of irregularities, including those that are specific to the Group’s sector;

•  any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the Group’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:

–  identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;

–  detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;

–  the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations; and

•  the matters discussed among the audit engagement team including significant component audit teams and relevant internal 

specialists, including tax, actuarial, financial instruments, IT, climate, and industry specialists regarding how and where fraud might 
occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.

As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and 
identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: valuation of UK motor large bodily injury claims reserves within 
the liability for incurred claims and inflation assumptions applied to UK motor bodily injury claims within the liability for incurred 
claims. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of 
management override.

We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, focusing on provisions of those 
laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, Solvency II regulation and 
relevant tax legislation.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but 
compliance with which may be fundamental to the Group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the Group’s 
operating licence, and the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority regulations.

11.2. Audit response to risks identified
As a result of performing the above, we identified the valuation of UK motor large bodily injury reserves within the liability for incurred 
claims and inflation assumptions applied to UK motor bodily injury claims within the liability for incurred claims as key audit matters 
related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes 
the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters. 

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to the risks identified included the following:

•  reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of 

relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;

•  enquiring of management, the Audit Committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;

•  performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement 

due to fraud;

•  reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with 

HMRC, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority; and

•  in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other 

adjustments; assessing whether the judgments made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating 
the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members, including 
internal specialists and significant component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws 
and regulations throughout the audit.

continued

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

•  the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 

are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

•  the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

13. Corporate Governance Statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified 
for our review.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 
Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit: 

•  the directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any 

material uncertainties identified set out on page 198;

•  the directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the Group’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is 

appropriate set out on page 109;

•  the directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 201;

•  the Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 98;

•  the section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set 

out on page 98; and

•  the section describing the work of the Audit Committee set out on page 161.

14. Matters on which we are required to report by exception
14.1. Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 

from branches not visited by us; or

•  the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

14.2. Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not 
been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

15. Other matters which we are required to address
15.1. Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by shareholders’ approval at the Annual General Meeting on 
27 April 2023 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2023 and subsequent financial periods. The period of 
total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is eight years, covering the years ending 
31 December 2016 to 31 December 2023.

Financial StatementsAdmiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended 31 December 2023

221

General information
Admiral Group plc is a public limited Company incorporated in England and Wales. Its registered office is at Tŷ Admiral, David Street, 
Cardiff, CF10 2EH and its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The nature of Admiral Group operations and its principal 
activities is set out in the Business model section on page 8.

1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with United Kingdom adopted 
international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The Company has elected to 
prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(FRS 101).

The accounting policies set out in the notes to the financial statements have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all 
periods presented in these Group financial statements. 

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as fair value through 
profit or loss or as fair value through Other Comprehensive Income, and insurance and reinsurance contract assets and liabilities which 
are measured at their fulfilment value in accordance with IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. The Group and Company financial statements are 
presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest £0.1 million.

Cashflows from operating activities before movements in investments comprise all cashflows arising from the Group’s insurance and 
reinsurance activities, and from loans and advances issued to customers. Cashflows from financing activities include the cashflows on issues 
of loan backed securities, lease liabilities and other financial liabilities.

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and can affect those returns through its power over the entity. 

In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date 
on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date that control commences until the date control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are 
allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.

The Group has securitised certain loans and advances to customers by the transfer of the loans to special purpose entities (’SPEs’) 
controlled by the Group. Securitisation enables a subsequent issuance of debt by the SPEs to investors who gain the security of the 
underlying assets as collateral. These SPEs are fully consolidated into the Group financial statements under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial 
Statements, as the Group controls the entity in line with the above definition.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. 

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
year in which the estimate is reviewed. To the extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and liabilities, 
the movement is recognised by adjusting the carrying amount of the related asset or liability in the period in which the change occurs. 
Further information regarding the Group’s critical accounting judgements and estimates is provided in note 2 to the financial statements.

Going concern
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In considering this requirement, the directors have 
taken into account the following:  

•  The Group’s profit projections, including:

–  Changes in premium rates and projected policy volumes across the Group’s insurance businesses

–  The impacts of the continued elevated inflationary environment on the cost of settling claims across all of the Group’s 

insurance businesses 

–  The return of motor claims frequency towards pre-pandemic levels 

–  Projected trends in other revenue generated by the Group’s insurance business from fees and the sale of ancillary products 

–  Projected contributions to profit from businesses other than the UK Car insurance business 

–  Expected trends in unemployment in the context of credit risks and the growth of the Group’s consumer lending business

–  The More Than acquisition due to complete in the first half of 2024

–  Assessment of wider market risk and changes in investment performance given the changing interest rates toward the end of 2023.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2023
continued

1. Basis of preparation continued
•  The Group’s solvency position, which has been closely monitored through periods of market volatility. The Group continues to maintain 

a strong solvency position above target levels

Presentation and disclosure
For presentation in the Statement of Financial Position, the Group aggregates insurance and reinsurance contracts issued and reinsurance 
contracts held respectively, and presents separately: 

•  The adequacy of the Group’s liquidity position after considering all the factors noted above 

•  Portfolios of insurance contracts issued that are assets 

•  The results of business plan scenarios and stress tests on the projected profitability, solvency and liquidity positions including the 

•  Portfolios of insurance contracts issued that are liabilities 

impact of severe downside scenarios that assume severe adverse economic, credit and trading stresses 

•  The regulatory environment, focusing on regulatory guidance issued by the FCA and the PRA in the UK and regular communications 

between management and regulators 

•  A review of the Company’s principal risks and uncertainties and the assessment of emerging risks, including climate related risks.

Following consideration of all of the above, the Directors have reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operation for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report, and that it is therefore 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Further information regarding the Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, is set out in the Strategic Report. Further information regarding the financial position of the Company, 
its cashflows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also described in the Strategic Report. In addition, note 2 to the financial 
statements include the Group’s insurance and financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and its exposures 
to credit risk and liquidity risk; and its objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital.

Adoption of new and revised standards
The Group has adopted the following IFRSs and interpretations during the year, which have been issued and endorsed: 

•  IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective 1 January 2023)

•  Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates (effective 

1 January 2023)

•  Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and Practice Statement 2: Disclosures of Accounting policies (effective 

1 January 2023)

•  Portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are assets 

•  Portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are liabilities. 

The portfolios referred to above are those established at initial recognition in accordance with the IFRS 17 requirements. 

The line item descriptions in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income have been changed significantly 
compared with last year. Previously, the Group reported the following line items:

•  Gross written premiums

•  Net written premiums 

•  Changes in unearned premium reserves 

•  Gross insurance claims 

•  Net insurance claims

•  Net operating expenses. 

Instead, IFRS 17 requires separate presentation of: 

•  Insurance revenue 

•  Insurance service expenses 

•  Income or expenses from reinsurance contracts held 

•  Insurance finance income or expenses.

The Group provides disaggregated qualitative and quantitative information about:

•  Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (effective 

•  Amounts recognised in its financial statements from insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held

1 January 2023).

•  Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: International tax reform - Pillar two model rules (effective 1 January 2023).

The application of the amendments listed above has not had a material impact on the Group’s results, financial position and cashflows. 
Further information on the impact of the transition to IFRS 17 is provided below.

IFRS 17 adoption
IFRS 17, the new insurance contracts standard, replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, from 1 January 2023. 

As a result, the opening balance sheet (1 January 2022) and prior year comparatives (FY 2022) have been restated under IFRS 17, applying 
the transitional provisions in Appendix C to IFRS 17. The nature of the changes in accounting policies can be summarised as follows:

Changes to classification and measurement.
The adoption of IFRS 17 did not change the classification of the Group’s insurance contracts. 

The Group was previously permitted under IFRS 4 to continue accounting using its previous (UK GAAP) accounting policies. However, IFRS 
17 establishes specific principles for the recognition and measurement of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held by 
the Group. 

Under IFRS 17, the Group’s insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held have all been assessed as eligible to be measured 
by applying the premium allocation approach (‘PAA’). The PAA simplifies the measurement of insurance contracts in comparison with the 
general model in IFRS 17. 

•  Significant judgements, and changes in those judgements, when applying the standard.

The new accounting policies and choices adopted in the implementation of IFRS 17 are disclosed in the notes to these 
financial statements. 

Transition approach 
The full retrospective approach was applied to the insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held that were in force at the 
transition date. 

The transition approach was determined at a group of insurance contracts level. Accordingly, the Group has recognised and measured 
each group of insurance contracts in this category as if IFRS 17 had always applied; derecognised any existing balances that would not 
exist had IFRS 17 always applied; and recognised any resulting net difference in equity.

Impact of Transition on Equity 
The total impact of the transition was a reduction in equity of £125.6 million, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity. The Statement of Financial Position presents the restated balance sheet as at the transition date of 1 January 2022, with 
supporting notes providing further detail as required.

The key changes driving the adverse impact on transition are:

•  An adverse impact arising from the Group’s accounting policy choice to expense acquisition costs, which results in a write off of the 

Group’s gross deferred acquisition cost asset

The measurement principles of the PAA differ from the ‘earned premium approach’ used under IFRS 4 in the following key areas: 

•  A reduction in quota share reinsurance assets primarily as a result of the change in timing in recognition of ceded quota share expense 

•  The liability for remaining coverage reflects premiums received less amounts recognised in revenue for insurance services provided 

•  The Group has chosen to expense its insurance acquisition cashflows as incurred

•  Measurement of the liability for remaining coverage involves an explicit evaluation of risk adjustment for non-financial risk when a 

group of contracts is onerous in order to calculate a loss component 

•  Measurement of the liability for incurred claims (previously claims outstanding) is determined on a discounted probability-weighted 

expected value basis, and includes an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk. 

•  Measurement of the asset for remaining coverage (reflecting reinsurance premiums paid for reinsurance held minus ceded earned 
premium) is adjusted to include a loss-recovery component to reflect the expected recovery of onerous contract losses where such 
contracts reinsure onerous direct contracts. 

recoveries, which under IFRS 17 are realised in line with the earning of premium, rather than aligned to when the gross expenses 
are incurred

•  An adverse impact due to the deferral of revenue in relation to underwritten ancillary products, which was previously recognised 

immediately as commission income

•  An offsetting favourable impact due to change in the Group’s claims liabilities, net of reinsurance, as a result of the requirements for 

the liability and asset for incurred claims to be calculated using a probability weighted, discounted best estimate plus risk adjustment 
for non-financial risk

•  The tax treatment of the transition impact follows the accounting treatment, with no transitional relief available. The tax impact on 
transition has been calculated at an entity level, based on the tax rates in place in 2023, when the tax transition impacts are realised. 
Deferred tax assets in relation to carried forward losses are recognised only to the extent that it is probable future taxable profit will be 
available against which the assets can be utilised, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for taxation.

The difference between IFRS 4 and IFRS 17 reported profit primarily arises as a result of differences in the reserve strength or risk 
adjustment position over the course of 2022 under each standard. Under IFRS 4, Admiral moved down to the 95th percentile over the 
course of 2022. Under IFRS 17, Admiral moved down to the 95th percentile at the transition date of 1 January 2022, and remained at that 
percentile during 2022. This results in lower reserve releases under IFRS 17 in 2022, and therefore lower profit. 

The discounting impact shown above is the impact of the discounting of the gross, net of XoL claims cost and finance expenses 
recognised in the period. In UK Insurance, whilst there is a favourable impact of discounting of the claims incurred of circa £52 million at 
YE 2022, this is offset by the unwind of discounting of prior years, reducing the overall discounting benefit to £15 million when compared 
to IFRS 4 claims costs. It should be noted that whilst the higher discount curves seen in 2022 result in lower claims reserves, the Group’s 
accounting policy decision to take the impact of changes in yield curve on outstanding claims reserves to Other Comprehensive Income 
means that this is not a material driver of IFRS 17 profit in 2022. 

In addition, the majority of the discounting benefit on gross claims net of excess of loss reinsurance is offset by the significant adverse 
movement on quota share recoveries. This is significant given that, due to quota share contracts having been largely commuted on 
earlier underwriting years, there is no significant offsetting finance income (representing the unwind of discounting within the quota 
share result). 

Other movements include a number of largely offsetting differences in the timing of recognition of acquisition expenses, quota share 
reinsurance profit commission recoveries, and movements in the onerous loss component.

New and revised IFRS Standards in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRS Standards that 
have been issued but are not yet effective:

•  Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Lack of Exchangeability (effective 1 January 2025)

•  Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cashflows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements  

(effective 1 January 2024)

•  Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of liabilities as Current or Non-current  

(effective 1 January 2024)

•  Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (effective 1 January 2024).

The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements  
of the Group in future periods.

Acquisition of More Than home and pet personal lines from RSA 
During December 2023 the Group signed an agreement to acquire the UK direct Home and Pet personal lines insurance operations of 
RSA Insurance Group Limited (“RSA”). The acquisition is expected to complete during the first half of 2024. The consideration payable at 
completion is £82.5 million, with a further potential payment of £32.5 million depending on the number of policies successfully migrated 
to the Group. The acquisition will not include liabilities relating to existing policies, which will remain with RSA. There is no impact on the 
results reported in these financial statements as a result of the transaction.

2. Critical accounting judgements and estimates 
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as described in the notes to the financial statements, the Directors are required to make 
judgements (other than those involving estimations) that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised and to make estimates 
and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant, including where 
appropriate, weather-related factors. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods. 

2.1 Critical accounting judgements
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are presented separately below), that the 
Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in financial statements.

Premium allocation approach (‘PAA’)
The Group applies the PAA to all of its insurance and reinsurance contracts.

The coverage period of insurance contracts is typically one year or less, including insurance contract services arising from all premiums 
within the contract boundary. The Group does not consider the existing products with more than 12 months coverage to be material. 
The Group’s insurance contracts are therefore automatically eligible for the PAA.

However, the Group’s reinsurance contracts are not automatically eligible for the PAA given that the coverage period is greater than one 
year. The Group has modelled the expected cashflows and reasonably possible future scenarios for its reinsurance contracts, and as a 
result expects that the measurement of the asset for remaining coverage for the group containing those contracts under the PAA does 
not differ materially from the measurement that would be produced applying the general model. Its reinsurance contracts are therefore 
eligible for the PAA. 

The modelling of the cashflows associated with the Group’s reinsurance contracts, and reasonably possible future scenarios, is a key area 
of judgement that impacts the PAA eligibility assessment and the resulting measurement of and presentation of reinsurance contracts in 
these financial statements.

Classification of the Group’s contracts with reinsurers as reinsurance contracts
A contract is required to transfer significant insurance risk in order to be classified as such. Management reviews all terms and conditions 
of each such insurance and reinsurance contract in order to be able to make this judgement. In particular, all reinsurance contracts (both 
excess of loss and quota share contracts) held by the Group have been assessed and it has been concluded that all contracts transfer 
significant insurance risk and have therefore been classified and accounted for as reinsurance contracts within these financial statements. 

Unit of account: combination of insurance contracts and separation of distinct components
The lowest unit of account in IFRS 17 is the contract and there is a presumption that a contract with the legal form of a single contract 
would generally be considered a single contract in substance. However, there might be certain facts and circumstances where legal 
form does not reflect the substance of the arrangement and separation of the contract is required, or alternatively circumstances when 
contracts should be combined, such as when a set of insurance contracts with the same or a related counterparty may achieve, or be 
designed to achieve, an overall commercial effect. 

Overriding the legal contract to reflect substance is not a policy choice; it is a significant judgement requiring careful consideration of all 
relevant facts and circumstances. The following considerations, as set out by the IFRS 17 Transition Resource Group, are deemed relevant 
in assessing whether the contracts should be separated, or alternatively, combined: 

•  whether there is interdependency between the different risks covered 

•  whether components lapse together, and 

•  whether components can be priced and sold separately.

2. Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued
In addition, any cashflows related to promises to transfer distinct goods or services, other than insurance contract services, that are 
within the host insurance contract are separated and recognised by applying IFRS 15. In determining whether there are such distinct 
components, the following is considered:

•  whether the policyholder can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other resources available to 

the policyholder

•  whether the cashflows and risks associated with the good or service are highly interrelated with the cashflows and risks associated 

with the insurance components in the contract

•  whether the Group provides a significant service in integrating the good or service with the insurance components. 

After separating any such distinct components, IFRS 17 is applied to all remaining components of the (host) insurance contract.

The Group has determined that, in applying these requirements to its insurance contracts:

•  The individual insurance policies contained in a ’multi-cover policy’ are treated as separate contracts, given that the components can 
be priced and sold separately, there is little interdependency between the risks covered, and the components can lapse separately 

•  The cashflows associated with administration fees (for changes to the underlying insurance policy), and instalment income (being 
the additional fees payable by a policyholder associated with paying for an insurance contract over 12 months, rather than in one 
up-front payment), are non-distinct given that the policyholder cannot benefit from these services separately and the services are 
highly interrelated with the core insurance policy. These cashflows are therefore treated as insurance revenue under IFRS 17. However, 
for the component of the insurance policy that is underwritten outside the Group by a third party insurer, the Group is performing an 
agency service on behalf of the third party insurer, and therefore this component is treated as a separate component of revenue and 
accounted for under IFRS 15

•  The cashflows associated with ancillary or ’add on’ products (which are sold within the same set of contracts as the core product), are 

separated from the core product in cases where the policyholder can benefit from the product on its own, and where the cashflows are 
not highly interrelated with the insurance components in the contract or the Group does not provide a significant service in integrating 
the products.

In addition, the Group’s quota share reinsurance contracts contain profit commission arrangements. Under these arrangements, there 
is a minimum guaranteed amount that the Group, as the policyholder, will always receive – either in the form of profit commission, or 
as claims, or another contractual payment irrespective of the insured event happening. The minimum guaranteed amounts have been 
assessed to be highly interrelated with the insurance component of the reinsurance contracts and are, therefore, non-distinct investment 
components which are not accounted for separately. Given that the receipt and payment of these non-distinct investment components 
do not relate to the provision of insurance services, the amounts are excluded from the net reinsurance expenses in the Group’s Income 
Statement (i.e. both ceded reinsurance premiums and ceded recoveries are presented net of the minimum guaranteed amount that the 
Group will always receive). 

Presentation of reinsurance ‘funds withheld’ contracts
The Group has a number of quota share reinsurance contracts that have funds withheld features, whereby the quota share proportion of 
ceded premiums and related recoveries are retained by the Group, and settled on a net basis at commutation. The only initial cashflows 
during the coverage period are therefore the payment of any reinsurer margin.

Under IFRS 17, the reinsurance assets related to these funds withheld contracts are presented on a cashflow basis i.e. the full proportional 
share of ceded premiums and recoveries is not presented in either the Income Statement or the Statement of Financial Position. 

Consolidation of the Group’s special purpose entities (‘SPEs’)
The Group has set up a number of SPEs in relation to the Admiral Money business, whereby the Group securitises certain loans by the 
transfer of the loans to the respective SPEs. The securitisation enables a subsequent issue of debt by the SPEs to investors who thereby 
gain the security of the underlying assets as collateral. 

The accounting treatment of SPEs has been assessed and it has been concluded that the entities should be fully consolidated into the 
Group’s financial statements under IFRS 10. This is due to the fact that despite not having legal ownership, the Group has control of the 
SPEs, being exposed to the returns and having the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SPEs.

The SPEs have therefore been fully consolidated in the Group’s financial statements.

2.2  Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below. 

Best estimate of future cashflows to fulfil insurance contracts
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims that have been incurred prior to the balance sheet date and that remain unsettled at the 
balance sheet date, for material lines of business, is estimated by internal actuarial teams using a range of standard actuarial claims 
projection techniques, (such as incurred and paid chain ladder techniques, Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods and initial expected 
assumptions) to allow an actuarial assessment of their potential outcome. This includes an allowance for unreported claims. 
The projection of the overall claims reserve is subject to comparison against equivalent outputs produced by an independent external 
actuarial specialist for material lines of business.

Claims are segmented into groups with similar characteristics and which are expected to develop and behave similarly, for example bodily 
injury (attritional and large) and damage claims, with specific projection methods selected for each head of damage. Key sources of 
estimation uncertainty arise from both the selection of the projection methods and the assumptions made in setting claims provisions. 

Internal and external factors may affect the cost of settling claims in ways that wouldn’t be allowed for by standard actuarial techniques; 
where this occurs adjustments to the technique, assumptions or result may be applied. Examples of these factors include:

•  Changes in the reporting patterns of claims impacting the frequency of bodily injury and damage claims 

•  Emerging inflationary trends on the average cost of bodily injury and damage claims 

•  The likelihood of bodily injury claims settling as Periodic Payment Orders 

•  Changes in the regulatory or legal environment that lead to changes in awards for bodily injury claims and associated legal costs 

•  Changes to the underlying process and methodologies employed in setting and reviewing case reserve estimates. 

Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in future, (e.g., to reflect one-off 
occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, 
judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy features and claims handling procedures) in order 
to arrive at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that present the probability weighted expected value outcome from the range of 
possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.

The Group also has the right to pursue third parties for payment of some or all costs. Estimates of salvage recoveries and subrogation 
reimbursements are offset against ultimate claims costs. Other key circumstances affecting the reliability of assumptions include delays 
in settlement. 

Outputs of the actuarial projections include ultimate average cost per claim and claim frequency by accident year, implied claims 
inflation metrics and ultimate loss ratios and burn costs by accident year and underwriting year. These metrics are reviewed and 
challenged as part of the process for making allowance for the uncertainties noted.

Methods used to measure the risk adjustment for non-financial risk
The risk adjustment for non-financial risk is the compensation that is required for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of 
cashflows that arises from non-financial risk as the insurance contract is fulfilled. Because the risk adjustment represents compensation for 
uncertainty, estimates are made on the degree of diversification benefits and expected favourable and unfavourable outcomes in a way that 
reflects the Group’s degree of risk aversion. The Group estimates an adjustment for non-financial risk separately from all other estimates. 

Applying a confidence level technique (value at risk (“VaR”), the Group estimates the probability distribution of the present value of the 
future cashflows from insurance contracts at each reporting date and calculates the risk adjustment for non-financial risk as the excess of 
the value at risk at the target confidence level over the expected present value of the future cashflows.

The Group’s risk adjustment is set in a range between the 85th and 95th percentile, on a net of excess of loss reinsurance basis. The level and 
estimate of risk adjustment required at reporting date is made in a way that reflect the Group’s degree of risk aversion, taking into account 
both internal factors (such as data quality and trends; diversification across portfolios) and external factors (such as inflation and potential 
changes in Ogden rate) that are relevant at that point in time.

To determine the risk adjustment for non-financial risk for reinsurance contracts, the Group applies these techniques both gross and net 
of excess of loss reinsurance and derives the amount of risk being transferred to the reinsurer as the difference between the two results. 
The net of excess of loss risk adjustment is allocated to quota share reinsurance contracts on a proportional basis.

The risk adjustment is calculated at the issuing entity level. Diversification benefit is included across portfolios within the entity, to reflect 
the diversification in contracts sold across entities.

The risk adjustment is then allocated down to each portfolio of contracts within the entity using a spread VaR methodology to inform the 
allocation, to ensure coherence of the gross and excess of loss reinsurance results for risk adjustment across the portfolios within an entity. 
Allocations of the risk adjustment to each underwriting year (annual cohort) of contracts within a portfolio is performed manually, based on a 
systematic approach using management judgement. This typically involves allocating a higher proportion of the risk adjustment to the more 
recent underwriting years that are less developed and therefore more uncertain, compared to the proportion of risk adjustment allocated to 
older, more developed years.

Where a risk adjustment is required for the liability for remaining coverage due to facts and circumstances indicating that contracts are 
onerous, this is derived using the risk adjustment for the earned portion of the reserves, adjusted for the unearned claims reserves to reflect 
the difference in exposure/size of reserves and difference in drivers of risk in the reserves.

2. Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued
Calculation of expected credit loss provision
The Group is required to calculate an expected credit loss (‘ECL’) allowance in respect of the carrying value of the Admiral Money loan 
book in line with the requirements of IFRS 9. Due to the size of the loan book, the calculation of the ECL is deemed to be a critical 
accounting judgement and includes key sources of estimation uncertainty. 

Management applies judgement in:

•  Determining the appropriate modelling solution for measuring the ECL

•  Calibrating and selecting appropriate assumptions

•  Setting the criteria for what constitutes a significant increase in credit risk

•  Identification of key scenarios to include and determining the credit loss in these instances. 

The key areas of estimation uncertainty are in the calculation of the probability of default (‘PD’) in the base scenario for stage 1 and 2 
assets, and the determination, impact assessment and weighting of the forward-looking scenarios. 

Refer to the analysis in note 7 to the financial statements for further detail on the Group’s ECL methodology applied in the period. 

3. Insurance and financial risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to insurance risk, and financial risks of credit, spread, interest rate, liquidity and foreign exchange 
risk. The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the management of insurance risk and financial risks, although it has delegated 
the detailed oversight of supervising risk management and internal control to the Group Risk Committee. 

There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group. These are detailed in full in the Corporate 
Governance Statement. Specific considerations for the risks arising from insurance and financial risk are detailed below. 

3.1  Insurance risk
The Group’s primary business is the issuance of insurance contracts that transfer risk from policyholders to the Group and its co-
insurance partners. 

Insurance risk involves uncertainty over the occurrence, amount or timing of claims arising on insurance contracts issued. 

It is primarily comprised of Reserve risk; the risk that the value of insurance liabilities established is insufficient to cover the ultimate cost 
of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, and premium risk; the risk that the claims experience on business written but not earned is 
higher than allowed for in the premiums charged to policyholders. 

The Board has ultimate responsibility for the management of insurance risk although as set out above, it has delegated the detailed 
oversight of risk management to the Group Risk Committee. The Group also has a Group Reserving Committee as well as local Reserving 
Committees which are comprised of senior managers within the finance, claims, pricing and actuarial functions in the respective 
businesses. The Reserving Committees primarily recommend the approach for claims reserving but also review the systems and controls 
in place to support accurate reserving and consider material reserving issues such as large bodily injury claims frequency and severity, the 
impact of changes in the claims systems and the external environment. 

The Board implements certain policies to mitigate and control the level of insurance risk accepted by the Group. These include 
pricing policies and claims management and administration processes, in addition to reserving policies and entering into 
reinsurance arrangements. 

3.1.1 Reserve risk
Reserve risk arises from:

•  The uncertain nature of claims, in particular the development of large bodily injury claims

•  Unexpected future impact of socioeconomic trends or regulatory changes, for example changes to the Ogden discount rate 

•  Data issues and changes to the claims reporting process 

•  Failure to recognise claims trends in the market including a slow-down in the processing of recoveries and liabilities with third party 

insurers which increases the estimation risk of these amounts 

•  Changes in underwriting and business written so that past trends are not necessarily a predictor of the future. 

Understatement of reserves may result in not being able to pay claims when they fall due. Alternatively, overstatement of reserves can 
lead to a surplus of funds being retained resulting in opportunity cost; for example, lost investment return or insufficient resource to 
pursue strategic projects and develop the business.

Reserve risk is mitigated through a series of processes and controls. The key processes are as follows:

•  Regular management and internal actuarial review of individual and aggregate case claim reserves, including regular reporting of 

management information and exception reporting of significant movements

•  Regular management and internal actuarial review of large claims, including claims settled or potentially settled by PPOs for which the 
uncertainty is increased by factors such as the lifetime of the claimant and movements in the indexation for the cost of future care of 
the claimant

•  Bi-annual external actuarial review of best estimate claims reserves using a variety of recognised actuarial techniques

•  Internal actuarial analysis of reserve uncertainty through qualitative analysis, scenario testing and a range of stochastic 

reserving techniques

•  Ad hoc external reviews of reserving related processes and assumptions

•  The application of a risk adjustment aligned with Group risk appetite.

As described in note 2, critical accounting judgements and estimates, the Group includes the risk adjustment for non-financial risk within 
its measurement of insurance contracts and reinsurance contract assets, using a confidence level technique, with the risk adjustment 
being set in a range between the 85th and 95th percentile, on a net of excess of loss reinsurance basis.

Whilst the underlying methods to calibrate the reserve risk distribution from which the percentile is selected are consistent year on year, 
a number of developments in the reserve risk modelling in 2023 result in a slightly less volatile distribution than at the end of 2022. 

The reserves including risk adjustment at 31 December 2023 equated to a 93rd percentile confidence level position (2022: 95th 
percentile) to the nearest whole percentile. The reduction in the confidence level from 2022 is reflective of the Group’s assessment of 
uncertainty and the level of adverse risks associated with both internal and external factors, and in particular the Group’s continued 
diversification across portfolios.

3.1.2 Premium risk
As noted above, the Group defines premium risk as the risk that claims cost on business written but not yet earned is higher than allowed 
for in the premiums charged to policyholders. This also includes catastrophe risk, the risk of incurring significant losses as a result of the 
occurrence of manmade catastrophe, or natural weather events. 

Key processes and controls operating to mitigate premium risk are as follows:

•  Experienced and focused senior management and teams in relevant business areas including pricing and claims management 

•  A data-driven and analytical approach to regular monitoring of claims and underwriting performance

•  Observations of weather events trends to understand climate impacts on frequency and severity

•  Capability to identify and resolve underperformance promptly through changes to key performance drivers, in particular pricing. 

3.1.3 Reinsurance risk
The Group purchases reinsurance as part of its risk mitigation programme. Reinsurance held is placed on both an excess of loss basis, 
designed to protect the Group against very large individual claims and catastrophe losses, and a proportional basis i.e. quota–share 
reinsurance which is taken out to reduce the overall exposure of the Group to its insurance contracts. 

Reinsurance risk is the risk of placement of ineffective reinsurance arrangements, or the economic risk of reduced availability of 
reinsurance arrangements in future periods. 

The Group mitigates these risks by ensuring that it has a diverse range of financially secure reinsurance partners, including a long-term 
relationship with Munich Re and a number of other large reinsurers.

Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with underlying insurance contract liabilities and in 
accordance with the reinsurance contract terms. Although the Group has reinsurance arrangements, it is not relieved of its direct 
obligations to its policyholders and thus a credit exposure exists with respect to reinsurance held, to the extent that any reinsurer is 
unable to meet its obligations. 

Information regarding reinsurance credit risk is provided in note 3.2.1.

3.1.4 Concentration of insurance risk
The Directors do not believe there are significant concentrations of insurance risk. This is because the risks are spread across a large 
number of policies across a wide regional base. The International Car Insurance, UK Household, UK Travel and UK Pet businesses further 
contribute to the diversification of the Group’s insurance risk.

The Group’s placement of reinsurance is diversified such that it is neither dependent on a single reinsurer nor are the operations of the 
Group substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract. 

The tables in note 5f(i) show the concentration of net insurance contract liabilities by product type and geographic area.

3.1.5 Sensitivity analysis
The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on profit for reasonably possible movements in key assumptions with all other 
assumptions held constant. The correlation of assumptions will have a significant effect in determining the ultimate impacts, but to 
demonstrate the impact due to changes in each assumption, assumptions have been changed on an individual basis. It should be noted 
that movements in these assumptions are non-linear. 

The sensitivities are shown for UK motor only, being the line of business where such sensitivities could have a material impact at a 
Group level. The sensitivities are shown on a gross and net of quota share reinsurance basis to illustrate the impacts on shareholder 
profit and equity before and after risk mitigation from quota share reinsurance. The sensitivities (both gross and net) include the 
impacts of movements in co-insurance profit commission, given that underwriting year loss ratios including risk adjustment, are a direct 
input to the calculation of profit commission. Refer to note 8 to these financial statements for the accounting policy for co-insurance 
profit commission. 

Ogden discount rate 
The sensitivities reflect the impact on profit before tax and equity in 2023 for changes to the Ogden discount rate from the current rate 
of minus 0.25%, with all other assumptions (including the absolute value of risk adjustment) remaining unchanged.

Ogden discount rate increase by 125 bps to +1.00%

The sensitivities do not reflect the full ultimate impacts of changes in the Ogden rate as some of the impact will flow into future

In addition, should the Ogden discount rate change in future periods, the impacts on profit before tax and equity are likely to be larger 
than those set out above, as a result of including the impacts on claims arising in relation to premium written and earned beyond 
31 December 2023. 

Risk adjustment 
The sensitivities reflect the impact on profit before tax in 2023 and equity as at the end of 2023 for changes in the selection of the UK

*2. ‘Booked’ loss ratios are undiscounted underwriting year loss ratios, including risk adjustment. 

3.2. Financial risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to financial risks of credit, spread, interest rate, liquidity and foreign exchange risk. The detailed 
oversight of supervising risk management and internal control has been delegated to the Group Risk Committee. 

There is also an Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Group and subsidiary Boards on investment strategy, and 
overseas the Group’s investments, as well as advising on liquidity funding and foreign exchange management.

3.2.1 Credit risk
The Group defines credit risk as the risk of financial loss if another party fails to perform its obligations. The key areas of exposure to 
credit risk for the Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments, bank deposits, loans and advances to customers and 
policyholder receivables. 

The Directors consider credit quality and counterparty exposure frequently and in significant detail. The Directors consider that the 
policies and procedures in place to manage credit exposure continue to be appropriate for the Group’s risk appetite and, during 2023, 
and historically, no material credit losses have been experienced by the Group.

Financial investments and cash
Credit and counterparty risk is managed by the Group by investing in high quality money market funds, and setting suitable parameters 
for asset managers to adhere to when purchasing debt securities. Cash balances and deposits are placed only with highly rated 
credit institutions. 

The Group primarily invests the following asset types:

•  Debt securities are held within segregated mandates and investment funds. This includes government debt, private debt and asset 
backed securities. The guidelines of the investments ensure management of credit risk. Generally, the duration of the securities is 
relatively short and similar to the duration of the on book claims liabilities

•  Liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of short-dated fixed and variable rate securities, such as cash deposits, certificates of 

deposits, floating rate notes and other commercial paper 

•  Deposits held with well rated institutions and which are short in duration (under three years). These are classified as held at amortised 

cost. Therefore, neither the carrying value of the asset, nor the interest return will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.

The detailed holdings are reviewed regularly by the Investment Committee. 

Reinsurance assets
To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers (in the form of reinsurance recoveries), the Group only conducts business with 
companies of appropriate financial strength ratings. In addition, many reinsurance contracts are operated on a funds withheld basis, 
which substantially reduces credit risk, as the Group retains the cash received from policyholders.

3. Insurance and financial risks continued
Loans and advances to customers
The risk appetite for the lending business is set to ensure that the risk taken is commensurate with the expected returns. 
Management has defined an amber and a red loan loss limit, representing points at which action is required. These limits have been 
defined by management to reflect the business maturity, the business’ ambitions and the economic climate. Risk appetite is assessed at 
least annually, while the limits are continuously monitored. See note 7 for further information.

Other receivables
A further principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders, largely due to the potential for default by 
instalment payers. The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level of balance recoverable. There is also 
mitigation by the operation of numerous high- and low-level controls in this area, including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to 
inception and automated cancellation procedures for policies whereby payment has not been received.

The amount of bad debt expense relating to policyholder debt charged to the Income Statement in 2023 and 2022 is insignificant. 

Trade receivables and other debtors are also subject to credit risk, although this is mitigated by a review of the credit worthiness of all 
counterparties prior to them being accepted. 

All other assets are assessed as low credit risk under IFRS 9, with no significant amounts past due or impaired. No further disclosure is 
provided due to this having an immaterial impact on the financial statements.

*1. £26.8 million (2022: £59.4 million) of the unrated exposure stems from money market funds, which are rated AAA/AA, but the underlying securities are not. The remaining unrated exposure is a 

mixture of private debt £210.0 million (2022: £123.9 million) and other holdings £57.1 million (2022: £71.8 million).

*2. Loans and advances to customers are assets generated within the Group and hence not externally rated. See note 7 for management’s internal assessment of credit risk. 

There were no further significant financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2023 or 2022.

3.2.1.2  Credit Spread risk
Spread risk is the risk of losses arising from changes in the spread between corporate bond yields and the risk-free yield curve. 
These losses may not be realized as bonds are typically held to maturity.

Sensitivity to credit spread risk
The impact on equity of 100 and 200 basis point increases in credit spreads on financial investments and cash at the relevant valuation 
date, is as follows: 

Reduction in equity – 100bps
Reduction in equity – 200bps

31 December 2023
£m
(75.4)
(150.8)

31 December 2022
£m
(64.4)
(128.7)

The impact on the Income Statement from movements in credit spreads at the valuation date is immaterial.

No sensitivity analysis has been presented in relation to the impact on insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets in respect of changes 
in credit spreads, as it has been assumed that there is no direct impact on the illiquidity premium as a result of a movement in 
credit spreads.

Also see note 7 for further information on sensitivity in respect of credit risk in relation to loans and advances to customers.

3.2.2 Interest rate risk 
The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely impact on the capital 
values of financial assets and liabilities. 

Interest rate risk on financial instruments arises primarily from the Group’s investments in debt securities. These investments are 
exposed to the risk of adverse changes in fair values or future cashflows because of changes in market interest rates.

In addition, the value of insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance contracts assets recognised within the financial statements are 
impacted by changes in interest rates, given that these are discounted using a risk-free interest rate, plus illiquidity premium.

The Group manages interest rate risk by closely matching, where possible, the durations of insurance contracts with fixed and guaranteed 
terms and the supporting financial assets. The Group monitors its interest rate risk exposure through periodic reviews of asset and 
liability positions. Additionally, estimates of cashflows and the impact of interest rate fluctuations are modelled and reviewed every 
six months.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2023
continued

3. Insurance and financial risks continued
Loans and advances to customers
The Group’s consumer loan portfolio consists of fixed rate loans, which are funded at a floating variable rate. The Group has interest 
rate swap arrangements in place to eliminate the majority of the interest rate risk variability in the cashflows payable on the loan 
backed securities. 

Hedge accounting
Hedge accounting is applied when the criteria specified in IFRS 9 are met. In line with IFRS 9, the gain or loss on the hedged position as at 
the balance sheet date is recognised through Other Comprehensive Income. 

This results in a hedging reserve in relation to the interest rate swap.

Financial liabilities
Following the repurchase of the subordinated loan notes and the issuance of new subordinated loan notes, the Group holds two 
financial liabilities in the form of a £55.1 million subordinated loan note with a ten year maturity and fixed rate coupon of 5.5% with a 
redemption date of 25 July 2024 and a £250.0 million subordinated loan note with a ten year maturity and fixed rate coupon of 8.5% with 
a redemption date of 6 January 2034. The liabilities are valued at amortised cost and therefore neither the carrying value of the deposits, 
nor the interest payable, will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. 

Other financial assets and liabilities
There is no significant exposure to interest rate risk for other financial assets and liabilities due to these being held at amortised cost.

Sensitivity to interest rate risk
The impact on profit and loss (before tax) and equity arising from the impact of 100 basis point and 200 basis point increases and 
decreases in interest rates on insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance contract assets, is as follows:

£m
Increase of 100 basis points

The impact on profit before tax of a 100 basis and 200 basis point move in relation to investments and cash is not significant, at 
£15.2 million and £30.4 million respectively. The impact on equity is more significant, at £81.7 million and £163.4 million respectively, as a 
result of the gains and losses on the majority of the financial investment portfolio being reflected in Other Comprehensive Income. 

Sensitivities for the 2022 comparative period are not significantly different to those provided above.

Changes in interest rates mainly affect the Income Statement and equity as follows:

Income statement
•  Interest revenue and other finance costs on floating-rate financial instruments (assuming that interest rates had varied by 100 basis 

points during the year) 

•  Changes in the fair value of derivatives and fixed-rate financial instruments measured at FVTPL

•  Changes in the discounted fulfilment cashflows of onerous contracts 

•  Insurance claims expenses, reinsurance claims recoveries and finance income or expenses recognised in profit or loss, as a result of 
discounting future cashflows at a revised current rate (assuming that interest rates had varied by 100 basis points during the year). 

Equity 
•  Changes in the fair value of fixed-rate financial assets measured at FVOCI

•  Insurance finance income and expenses recognised in OCI as a result of discounting future cashflows at a revised current rate 

•  The effect on profit or loss as above, net of tax.

The Group’s Solvency II balance sheet, which includes technical provisions discounted using Bank of England and EIOPA yield curves 
reflects a low sensitivity to interest rates as a result of well-matched durations of assets and liabilities. 

3.2.3 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficient available financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations 
as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost. 

The Group holds appropriate liquidity buffers at the Parent Company and subsidiary levels. 

Further, as noted above, a significant portion of insurance funds are invested in investment funds with same day liquidity, meaning that  
a large proportion of the Group’s cash and investments are readily available. 

Insurance and reinsurance contracts
The following table analyses the undiscounted, best estimate cashflows of the Group’s claims liabilities under its insurance and 
reinsurance contracts, which reflects the dates on which the cashflows are expected to occur. Liabilities and assets for remaining 
coverage are excluded from this analysis.

The Group’s Directors believe that the cashflows arising from these assets will be consistent with this profile. Liquidity risk is not, 
therefore, considered to be significant.

3.2.4 Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact the valuation of 
overseas assets and liabilities. 

The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its operations overseas. Although the relative size of the international operations 
means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign exchange rates could result in larger potential gains or losses. 
Assets held to fund insurance liabilities are held in the currency of the liabilities; however, surplus assets held as regulatory capital in 
foreign currencies remain exposed. 

The Group’s exposure to net assets and profits in currencies other than the reporting currency is immaterial other than for US dollars and 
euros. The Group’s exposure to net assets held in dollars at the balance sheet date was £3.9 million (2022: £23.6 million); the exposure to 
net assets held in euros was £76.8 million (2022: £69.3 million). 

If the sterling exchange rates against US dollars had strengthened/weakened by 10%, the Group’s profit before tax for the year would 
increase/decrease by £2.0 million (2022: £3.9 million).

If the sterling rates with euros had strengthened/weakened by 10%, the Group’s profit before tax for the year would increase/decrease 
by £1.3 million (2022: £2.3 million).

3.2.5 Objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital 

The Group’s capital management policy defines the Board oversight, risk appetite and tier structure of the Group’s capital in addition to 
management actions that may be taken in respect of capital, such as dividend payments. 

The Group aims to operate a capital-efficient business model by transferring a significant proportion of underwriting risk to co-insurance 
and reinsurance partners. This in turn reduces the amount of capital the Group needs to retain to operate and grow and allows the Group 
to distribute the majority of its earnings as dividends. 

The Board has determined that it will hold capital as follows:

•  Sufficient Solvency II Own Funds to meet all of the Group’s Solvency II capital requirements (over a 1 year and ultimate time horizon)

•  An additional contingency to cover unforeseen events and losses that could realistically arise. This risk appetite buffer is assessed via 

stress testing performed on an annual basis and is calibrated in relation to the one-year regulatory SCR. 

The Group’s current risk appetite buffer is 50% above the regulatory SCR. 

The Group’s dividend policy is to:

•  Pay a normal dividend equal to 65% of post-tax profits for the period 

•  Pay a special dividend calculated with reference to distributable reserves and surplus capital held above the risk appetite buffer. 

This policy gives the Directors flexibility in managing the Group’s capital.

As noted above, the Group’s regulatory capital position is calculated under the Solvency II Framework. The Solvency Capital Requirement 
(SCR) is based on the Solvency II Standard Formula, with a capital-add-on to reflect limitations in the Standard Formula with respect to 
Admiral’s risk profile (predominately in respect of profit commission arrangements in co-and reinsurance agreements and risks relating to 
Periodic Payment Order (PPO) claims). 

Solvency ratio (unaudited)
At the date of this report, the Group’s regulatory solvency ratio, calculated using a capital add-on that has not been subject to regulatory 
approval, is 200% (2022: 180%). This includes the recognition of the 2023 final dividend of 52.0 pence per share (2022: 52.0 pence per share). 

The Group’s 2023 Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) will, when published, disclose a solvency ratio that is calculated at 
the balance sheet date rather than annual report date, using the capital add-on that was most recently subject to regulatory approval. 
The estimated and unaudited SFCR solvency ratio is 183%, with the reconciliation between this ratio and the 200% noted above being 
as follows:

The Group has complied with its regulatory capital requirements throughout the period.

Subsidiaries
The Group manages the capital of its subsidiaries to ensure that all entities within the Group are able to continue as going concerns and 
also to ensure that regulated entities meet regulatory requirements with an appropriate risk appetite buffer. Excess capital above these 
levels within subsidiaries is paid up to the Group Parent Company in the form of dividends on a regular basis. 

4. Operating segments 
4a. Accounting policies
(i) Group consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the results and balances of the Company and all entities controlled by the Company, 
being its subsidiaries and SPEs (together referred to as the Group), for the year ended 31 December 2023 and comparative figures for 
the year ended 31 December 2022. The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries and its SPEs are consolidated in the Group 
financial statements. 

The Company controls 100% of the voting share capital of all its principal subsidiaries, except Admiral Law Limited.

An SPE is fully consolidated into the Group financial statements under IFRS 10, where the Group has control over the SPE.

The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group. 
In accordance with IAS 24, transactions or balances between Group companies that have been eliminated on consolidation are not 
reported as related party transactions in the consolidated financial statements.

(ii) Foreign currency translation
Items included in the financial records of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, the Group’s presentational currency, rounded to the nearest £0.1 million. 

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement.

Non-monetary items measured at cost are translated at their historic rate and non-monetary items held at fair value are translated using 
the foreign exchange rate on the date that the fair value was established.

The financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currency is not pounds sterling are translated into the Group 
presentation currency (pound sterling) as follows:

•  Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet

•  Income and expenses for each Income Statement are translated at an average exchange rate (unless this average is not a reasonable 

approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the date of the transaction)

•  All resulting exchange differences are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and in a separate component of equity except to 

the extent that the translation differences are attributable to non-controlling interests.

On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular operation is recognised in the 
Income Statement.

4b. Segment reporting
The Group has four reportable segments, as described below. These segments represent the principal split of business that is regularly 
reported to the Group’s Board of Directors, which is considered to be the Group’s chief operating decision maker in line with IFRS 8 
Operating Segments. 

UK Insurance
The segment consists of the underwriting of Motor, Household, Pet and Travel insurance and other products that supplement these 
insurance policies within the UK. It also includes the generation of revenue from additional products and fees from underwriting 
insurance in the UK. The Directors consider the results of these activities to be reportable as one segment as the activities carried out 
in generating the revenue are not independent of each other and are performed as one business. This mirrors the approach taken in 
management reporting.

International Insurance
The segment consists of the underwriting of car and home insurance and the generation of revenue from additional products and fees 
from underwriting car insurance outside of the UK. It specifically covers the Group operations Admiral Seguros in Spain, ConTe in Italy, 
L’olivier Assurance in France and Elephant Auto in the US. None of these operations are reportable on an individual basis, based on the 
threshold requirements in IFRS 8.

Admiral Money
The segment relates to the Admiral Money business launched in 2017, which provides unsecured personal loans and car finance products 
in the UK, primarily through the comparison channel, credit scoring applications and direct channels. 

Other
The ‘Other’ segment is designed to be comprised of all other operating segments that are not separately reported to the Group’s Board 
of Directors and do not meet the threshold requirements for individual reporting. It includes the results of Admiral Pioneer, and compare.
com prior to its disposal on 27 March 2023. 

Taxes are not allocated across the segments and, as with the corporate activities, are included in the reconciliation to the Consolidated 
Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

An analysis of the Group’s revenue and results for the year ended 31 December 2023, by reportable segment, is shown below. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are materially consistent with those presented in the notes to the financial 
statements for the Group.

5. Insurance service result 
a) Accounting policies
(i) Insurance, Reinsurance and Co-insurance contracts classification
Under IFRS 17, an insurance contract is defined as a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance risk from 
another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) 
adversely affects the policyholder.

Insurance contracts
The Group issues insurance contracts in the normal course of business, under which it accepts significant insurance risk from its 
policyholders. As a general guideline, the Group determines whether it has significant insurance risk by comparing benefits payable after 
an insured event with benefits payable if the insured event did not occur. 

Reinsurance contracts
The Group also enters into both excess of loss (‘XoL’) and quota share reinsurance contracts. A contract is only accounted for as a 
reinsurance contract in these financial statements where there is significant insurance risk transfer, after an assessment made by 
management based on the terms and conditions of the contracts.

Co-insurance contracts
Co-insurance arrangements are contracts entered into by the Group’s intermediaries, under which insurance risks are shared on a 
proportional basis, with the co-insurer taking a specific percentage of premium written and being responsible for the same proportion 
of each claim. The co-insurer therefore takes direct insurance risk from the policyholder and is subsequently directly responsible to the 
claimant for its proportion of the claim. As the contractual liability is several and not joint, neither the premiums nor the claims relating 
to any external co-insurance contract (i.e. outside the Group) are included in the Income Statement.

Under the terms of these arrangements, the co-insurers reimburse the Group for the same proportionate share of the directly 
attributable costs in fulfilling the insurance contracts.

(ii) Level of aggregation
IFRS 17 requires an entity to determine the level of aggregation for applying its requirements. The level of aggregation for the Group 
is determined firstly by dividing the business written into portfolios, which comprise contracts subject to similar risks and which are 
managed together.

The Group’s insurance business is therefore divided into portfolios based on both the product (line of business such as motor, household 
etc), and geography (UK, Italy, Spain, France and the US).

IFRS 17 requires a further division of the portfolios into a ‘group’ of contracts (being the lowest unit of account) based on expected 
profitability, and also requires that no group contains contracts issued more than one year apart. However, the Group makes an evaluation 
of the smallest unit of account, i.e. whether a series of contracts need to be treated together as one unit based on reasonable and 
supportable information, or whether a single contract contains components that need to be separated and treated as if they were stand-
alone contracts. 

Following the application of the IFRS 17 level of aggregation requirements, each of the Group’s portfolios (which are determined by 
geography and line of business) is further disaggregated by year of issue into a group of contracts based on expected profitability at 
inception into three categories:

a)  A group of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition, if any

b)  A group of contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently, if any

c)  A group of the remaining contracts in the portfolio.

The Group has elected to group together those contracts that would fall into different groups only because law or regulation specifically 
constrains its practical ability to set a different price or level of benefits for policyholders with different characteristics. 

To assess the profitability of groups of contracts, the Group determines the appropriate level at which reasonable and supportable 
information is available. The Group assumes that no contracts in the portfolio are onerous at initial recognition unless facts and 
circumstances indicate otherwise. For contracts that are not onerous, the Group assesses, at initial recognition, that there is no significant 
possibility of becoming onerous subsequently by assessing the likelihood of changes in applicable facts and circumstances. The Group 
considers facts and circumstances to identify whether a group of contracts are onerous based on: 

•  Pricing information 

•  Results of similar contracts it has recognised 

•  Environmental factors, e.g. a change in market experience or regulations.

The Group divides portfolios of reinsurance contracts held applying the same principles set out above, except that the references to 
onerous contracts refer to contracts on which there is a net gain on initial recognition. 

Reinsurance contracts held are assessed for aggregation requirements on an individual contract basis. For many of the Group’s 
reinsurance contracts held, a group comprises a single contract. The Group reports its reinsurance contracts by portfolio, which aggregate 
the contracts by type of reinsurance (e.g. quota share or XoL) and product. 

These groups represent the level of aggregation at which insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held are initially 
recognised and measured. Such groups are not subsequently reconsidered.

5. Insurance service result continued 
(iii) Recognition, modification and derecognition
Groups of insurance contracts issued are recognised from the earliest of the following:

•  The beginning of the coverage period

•  The date when the first payment from the policyholder is due or actually received, if there is no due date 

•  For a group of onerous contracts, when the Group determines that facts and circumstances indicate that the group is onerous.

A group of reinsurance contracts held is entered into from the earlier of: 

•  The beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held. However, the Group delays the recognition of a group 

of reinsurance contracts held that provide fully proportionate coverage until the date any underlying insurance contract is initially 
recognised, if that date is later than the beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held

•  The date the Group recognises an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts if the Group entered into the related reinsurance 

contract held in the group of reinsurance contracts held at or before that date.

The Group derecognises an insurance or reinsurance contract when it is: 

•  Extinguished i.e. when the obligation specified in the insurance contract expires or is discharged or cancelled, or

•  The contract is modified such that the modification results in a change in the measurement model or the applicable standard for 

measuring a component of the contract, substantially changes the contract boundary, or requires the modified contract to be included in 
a different group. In such cases, the Group derecognises the initial contract and recognises the modified contract as a new contract.

When a modification is not treated as a derecognition, the Group recognises amounts paid or received for the modification with the 
contract as an adjustment to the relevant liability for remaining coverage. 

(iv)  Contract boundary
The Group includes in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts all the future cashflows within the boundary of each contract 
in the group. Cashflows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that 
exist during the reporting period in which the Group can compel the policyholder to pay the premiums, or in which the Group has 
a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with insurance contract services. A substantive obligation to provide insurance 
contract services ends when: 

•  The Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the particular policyholder and, as a result, can set a price or level of benefits 

that fully reflects those risks, or

•  Both of the following criteria are satisfied: 

i. The Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the portfolio of insurance contracts that contain the contract and, as a 
result, can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects the risk of that portfolio 

ii. The pricing of the premiums up to the date when the risks are reassessed does not take into account the risks that relate to periods 
after the reassessment date. 

 A liability or asset relating to expected premiums or claims outside the boundary of the insurance contract is not recognised. 
Such amounts relate to future insurance contracts. In assessing the practical ability to reprice, risks transferred from the policyholder to 
the Group, such as insurance risk and financial risk, are considered; other risks, such as lapse or surrender risk, are not included.

For groups of reinsurance contracts held, cashflows are within the contract boundary if they arise from substantive rights and obligations 
of the Group that exist during the reporting period in which the Group is compelled to pay amounts to the reinsurer or in which the 
Group has a substantive right to receive services from the reinsurer. 

(v)  Presentation 
The Group presents separately, in the Statement of Financial Position, the carrying amount of portfolios of insurance contracts issued that 
are assets, portfolios of insurance contracts issued that are liabilities, portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are assets and portfolios of 
reinsurance contracts held that are liabilities. 

The Group disaggregates the total amount recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Other 
Comprehensive Income into an insurance service result, comprising insurance revenue and insurance service expense, and insurance finance 
income or expenses. 

The Group separately presents income or expenses from reinsurance contracts held from the expenses or income from insurance contracts 
issued. This is presented as one single amount in the Consolidated Income Statement, with additional disclosure provided in the notes to the 
financial statements.

The Group does not disaggregate the change in risk adjustment for non-financial risk between a financial and non-financial portion. 
It includes the entire change as part of the insurance service result.

Subject to specified criteria, the PAA can be adopted

Coverage (‘LRC’), 
adjusted for financial  
risk and time value  
of money

Liability for Incurred 
Claims (‘LIC’), adjusted 
 or time value of money

Where the coverage period of all contracts within 
a group is not longer than one year, insurance 
acquisition cashflows can either be expensed as 
incurred, or allocated, using a systematic and rational 
method, to groups of insurance contracts (including 
future groups containing insurance contracts that are 
expected to arise from renewals) and then amortised 
over the coverage period of the related group. For 
groups containing contracts longer than one year, 
insurance acquisition cashflows must be allocated to 
related groups of insurance contracts and amortised 
over the coverage period of the related group.
Where there is no significant financing component 
in relation to the LRC, or where the time between 
providing each part of the services and the related 
premium due date is no more than a year, an entity is 
not required to make an adjustment for accretion of 
interest on the LRC.
For PAA groups, where claims or directly attributable 
insurance expenses are expected to be paid within  
a year of the date that the claim is incurred, it is  
not required to adjust these amounts for the time 
value of money.

Interim reporting

There is an option to disaggregate part of the 
movement in the LIC resulting from changes 
in discount rates, and present this in Other 
Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’).
Where an entity is required to apply IAS 34 (as for the 
Group) there is an option as to whether to choose a  
year-to-date” basis or a “period to date” basis for  
financial reporting.

Adopted approach
Coverage period for the Group’s insurance 
contracts assumed is one year or less and so 
qualifies automatically for PAA. 
Reinsurance contracts (both XoL and quota share) 
include contracts with a coverage period greater 
than one year. However, there is no material 
difference in the measurement of the asset for 
remaining coverage between PAA and the general 
model, therefore these qualify for PAA.
The Group’s insurance contracts are all one year  
or less. The Group has therefore taken the option 
to expense acquisition costs as incurred.

There is no allowance made for accretion of 
interest on the LRC given that the premiums are 
received within one year of the coverage period.

For some claims, for example within the travel 
product line in the UK, and other immaterial 
product lines across the Group, the incurred claims 
are expected to be paid out in less than one year. 

Similarly, the majority of directly attributable 
insurance expenses are expected to be settled 
within one year. For these claims and expenses, no 
adjustment is made for the time value of money.

In addition, given the impact of discounting 
outstanding claims in the Group’s US insurance 
operation is immaterial, no discounting has  
been applied. 

For all other business, the LIC is adjusted for the 
time value of money.
The impact on LIC of changes in discount rates will 
be captured within OCI, in line with the accounting 
for assets backing the insurance claims liabilities.

The Group has opted to apply the option to use 
year-to-date accounting for interim reporting.

Fulfilment cashflows within the contract boundary
The fulfilment cashflows (‘FCF’) are the current estimates of the future cashflows within the contract boundary of a group of contracts 
that the Group expects to collect from premiums and pay out for claims, benefits and expenses, adjusted to reflect the timing and the 
uncertainty of those amounts. The estimates of future cashflows: 

•  Are based on a probability weighted mean of the full range of possible outcomes 

•  Are determined from the perspective of the Group, provided the estimates are consistent with observable market prices for 

market variables 

•  Reflect conditions existing at the measurement date. 

In estimating future cashflows, the Group incorporates, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information that is available 
without undue cost or effort at the reporting date. This information includes both internal and external historical data about claims and 
other experience, updated to reflect current expectations of future events. The estimates of future cashflows reflect the Group’s view 
of current conditions at the reporting date, as long as the estimates of any relevant market variables are consistent with observable 
market prices.

An explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk is estimated separately from the other estimates. 

For the Group’s contracts which are measured under the PAA, unless the contracts are onerous, the explicit risk adjustment for  
non-financial risk is only estimated and included within the measurement of the liability for incurred claims.

Risk of the Group’s non-performance is not included in the measurement of groups of insurance contracts issued. In the measurement 
of reinsurance contracts held, the probability weighted estimates of the present value of future cashflows include potential credit losses 
and other disputes of the reinsurer to reflect the non-performance risk of the reinsurer.

The Group estimates certain fulfilment cashflows at the portfolio level or higher and then allocates such estimates to groups 
of contracts.

The Group uses consistent assumptions to measure the estimates of the present value of future cashflows for the group of reinsurance 
contracts held and such estimates for the groups of underlying insurance contracts.

Discount rates
A bottom-up approach has been applied in the determination of discount rates. Under this approach, the discount rate is determined as 
the risk-free yield adjusted for differences in liquidity characteristics between the financial assets used to derive the risk-free yield and 
the relevant liability cashflows (known as an illiquidity premium). 

A separate risk-free yield is obtained for each currency, where a material amount of business is written in that currency. The risk-free yield 
curve is obtained using rates published by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) for the UK insurance business, whilst for AECS the 
EIOPA risk free term structures are used. These curves are available from October 2015 and provides rates for terms up to 150 years.

For periods prior to October 2015, observable market data is available for terms up to 25 years for GBP (30 years for EUR). For terms 
that aren’t directly observable from market data, the Smith-Wilson approach is used to derive the rates which extrapolates between 
the observable data and an assumed ultimate forward rate. The Smith-Wilson approach is used to derive the published Solvency II yield 
curves, which supports consistency over time. 

Similarly to the approach to risk-free rates, an illiquidity premium will be set by currency. The illiquidity premium will be set by reviewing 
internal illiquidity benchmarks and, when required, performing quantitative analysis to support qualitative judgement. 

The following weighted average rates, based on the yield curves derived using the above methodology, were used to discount the liability 
for incurred claims at the end of the current and prior periods:

Generally, the illiquidity premium is expected to be stable over time and re-assessment of the assumption will be triggered by significant 
changes in internal illiquidity benchmarks and/or changes in the illiquidity of the liabilities (e.g. claims mix). Quantitative analysis will be 
performed when the illiquidity premium changes, including performing sensitivity analysis on the assumption.

Insurance revenue
The insurance revenue for the period is comprised of the amount of expected premium receipts (excluding any investment component) 
allocated to the period. The Group allocates the expected premium receipts to each period of insurance contract services on the basis of 
the passage of time. However, if the expected pattern of release of risk during the coverage period differs significantly from the passage 
of time, for example due to seasonality of claims, then the allocation is made on the basis of the expected timing of incurred insurance 
service expenses. For the periods presented, all insurance premium revenue has been recognised based on the passage of time.  
If a change in allocation is necessary due to a change of facts and circumstances, the change is accounted for prospectively as a change  
in accounting estimate.

The Group’s insurance revenue is comprised of the following component parts: 

•  Insurance premium revenue: Insurance premium revenue reflects the expected premium receipts allocated to the period based on 

the passage of time, adjusted for seasonality if required. It excludes any additional income that arises from the writing of the insurance 
contract that is presented as part of insurance revenue as set out below.

•  Instalment income: In contrast to IFRS 4, instalment income related to the risk attaching part of the premium that is retained within 

the Group is recognised as part of the insurance revenue cashflows due to it being considered non-distinct from the underlying 
insurance policy, as set out in note 2 to the financial statements.

•  Administration fees: Administration fees are costs charged to the customer for arranging a change to their policy. The performance 

obligation is the change in a customer’s policy and given that the obligation related to activities that are required to fulfil the insurance 
contract and the policyholder cannot benefit from the service by itself, it is considered as part of fulfilment cashflows, 
i.e. the full transaction price is therefore recognised as part of insurance revenue on a point in time basis.

IFRS 17 does not require separate insurance revenue analysis for insurance contracts measured under PAA. See Appendix 1 and note 13 
for further information regarding the disaggregation of insurance revenue.

As stated in note 2, the Group has excluded any instalment income and administration fees derived from the proportion of insurance 
coverage under the co-insurance arrangements where the Group bears no risks. 

Insurance service expenses
The following elements are included in insurance service expenses:

•  Incurred claims and benefits excluding investment components 

•  Other incurred directly attributable insurance service expenses, including administration and acquisition expenses, and share scheme 

expenses that are attributable to insurance services 

•  Changes that relate to past service (i.e. changes in the fulfilment cashflows relating to the Liability for Incurred Claims) 

•  Changes that relate to future service (i.e. losses/reversals on onerous groups of contracts from changes in the loss components).

Only items that reflect insurance service expenses (i.e. incurred claims and other insurance service expenses arising from insurance 
contracts the Group issues) are reported as insurance expenses. Cashflows that are not directly attributable to a portfolio of insurance 
contracts, such as some product development and training costs, are recognised in other operating expenses as incurred.

The total costs incurred in relation to the co-insurance share of insurance business are presented within other operating expenses, 
as is the reimbursement of these costs, given that they are not related to the costs directly attributable to fulfilling the Group’s 
insurance contracts. 

Reinsurance net expense/income
The Group has presented the income or expenses from a group of reinsurance contracts held separately from insurance finance income 
or expenses as a single amount and has provided in the disclosure note a separate analysis of the amounts recovered from the reinsurer 
and an allocation of the premiums paid that together give a net amount equal to that single amount.

As part of its quota share arrangements, the Group typically recovers either a set ceding commission, or the quota share reinsurer’s 
proportional share of the expenses that are incurred in fulfilling the insurance contracts.

These amounts are typically settled net with the premium charged and are not contingent on claims. As a result, under IFRS 17 the 
expenses and ceding commissions recovered are considered to reflect a reduction in the transaction price equivalent to charging a lower 
premium (with no corresponding ceding commission or expense recovery). 

In addition, as set out in note 2 to these financial statements, where the reinsurance arrangements result in a “minimum recovery” from 
the reinsurer due to profit commission or sliding scale commission arrangements that is not contingent on claims, and the amount is not 
settled “net” with premium, the minimum recovery is treated as a non-distinct investment component.

As a result, the Group treats reinsurance cashflows that are contingent on claims on the underlying contracts as part of the claims that 
are expected to be reimbursed under the reinsurance contract held, and excludes non-distinct investment components and commissions 
from the allocation of reinsurance premiums presented in the notes to the financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2023

5. Insurance service result continued
Insurance finance income and expense
Insurance finance income or expenses comprise the change in the carrying amount of the group of insurance contracts arising from:

(a)  The effect of the time value of money and changes in the time value of money

(b)  The effect of financial risk and changes in financial risk.

The Group disaggregates insurance finance income or expenses on insurance contracts issued between the Consolidated Income 
Statement and the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income. The impact of changes in market interest rates on the 
value of the insurance assets and liabilities are reflected in Other Comprehensive Income in order to minimise accounting mismatches 
between the accounting for financial assets and insurance assets and liabilities. The Group’s financial assets backing the insurance 
portfolios are predominantly measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (‘FVOCI’). 

Insurance contracts: Liability for remaining coverage
Initial measurement
For a group of contracts that is not onerous at initial recognition, the Group measures the liability for remaining coverage as: : 

•  The premiums, if any, received at initial recognition

•  Any other asset or liability previously recognised for cashflows related to the group of contracts that the Group pays or receives before 

the group of insurance contracts is recognised. 

The Group recognises any insurance premium tax collected in relation to the premiums received as part of the premium receipts, 
but given it is acting as an agent, these taxes are not included as either insurance revenue or an insurance expense. Any outstanding 
insurance premium tax liability is presented within the liability for remaining coverage until paid.

There is no allowance for time value of money as the premiums are received within one year of the coverage period. 

Where facts and circumstances indicate that contracts are onerous at initial recognition, the onerous contracts are separately grouped 
from other contracts and a loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the net outflow, resulting in the carrying amount 
of the liability for the group being equal to the fulfilment cashflows. A loss component is established by the Group for the liability for 
remaining coverage for such onerous group depicting the losses recognised. 

Subsequent measurement
The Group measures the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage at the end of each reporting period as:

•  The liability for remaining coverage at the beginning of the period; plus

•  Premiums received in the period, minus

•  The amount recognised as insurance revenue for the services provided in the period, minus 

•  Payments to the tax authorities in respect of premium receipts.

The onerous loss component is remeasured over the coverage period so that at the end of the coverage period, it is reduced to £nil.

Insurance contracts: Liability for incurred claims
The Group estimates the liability for incurred claims as the fulfilment cashflows related to incurred claims, including any creditors related 
to directly attributable insurance expenses. The liability for incurred claims also includes an explicit adjustment for non-financial risk (the 
risk adjustment). 

Reinsurance contracts held 
Initial measurement 
The Group measures its reinsurance assets for a group of reinsurance contracts that it holds on the same basis as insurance contracts that 
it issues. However, they are adapted to reflect the features of reinsurance contracts held that differ from insurance contracts issued. 

Where the Group recognises a loss on initial recognition of an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts or when further onerous 
underlying insurance contracts are added to a group, the Group establishes a loss-recovery component of the asset for remaining 
coverage for a group of reinsurance contracts held depicting the recovery of losses. The Group calculates the loss-recovery component 
by multiplying the loss recognised on the underlying insurance contracts and the percentage of claims on the underlying insurance 
contracts the Group expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held. The Group uses a systematic and rational method 
to determine the portion of losses recognised on the group of insurance contracts covered by the reinsurance contracts held, in the 
case that there is partial coverage of underlying insurance contracts by reinsurance contracts. The loss-recovery component adjusts the 
carrying amount of the asset for remaining coverage.

The risk adjustment for non-financial risk is the amount of risk being transferred by the Group to the reinsurer and is calculated with 
reference to the gross risk adjustment, adjusted for any excess of loss risk adjustment, as required.

Subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of reinsurance contracts held follows the same principles as those for insurance contracts issued and 
has been adapted to reflect the specific features and terms and conditions of the reinsurance contracts held. In addition, changes in 
the fulfilment cashflows that arise from changes in the risk of non-performance of the reinsurer are reflected within net expenses from 
reinsurance contracts held within the Income Statement. 

Where the Group has established a loss-recovery component, the Group subsequently reduces the loss recovery component to zero in 
line with reductions in the onerous group of underlying insurance contracts in order to reflect that the loss-recovery component shall not 
exceed the portion of the carrying amount of the loss component of the onerous group of underlying insurance contracts that the entity 
expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held.

The extinguishment or commutation of a reinsurance arrangement results in a derecognition of any reinsurance assets or liabilities 
related to the commuted contract from the balance sheet, so that the Group retains the full future risk of claims development. As a 
result of commutation, any difference arising between the present carrying value of reinsurance assets or liabilities and the cash 
settlement is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.

(iv) Claims development
The tables below illustrate how estimates of cumulative claims for UK Motor, UK Non-Motor and International Insurance have developed 
over time on a gross and net of reinsurance basis. 

Each table shows how the Group’s estimates of total claims for each underwriting year have developed over time and reconciles the 
cumulative claims to the amount included in the Statement of Financial Position. Balances have been translated at the exchange rates 
prevailing at the reporting date. The Group has not disclosed information for underwriting years 2017 and prior for the international 
insurance and UK Non-Motor insurance businesses, given that the claims that remain outstanding on those years are immaterial.

IFRS 17 does not require an entity to disclose claims development information for which uncertainty about the amount and timing of 
the claims payments is typically resolved within one year. Therefore, the Group has not disclosed information about the claims in its other 
lines of business or related directly attributable expenses.

6. Investment income and finance costs 
6a. Accounting policies
i) Financial assets 
Classification and measurement
The classification and subsequent measurement of the financial asset under IFRS 9 depends on:
a.  The Group’s business model for managing the financial assets, and
b.  The contractual cashflow characteristics of the financial asset.

Based on these factors, the financial asset is classified into one of the following categories:

Amortised cost  
These comprise assets which are held in order to collect contractual cashflows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise to cashflows which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI), where the asset is not 
designated as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

For the Group, these include deposits with credit institutions, cash and cash equivalents, insurance receivables, trade and other 
receivables and loans and advances to customers.

The interest income generated from these assets is included in investment returns, with the exception of loans and advances to 
customers and cash and cash equivalents relating to the loans business, where the interest receivable is recognised in interest income. 

Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) 
These comprise assets which are held both to collect contractual cashflows and to sell the asset, where the contractual terms of the 
financial asset give rise to cashflows which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI), 
where the asset is not designated as FVTPL.

For the Group, these assets include corporate, government and private debt securities. These assets are held to match policyholder 
liabilities or interest on debt liabilities. If sold before maturity, gains or losses on these assets impact the consolidated Income Statement.

In addition, IFRS 9 allows an irrevocable election at initial recognition to designate equity investments at FVOCI that otherwise would be 
held at FVTPL, provided these are not held for trading. The Group has made this election for certain investments which are not held for 
trading and are strategic investments to be designated as being reported through FVOCI. 

Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, with the exception of recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest 
revenue, dividend income and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in profit or loss. 

A gain or loss on disposal of an investment measured at FVOCI is presented within investment return in the period in which it arises.

Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) 
These are assets which do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI, or which are designated as FVTPL. 

For the Group these assets include liquidity funds investing in short duration assets, other funds and derivative financial instruments.  
The regulatory capital within the Group is used to invest in these instruments in addition to any surplus funds which may be held. 
Buying and selling activity occurs depending on timing of different cashflows.

Impairment
The expected credit loss model (ECL) is used to calculate any impairment to be recognised for all assets measured at amortised cost, 
as well as financial investments measured at FVOCI. The general approach, which utilises the three-stage model, is used for loans and 
advances to customers (see note 7) whilst impairment for the remaining assets is measured using the simplified approach.

This simplified approach is based on an assessment made based on an external credit rating agency or an assessment from the Group’s 
external asset managers, to assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, combined with other external data 
as follows:

•  Financial assets in stage 1 are those where the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition.  A 12-month ECL is 
recognised.  To determine the default rate, the average of external rates using Standard & Poor and Moody’s is used, together with 
consideration of any overlay based on qualitative criteria

•  Financial assets in stage 2 are those where credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, with the provision reflecting 
a lifetime loss.  A significant increase in credit risk is defined as public assets that are downgraded outside of investment grade, or for 
a bond purchased at sub-investment grade, a fall in of a full credit banding i.e. BB to B; and private assets which have been flagged on 
watchlists for significant credit deterioration.  For assets in stage 2, the lifetime credit loss is calculated by multiplying the default rate 
by the number of years from maturity. For assets in stage 1 and stage 2, a recovery rate is also applied to the loss given default, based 
on an average of a number of external and internal sources.

•  Financial assets in stage 3 are credit impaired, which typically occurs when the asset has defaulted, restructured or is not expected to 
return full proceeds.  Each asset in this category is reviewed to assess the recoverable amount based on the information available.

The credit rating of all assets is regularly monitored. As at the year-end reporting date, the majority of financial assets are of investment 
grade and considered low risk under IFRS 9. These therefore remain within stage 1 and a 12-month expected loss is used to calculate the 
impairment provision required.

The impairment provision at 31 December 2023 is £6.9 million (£9.4 million at 31 December 2022). 

The calculated impairment loss within the fair value is recognised through the Income Statement whilst fair value movements are 
recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. 

Given there is no material change in the credit quality or type of financial assets in the year and the movement in provision is immaterial, 
no further disclosure has been made. 

Derecognition
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cashflows from that asset have expired, or when the Group transfers the asset 
and all the attached substantial risks and rewards relating to the asset to a third party.

ii) Financial liabilities
Classification and subsequent measurement
All financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except for 
derivatives that are classified at fair value through profit or loss and subsequently measured at fair value.

Movements in the amortised cost are recognised through the Income Statement.

Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under that liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.

iii) Investment return and finance costs
Investment return from financial assets comprises distributions as well as net realised and unrealised gains on financial assets classified as 
FVTPL, interest income and net realised gains from financial assets classified as FVOCI, and interest income from financial assets classified 
as amortised cost.  

Finance costs from financial liabilities comprise interest expense on subordinated notes, loan backed securities, credit facilities and 
lease liabilities, calculated using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate method calculates the amortised cost 
of a financial asset or liability (or group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and allocates the interest income or expense over the 
expected life of the asset or liability.

6f. Fair value measurement
IFRS 13 requires assets and liabilities that are held at fair value to be classified according to a hierarchy which reflects the observability of 
significant market inputs, based on three levels. The Group policy is to recognise transfer between fair value hierarchy levels as at the end 
of the reporting period. There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels in the reporting period (2022: none).

Fair value measurement using significant unobservable inputs (level three)
Level three investments consist of debt securities and equity securities. 

Debt securities are comprised primarily of investments in debt funds which are valued at the proportion of the Group’s holding of the 
Net Asset Value (NAV) reported by the investment vehicle. These include funds that invest in corporate direct lending, residential and 
commercial mortgages, and other private debt. In addition, there is a small allocation of privately placed bonds which do not trade on 
active markets, these are valued using discounted cash-flow models designed to appropriately reflect the credit and illiquidity of these 
instruments; these valuations are performed by the external fund managers. The key unobservable input across private debt securities is 
the discount rate which is based on the credit performance of the assets. A deterioration of the credit performance or expected future 
performance will result in higher discount rates and lower values.

Equity securities are primarily comprised of investments in Private Equity and Infrastructure Equity funds, which are valued at the 
proportion of the Group’s holding of the NAV reported by the investment vehicle. These are based on several unobservable inputs 
including market multiples and cashflow forecasts.

There were no significant inter-relationships between unobservable inputs that materially affect fair values.

The table below presents the movement in the period relating to financial instruments valued using a level three valuation:

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term deposits with original maturities 
of three months or less. 

An assessment has been completed for impairment purposes in line with that set out in note 6a above.  Given the short-term duration of 
these assets and low risk of these assets, no impairment provision has been recognised. 

For cash at bank and cash deposits and other receivables, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity.

Insurance receivables 
Insurance receivables are measured at historic cost. Given that non-repayment would result in a withdrawn policy and the short-term 
duration of these assets, no bad debt provision has been recognised.

Insurance receivables reported within other receivables are comprised of the external coinsurer’s share of premium receivable, with the 
related liability in respect of written premium presented within amounts owed to the coinsurer.

Trade and other receivables
Classification. Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost, being made up of multiple types of receivable balances. 

Impairment. Where a provision is required for these receivables, it is calculated in line with the simplified method for trade receivables 
per IFRS 9, whereby lifetime expected credit losses are recognised irrelevant of the credit risk. In this case, the provision is based on a 
combination of 

(i)  Aged debtor analysis

(ii)  Historic experience of write offs for each receivable 

(iii)  Any specific indicators of credit deterioration observed, and

(iv) Management judgement.

The level of provision is immaterial. 

The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Subordinated notes
Financial liabilities are inclusive of two separate issuances of subordinated notes totalling £305.1 million. The first subordinated notes 
were issued on 25 July 2014 at a fixed rate of 5.5% per annum and a total value of £200 million. In July 2023 these notes were tendered 
with a take-up of 72.45%, with the remaining amount retaining the original redemption date of 25 July 2024.

The second subordinated notes were issued on 6 July 2023 at a fixed rate of 8.5% per annum, with a total value of £250 million and a 
redemption date of 6 January 2034 (subject to various provisions of the terms and conditions governing the notes).

The notes are unsecured subordinated obligations of the Group and rank pari passu without any preference among themselves. In the 
event of a winding-up or bankruptcy, they are to be repaid only after the claims of all other senior creditors have been met.

There have been no defaults on any of the notes during the year. The Group has the requirement to defer interest payments on the notes 
in certain circumstances but to date none of these circumstances has arisen. 

The fair value of subordinated notes (level one valuation based on quoted prices in active markets) at 31 December 2023 is £329.8 million 
(2022: £196.4 million).

Other borrowings
The Group holds various revolving credit facilities including a £300.0 million facility which expires in April 2026, a £20.0 million facility 
which expires in August 2024 and a €100.0 million facility which expires in August 2024. As at 31 December 2023 £55.0 million was 
drawn under these facilities (2022: £20.0 million), which is shown within other borrowings in the table above. This is made up of 
£35.0 million from the facility expiring April 2026 (2022: £nil) and £20.0 million from the pound sterling facility expiring August 2024 
(2022: £20.0 million).

The carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Loan backed securities
Asset backed senior loan note facilities of £1,000.0 million have been established in relation to the Admiral Money business (see note 
2 for details of the accounting treatment of SPEs).  As at the year end, £759.6 million (2022: £714.7 million) of these facilities had 
been utilised.

The carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Lease liabilities
The Group leases various properties, with rental contracts typically for fixed periods of 5 to 25 years although these may have extension 
options. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease 
agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. 

For each lease, a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability is recognised at the date at which the leased asset becomes available 
for use by the Group.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of remaining lease payments, which include the following:

•  Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable

•  Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate

•  Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the Group’s 
incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of 
a similar value in a similar economic environment, with similar terms and conditions. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing 
rate as the discount rate.

Subsequently, lease payments are allocated to the lease liability, split between repayments of principal and interest. A finance cost is 
charged to the profit and loss so as to produce a constant period rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease liability.

Whereby a change in lease term is identified, the lease liability is recalculated based on the present value of the remaining 
lease payments.

7.  Loans and Advances to Customers 
7a. Accounting policies 
Loans and advances to customers consist of unsecured personal loans and car finance products.  

Classification 
Loans and advances to customers are measured at amortised cost. This is because assets are held in order to collect contractual cashflows 
and the contractual terms of the financial asset demand cash inflows which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.  

Interest income and expense 
Interest income received in relation to loans and advances to customers is calculated using the effective interest method which 
allocates interest, direct and incremental fees and costs over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities. There has been no change in 
recognition of interest income from the comparative period. 

Interest expense is calculated using the process appropriate to each source of funding, which is not linked to individual accounts. 

Finance leases 
Included within loans and advances to customers are personal contract purchase (PCP) and hire purchase (HP) arrangements which are 
classified as finance leases under IFRS 16. A receivable equal to the net investment in the lease has been recognised. The net investment 
is equal to the gross investment in the lease discounted at the rate implicit in the lease.  

Lease interest income is recognised within interest income in the Income Statement over the term of the lease using the effective 
interest rate method.  

The title to the underlying vehicle remains with the Group until the lessee has made all contractual payments, at which point ownership 
is transferred to the lessee. In the event of breach of contract, such as non-payment, the vehicle itself acts as collateral for the finance 
lease, becoming available for repossession in most cases. 

Some of the ways in which the Group maintains its rights to the vehicle, and thus manages the risk of loss associated with the finance 
lease, include:

•  The Group does not enter into any finance leases with a maximum loan-to-value limit, reducing the risk of shortfall on termination of 

the contract

•  The Group requires the lessee to insure the underlying vehicle at all times, reducing the risk of non-recovery if the asset is stolen 

or destroyed

•  The estimated future value of each vehicle, which is sourced externally, is considered in the pricing of the lease contracts to provide 

protection against deterioration in that value.

Fair value measurement
The loans and advances are recognised at fair value at the point of origination and then subsequently on an amortised cost basis. 
This carrying value is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value, which is calculated based on estimates using the present value of 
future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

Expected credit losses
The expected credit loss model is a three-stage model based on forward looking information regarding changes in the credit quality since 
origination. Credit risk is measured using a Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) defined 
as follows:  

•  Probability of Default (PD): The likelihood of an account defaulting; calibrated through analysis of historic customer behaviour. 

Where customers have already met the definition of default this is 100%. For customers that are not in default the PD is determined 
through analysis of historic default data using external and internal data sources available at the reporting date. 

•  Exposure at Default (EAD): The amount of balance at the time of default. For loans that are in arrears the EAD is taken as the current 

balance plus any expected interest arrears.  For up-to-date loans the EAD is calculated as the expected balance 3 months prior to each 
period, plus 3 months of interest arrears to account for the time it takes to default following falling into arrears.  

•  Loss Given Default (LGD): The amount of the asset not recovered following a borrower’s default, determined through analysis of 

historic recovery performance. 

The PD is applied to the EAD to calculate the expected loss excluding recoveries. The LGD is then applied to this loss to calculate the total 
expected loss including recoveries. A forward-looking provision is also calculated, as set out later in this note. 

Loan assets are segmented into three stages of credit impairment: 

•  Stage 1 – no significant increase in credit risk of the financial asset since inception; 

•  Stage 2 – significant increase in credit risk of the financial asset since inception; 

•  Stage 3 – financial asset is credit impaired. 

For assets in stage 1, the allowance is calculated as the expected credit losses from events within 12 months after the reporting date. 
For assets in stages 2 and 3 the allowance is calculated as the expected credit loss from events in the remaining lifetime of each asset. 
The allowance is calculated for each loan at an individual level. 

Significant increase in credit risk (SICR) (stage 2)

As explained above, stage 1 assets have an ECL allowing for losses in the next twelve months, and stage 2 or 3 assets have an ECL allowing 
for losses over the remaining lifetime of the contract. An asset moves to stage 2 when its credit risk has increased significantly since initial 
recognition. IFRS 9 does not prescribe a definition of significant increase in credit risk but does include a rebuttable presumption that this 
does occur for loan assets which are 30 days past due (which the Group does not rebut). 

The Group has deemed a significant increase in credit risk to have occurred where:

•  The loan is in arrears, or

•  The behavioural PD has moved outside a specified threshold from the application PD

•  The customer is identified as being two or more payments in arrears on a credit product with a third party and reported to the credit 

reference agency.

The Group maintains two probation periods: 

•  Where a customer is up to date but previously has been 30+ days past due they will be held in stage 2 for 6 months;

•  Where a customer is up to date but previously Credit impaired (stage 3) they will be held in stage 2 for 12 months. 

A range of metrics including accuracy rates, false positive rates, oscillation rates and the Mathews corelation are monitored in relation to 
loans which are held in the above probation periods.

Credit impaired (stage 3)

The Group does not rebut the presumption within IFRS 9 that default has occurred when an exposure is greater than 90 days past due, 
which is consistent with a customer being three or more payments in arrears. In addition, a loan is deemed to be credit impaired where:

•  There is an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) agreement confirmed or proposed, or 

•  Customer has started or progressed bankruptcy action, or

•  A repayment plan is in place, or

•  A customer is deceased.

As at 31 December 2023, there were 7,300 loans totalling £40.1m that were subject to forbearance (2022: 4,400 loans totalling 
£21.5m). Significant categories of forbearance arrangements include Bankruptcy, Debt Management Plans and Individual 
Voluntary Arrangements.

PMAs are calculated using management judgement and analysis. The key categories of PMAs are as follows:

Model performance
The model has been calibrated on historical data that may not fully reflect the risk of losses in the recent and ongoing, highly volatile 
macro-economic period. In addition, interest rate rises in 2023 have created the potential for performance uncertainty. For this reason 
a Model Performance PMA has been made. It effectively recalibrates the modelled probability of default of the loans to reflect recent 
monitored performance. A refresh of the PD model during 2023 has reduced the PMA in comparison to the previous year end.

Cost of Living
This PMA captures the risk of customers falling into a negative affordability position, whereby customers are no longer able to meet their 
credit commitments due to higher expenditure driven by higher prices and increased mortgage payments, when their standard variable 
or fixed term rate comes to an end. A PMA is held to acknowledge this, using both external and internal data. 

Economic scenarios
An uncertainty factor determined by management judgment has been added to reflect the recent volatility in unemployment forecasts. 
This factor has been reduced as variability between successive forecasts has fallen. 

Write off policy
Loans are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The Group’s policy is to write off balances to their 
estimated net realisable value. Write offs are actioned on a case-by-case basis taking into account the operational position and the 
collections strategy. 

Forward-looking information
Under IFRS 9 the provision must reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of 
possible outcomes. The means by which the Group has determined this is to run scenario analysis. 

Management judgment has been used to define the weighting and severity of the different scenarios based on available data.

The key economic driver of credit losses from the scenarios is the likelihood of a customer entering hardship through unemployment. 
Unemployment forecasts include a risk grade split of PD based on the correlation between grade-level default rates observed relative 
to the change in unemployment rates in the previous downturn, adjusted for the unemployment forecast expected in the current 
economic environment. 

The scenario weighting assumptions used are detailed below, along with the unemployment rate assumed in each scenario at 
31 December 2023.

The economic scenarios and forecasts have been updated in conjunction with a third party economics provider. The probability 
weightings reflect the view that there is a probability of 90% attached to recessionary outcomes. 

The sensitivities in the above tables show the variance to ECL that would be expected if the given scenario unfolded rather than the 
weighted position the provision is based on. At 31 December 2023 the implied weighted peak unemployment rate is 5.2%: the table 
shows that in a downturn scenario with a 6.0% peak unemployment rate the provision would increase by £2.5 million, whilst the upturn 
would reduce the provision by £5.2 million, base case reduce by £1.1 million and severe increase the provision by £8.2 million.

Stage 1 assets represent 81% of the total loan assets; 0.1% increase in the stage 1 PD, i.e. from 2.2% to 2.3% would result in a £0.6 million 
increase in ECL.  

Amounts arising from ECL: loans and advances to customers
The following table sets out information about the credit quality of the loans and advances to customers measured at amortised cost. 
Credit grades are used to segment customers by apparent credit risk at the time of acquisition. Higher grades are the lowest credit risk 
with each subsequent grade increasing in expected credit risk. The Group does not have any purchased or originated credit impaired 
assets. These tables are inclusive of the finance lease assets which are held by the Group, further analysis of these balances can be found 
in note 7c.

All probability of default figures included in this paragraph allow for forward-looking information, i.e. the PDs are a weighted average from 
the economic scenarios considered and relate to the Admiral Money consumer lending business. The average probability of default in 
for stage 1 assets is 2.2% (2022: 2.7%) reflecting the expectation of defaults within 12 months of the reporting date. The average PD for 
assets in stage 2 is 36.8% (2022: 36.6%) reflecting expected losses over the remaining life of the assets. The PD for assets in stage 3 is 
100% (2022: 100%) as these assets are deemed to have defaulted.

•  Revenue from the Group’s law firm

•  Comparison income

Other revenue also includes instalment income on insurance premium paid via instalments, where it is not recognised under IFRS 17 
(see notes 2 and 5) due to the income being separable from the host insurance contract. This instalment income is recognised using the 
effective interest rate method, and as such is not within the scope of IFRS 15.

Co-insurer profit commission revenue falling within the scope of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers relates primarily to a 
contractual arrangement between the Group’s insurance intermediary EUI Limited, and an external co-insurer (Great Lakes, a subsidiary 
of Munich Re) which underwrites a share of the UK Car Insurance business generated by EUI Limited. 

The net investment in finance leases shown above includes an unguaranteed residual value of £0.2 million (2022: The net investment in 
finance leases shown above is net of the unguaranteed residual value of £0.3 million).

8. Other revenue and co-insurer profit commission continued
(ii) Nature of goods and services
The following is a description of the principal activities within the scope of IFRS 15 from which the Group generates its other revenue.

Products and services
Fee and commission revenue, 
including administration fees: 
where the income is separable  
from the underlying  
insurance contract

Revenue from 
law firm

Profit commission  
from co-insurers

Comparison

Nature, timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and significant payment terms
The performance obligation is the provision of insurance intermediary services, at which point 
the performance obligation is met. Revenue is therefore recognised at a point in time, matching 
the Group’s provision of services. Where the Group has no remaining obligations, the revenue is 
recognised immediately. An allowance is made for expected cancellations where the customer may 
be entitled to a refund of amounts charged.
Payment from revenue generated from policyholders is due immediately, or in line with direct debit 
instalments.  Payments from external parties is due within 30 days of the period close.
The performance obligation is the pursuit of the compensation from the at fault party’s insurer 
on behalf of the customer. Once the case is settled the performance obligation is fully satisfied. 
Revenue is therefore recognised over time using the expected value method. This method values 
revenue by multiplying hours incurred on open cases by a 12-month realisable rate. The realisable 
rate is a probability weighted transaction price based on settled cases. The expected value method 
therefore results in revenue recognised being constrained to that where there is a high probability of 
no significant reversal. 

Revenue is recognised over time because the Group has an enforceable right to payment for 
performance completed to date and the work performed to date has no alternative use to the Group.

A contract asset is recognised equal to the work performed up to the balance sheet date but not yet 
billed. Refer to note 6h for further detail of this balance.

Payment is due within 28 days of invoice.
Profit commission is generated if an individual year is profitable, based on the premiums written,  
and expenses and claims costs incurred.  It is therefore a variable consideration, recognised at a 
point in time.

The cumulative profit commission recognised is calculated in aggregate across the contract, in line 
with contract terms, based on a number of detailed inputs for each individual underwriting year, the 
most material of which are as follows:

•  Premiums, defined as gross premiums ceded including any instalment income, less reinsurance 

premium (for excess of loss reinsurance)

•  Insurance expenses incurred

•  Claims costs incurred.

Whilst the premiums and insurance expenses related to an underwriting year are typically fixed 
at the conclusion of each underwriting year and are not subject to judgement, the claims cost is 
subject to inherent uncertainty. This results in the co-insurer profit commission recognised under 
IFRS 15 being a variable amount.

As such:
•  The Group uses the expected value method for the initial calculation of profit commission 
revenue, based on known premiums and expenses, and the best estimate of claims costs. 

•  The variable revenue estimated using the expected value method above is constrained through 
the inclusion of the risk adjustment within the claims cost element of the calculation, with the 
profit commission recognised aligned to the IFRS 17 booked loss ratios, discounted at locked-
in rates, and inclusive of finance expense. The inclusion of the risk adjustment constrains the 
cumulative profit commission revenue recognised to a level where there is a high probability of no 
significant reversal. 

The key methods, inputs and assumptions used to estimate the variable consideration of profit 
commission are therefore in line with those used for the calculation of claims liabilities, as set out in 
note 3 to the financial statements, with further detail also included in note 5.  There are no further 
critical accounting estimates or judgements in relation to the recognition of profit commission.
The performance obligation is the provision of insurance intermediary services, at which point the 
performance obligation is met. Revenue is therefore recognised at a point in time.

Profit commission from reinsurers is within the scope of IFRS 17, and not within the scope of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers due to the nature of the income.

The adoption of IFRS 17 has resulted in a presentational change whereby a significant proportion of “Other revenue” is now recognised 
under IFRS 17. The prior year comparatives have been restated from those previously reported as a result.

During the period, there has been a change in accounting estimate in relation to the calculation of co-insurer profit commission within 
the scope of IFRS 15. The underwriting year loss ratio inputs to the calculation were previously based on IFRS 4 financial statement loss 
ratios in line with the Group’s insurance accounting. The transition from IFRS 4 to IFRS 17 has resulted in a change to the underwriting 
year loss ratio inputs to the calculation, such that the new basis of estimation results in the recognition of co-insurer profit commission 
aligned to the IFRS 17 loss ratios, including risk adjustment, as set out above.  The impact of the change in estimation basis in the period 
and in future is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.

There has been no further change in revenue recognition from the restated comparative period.

8b. Disaggregation of revenue
In the following tables, other revenue is disaggregated by major products/service lines and timing of revenue recognition. The total 
revenue disclosed in the table of £205.8 million (2022: £256.4 million) represents total other revenue and co-insurer profit commission

9. Directly attributable and other expenses
9a. Accounting policies
(i) Directly attributable insurance expenses
Directly attributable expenses are cashflows that are directly attributable to a portfolio of insurance contracts and recognised as incurred 
insurance service expenses. See note 5a for details of the types of expenses recognised as directly attributable insurance expenses.

(ii) Other operating expenses
All other operating expenses are charged to the Income Statement in the period that they are incurred.

(iii) Employee benefits
As detailed in the Remuneration Committee Report, the key elements of employee remuneration are:

•  Base salaries and pension contributions;

•  Share based incentive plans;

•  A discretionary bonus, (the ‘DFSS Bonus’), rather than an annual cash bonus, that is based on the number of DFSS awards held and 

actual dividends paid out to shareholders.

Within note 9b, the charges for base salaries and pension contributions (and the related social security costs) are recognised within 
Administration and acquisition expenses, Expenses relating to additional products and fees and Other expenses based on the role of 
the employee.

Charges for the share-based incentive plans (and related social security costs) and discretionary bonus are included within share scheme 
charges. These charges are not shown as part of the result for each reportable segment, or within the expense ratio, due to them being 
materially comprised of an accounting charge in line with IFRS 2 Share-based payments which does not result in a cash payment to 
employees but instead results in an issue of new shares (resulting in a dilution of existing shares).

For equity settled schemes, the charge, which reflects the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
free shares, is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, as shown in Consolidated statement of changes in equity 
(2023: £63.3 million; 2022: £57.3 million). 

For the cash settled schemes, the expense recognised for the fair value of services received results in a corresponding increase 
in liabilities. 

The key drivers and assumptions used to calculate the charge for the schemes over the three year vesting period are:

•  The number of shares awarded, which is set at the start of each scheme. Details of the number of shares awarded for each scheme 

where shares remain unvested is set out in note 9f (iii)

•  The fair value of the shares;

–  For the SIP, the fair value of the shares awarded is the share price at the award date. Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive 

dividends, and hence no adjustment is made to this fair value

–  For the DFSS equity settled awards, awards are not eligible for dividends, although a discretionary bonus is currently paid equivalent 

to the dividend that would have been paid on the shareholding, hence the fair value of the shares is revised downwards to take 
account of these expected dividends

–  For the DFSS cash settled awards, the fair value is based on the share price at the vesting date. The closing share price at the end of 

each reporting period is used as an approximation for the closing price at the end of the vesting period.

•  Employee attrition rates, which impact the ultimate number of shares that vest.

•  In the case of the DFSS, the vesting rates based on the performance conditions, which also impact the ultimate number of shares 

that vest.

The number of shares that have ultimately vested compared to those originally awarded is set out in note 9f(iv).

At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its assumptions on the number of shares which will ultimately vest based on the latest 
forecast information for attrition rates and, for the DFSS, the extent to which the performance conditions are met. 

The financial impact as a result of any change in the assumptions is recognised through the Income Statement. Any significant changes 
in assumptions may therefore result in an increased/decreased charge in an accounting period as a result of this true-up of the expected 
cumulative charge required.

Social security costs on share-based incentive plans
Social security costs are incurred by the Group in respect of the share-based incentive plans, with the expense recognised over the 
vesting period for each share scheme. For the SIP, these costs are paid when the employees sell the shares after vesting (typically 3–5 
years after the grant date). For the DFSS, the costs are paid immediately upon vesting.

The total social security costs are calculated based on the following:

•  The taxable value of the shares, being:

The rules of the share schemes ensure that the actual dilution level does not exceed 10% in any rolling ten-year period.

–  For the SIP, the lower of the share price at award date and the share price at the balance sheet date

Base salaries and pension contributions
Base salaries and the related employer social security costs are charged to the Income Statement in the period that they are incurred.

–  For the DFSS, the share price at the balance sheet date

•  The number of shares expected to vest for each scheme, driven by the number of shares awarded, attrition rates and, for the DFSS, the 

The Group contributes to defined contribution personal pension plans for its employees. The contributions payable to these schemes are 
charged in the accounting period to which they relate.

vesting rate based on performance conditions

•  The appropriate social security rate.

Share based incentive plans and related social security costs
The Group operates a number of equity and cash settled compensation schemes for its employees, the main ones being:

•  A Share Incentive Plan (SIP), which is in place for all UK employees encouraging wide share ownership across employees, and 

•  The Discretionary Free Share Scheme (DFSS). DFSS shares are typically awarded to managers, and for the majority of employees 50% 
of the DFSS shares awarded are subject to three performance conditions being Earnings per Share growth, Return on Equity and Total 
Shareholder Return vs. the FTSE 350 (excluding investment companies) over a three-year period. The other 50% are guaranteed with 
continued employment.

For both schemes, employees must remain in employment three years after the award date (i.e. at the vesting date), otherwise the 
shares are forfeited.

The majority of these schemes are classed as equity settled under IFRS 2, due to the employees receiving shares (rather than cash) as 
consideration for the services provided. 

These assumptions are updated at the end of each reporting period. The financial impact as a result of any change in the assumptions 
is recognised through the Income Statement. Any significant changes in assumptions may therefore result in an increased/decreased 
charge in an accounting period as a result of this true-up of the expected cumulative charge required.

Discretionary bonus on shares allocated but unvested
The cost of the DFSS bonus is recognised and paid in each period equivalent to the dividends on shares allocated to employees that are 
still entitled to vest but have not yet vested. The cost shown also includes the social security costs on the discretionary bonus. No accrual 
is made for future discretionary bonus payments due to there being no contractual obligation for such a bonus at the balance sheet date.

(i) The Approved Share Incentive Plan (the SIP)
Eligible UK based employees qualify for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year period. 
The maximum award for each year is £3,600 per employee and the maximum number of shares that can vest relating to the 2023 
schemes is 1,045,697 (2022 schemes: 872,728; 2021 schemes: 688,384). 

The awards are made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the Group’s performance.

 (ii) The Discretionary Free Share Scheme (the DFSS)
Under the DFSS, details of which are contained in the remuneration policy section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, individuals 
receive an award of free shares at no charge.  

The maximum number of shares that can vest relating to the 2023 schemes is 3,360,665 (2022 scheme: 3,070,323; 2021  
scheme: 2,850,114). 

The vesting percentage for most employees for the 2020 DFSS scheme which vested during 2023 was 78.25% (2019 DFSS  
scheme: 98.9%).

vesting outcomes based on performance conditions noted above (DFSS schemes).

The weighted average fair value of the shares granted in the year was £20.48 (2022: £19.45).  

The weighted average market share price at the date of exercise for shares exercised during the year was £23.28 (2022: £21.51).

10. Taxation 
10a. Accounting policy
Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprise of current and deferred tax. 

(i) Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date, and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. 

Current tax related to items recognised in Other Comprehensive Income is also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and not in 
the Income Statement.

(ii) Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and that are 
expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled, or the asset is realised.

The principal temporary differences arise from carried forward losses, differences between tax capital allowances and depreciation of 
property, plant and equipment, reserve movements and share scheme charges. 

The resulting deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except to the extent it relates to items that are recognised in 
Other Comprehensive Income or directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or 
directly in equity respectively.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets (including those relating to carried 
forward losses) are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets 
can be utilised. The probability of the availability of future taxable profits is determined by a combination of the existence of taxable 
temporary differences and reviewing future profit projections for the businesses.

Corporation tax assets as at 31 December 2023 totalled £20.4 million, with corporation tax liabilities of £4.9 million (2022: £13.9 million 
liability and £9.1 million asset).

The UK corporation tax rate for 2023 is 23.5% (2022: 19.0%). An increase to the main rate of corporation tax in the UK from 19% to 25% 
was announced in the 2021 Budget and has come into effect from 1 April 2023. 

Adjustments relating to prior periods are higher than previous periods, with £11.7 million of the above total impact of £13.5 million 
due to the Group deciding to settle a historic Italian tax matter, relating mainly to cross border matters. Further costs of £6.8 million 
relating to this inspection, such as interest and penalties, are included in Other Group costs within the Income Statement. These costs are 
expected to be non-recurring.

In 2021, over 130 countries reached a historic agreement to reform the international tax framework. The main aim of the agreement was 
to ensure that large, multinational corporations pay their fair share of tax in the countries in which they operate and this included the 
introduction of a new global minimum corporate income tax rate of 15% - referred to as the Pillar Two rules. 

Legislation has now been enacted in various countries (including the United Kingdom) and draft legislation or announcements have 
been made in others, with the rules first coming into effect for the Group from 1 January 2024. Under the new rules, the Group may be 
required to pay top-up taxes either in the UK ultimate parent location or in the overseas jurisdiction if a jurisdiction has an effective tax 
rate of less than 15%, as calculated under the rules. 

The Group expects top-up tax to arise in relation to our operations in Gibraltar, where the statutory corporate tax rate is 12.5%. However, 
since the enacted Pillar Two legislation is only effective from 1 January 2024, the Group has no related current tax impact for the year 
ended 31 December 2023. If the Pillar Two rules had applied in the year ended 31 December 2023, top-up tax arising in relation to the 
profits in Gibraltar would have been immaterial to the Group.

The Pillar Two rules are complex and the Group continues to monitor ongoing developments in legislation and guidance to assess the 
impact for future periods. Current modelling indicates that the top-up tax will primarily be dependent on the profits arising in Gibraltar. 
Based on current forecasts and the expected profit mix across the Group for the next two financial years (2024 and 2025), it is not 
expected that the Pillar Two rules will result in a material increase in the Group effective tax rate compared to the average of the last 
three years (2021-2023: 21% average).

The Group has applied the temporary mandatory exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and 
liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023. 

In addition to the Pillar Two legislation, the Government of Gibraltar announced on 24 January 2024 that the taxation of interest income 
as trading income is to be extended to include that of insurers for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 February 2024. This change 
would result in additional investment and interest income of the Group’s subsidiary, Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited becoming 
taxable from 1 January 2025 at the Gibraltar corporation tax rate of 12.5%. 

If the change in treatment had taken effect for the current financial year ended 31 December 2023, the impact to the Group on current 
tax and deferred tax is estimated to be immaterial. The Group are continuing to review the draft legislation against the particular nature 
of the investments held in Gibraltar to determine how widely it applies.

It should be noted that there will be interactions between these two legislative changes. Additional corporation tax in Gibraltar payable 
as a result of the proposed changes to the taxation of interest income will correspondingly reduce the Pillar Two top-up tax required to 
be paid by the Group for periods ending 31 December 2025 onwards.

Positive amounts presented above relate to a deferred tax asset position.

The deferred tax asset has increased during the year, mainly relating to unused tax losses in the UK and Gibraltar which are recognised as 
it is considered probable that there are sufficient future taxable profits available to utilise the losses.

At 31 December 2023, the Group had unused tax losses amounting to £233.0 million (2022: £322.0 million, including losses of compare.
com which was disposed of in 2023) and other deductible timing differences of £43.4 million, relating primarily to the Group’s businesses 
in the US and Spain for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised. This is due to uncertainty over the availability and timing of 
future taxable profits against which to utilise these deferred tax assets. The earliest expiry date for the US tax losses is 2029, with no 
expiry for the losses in Spain.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2023
continued

11. Other Assets and Other Liabilities
11a. Accounting policy
(i) Property and equipment, and depreciation

All property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method 
to write off the cost less residual values of the assets over their useful economic lives. These useful economic lives are as follows:

Improvements to short leasehold buildings
Computer equipment
Office equipment
Furniture and fittings
Right-of-use assets

– four to ten years
– two to four years
– four years
– four years
– two – twenty years, aligned to lease agreement

As set out further in note 6i to the financial statements, a right-of-use asset is established in relation the Group’s lease arrangements. 

The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which comprises the following:

•  The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability (note 6i to the financial statements)

•  Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received

•  Any initial direct costs, and

•  Restoration costs.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the asset’s useful life on a straight-line basis.

The Group does not have any significant leases which qualify for the short-term leases or leases of low-value assets exemption.

(ii) Impairment of property and equipment
In the case of property and equipment, carrying values are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there are 
any indicators of impairment. If any such indicators exist, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying 
value. The carrying value is the higher of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and the asset’s value in use. Impairment losses are 
recognised through the Income Statement.

(iii) Intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Goodwill has been recognised in acquisitions of subsidiaries 
and represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. 

The classification and accounting treatment of acquisitions occurring before 1 January 2004 have not been reconsidered in preparing 
the Group’s opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 due to the exemption available in IFRS 1 (First time adoption). In respect of 
acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at the transition date on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the 
amount recorded under UK GAAP, which was tested for impairment at the transition date. On transition, amortisation of goodwill has 
ceased as required by IAS 38.

Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) according to 
business segment and is reviewed annually for impairment. 

The goodwill held on the balance sheet at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is allocated solely to the UK Insurance segment.

Impairment of goodwill
The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount (by allocating the goodwill 
to CGUs) and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower. Impairment losses are recognised through the Income 
Statement and are not subsequently reversed. 

The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and the value in use of the CGU.

The value in use calculations use cashflow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a period of up to 
three years. Cashflows beyond this period are considered, but not included in the calculation. 

The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding revenue growth, along with expected changes in pricing 
and expenses incurred during the forecast period. Management estimates revenue growth rates and changes in pricing based on past 
practices and expected future changes in the market. 

The headroom above the goodwill carrying value is very significant, and there is no foreseeable event that would eliminate this margin.

Software
Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over its expected useful life (generally the licence term which 
is typically between 2 and 4 years). Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset, with directly attributable costs 
incurred in the development stage capitalised. The internally generated software assets are amortised over the expected useful life of 
the systems and amortisation commences when the software is available for use.

The carrying value of software is reviewed every six months for evidence of impairment, with the value being written down if any 
impairment exists. Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve.

Customer contracts and relationships
Customer contracts and relationships are recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over its expected useful life (generally the 
term of the contract), amortisation commences when the contract begins.

The carrying value of customer contracts and relationships are reviewed every six months for evidence of impairment, with the value 
being written down if any impairment exists. Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve.

(iv) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation arises as a result of an event that occurred before the balance sheet 
date, when a cash-outflow relating to this obligation is probable and when the amount can be estimated reliably. 

Where a material obligation exists, but the likelihood of a cash outflow or the amount is uncertain, or where there is a possible obligation 
arising from a past event that is contingent on a future event, a contingent liability is disclosed. 

Contingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of future events. Where it is probable that a cash inflow will arise from a contingent asset, this is disclosed.

Goodwill relates to the acquisition of Group subsidiary EUI Limited (formerly Admiral Insurance Services Limited) in November 1999. 
As described in the accounting policies, the amortisation of this asset ceased on transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004. All annual 
impairment reviews since the transition date have indicated that the estimated recoverable value of the asset is greater than the 
carrying amount and therefore no impairment losses have been recognised. 

Internally generated software includes a new claims system implemented within the UK business during 2022 which has a net carrying 
amount of £24.1 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £33.4 million) and a remaining amortisation period of 3 years.

Only one year of forecasts is required to support the recoverable value of goodwill above. Given the short time period used to support the 
recoverable amount, no terminal growth rate or discounting is applied.

Refer to the accounting policy for goodwill for further information.

11. Other Assets and Other Liabilities continued
11f. Contingent liabilities
The Group’s legal entities operate in numerous tax jurisdictions and on a regular basis are subject to review and enquiry by the relevant 
tax authority.

One of the Group’s previously owned subsidiaries was subject to a Spanish Tax Audit which concluded with the Tax Authority denying the 
application of the VAT exemption relating to insurance intermediary services. The Company has appealed this decision via the Spanish 
Courts and is confident in defending its position which is, in its view, in line with the EU Directive and is also consistent with the way 
similar supplies are treated throughout Europe. Whilst the Company is no longer part of the Admiral Group, the contingent liability which 
the Company is exposed to has been indemnified by the Admiral Group up to a cap of £22 million.

No material provisions have been made in these financial statements in relation to the matters noted above. 

The Group is, from time to time, subject to threatened or actual litigation and/or legal and/or regulatory disputes, investigations or 
similar actions both in the UK and overseas. All potentially material matters are assessed, with the assistance of external advisers if 
appropriate, and in cases where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established 
to reflect the best estimate of the liability. In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, for example if the facts are unclear or 
because further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case or form a reliable estimate of its financial effect. In these 
circumstances, specific disclosure of a contingent liability and an estimate of its financial effect will be made where material, unless it is 
not practicable to do so.

The Directors do not consider that the final outcome of any such current case will have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial 
position, operations or cashflows, and as such, no material provisions are currently held in relation to such matters. 

A number of the Group’s contractual arrangements with reinsurers include features that, in certain scenarios, allow for reinsurers to 
recover losses incurred to date. The overall impact of such scenarios would not lead to an overall net economic outflow from the Group.

12. Dividends, Earnings and Share Capital
The Group’s capital includes share capital and the share premium account, other reserves which are comprised of the fair value reserve, 
insurance finance reserve, hedging reserve and foreign exchange reserve, and retained earnings.

12a. Accounting policies
(i) Share capital
Shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets. 

(ii) Fair value reserve
For investments recognised as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), changes in fair value are accumulated within 
the fair value reserve within equity. The accumulated changes in fair value are transferred to profit or loss when the investment is 
derecognised or impaired. 

(iii) Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve includes the cash flow hedge reserve. The cash flow hedge reserve is used to recognise the effective portion of 
gains or losses on derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Amounts are subsequently reclassified to profit or loss 
as appropriate.

(iv) Insurance finance reserve
The insurance finance reserve relates to the impact of changes in market interest rates on the value of the insurance and reinsurance 
assets and liabilities. These changes are reflected in the insurance finance reserve in order to minimise accounting mismatches between 
the accounting for financial assets and insurance assets and liabilities.

(v) Dividends
Dividends are recorded in the period in which they are declared and paid. 

(vi) Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Group Parent Company, Admiral Group 
plc by the weighted average number of ordinary shares during the period. 

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Group Parent Company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2023
continued

1. Accounting policies
1.1  Basis of preparation
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 
101). The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as fair value 
through the profit or loss or as fair value through Other Comprehensive Income. The Parent Company financial statements are presented 
alongside the consolidated financial statements which can be found on page 437.

In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the UK (“Adopted IFRSs”) but makes amendments where necessary in order to 
comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.

Admiral Group plc is considered to be the parent entity and the ultimate parent Company of the Group.

1.2  Changes to accounting policies
No changes to accounting policies have been made in the period which have a material impact.

1.3 Disclosure exemptions applied under FRS 101
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:

•  FRS 101.8 (a): the requirements of paragraph 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 Share-based payment

1.7 Employee share schemes
The Company operates a number of share schemes for employees of the Group’s subsidiaries. For equity settled schemes, the fair value 
of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the schemes is recognised as an increase in equity in the 
Company. A corresponding intercompany charge is made to the subsidiaries whose employees receive the free shares.  For further detail, 
see note 9 in the consolidated financial statements.

1.8 Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences 
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.  

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. They are regarded as recoverable to the extent 
that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits from 
which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.  

1.9 Financial assets and financial liabilities
Under IFRS 9, classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets depend on:

•  The Company’s business model for managing the asset; and

•  The cashflow characteristics of the asset.

•  FRS 101.8 (d): the requirement of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure to make disclosures about financial instruments

Based on these factors, the Company classifies its financial assets into one of the three categories below:

•  FRS 101.8 (f): the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to present comparative information in 

•  Amortised cost: assets held for collection of contractual cashflows where the cashflows represent solely payments of principal and 

respect of:

–  paragraph 118(3) of IAS 38 Intangible Assets

•  FRS 101.8 (g): the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D and 111 of IAS 1 Presentation 

of Financial Statements to produce a cashflow statement, a third balance sheet and to make an explicit and unreserved statement of 
compliance with IFRSs

•  FRS 101.8 (h): the requirements of IAS 7 Statements of Cashflows to produce a cashflow statement

•  FRS 101.8 (i): the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to 

include a list of new IFRSs that have been issued but that have yet to be applied

•  FRS 101.8 (k): the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or 

more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to transaction is wholly owned by such a member

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
financial statements.

1.4 Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In considering the appropriateness of this assumption, the 
Board have reviewed the Company’s projections for the next twelve months and beyond, including cashflow forecasts and regulatory 
capital surpluses. 

The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual financial statements.

1.5 Critical accounting judgements and key source of estimation uncertainty
In applying the Company’s accounting policies as described below, management consider there to be a key source of estimation 
uncertainty within the impairment testing of the Company’s investments in group undertakings. Management recognises the estimation 
involved in determining whether the carrying value of the investment may be supported by the recoverable amount calculation based on 
the ‘value in use’ of the asset (the net present value of future cashflows arising from the asset). 

In calculating the net present value of future cashflows, Management has made assumptions over the timing and amount of underlying 
profit projections of the relevant undertakings, long term growth rates in those projections and the discount rate applied to these 
projections that is appropriate to reflect the market’s view of the risk of the relevant investment. Sensitivity of these assumptions is also 
considered in calculating the net present value and suitably incorporated in Management’s valuations. 

No key accounting judgements have been made in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. 

1.6 Shares in Group undertakings
Shares in Group undertakings are valued at cost less any provision for impairment in value.

The requirements of IAS 36 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the 
Company’s investments in subsidiaries. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in 
accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value 
less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment 
subsequently increases.  See note 4 to these financial statements for further detail.

interest, that are not designated as FVTPL.

•  Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI): Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cashflows and 
selling the assets, where the assets’ cashflows represent solely payments of principal and interest, and that are not designated 
at FVTPL.

•  Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI, or which are designated as 

FVTPL at initial recognition.

In line with the above:

•  Gilts and other debt securities are measured at FVOCI. Unrealised changes in the fair value of these assets are recognised in Other 

Comprehensive Income (OCI). The recognition of impairment gains or losses and interest revenue are recognised in the profit or loss.

•  Investments measured at FVTPL are primarily money market funds. Interest income is recognised in the Income statement.

The expected credit loss model is used to calculate any impairment to be recognised for all assets measured at amortised cost, as well as 
financial investments measured at FVOCI.  Impairment is measured using the simplified approach.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks. All cash and cash equivalents are measured at 
amortised cost.

The Company’s financial liabilities comprise of subordinated notes and revolving credit facilities which are held at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.

1.10 Intangible Assets
Purchased software licences are classified as an intangible asset and stated in the balance sheet at a cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Software is amortised from the point at which the asset is operational and is amortised over the licence period.

1.11 Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost, less any impairment.

1.12 Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost.

2. Administrative expenses
Included within administrative expenses are re-charges of £7.1 million (2022: £6.1 million) relating to employees within the Group who 
perform services on behalf of the Company.  No employees are directly employed by the Company.

A full list of the Company’s subsidiaries is disclosed in note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.

The additions to investments in the period of £41.7 million relate to the following:

•  Further investment in Admiral Europe Compañía de Seguros (‘AECS’) (£30.7 million);

•  Further investment in Able Insurance Services Limited (‘Able’) (£5.0 million);

•  Further investment in Admiral Financial Services Italia S.P.A (‘AFSI’) (£6.0 million)

An annual impairment review is performed over the carrying value of the investments in subsidiary undertakings, which involves 
comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the 
asset less costs to sell, and the value in use of the subsidiary, calculated using cashflow projections based on financial budgets approved 
by the Group Board.

Elephant
In 2023 a non-cash impairment loss of £19.5 million (2022: £35.2 million) has been recognised by the Parent Company in respect of its 
investment in the Group’s US Insurance business Elephant. The impairment charge is to reflect the loss incurred during 2023 to bring the 
value of the investment to its recoverable amount, being its fair value less costs to sell (equivalent to net asset value), of £36.9 million 
(2022: £56.3 million). The impairment charge is presented within the “Impairment losses” line of the Parent Company Income Statement.

The carrying value is based on fair value less costs of disposal, for which the net assets has been used as a reasonable approximation, using 
tier 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Due to limitations on evidential market information and restrictions in readily available information, net 
assets have been used to estimate fair value less costs to sell.

As the valuation is based on net assets, any movement in future profits will impact the investment held.

Able
In 2023 a non-cash impairment loss of £7.9 million (2022: £nil) has been recognised by the Parent Company in respect of its investment in 
the Group’s UK based insurance business Able. The impairment charge is to bring the value of the investment to its recoverable amount, 
being its fair value less costs to sell (equivalent of net asset value), of £6.1 million (2022: £9.0 million).

AFSI
In 2023 a non-cash impairment loss of £9.8 million (2022: £nil) has been recognised by the Parent Company in respect of its 
investment in the Group’s Italian loans business AFSI. The impairment charge is to reflect the loss incurred during 2023 to bring the 
value of the investment to its recoverable amount, being its fair value less costs to sell (equivalent of net asset value), of £4.7 million 
(2022: £8.5 million). 

The Board continues to explore new adventures and is committed to supporting Able and AFSI in its diversification strategy. 

Impairment charges is presented within the “Impairment losses” line of the Parent Company Income Statement.

The recognition of deferred tax assets is supported by the expected future taxable profits of the UK group.

Legislation to introduce a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% known as the Pillar Two rules was substantively enacted in the 
UK on 20 June 2023 under Finance (No.2) Act 2023. The rules introduce a domestic top-up tax and multinational top-up tax effective 
for accounting periods starting on or after 31 December 2023. There is therefore no related current tax impact for the year ended 
31 December 2023. The Parent Company has applied the temporary mandatory exception to recognising and disclosing information 
about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023. 
Further information can be found in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements.

Held within amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings is £223.7 million (2022: £182.2 million) which relate to loans with formal 
agreements in place between the parent and the subsidiary. The estimated credit losses of these loans has been considered and any 
expected credit loss is considered to be immaterial due to the assessment of credit risk being low due to the positive net value of assets 
of the subsidiaries and future trading projections. 

Of the above amount, £28.5 million is due in greater than one year (2022: £155.1 million).

The dividends proposed in March (approved in April) represent the final dividends paid in respect of the 2021 and 2022 financial years. 
The dividends declared in August are interim distributions in respect of 2022 and 2023.

A final dividend of 52.0 pence per share (£156.2 million) has been proposed in respect of the 2023 financial year. Refer to the Chair’s 
Statement and Strategic Report for further detail.

The profit and loss account of the Parent Company does not include any unrealised profits, therefore the amount available for 
distribution by reference to these accounts is £137.2 million. Interim accounts will be laid before Companies House prior to payment 
of the 2023 Final Dividend in order to demonstrate that profits are available for distribution.   

The Group also has substantial retained profits in its subsidiary companies which are expected to flow up to the Parent Company in due 
course, such that surplus cash generated can continue to be returned to shareholders.

11.  Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 101.8 (k) and not disclosed details of

12. Guarantees and contingent liabilities 
During 2018, a Special Purpose Entity (SPE) was set up in order to secure additional funding for the Admiral Money business, with a 
second such SPE set up in October 2021.  The Company acts as guarantor for certain operational performance conditions of its subsidiary, 
AFSL, as seller and servicer for the SPEs, and indemnifies AFSL in respect of any amount that would have been payable by AFSL for non-
compliance with such performance conditions.

One of the Groups’ previously owned subsidiaries was subject to a Spanish Tax Audit which concluded with the Tax Authority denying the 
application of the VAT exemption relating to insurance intermediary services.   The Company has appealed this decision via the Spanish 
Courts and is confident in defending its position which is, in its view, in line with the EU Directive and is also consistent with the way 
similar supplies are treated throughout Europe.  Whilst the Company is no longer part of the Admiral Group, the contingent liability which 
the Company is exposed to has been indemnified by the Admiral Group up to a cap of £22 million.

A number of the Group’s contractual arrangements with reinsurers include features that, in certain scenarios, allow for reinsurers to 
recover losses incurred to date. The overall impact of such scenarios would not lead to an overall net economic outflow from Admiral 
Group plc.

13. Post balance sheet events
No events have occurred since the reporting date that materially impact these financial statements.  

14. Continued application of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 101 – Reduced Disclosure Framework
Following the first time application of FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework in 2015, the Board considers that it is in the best interests 
of the Group for Admiral Group plc to continue to apply the FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework in future periods. A shareholder or 
shareholders holding in aggregate 5% or more of the total allotted shares in Admiral Group plc may serve objections to the use of the 
disclosure exemptions on Admiral Group plc, in writing, to its registered office (Tŷ Admiral, David Street, Cardiff, CF10 2EH) no later than 
30 June 2024.

Alternative Performance Measures
Throughout this report, the Group uses a number of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs); measures that are not required or 
commonly reported under International Financial Reporting Standards, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) under 
which the Group prepares its financial statements. 

These APMs are used by the Group, alongside GAAP measures, for both internal performance analysis and to help shareholders and 
other users of the Annual Report and financial statements to better understand the Group’s performance in the period in comparison to 
previous periods and the Group’s competitors. 

The table below defines and explains the primary APMs used in this report. Financial APMs are usually derived from financial statement 
items and are calculated using consistent accounting policies to those applied in the financial statements, unless otherwise stated. 
Non-financial KPIs incorporate information that cannot be derived from the financial statements but provide further insight into the 
performance and financial position of the Group. 

APMs may not necessarily be defined in a consistent manner to similar APMs used by the Group’s competitors. They should be considered 
as a supplement rather than a substitute for GAAP measures.

Turnover

Turnover is defined as total premiums written (as below), Other insurance revenue, Other revenue and 
interest income from Admiral Money. It is reconciled to financial statement line items in note 13 to the 
financial statements. 

This measure has been presented by the Group in every Annual Report since it became a listed Group in 2004. 
It reflects the total value of the revenue generated by the Group and analysis of this measure over time provides a 
clear indication of the size and growth of the Group. 

The measure was developed as a result of the Group’s business model. The UK Car insurance business has 
historically shared a significant proportion of the risks with Munich Re, a third party reinsurance Group, through 
a co-insurance arrangement, with the arrangement subsequently being replicated in some of the Group’s 
international insurance operations. Premiums and claims accruing to the external co-insurer are not reflected 
in the Group’s Income Statement and therefore presentation of this metric enables users of the Annual Report 
to see the scale of the Group’s insurance operations in a way not possible from taking the Income Statement 
in isolation.
Total premiums written are the total forecast premiums, net of forecast cancellations written in the underwriting 
year within the Group, including co-insurance. It is reconciled to financial statement line items in note 13 to the 
financial statements.

This measure has been presented by the Group in every Annual Report since it became a listed Group in 2004. 
It reflects the total premiums written by the Group’s insurance intermediaries and analysis of this measure over 
time provides a clear indication of the growth in premiums, irrespective of how co-insurance agreements have 
changed over time. 

Total Premiums 
Written

Earnings per share

Underwriting result 
(profit or loss)

Loss Ratio

The reasons for presenting this measure are consistent with that for the Turnover APM noted above.
Earnings per share represents the profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders, divided by the weighted 
average number of basic shares.
For each insurance business an underwriting result is presented.  This shows the insurance segment result before 
tax excluding investment income, finance expenses, co-insurer profit commission and other net income.  It 
excludes both gross share scheme costs and any assumed quota share reinsurance recoveries on those share 
scheme costs.
Loss ratios are reported as follows:

Reported loss ratios are expressed as a percentage, of claims incurred, on a gross basis net of XoL reinsurance, 
divided by insurance revenue net of XoL reinsurance premiums ceded.

The reported loss ratios use the total claims, and earned premium loss ratios, we use the total claims, and earned 
premium and related income (instalment income, administration fees and ancillary income where it is highly 
correlated to the core product). It is understood that this is consistent with the approach taken by peers, and 
reflects the true profitability of products sold.

Core product loss ratios use the total claims and earned premiums for the core product only. This measure is 
more consistent with that used previously, and are reflective of the performance of the core product in a line 
of business.

The calculations and compositions of the loss ratios are presented within Appendix 1a and Appendix 1b to these 
financial statements. 

Expense Ratio

Expense ratios are reported as follows:

Reported expense ratios are expressed as a percentage, of expenses incurred, on a gross basis excluding share 
scheme costs, divided by insurance revenue net of XoL reinsurance premiums ceded.

The reported expenses ratios use the total expenses ratios, we use the total expenses (excluding share scheme 
costs), and earned premium and related income (instalment income, administration fees and ancillary income 
where it is highly correlated to the core product). It is understood that this is consistent with the approach taken 
by peers, and it is considered to be reflect the true profitability of products sold.

Core product expense ratios use the total expenses (excluding share scheme costs) and earned premiums 
for the core product only. This measure is more consistent with that used previously, and are reflective of the 
performance of the core product in a line of business.

Written expense ratios are calculated using total expenses (excluding share scheme costs) and written 
premiums, net of cancellation provision, for the core product only.

The calculations of the reported expense ratios are presented within Appendix 1a and Appendix 1b  to the 
financial statements.
Combined ratios are the sum of the loss and expense ratios as defined above. Explanation of these figures is noted 
above and reconciliation of the calculations are provided in Appendix 1a and Appendix 1b.
This is the reported insurance segment underwriting result,  divided by insurance revenue net of excess of loss 
premiums ceded.
The total result (ceded premiums minus ceded recoveries) from contractual quota share arrangements, 
excluding the quota share reinsurer’s share of share scheme expenses, finance expenses and onerous 
loss component.
The profit or loss before tax reported for individual business segments, which exclude net share scheme costs and 
other central expenses.
Return on equity is calculated as profit after tax for the period attributable to equity holders of the Group divided 
by the average total equity attributable to equity holders of the Group in the year. This average is determined by 
dividing the opening and closing positions for the year by two.  It excludes the impact of discontinued operations.
Group customer numbers reflect the total number of cars, vans, households and pets on cover at the end of the 
year, across the Group, and the total number of travel insurance and Admiral Money customers.

This measure has been presented by the Group in every Annual Report since it became a listed Group in 2004. 
It reflects the size of the Group’s customer base and analysis of this measure over time provides a clear indication 
of the growth. It is also a useful indicator of the growing significance to the Group of the different lines of business 
and geographic regions. 

The measure has been restated from 2022 onwards to exclude Veygo policies, given the significant fluctuations 
that can arise at a point in time as a result of the short-term nature of the product.
Effective tax rate is defined as the approximate tax rate derived from dividing the Group’s profit before tax by the 
tax charge going through the Income Statement. It is a measure historically presented by the Group and enables 
users to see how the tax cost incurred by the Group compares over time and to current corporation tax rates.

Additional Terminology
There are many other terms used in this report that are specific to the Group or the markets in which it operates.  
These are defined as follows:

Accident year

Actuarial best 
estimate
ASHE 

Claims reserves 

Co-insurance 

Commutation

The year in which an accident occurs. Claims incurred may be presented on an accident year basis or an 
underwriting year basis, the latter sees the claims attach to the year in which the insurance policy incepted.  
The probability-weighted average of all future claims and cost scenarios calculated using historical data, 
actuarial methods and judgement.
‘Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings’ – a statistical index that is typically used for calculating the inflation of 
annual payment amounts under Periodic Payment Order (PPO) claims settlements.
A monetary amount set aside for the future payment of incurred claims that have not yet been settled, thus 
representing a balance sheet liability. 
An arrangement in which two or more insurance companies agree to underwrite insurance business on a 
specified portfolio in specified proportions. Each co-insurer is directly liable to the policyholder for their 
proportional share.
An agreement between a ceding insurer and the reinsurer that provides for the valuation, payment, and 
complete discharge of all obligations between the parties under a particular reinsurance contract.

The Group typically commutes UK motor insurance quota share contracts after 24-36 months from the start of 
an underwriting year where it makes economic sense to do so. Although an individual underwriting year may 
be profitable, the margin held in the financial statement claims reserves may mean that an accounting loss 
on commutation must be recognised at the point of commutation of the reinsurance contracts. This loss on 
commutation unwinds in future periods as the financial statement loss ratios develop to ultimate.   
The tendency for the insurance market to swing between highs and lows of profitability over time, with the 
potential to influence premium rates (also known as the “underwriting cycle”).
The cost of claims incurred in the period, less any claims costs recovered via salvage and subrogation arrangements 
or under XoL reinsurance contracts. It includes both claims payments and movements in claims reserves.
Contractual arrangements whereby the Group transfers part or all of the insurance risk accepted to another 
insurer on an excess of loss (‘XoL’) basis (full reinsurance for claims over an agreed value).
The element of premium, less XoL reinsurance premium, earned in the period.

Gross earned premium (excluding any co-insurer share) plus Other insurance revenue.
NPS is currently measured based on a subset of customer responding to a single question: On a scale of 0–10 
(10 being the best score), how likely would you recommend our Company to a friend, family or colleague 
through phone, online or email. Answers are then placed in 3 groups; Detractors: scores ranging from 0 to 6; 
Passives/neutrals: scores ranging from 7 to 8; Promoters: scores ranging from 9 to 10 and the final NPS score is : 
% of promoters - % of detractors.
The discount rate used in calculation of personal injury claims settlements in the UK. 
Revenue that is considered non-separable from the core insurance product sold and therefore under IFRS 17 is 
reported as insurance revenue. For the Group, this is typically the instalment income, administration fees and 
any other non-separable income related to the Group’s retained share of the underwritten products.
A compensation award as part of a claims settlement that involves making a series of annual payments to a 
claimant over their remaining life to cover the costs of the care they will require. 
A series of payments are made by the policyholder, typically monthly or annually, for part of or all of the duration 
of the contract. Written premium refers to the total amount the policyholder has contracted for, whereas 
earned premium refers to the recognition of this premium over the life of the contract.
A clause found in some reinsurance and co-insurance agreements that provides for profit sharing. Co-insurer 
profit commission is presented separately on the Income Statement whilst reinsurer profit commissions are 
presented within the reinsurance result, as a part of any recovery for incurred claims.

Regulatory Solvency 
Capital Requirement 
(‘SCR’)

The Group’s Regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) is an amount of capital that it should hold in addition 
to its liabilities in order to provide a cushion against unexpected events. In line with the rulebook of the Group’s 
regulator, the PRA, the Group’s SCR is calculated using the Solvency II Standard Formula, and includes a fixed 
capital add-on to reflect limitations in the Standard Formula with respect to Admiral’s risk profile (predominately 
in respect of co-and reinsurance profit commission arrangements and risks relating to Periodic Payment Orders 
(PPOs). The Group’s current fixed capital add-on of £24 million was approved by the PRA during 2023. 

The Group is required to maintain eligible Own Funds ( Solvency II capital) equal to at least 100% of the Group SCR. 
Both eligible Own Funds and the Group SCR are reported to the PRA on a quarterly basis and reported publicly on 
an annual basis in the Group’s Solvency and Financial Condition Report. 

Admiral separately calculates a ‘dynamic’ capital add-on and has used this to report a solvency capital requirement 
and solvency ratio at the date of this report. A reconciliation between the regulatory solvency ratio and that 
calculated on a dynamic basis is included in note 3 to the Group financial statements.
Contractual arrangements whereby the Group transfers part or all of the insurance risk accepted to another 
insurer. This can be on a quota share basis (a percentage share of premiums, claims and expenses) or an excess of 
loss (‘XoL’) basis (full reinsurance for claims over an agreed value).
Scaled Agile is a framework that uses a set of organisational and workflow patterns for implementing agile 
practices at an enterprise scale. Scaled agile at Admiral represents the ability to drive agile at the team level 
whilst applying the same sustainable principles of the Group.
A process by which a group of assets, usually loans, is aggregated into a pool, which is used to back the issuance 
of new securities. A Company transfer assets to a special purpose entity (SPE) which then issues securities 
backed by the assets. 
A ratio of an entity’s Solvency II capital (referred to as Own Funds) to Solvency Capital Requirement. 
Unless otherwise stated, Group solvency ratios include a reduction to Own Funds for a foreseeable dividend (i.e. 
dividends relating to the relevant financial period that will be paid after the balance sheet date).
An entity that is created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective. There are specific restrictions or 
limited around ongoing activities. The Group uses an SPE set up under a securitisation programme.
A projected actuarial best estimate loss ratio for a particular accident year or underwriting year.
The year in which an insurance policy was incepted.
Also referred to as the written basis. Claims incurred are allocated to the calendar year in which the policy was 
underwritten. Underwriting year basis results are calculated on the whole account (including co-insurance 
and reinsurance shares) and include all premiums, claims, expenses incurred and other revenue (for example 
instalment income and commission income relating to the sale of products that are ancillary to the main 
insurance policy) relating to policies incepting in the relevant underwriting year.
