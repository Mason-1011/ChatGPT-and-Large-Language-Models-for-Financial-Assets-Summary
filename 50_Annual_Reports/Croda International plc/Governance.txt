The tables below set out the assumptions used, the risk profile generated and our planned mitigations for each of the four key climate risks 

selected. Our analysis shows that the financial risks they present to Croda could be managed by currently planned mitigating actions meaning that 

we would not have to materially change our strategy or business model and indicating confidence in the resilience of both. The impact of climate 

change is considered under our Accounting Policies, see page 157.

Mitigations and measures

The potential changes in the  
cost of sales that Croda may be 
exposed to has been modelled 
using the future percentage 
increase of palm oil prices 
(Orbitas – Climate Transition Risk 
Analyst Brief: Indonesian Palm 
Oil) against the total volumes  
and price of palm oil derivatives 
purchased by Croda in 2021. 
Indonesia is the dominant origin 
of Croda’s supply.

The cost of palm oil is forecast to 
expose Croda to varying levels  
of risk across the two different 
climate related scenarios – 
Current Policies and Net Zero 
2050 – for which clear models 
are available.

In the Hot House World scenario, the cost of palm 
oil increase is limited, resulting in a low level of 
financial risk to the business out to 2035, at which 
point the cost of palm oil is forecast to drop below 
the 2021 baseline cost resulting in a cost saving 
opportunity for the business, driven by continual 
efficiency improvement in farming technologies 
(partially supported by Croda crop innovation) 
driving prices down.

In an Orderly transition scenario, a predicted 
increase in the cost of palm oil (driven by increasing 
demand for palm oil as an alternative to fossil 
based oils for fuel) is expected to drive initially 
moderate impacts towards critical levels of financial 
risk by 2045.

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified palm oil cultivation  
leads to increased yields due to more efficient farming practices, increasing 
availability of palm and palm kernel oil without further deforestation. Being  
a leading voice in industry and working with coalitions such as Action for 
Sustainable Derivatives (ASD) to drive further industry transition to RSPO 
helps to mitigate the risks associated with increased pricing due to lack  
of availability. 

88.4% of our palm derivative purchases in 2023 were RSPO-certified and 
>99% of purchased volumes in 2022 were mapped back to either refineries, 
mills or plantations, working with ASD. For further details see page 15 of our 
Sustainability Impact Report.

Our focus on high value niches and differentiated products with unique 
characteristics also helps to mitigate this risk by enabling us to pass on raw 
material cost increases to our customers.

(Orderly transition) 

Related targets and metrics 

By 2030, over 75% of our organic raw materials by weight will be bio-based, 
absorbing carbon from the atmosphere as they grow. 59% in 2023∆ and 
59% in 2022 of our organic raw materials were bio-based.

We seek to improve mapping in 2024 to allow future reporting of % revenue 
linked to bio-based raw materials. 

Water Impact - Riverine Flood risk

Driver for assumptions

Risk profile and financial impact

Mitigations and Measures

In all three forecasted climate scenarios (Hot 
House World, Disorderly and Orderly), the 
predicted cost increase as a result of Annual 
Expected Damage from River Floods reaches 
‘high’ levels of financial risk to the business by 
2040. This gradual increase in financial exposure is 
replicated across all four sites in the analysis.

(Orderly transition)

The most at-risk sites were 
identified as either being within 
areas of Extremely High Riverine 
Flood Risk from the WRI 
Aquaduct tool or have recently 
been exposed to flooding events. 

 Using Croda revenue and 
assessment of financial impact 
(loss production leading to lost 
revenue and potential loss of 
business), this scenario assessed 
the possible cost to Croda of 
damage from river floods. The 
cost was modelled across the 
future climate related scenarios in 
line with expected annual growth 
rate (CAGR) and increase in 
Annual Expected Damage from 
River Floods for India from the 
NGFS database. India was 
chosen due to the higher risk  
of flooding at Croda’s sites in  
this area.

Following a specific risk assessment conducted by Croda’s insurers, with 
recommended controls, the residual risk is relatively low to the business. 

Specific measures underway include implementing flood mitigation strategies 
including flood monitoring, hard defences in the form of flood barriers and 
soft defences such as marshland/wetlands. 

Contingency plans and controls are in place for these variations and  
flooding scenarios. Croda has multiple sites which can produce products 
which alleviates this issue, and there is a large investment in the region to 
mitigate this.

To measure our water use impact, Croda developed an internal  
methodology that considers the entire water cycle and accounts for the 
social, environmental, and business impacts of water use. Six Croda sites 
were identified as being located in regions exposed to the highest levels of 
disruption from water impacts (flooding or water stress) and have defined 
realistic water impact reduction roadmaps.

Related targets and metrics:

Reduce our water use impact by 50% from our 2018 baseline: By the end of 
2022 there had been an 18% reduction from the baseline water impact 
score for our six material sites. 

% revenue for sites with significant risk of Flood: 14.9% 2023, 13.7% 2022.

Note this is gross risk and does not account for transfer of production at 
alternative locations.

Dame Anita Frew DBE
Chair

This report, together with the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
set out on pages 106 to 134, describes how the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code principles have been applied 
by the Company. The Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Code for the period under review. The 2018 
UK Corporate Governance Code is available at www.frc.org.uk.

Croda International Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2023

Dear fellow shareholder
It has been a challenging year for our business and whilst the trading 
environment is now beginning to improve, high inflation, rising interest 
rates and customer destocking had a significant effect on our financial 
performance. However, effective governance together with the strength 
of leadership of our Board continued to support the Executive on 
strategic investment through challenging conditions. 

Health and safety continues to be a key focus and is at the top of the 
agenda at every Board meeting. It is also a key focus for site visits, with 
a briefing document prepared so that site specific key health and safety 
information is available in advance of the visit thereby allowing the 
visiting Director to effectively challenge any particular areas of concern 
or educate themselves on good practice for wider learnings. In June, 
the Board attended a safety training day at the Leek site where the 
Group’s safety values were reiterated and the Board was able to 
engage with both process safety protocols and the behavioural safety 
of our employees and contractors. 

The Board remained focused on sustainability and achieving our 
ambition to be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients, 
by becoming Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030. Reflecting 
the Board’s commitment, it approved the creation of a Sustainability 
Oversight Committee to provide the Board with enhanced oversight of 
sustainability matters and strategy implementation as well as ensuring 
compliance with relevant regulations. In July, the sustainability team 
provided the Board with a training session which focused on the 
leadership role the Board has in ensuring that Croda responds to social 
and environmental risks. See pages 98 to 99 for further information on 
the Sustainability Oversight Committee and the Board’s focus on 
sustainability on page 77.

The Board oversaw the introduction of a new organisational model, 
moving to a more agile, simplified matrix structure with all regional 
teams reporting into Consumer Care and Life Sciences to provide  
a solid foundation for the next phase of Croda’s development.  
This will drive greater accountability and responsiveness to customers, 
empower decision-making through the organisation and facilitate  
the onboarding of new talent more effectively. See page 81 for  
more information.

During 2023, the Board continued its oversight and challenge to the 
management team in delivering the Group’s strategy. This included 
taking part in two dedicated strategy sessions with the Executive 
Committee team with discussions focused on the changing market 
environment in Consumer Care and the need for a flexible strategy to 
meet the expectations of consumers. In Life Sciences, time was also 
spent understanding the evolution of the Pharma market towards 
emerging biopharma and genetic medicine modalities and the strategic 
focus on strengthening our current base, accelerating innovation and 
targeting complementary M&A. Further details on our Board strategy 
review can be found on page 77. 

The acquisition of Solus Biotech, a global leader in premium 
biotechnology-derived beauty actives, completed in July following the 
unconditional approval from the South Korean regulatory authorities. 
The acquisition provides access to biotech-derived ceramide and 
phospholipid technologies, and emerging capabilities in natural retinol 
and will significantly strengthen our Beauty Actives portfolio. Located  
in South Korea, Solus expands our Asian manufacturing capability and 
will create a new biotechnology R&D hub in the region. See page 80 
for more information on Solus Biotech.

 
 
The Board is always mindful of the impact of its decisions on our 
stakeholders and on the long-term sustainable success of the 
Company. On pages 78 to 83 we describe how the Board engaged 
with each of our key stakeholders and give some examples of how we 
have considered their interests in some of the Board decisions made 
during the year. The Board owns and oversees our risk management 
programme and has completed a robust assessment of the Group’s 
emerging and principal risks. Further information is on page 51. 

Our success depends on our skilled and highly committed employees 
and throughout 2023 our people have demonstrated their resilience, 
adaptability and determination to persevere in a very tough trading 
environment. During the year the Board met regularly with employees, 
through listening groups, Board presentations and site visits. Further 
details on how we engaged with our employees can be found on 
pages 78 and 84. 

Leadership and diversity 
Board succession planning continued to be a key focus this year  
with my retirement as Chair of the Board at the conclusion of the  
2024 AGM.

During the year the Nomination Committee undertook a search for a 
new Chair to take over when I step down at the AGM at the end of my 
nine-year tenure. Following a comprehensive search process, in 
September we announced that Danuta Gray had been appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director and Chair designate. Danuta joined the Board 
on 1 February 2024, and will succeed me as Chair at the conclusion  
of the AGM in April. Further information about the rigorous selection 
process led by Jacqui Ferguson, our Senior Independent Director,  
can be found on page 96. 

In December we announced that our CFO, Louisa Burdett, would be 
leaving Croda in June 2024. We are sorry that Louisa is leaving but she 
has our very best wishes. A search for her replacement is underway.

Helena Ganczakowski stepped down at the AGM in 2023 having 
served nine years as a Director. I extend grateful thanks, on behalf of 
the Board, for the outstanding contribution she has made to the Board 
and as Chair of the Remuneration Committee over the last nine years. 
Her insight, support and challenge will be missed and we wish her all 
the best. The Board undertook a search for a new Non-Executive 
Director to replace Helena and on 27 April 2023, Chris Good joined  
the Board as a Non-Executive Director. Chris has spent his executive 
career in the consumer care industry with more than 20 years at Estée 
Lauder Companies, a global leader in prestige beauty. Chris’ deep 
understanding of the consumer care industry and in particular his 
insights into beauty care markets and consumers are of great value to 
Croda and the Board. His appointment strengthens the consumer care 
knowledge and experience around the Board table, supporting our 
continued transition to a pure play Consumer Care and Life Sciences 
business. Further details on Chris’ induction can be found on page 97.

We believe that diversity in the Boardroom is essential for innovative 
thinking and improves the quality of decision-making. I am happy to 
report that the composition of the Board continues to exceed the new 
diversity requirements of the FCA Listing Rules as well as the ambitions 
set out in the FTSE Women Leaders Review and the Parker Review for 
FTSE 100 companies. Two of our Board members are from ethnic 
minority backgrounds. We are also comfortably in line with the 
requirement that listed companies should have at least one woman in a 
senior Board position with a female Chair, Senior Independent Director 
and Chief Financial Officer. Further information on Board diversity, 
including the new Listing Rule disclosure requirements, can be found 
on pages 93 to 94.

On the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the Board 
agreed to extend Keith Layden’s appointment for a further year and  
my appointment up to the 2024 AGM. This is in line with our policy  
to review appointments annually once six years’ tenure has been 
completed. Following the retirement of Helena Ganczakowski in April, 
Jacqui Ferguson was appointed as Senior Independent Director. Before 
making a recommendation to the Board, the Nomination Committee 
considers the contribution made to the Board and the Committees  
by the individual and their time commitments. No Director being 
considered for re-appointment took part in any discussion relating to 
their own appointment. Further information about the tenure of other 
Board members can be found on page 95.

Board evaluation
In accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, this 
year’s Board evaluation was externally facilitated and I am pleased to 
report that it confirmed that we continue to operate as a highly effective 
Board with many signature strengths. Details of the Board’s annual 
evaluation are set out on pages 88 to 89. 

Annual General Meeting
Our AGM will be held on 24 April 2024 and provides shareholders  
with a valuable opportunity to communicate with us and this dialogue  
is very important to the Board. As a result of the impact of Covid-19, 
from 2022 we offered shareholders a choice to attend the AGM in 
person or view the AGM remotely via a webcast. Take-up for remote 
attendance has, however, been very low with just one shareholder 
attending remotely in 2023 and no questions having been submitted  
by those attending remotely. In light of the apparent lack of demand  
for remote participation and to avoid unnecessary costs, we have 
decided to arrange our 2024 AGM on the basis that shareholders,  
their proxies and corporate representatives may attend in person 
without broadcasting the event. We will keep shareholder demand  
for remote participation under review in respect of our future AGMs.

It has been my great privilege to work with Croda and to serve as Chair 
of the Board since 2015. I would like to give thanks to my fellow Board 
members and all my colleagues working at Croda for their hard work, 
commitment and support during my nine-year tenure as Chair and I 
wish everyone every success for the exciting future ahead.

Board activity

Board activity in 2023

Board meetings and structure in 2023
Board meetings are the main forum for the Directors to debate,  
review and challenge strategic, operational and governance matters 
concerning the Company, as required to ensure that the Directors 
discharge their duties including under Section 172(1) of the Companies 
Act 2006.

There were six scheduled meetings of the Board during the year plus 
two additional ad-hoc meetings to discuss business performance. 
Board meeting agendas are set through a collaborative process 
between the Chair, CEO and Company Secretary. The Chair ensures 
adequate time is allocated to allow effective discussion, with a typical 
agenda being structured to ensure a balance is maintained between 
reporting, approvals, strategy and governance.

Detailed planning is undertaken to create an annual Board agenda 
programme, which ensures important strategic, operational, financial, 
cultural and corporate governance items are discussed at the 
appropriate time during the year, with additional deep dives into  
key strategic areas. 

In addition to the formal meetings of the Board, a separate Strategy 
Day was held in June, attended by members of the Executive 
Committee and their senior management teams; see page 77 for  
more information. A further five-year strategic plan session was held  
in the autumn.

Singapore, Korea and the US. During site visits, Directors meet a wide 
range of employees and actively participate in workforce engagement 
sessions through listening groups, town halls and informal dinners as 
well as receiving business update presentations. These interactions 
allow Directors to have discussions and receive direct feedback from  
a cross section of employees, which fosters better and more informed

Board agendas and activity in 2023

Reporting – 
backward 
looking

The Board receives reports from members of the 
Executive Committee as well as the Board Committees, 
with reports from the CEO and CFO forming the main 
items for discussion at each meeting.

•  The CEO’s report focuses on strategic and operational 
activities. Safety is always the first matter he reports 
on with a focus on behavioural and process safety 
issues including relevant KPIs. He also reports on key 
Quality KPIs. The performance of each business is 
discussed, including sales, regional activity and 
competitor insights as well as any major customer, 
supplier and regulatory body issues. The global 
market and macroeconomic environments have  
also been a key focus given the challenging  
trading environment. 

Approvals – 
current 
issues

Approvals that form part of the matters reserved for  
the Board include corporate transactions, capital 
expenditure, significant commercial contracts, the 
financial statements, and dividends. For example, 
during 2023 the Board:

•  Approved the trading updates in April and October.
•  Approved capital investments in Guangzhou,  

China and at our sites in Leek in the UK and Lamar  
in the USA.

•  The CFO reports on monthly and year to date sales 
performance, profit, cash flow, cost base, capital 
expenditure and outlook for the year. She also 
reports during the year on performance against 
budget and treasury items (including liquidity) and 
keeps the Board abreast of investor discussions  
and feedback.

•  The Board receives quarterly reports from members 
of the Executive Committee in relation to all aspects 
of the business, including market sectors, regional

Key areas of focus throughout the year

Board focus on sustainability

Sustainability embedded in our decision-making 
During the year the Board remained focused on delivery of our 
sustainability Commitment, which is a fundamental aspect of how  
we work, how we are judged, and how we judge ourselves, as we 
decouple our continued growth and increasing shareholder value from 
our impacts on the environment. 

The Board approved the Group’s annual budget, which includes 
investments to achieve our Commitment and sustainability strategy  
and to ensure sufficient prioritisation of resource to support this. 

Sustainability plays a central role in decision-making with new 
investments having to meet our rigorous sustainability requirements.  
In September the Board approved the development of a greenfield 
manufacturing site at Guangzhou in China to help transform our 
Fragrance and Beauty Actives businesses in support of our fast  
grow Asia strategy. The Board considered the impact on the Group’s 
sustainability commitments, with the use of sustainable materials for 
construction, zero scope 1 emissions, no waste to landfill and progress 
to zero scope 2 emissions by buying renewable electricity as available. 
The acceleration of botanical actives sits alongside traditional Chinese 
medicine using locally sourced ingredients, meeting consumer demand 
for sustainability and ‘clean beauty’. 

The Board decided to proceed with the development of the Pharma 
expansion programme at the Lamar greenfield site in Pennsylvania in 
line with our strategy to grow our Nucleic Acid Delivery business and 
our commitment to contribute to the development and 
commercialisation of 25% of WHO-listed pipeline vaccines. The Board 
also took account of the site’s five-year plan to target a carbon free 
manufacturing footprint. 

In December 2022, the Board approved the acquisition of Solus 
Biotech, a global leader in premium biotechnology-derived ingredients 
for beauty care and pharmaceuticals. The acquisition enhances our 
sustainable biotechnology capabilities as well as consolidating our 
position as a global leader in sustainable actives with a North Asian 
manufacturing and innovation facility. 

Monitoring and awareness 
The Board receives quarterly sustainability reports which include a 
balanced scorecard against our Commitment and enable the Board  
to challenge the pace of change and resource allocation. The Board 

monitored progress against the decarbonisation roadmaps  
produced for all sites in 2022 and oversaw the development of  
scope 3 reporting, including the quantification of downstream 
emissions fundamental to Croda and our customers, and reviewed  
and challenged progress in meeting the key milestones forming part  
of our sustainability commitments. 

During the year a number of site visits were undertaken by our 
Directors and in advance of these a sustainability and safety briefing 
note is prepared to enable the visiting Director to have a Group 
perspective as well as focusing on relevant areas of interest and also 
any areas of concern.

As part of its annual risk review, the Board confirmed that ‘Delivering 
sustainable solutions – Climate and Land Positive’ continues to be a 
principal risk. See pages 51 to 53 for more information on our risk 
management process and pages 59 to 67 for our TCFD disclosures 
including our approach to identifying and assessing climate-related  
risk and integration into the risk management framework.

The Board and Audit Committee reviewed how best to ensure  
that the business complies with relevant standards and that it has 
assurance on the accuracy and reliability of climate-related and other 
sustainability disclosures and approved the appointment of an external 
assurance partner to provide limited assurance of significant climate 
and gender diversity KPIs.

Ensuring the Board has sufficient knowledge and expertise 
The Board determined in the 2022 Board evaluation that sustainability 
was an area that it would benefit from further training given the ever 
evolving regulatory and reporting landscape. In July the Board received 
a sustainability training session focusing on its leadership role in 
ensuring Croda responds to ESG risks and opportunities and the need 
for enhanced transparency to satisfy our stakeholders. The sessions 
helped to improve understanding, explore Croda’s leadership response 
and priorities and enrich the Directors’ own thinking and perspective. 

Following a number of discussions, the Board established the 
Sustainability Oversight Committee. The Committee’s support will be 
fundamental as the Group seeks to manage the risks that come with 
climate change and to navigate through an increasingly stringent 
regulatory environment. Further details are set out in the Sustainability 
Oversight Committee report on pages 98 to 99.

Strategy review
The annual Board strategy review provides a focused opportunity to  
assess and review the Company’s strategy and ensure that it continues  
to be appropriate. In 2023, the theme was delivery in a challenging  
market environment.

In Consumer Care, discussions centred around the changing market 
environment and meeting the social and environmental transparency 
expectations of consumers. In Life Sciences, discussions focused on the 
evolution of the Pharma market towards emerging biopharma and genetic 
medicine modalities and the strategic focus on accelerating innovation and 
targeting complementary M&A. The Board also discussed the alignment  
of Croda’s organisational structure and talent management with future 
growth areas.

The day comprised presentations and break out groups led by members  
of the divisional teams, which encouraged more informal and interactive 
discussion and provided enhanced opportunity for Directors to share their 
external perspectives. A wrap up plenary session at the end of the day 
ensured that agreed actions and follow-up were captured.

existing business and supporting its future growth. The investment would assist 
in the retention of key personnel and expertise as well as supporting the increasing 
customer demand for locally sourced ingredients. It also demonstrated Croda’s 
belief and commitment in the local market and community. The investment 
aligned with Croda’s sustainability strategy and safety priorities by providing a 
state-of-the-art manufacturing facility providing a sustainable, carbon neutral, 
efficient and safe manufacturing facility to support the development of innovative 
and sustainable ingredients.

Having regard to the interests of all stakeholders, the Board concluded that it was

community presence. Increasing the Group’s IP and proprietary know-how would 
provide opportunities for learning and development for both existing employees 
and our new employees from Solus Biotech.

New organisational model
The Board oversaw the introduction of a new organisational 
business model with a more agile, simplified matrix structure to 
provide a solid foundation for the next phase of Croda’s evolution. 
This will drive greater accountability and responsiveness to 
customers, empower decision-making down the organisation  
and facilitate the onboarding of new talent more effectively.

The Board was kept closely appraised as plans were developed 
and progressed so that it could continue to review and evaluate 
the appropriateness of the new structure for execution of the 
Group’s strategy and focus on innovation, sustainability and 
growth, as well as ensuring that the potentially unsettling change 
was introduced sensitively and professionally and in line with 
Croda’s values. 

In considering the needs of the Group’s stakeholders, the Board 
recognised that although some employees would be adversely 
impacted, the new structure was in the best interests of 
employees as a whole as it would provide greater clarity on 
accountabilities and responsibilities with quicker decision-making 
and increased empowerment. It also determined that customers 
would benefit from better service levels and increased innovation, 
and for shareholders, the new structure would lead to a more 
competitive business generating increased revenues and profit.

While it will take time to fully bed down and will inevitably continue 
to evolve, the Board is confident that the new organisational 
model will provide a strong and enduring base on which Croda 
can move forward.

New super refining project
In line with the Pharma strategy to be a leading partner for high 
purity excipients and bioprocessing aids, the Board approved 
investment in additional super refining capabilities at our site  
in Leek.

In reviewing the proposal, the Board considered a number of key 
areas, including an understanding of the new technology required 
and the approach to project management with safety a key 
consideration for employees and contractors. The Board also 
considered the commercial case and the extent to which the 
development of high purity low carbon products would increase 
Croda’s product value proposition across the business. 

In considering investment in the project, the Board considered  
the interests of Croda’s stakeholders and concluded that the 
development would create opportunities for jobs and career 
development and provide a sustainable, efficient and safe 
workplace for employees and the local community. The Board 
also determined that customers and consumers would benefit 
from the enhanced and more sustainable product offering and  
for shareholders the investment would support the development 
of Croda’s Pharma protein delivery strategy.

Shareholder engagement

Approach to engagement
The Board is committed to maintaining regular dialogue with  
investors and communicating in a clear and transparent manner.  
A comprehensive investor engagement programme is led by David 
Bishop, Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs Director, and 
comprises results presentations, investor roadshows, attendance  
at conferences, seminars, site visits and ad-hoc meetings. This 
programme includes direct Board engagement through the CEO  
and CFO.

The Chair and other Non-Executive Directors are also available to  
meet with major shareholders to discuss topics including governance, 
strategy, ESG performance, and remuneration. The Board reviews 
monthly Board papers, meeting presentations and investor feedback 
following roadshows and other events. Direct engagement and  
the feedback it receives gives the Board insight into investors’  
views, helping to inform key decisions and the future direction  
of the Company. 

Our AGM offers the opportunity for all shareholders to meet with the 
Board in-person to receive an update on the business and to engage 
directly with the Board on topics deemed relevant. A number of 
investors and their representatives attended our AGM in April 2023 
where Phil Ruxton, Chief Sustainability Officer (pictured below), gave  
an update on our sustainability commitments and progress to date.  
All results presentations are webcast live and with replay facilities 
available ensuring all investors and analysts have equal opportunities  
to engage with the business. Investors can also sign up to receive 
regulatory alerts at www.croda.com, ensuring they are notified of 
company updates.

Engagement in 2023
In 2023 we met with 369 institutions across 870 interactions, with  
26 of our top 30 investors meeting management at least once. 
Engagement levels were slightly lower than 2022 given the absence of 
any large investor seminars, but nonetheless remained high and above 
FTSE 100 averages based on available benchmarks. Management 
engaged in roadshows after both full year and half year results, as well 
as roadshows in the USA, Germany, and France, ensuring investors 
had the opportunity to engage with them face-to-face.

As the trading environment rapidly deteriorated in the second quarter, 
the Board took the decision to issue an unscheduled trading update  
to the market in June. This was followed by another update in October 
as operating conditions remained challenging. Following both of these 
updates there was significant engagement with investors, with 
management making themselves available to discuss the trading 
dynamics and performance. 

In addition to both in-person and virtual meetings we hosted a range  
of site visits during the year, aimed at enabling investors to build an 
understanding of our operations and what differentiates our business 
first hand. These visits included multiple visits to Rawcliffe Bridge in 
Yorkshire, visits to our Beauty Actives and F&F businesses in France, a 
large group visit to our Seed Enhancement business in the Netherlands 
and various other visits to sites in the USA, Singapore and China.

Common investor questions

1. When do you expect customer destocking to end? 
Through 2023 our largest customers have reduced their inventories, 
impacting our sales volumes. While customers cannot reduce inventory 
levels indefinitely, calling an end to destocking is challenging. In 
Consumer Care, customer inventory levels in 2023 were lower than in 
2022 and our sales volumes improved during the year. Inventory levels 
remained heightened in Crop Protection, with customer destocking 
continuing throughout the year, and demand remained weak in 
Industrial Specialties. 

2. Why have operating margins reduced and will they 
return to previous levels? 
Across the Group we operate 11 large, multi-sector manufacturing 
sites. Historically the markets in which we operate have traded 
somewhat independently of each other, however in 2023 volume 
weakness impacted all our markets. This resulted in utilisation levels 
falling with reduced fixed overhead coverage at these sites impacting 
our margins. While we would expect margins to recover as utilisation 
improves, significant margin expansion will require a broad-based 
improvement across all markets. 

3. What is the future growth profile for the Pharma 
business?
Our Pharma business is focused on fast-growth niches where 
innovation needs are high. We expect the Pharma business to continue 
growing, excluding the Covid-19 lipids, for which we do not anticipate 
any revenue in 2024. Longer-term, our Nucleic Acid Delivery platform, 
which enabled the roll out of Covid-19 vaccines, has a particularly 
exciting growth pipeline with customers developing new mRNA 
vaccines that we expect to start commercialising from 2025. 

4. What is a ‘normal’ level of capital expenditure for the 
business? 
Capital expenditure has been elevated in recent years as we redeploy 
the investment proceeds from the disposal of our PTIC business which 
completed in 2022. This includes our Pharma investment programme 
of £175m which was initiated in 2021 and will continue through 2025. 
Longer-term we anticipate capital expenditure to maintain existing 
assets and provide future growth to be 6-8% of sales. 

5. What is your policy with regard to returning capital to 
shareholders?
Our capital allocation policy prioritises organic capital investment, 
complemented by bolt-on acquisitions and technology investments. 
We aim to maintain a strong balance sheet with net debt of 1-2x 
EBITDA and to make regular returns to shareholders through our 
ordinary dividend, with a track record of more than 30 years of 
progressive dividend growth. Our preference in the current trading 
environment is to retain a strong balance sheet, however, we will 
continue to monitor our capital requirements and make a special  
return to shareholders if appropriate.

The Board and culture

Our Purpose 
Our Purpose, Smart science to improve lives™, is made possible 
thanks to our distinctive values-led culture and the positive impact our 
activities and ingredients have on the environment and world around 
us. Our ambition is to become the most sustainable supplier of 
innovative ingredients and to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 
2030. Our culture governs how we interact with our customers, how 
we work with each other, and guides our relationships with our 
stakeholders. Our customer-focused values of being Responsible, 
Innovative and Together are integral to the way we behave individually 
and collectively and to the way we do business. The Board seeks to 
continually reinforce these values so that the right behaviours cascade 
throughout the organisation, ensuring our culture and behaviours drive 
what we do.

The Board is responsible for assessing, monitoring and promoting our 
culture and understands the importance of setting the right tone from 
the top. The importance of personal traits that reflect Croda’s values 
and culture are a key part of the selection criteria when appointing a 
new Non-Executive Director or, as was the case this year, a new Chair. 
See page 96 for more information on the Chair selection process. 

Monitoring our culture
Great emphasis is placed by the Board on ensuring that our culture  
is aligned to our Purpose, values and strategy and one of the Board’s 
key focus areas is to monitor and assess culture across the Group. 
Although culture is not tangible and cannot be assessed by metrics 
alone, the Board uses multiple information sources and KPIs to help to 
judge and assess how our culture is embedded in the organisation, 
how it shows across employee sentiment, and how it is observed in 
behaviours and trends. These include:

•  Regular meetings with members of the Executive Committee  

and management.

•  Employee survey results and response rates.
•  Feedback from employee engagement. 
•  Quarterly safety and employee wellbeing data. 
•  Feedback from shareholders.
•  Employee retention rates.
•  Diversity and inclusion metrics – such as gender balance,  
balanced shortlists, diversity on development programmes.

•  Ethics and whistleblowing reports.

The Board monitors the results and response rates of the regular pulse 
surveys undertaken during the year by all our employees across the 
Group. Each survey has a focus on particular aspects of culture, for 
example, Croda being a ‘Great place to work’. In 2023 the surveys 
mirrored those of the previous year so that progress on regional and 
local actions to improve the workplace and employee experience could 
be assessed. 

During the year the Board had oversight of initiatives focused on 
facilitating inclusion such as the Solaris programme which supports the 
pipeline of talent from underrepresented groups, including those from 
an ethnic minority. Steve Foots gave a presentation at a Solaris alumni 
session which prompted views from different perspectives and 
increased the understanding of challenges faced by minority groups. 

As a business, we run a number of development programmes for high 
performing and high potential senior colleagues. The senior leader 
mentoring programme enables the Directors and Executive Committee 
members to interact directly with a diverse group of talent from a range 
of functions across the business and support them in their professional 
growth through guidance, support and knowledge transfer. During the 
year, separate sessions of the Group’s Leadership Development 
Group, for high performing and high potential senior colleagues, were 
attended by Steve Foots and Nawal Ouzren. Steve attended a session 
in San Francisco and Nawal attended Ashridge Business School for a 

84

Croda International Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2023

module on Leading with impact and authenticity. Nawal took part in 
group discussions, a Q&A and joined the group for dinner which 
provided her with the opportunity to provide her insights and 
experiences in senior leadership roles and a perspective from the 
Boardroom. A session of the Women Lead Affinity Group in the USA 
was attended by Anita Frew which enabled her to share her experience 
and perspectives as a successful female leader. As well as benefitting 
the participants, these interactions help the Directors to build 
relationships with our highest potential employees and leaders. The 
Board remains engaged in the furtherance of diversity and inclusion 
initiatives across the business.

In June, Croda was included in the Sunday Times Best Places to Work 
following a third-party assessment of culture and workplace experience 
which concluded that Croda reflected good practice for employee 
engagement and wellbeing in the workplace. The nationwide survey 
honours and celebrates Britain’s top employers and is a clear 
representation of the positive experience of our employees and 
Croda’s culture and values. 

Listening to our employees
In view of Croda’s global operations, the Board decided that the most 
effective way of organising its engagement with employees was to 
continue to share the responsibility among all Non-Executive Directors 
and to utilise the variety of mechanisms in place. The Board is 
comfortable that it can continue to rely on alternative methods to 
engage with employees, rather than one of the three methods outlined 
in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.

In addition to formal Board meetings, during the year our Non-
Executive Directors visited operational sites in India, Singapore, Spain, 
France, Denmark, and the USA in order to better understand the 
Group’s businesses and operations in these countries. These visits 
allow the Directors to observe the Group’s operations in action, 
reinforce their knowledge and enable them to experience at first hand 
the culture of the Group. As part of these visits, wherever possible,  
the visiting Director leads workforce engagement sessions including 
listening groups and town halls with a diverse range of employees.  
A wide range of topics are discussed including those that are particular 
to the site and those of a more business and strategic nature. Topics 
which arose during the year included: knowledge management, safety, 
local business opportunities, organisational effectiveness, digitisation 
and data, human performance initiatives, serving customers and 
current trading. Feedback is then provided to the Board on discussions 
held and the Board’s response on key themes and insights is in turn 
relayed back to those employees who attended thereby creating a 
feedback loop between the Board and employees. The Company 
Secretary takes responsibility for any actions requiring follow up. 
Perspectives from employees are taken into account in decision-
making. For example, employee feedback regarding challenges around 
operational effectiveness within a matrix structure was a key factor in 
the development of the Group’s new organisational model. See page 
81 for more details.

As well as individual site visits, during the year the Board undertook a 
safety focused visit to our site at Leek which included discussions with 
the site management team, process engineers and safety managers. 
Extensive construction activities were underway at the time of the visit 
which enabled the Board to understand the additional process safety 
risks and protocols in place. In February the Board held an informal 
lunch with the Product Safety and Regulatory Affairs team at the 
Cowick office. As well as meeting the team, this provided the Board 
with key insights into the areas of innovation, ingredient defence and 
global registrations as well enabling a better understanding of the key 
challenges faced by the team.

Governance of a site visit
Where – the CEO and Company Secretary identify relevant sites that 
are of particular interest in terms of strategic focus, organic 
development or any specific issues. The aim is for the Board to gain 
insight into as wide a range of operations and locations as possible. 

Itinerary – detailed itineraries and agendas are planned and agreed 
well in advance with the local site management teams to ensure 
maximum benefit is derived out of the time available. In advance of the 
visit, Directors receive briefings on safety, sustainability and any other 
relevant matters specific to the site. 

Visit – Directors meet with the local management teams and receive 
presentations on a variety of topics, including safety, strategy, 
sustainability, business and financial performance, distribution and 

marketing. At operational sites, Directors undertake a tour which 
enables direct engagement with process engineers, operators and 
research scientists on the ground. An informal dinner is held to facilitate 
more relaxed interaction with the local team. Workforce engagement 
sessions are usually included and, where possible, customer meetings 
are also organised. 

Feedback – Directors present feedback of their observations to the 
Board and the Company Secretary takes responsibility for ensuring 
that any follow up actions are allocated to individuals with outcomes 
reported to the Board. Feedback from the Board on observations 
following employee engagement sessions is given to employees  
who attended.

Board leadership

The Company is led by an effective and entrepreneurial Board, whose 
role is to promote the long-term sustainable success of the Company, 
generating value for shareholders and contributing to wider society. 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the overall leadership of the 
Group. In this role, it oversees the development and delivery of a clear 
Group strategy in line with our Purpose.

At the date of this report, the Board comprises 11 Directors: the  
Chair; the Group Chief Executive; the Chief Financial Officer; seven 
independent Non-Executive Directors, including from 1 February 2024, 
the Chair designate; and one non-independent Non-Executive Director, 
who was the Company’s Chief Technology Officer until his retirement  
in 2017. The size of the Board allows time for constructive debate  
and challenge on key elements of the Company’s performance  
and strategic projects and enables all Directors’ views to be heard.  
It monitors operational and financial performance against agreed goals 
and objectives and ensures that appropriate controls and systems exist 
to manage risk and that there are the necessary financial resources 
and people with the necessary skills to achieve the strategic goals the 
Board has set. The Non-Executive Directors have a broad range of 
business, financial and international skills and experience, which 
provide appropriate balance and diversity of thought. The Executive 
Directors use the specific areas of expertise of the Non-Executive 
Directors as a source of ideas, experience, as well as challenge when 
developing strategic plans. The Directors’ biographical details are on 
pages 72 to 73. The Board maintains a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its approval. These matters include approving the  
Group’s strategy and budget, material corporate transactions and the 
authorisation of capital expenditure above delegated authority limits. 
They also include matters relating to risk management, approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts, dividends, appointing new Directors

Division of responsibilities 

Chair
The Chair leads the Board and sets the tone from the top, promoting a 
culture of openness and debate and effective communication between 
the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. She creates an 
environment at Board meetings in which all Directors are able to 
contribute to discussions and feel comfortable in engaging in healthy 
debate and constructive challenge.

Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director provides a sounding board for the 
Chair and acts as an intermediary for the Non-Executive Directors, 
where necessary. She is available to shareholders where 
communication through the Chair or Executive Directors has not been 
successful or where it may not seem appropriate. During the year, our 
Senior Independent Director played a critical role in leading the search 
for our new Chair. 

Independent Non-Executive Directors
The role of the independent Non-Executive Directors is central to an 
effective and accountable Board structure as they provide strategic 
and specialist guidance together with effective governance. They 
constructively challenge the Executive Directors and scrutinise the 
performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives 
and ensure all stakeholder views are considered.

Non-independent Non-Executive Director
Having served Croda for 34 years, the latter six of which were as a 
member of the Board, Keith Layden is not considered independent. 
However, because of his experience, Keith contributes strongly to the 
Board’s culture and personality, and adds unique and valuable insight 
as well as constructive challenge to Board discussions, in particular in 
relation to innovation and R&D.

Group Chief Executive 
The Group Chief Executive has day-to-day responsibility for the 
effective management of the Group’s business and for ensuring that 
Board decisions are implemented. He plays a key role in devising and 
reviewing Group strategies for discussion and approval by the Board. 
The Group Chief Executive is tasked with providing regular reports to 
the Board.

Chief Financial Officer
The role of Chief Financial Officer is to bring a commercial and  
financial perspective to the Boardroom. Working with the Group Chief 
Executive, she is responsible for the leadership and management of 
the Company according to the strategic direction set by the Board. 
She leads the global finance function and oversees the relationship  
with the investment community. 

Group General Counsel and Company Secretary
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary is Secretary to 
the Board and its Committees. He works closely with the Chair in the 
formulation of meeting agendas and annual agenda programmes. He 
ensures that Board procedures are complied with and also advises on 
regulatory compliance and corporate governance. This role is to 
support the Chair and the Non-Executive Directors.

Board leadership

The Company is led by an effective and entrepreneurial Board, whose 

role is to promote the long-term sustainable success of the Company, 

generating value for shareholders and contributing to wider society. 

The Board has ultimate responsibility for the overall leadership of the 

Group. In this role, it oversees the development and delivery of a clear 

Group strategy in line with our Purpose.

At the date of this report, the Board comprises 11 Directors: the  

Chair; the Group Chief Executive; the Chief Financial Officer; seven 

independent Non-Executive Directors, including from 1 February 2024, 

the Chair designate; and one non-independent Non-Executive Director, 

who was the Company’s Chief Technology Officer until his retirement  

in 2017. The size of the Board allows time for constructive debate  

and challenge on key elements of the Company’s performance  

and strategic projects and enables all Directors’ views to be heard.  

It monitors operational and financial performance against agreed goals 

and objectives and ensures that appropriate controls and systems exist 

to manage risk and that there are the necessary financial resources 

and people with the necessary skills to achieve the strategic goals the 

Board has set. The Non-Executive Directors have a broad range of 

business, financial and international skills and experience, which 

provide appropriate balance and diversity of thought. The Executive 

Directors use the specific areas of expertise of the Non-Executive 

Directors as a source of ideas, experience, as well as challenge when 

developing strategic plans. The Directors’ biographical details are on 

pages 72 to 73. The Board maintains a formal schedule of matters 

reserved for its approval. These matters include approving the

Independence of Non-Executive Directors 
Croda complies with the Financial Reporting Council’s Reporting Code 
in having experienced Non-Executive Directors who represent a source 
of advice, strong judgement and challenge to the Executive Directors. 
At present there are nine such Directors, including the Chair, the Chair 
designate and the Senior Independent Director, each of whom has 
significant commercial experience. Details of their experience is on 
pages 72 to 73. 

The independence of the Non-Executive Directors is kept under  
review to ensure continuing independence and objective judgement. 
The Chair was independent upon her appointment in 2015 and both 
the Chair as head of the Board and the Chief Executive as head of 
executive management have clearly defined roles. Further information 
on their roles is included on page 86. With the exception of Keith 
Layden, the Board considers that all Non-Executive Directors who 
served during the year are independent in character and judgement, 
with no relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, their judgement. Keith Layden is not considered 
independent, having served as the Company’s Chief Technology 
Officer prior to retirement from the Company and appointment as  
a Non-Executive Director in May 2017. 

Director induction
New Non-Executive Directors receive a tailored induction that focuses 
on the Group’s culture and values, stakeholders, strategy, structure, 
operations and governance. The aim is to enable a new Director to 
integrate into the Board as quickly as possible so that they are able to 
contribute to business and strategy discussions and provide effective 
challenge. Induction programmes are developed by the Company 
Secretary and discussions start well in advance of the appointment 
date to tailor the experience to the existing knowledge and experience 
and include meetings with members of the Board and Executive 
Committee, key senior managers and the Group’s audit partner  
and other key advisers. A schedule of country and site visits is also 
arranged which enables a new Director to gain insight into business 
operations and culture. See page 97 for further information on Chris 
Good’s induction programme this year and the planned induction for 
Danuta Gray for her role as Chair of Croda. 

All new Directors are given access to our electronic Board papers 
which provide easy and immediate access to key documents including 
previous Board and Committee papers; recent reports from the 
external auditor; the Group’s risk register and Schedule of Principal 

88

Croda International Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2023

Risks; the latest budget and strategic plan; recent sell-side analyst 
reports and feedback from our stakeholder engagement programmes; 
information on our sustainability initiatives; matters reserved for the 
Board; the Committee terms of reference and other key policies. 

Training 
All Directors keep their knowledge and skills up to date and include 
training discussions with the Chair in their annual performance reviews. 
As required, professional advisers are invited to provide in-depth 
updates and the Board also receives updates on market trends  
and environmental, technological and social considerations when 
appropriate. The Company Secretary provides regular updates to the 
Board and its Committees on regulatory and corporate governance 
matters and Directors receive training on their duties under Section 
172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 as part of their induction process 
from the Group’s corporate lawyers. All Directors participate in online 
compliance training courses as required, including competition law and 
anti-bribery and corruption. At induction, and as requirements change, 
training is provided on governance, legal and regulatory matters and 
specific training is provided when requested by the Directors. In June, 
the Board attended a site safety training day at Leek where the 
Group’s safety values were reiterated and the Board was able to 
engage with both process safety protocols and the behavioural safety 
of our employees and contractors. In July, the Sustainability team 
provided the Board with a training session which focused on the 
leadership role the Board has in ensuring that Croda responds to  
social and environmental risks. See page 77 for further information.  
To remain up to date with wider issues the Directors are encouraged  
to participate in events hosted by external organisations to develop 
broader perspectives. For example, during the year Chris Good 
attended a sustainability event hosted by Critical Eye to enhance  
his knowledge in this area.

Board evaluation 
The Board undertakes a formal review of its performance and that of its 
Committees each year and, in line with our three-year cycle, this year’s 
review was carried out by an external facilitator. Heidrick & Struggles 
were appointed and were able to build upon their existing knowledge 
of Croda and its Board, following their external review in 2020. The 
process included virtual interviews with all Board members and 
selected executives, an anonymous online questionnaire, in-person 
observations of Board and Committee meetings, and a review of

review was carried out by an external facilitator. Heidrick & Struggles 

were appointed and were able to build upon their existing knowledge 

All new Directors are given access to our electronic Board papers 

of Croda and its Board, following their external review in 2020. The 

which provide easy and immediate access to key documents including 

process included virtual interviews with all Board members and 

previous Board and Committee papers; recent reports from the 

selected executives, an anonymous online questionnaire, in-person 

external auditor; the Group’s risk register and Schedule of Principal 

observations of Board and Committee meetings, and a review of 

relevant documents. Heidrick & Struggles presented a review of their 
findings to the Board at its December meeting highlighting the areas  
of greatest effectiveness as well as areas for development. See below 
for more information on this year’s externally facilitated review. 

The Chair and Non-Executive Directors met without the Executive 
Directors present to allow an additional opportunity to discuss areas 
relevant to the operation of the Board. The Non-Executive Directors 
also met on their own, without the Chair.

The Senior Independent Director met with the Chair to provide 
feedback on her performance following discussions with the other 
Non-Executive Directors and the Executive management to gather their 
views. It was agreed that the Chair remained dedicated to her role and 
that she creates a culture of trust, openness and debate, facilitating an 
atmosphere of challenge whilst encouraging the effective contribution 
of all Board members. 

The Chair met and provided feedback to each Non-Executive Director 
and the Executive Directors. Following these discussions, the Chair 
was satisfied that all the Directors continued to be effective and 
demonstrate commitment to the role, including having time to attend  
all necessary meetings and to carry out all their duties. 

Conflicts of interest
The Board has an established process in place for reviewing and 
monitoring potential conflicts of interests. The Company’s Articles of 
Association allow the non-conflicted members of the Board to 
authorise an actual or potential conflict situation. Directors holding 
significant commitments outside the Company are required to disclose 
them prior to appointment and on an ongoing basis when there are 
any changes. Actual and potential conflicts of interest are included  
on a register which is maintained by the Company Secretary and 
reviewed annually.

During the year the Chair and the Company Secretary discussed  
any potential or perceived conflict of interest with John Ramsay’s 
directorship of DSM/Firmenich following their merger in 2023, and 
concluded that no conflict of interest existed but that this would be 

kept under review. As a precaution, the Board approved any situational 
conflict that may arise.

During the appointment of any new Non-Executive Directors other 
commitments are taken into account, in addition to whether or not  
a conflict or potential conflict would exist. Details of the professional 
commitments of the Non-Executive Directors are included in their 
biographies on pages 72 to 73. The Board is satisfied that these  
do not interfere or conflict with the performance of their duties for  
the Company. 

Board support 
Each Director has access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. Where necessary, the Directors may take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. Board papers are 
made available electronically one week in advance of meetings, which 
ensures that each Director has the time and resources to fulfil their 
duties. A resource centre within the web portal provides access to 
useful information about the Group, including corporate governance 
materials, finance and strategy information, Group policies and 
procedures, and information on topics such as risk and insurance. 
In order to build and increase Non-Executive Directors’ familiarity with, 
and understanding of, the Group’s people, businesses and markets, 
senior managers regularly make presentations at Board meetings. 

Board re-election 
Following the individual performance assessments, the Board is 
satisfied that each Director continues to perform effectively, allocates 
sufficient time for their duties and remains fully committed to their role. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive Directors 
can be viewed at www.croda.com. Contracts for Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors can be inspected during normal business 
hours at the Company’s registered office by contacting the Company 
Secretary and will also be available for inspection at the AGM. The 
Directors, with the exception of Anita Frew, will be proposed for 
election and re-election at the AGM on 24 April 2024 and details  
are in the Notice of Meeting.

Board evaluation 

Outcome
Overall the evaluation concluded that the Board was highly 
effective with many signature strengths. 

Strengths
Board dynamics – the Board is open, collegiate, collaborative, 
approachable, supportive and interested. Egos are noticeably 
absent and there is a high degree of trust with the Board seen as 
‘one’ with good relationships amongst the Directors and with the 
executive team. A strong onboarding process has led to the 
successful integration of new Directors.

Composition – the Board possesses comprehensive coverage 
across all markets and segments of Croda’s businesses with the 
newest Board members bringing a breadth of experience and 
relevant expertise. The composition of the Board is aligned with 
strategy. There has also been an improvement in diversity, both in 
terms of gender and ethnicity as well as background. Overall the 
Board is seen as having the skills and backgrounds to effectively 
steer strategic directions. 

Commitment – all Board members are personally committed to 
Croda’s success and dedicate time outside the Boardroom, for 

example, site visits, sub-committee membership and specialist 
conversations, as needed. Board members come well prepared 
for meetings, aided by a focused agenda and timely issued  
Board packs.

Opportunities and future areas of focus 
Accountability – although there is a high level of challenge  
to executives, this could be greater and the inclusion of more 
data-driven perspectives in Board presentations would enhance 
the evaluation of strategic proposals put forward by the 
executives. Increased use of outside-in perspectives would also 
help to facilitate challenge and bring fresh perspectives to guide 
effective decision-making. 

Culture – whilst recognising the importance and strengths of 
Croda’s culture, consideration should be given to the potential 
need to explore which aspects can be evolved to support the 
business’ next phase of growth. 

Succession pipeline – there is opportunity for the Board to 
place more regular emphasis on Croda’s long-term succession 
and talent pipeline, increasing the time spent on wider executive 
succession as well as regular review of capabilities, skills and 
leadership skills.

Audit, risk and internal control

Fair, balanced and understandable 
To assist the Board in determining whether the Annual Report was  
fair, balanced and understandable, the annual report team prepared  
a Board paper that, amongst other things, reviewed the process of 
preparation of the report, the controls in place to ensure consistency 
and reliability of the underlying information, identified the material 
positive and negative matters referred to in the report to ensure 
balanced content and provided details of the level of senior oversight  
of the content of the report.

The Annual Report and Accounts process is designed to give the 
Board enough time to assess whether it is fair, balanced and 
understandable, as required by the Code. The key themes and 
messages to be included in the Annual Report and Accounts are 
considered by the Board early in the process.

The Board considered whether the Annual Report and Accounts 
contained the necessary information for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy. 
The Directors received a full draft of the Annual Report and provided 
feedback. This review ensures that each Director has an opportunity to 
highlight any areas requiring further clarity as well as suggesting issues 
and areas that were not adequately covered or on which the report 
may have placed too much emphasis.

The key messages in the narrative in the Strategic Report and 
Governance sections of the Annual Report and Accounts were 
reviewed to ensure they were consistent with the financial reporting 
contained in the financial statements. The Board reviewed the new and 
amended APM definitions made during the year and believed that clear 
explanations had been provided for the KPIs.

The Board reviewed whether the Annual Report and Accounts 
disclosed the successes and the challenges that had been faced in  
the period and that the narrative and analysis effectively balanced the 
information needs and interests of each of our key stakeholder groups. 
In particular, the Board had regard to the current macroeconomic and 
geopolitical issues and the potential for wider impact alongside 
continued inflationary pressures.

The framework and layout were considered to be clear and coherent, 
with a consistent tone throughout and clearly signposted linkage 
between all sections, in a manner that reflected a comprehensive 
narrative and highlighted the key messages appropriately throughout. 

Following this assessment, the Board was of the opinion that the 2023 
Annual Report and Accounts are representative of the year and present 
a fair, balanced and understandable overview, providing the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess the Group’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.

Risk management and internal control
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for ensuring the 
maintenance of a sound system of internal controls and risk 
management, in accordance with the guidance set out in the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial Business Reporting 2014, and in the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The Board receives updates on principal 
risks and risk appetite on an annual basis.

Transparent policies and procedures 
Executive management have established an organisational structure 
with clear operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated 
authority which was reviewed by the Board (page 87). In particular, 
there are clear procedures and defined authorities for the following:

Financial reporting and financial statements review
Policies and procedures governing the financial reporting process and 
preparation of the financial statements are owned by the Chief Financial 
Officer and clearly and transparently communicated through the Group 
Policies system. In order to assess the financial statements, the Audit 
Committee regularly reviews reports from members of the finance team 
and the external auditor who is invited to attend the Committee’s 
meetings. When conducting its review the Committee considers 
material accounting assumptions and estimates made by 
management, any significant judgements or key audit matters identified 
by the auditor (pages 143 to 145), compliance with relevant accounting 
standards and other regulatory reporting requirements, including the 
2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, and the accounting policies 
and procedures applied (pages 101 to 103).

Internal audit function
The internal audit function is a key element of the Group’s corporate 
governance framework. Its role is to provide independent and objective 
assurance, advice and insight on governance, risk management and 
internal controls to the Board and Audit Committee and the Group.  
It supports the Group’s strategy and objectives by evaluating and 
assessing the effectiveness of risk management systems, business 
policies and procedures, system and key internal controls. In reporting 
on their reviews, internal audit makes recommendations to address 
issues and improve processes. Once recommendations are agreed 
with management, the internal audit function monitors their 
implementation and reports to the Audit Committee on progress at 
every meeting. See pages 101 to 103 of the Audit Committee report.

The Annual Report and Accounts process is designed to give the

Annual Report and Accounts are representative of the year and present 

a fair, balanced and understandable overview, providing the necessary 

information for shareholders to assess the Group’s position, 

performance, business model and strategy.

Capital investment
The Investment and Performance Committee (a sub-committee of the 
Executive Committee) operates a clearly defined capital expenditure 
process including detailed business plan appraisal, risk analysis and 
authorisation. The Global Capital Project Director has developed  
a framework for managing major capital expenditure, and post-
investment review processes are completed by internal audit  
(at the Audit Committee’s request).

Business risk management 
As described on page 51 the Executive Committee has established  
an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing emerging 
and principal risks. The Board receives updates on principal risks and 
risk appetite on an annual basis and the Audit Committee receives 
reports from internal audit on the effectiveness of mitigating controls  
in place over selected principal risks at each meeting. The Group Risk 
Committee, a sub-committee of the Executive Committee (page 87), 
meets on a quarterly basis to monitor and review both current and 
emerging risks.

Internal controls
There is a documented framework of required internal controls for 
business processes, IT, safety, quality and compliance, which form 
part of our business as usual activities and which are documented  
in controls manuals. Policies governing the internal controls are 
documented in the Group Policies system, which is available online  
to all employees, and each Group policy is owned by a member of the 
Executive Committee. Confirmation that the controls are being adhered 
to is the responsibility of managers, who together with their teams 
complete an annual self-assessment process against all controls which 
provides a snapshot of the control environment at the start of the year. 
Compliance with controls is tested by the internal audit team as part of 
their annual plan of work approved by the Audit Committee each year, 
as well as being tested by other internal assurance providers; see page 
103 for more information.

The Board discharged its responsibility for monitoring the operational 
effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems 
throughout the year using a process which involved:

•  Delegation of review of systems of risk management and internal 
control to the Audit Committee, whose activities are described in 
detail on pages 100 to 105.

•  Receipt of written confirmations from senior management.
•  Board review of the report on significant control weaknesses. 
•  Annual review of risk appetite statements and principal risks  

(page 51).

These processes have been in place for the full financial year up to the 
date on which the financial statements were approved by the Board. 
The systems are designed to mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.

Nomination Committee report

Report of the Nomination Committee

I am pleased to present the Nomination Committee report for the year 
ended 31 December 2023.

Main activities and priorities in 2023

Board changes
A key focus in 2023 was the search for a new Chair to succeed  
me when I step down at the conclusion of this year’s AGM. After  
a comprehensive selection process led by the Senior Independent 
Director, the Board decided to appoint Danuta Gray to succeed me 
and to help steer Croda through this next phase. Danuta joined the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director in February and will be appointed 
as Chair at the conclusion of the AGM in April 2024. The selection 
process was led by Jacqui Ferguson in her capacity as Senior 
Independent Director with the whole Board engaged in the process 
throughout. The independent specialist executive search consultant 
Egon Zehnder (EZ) was appointed to assist the Committee with the 
process. EZ is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for 
Executive Search Firms, and has no other connection with Croda  
or its individual Directors. See page 96 for further information on the 
Chair selection process. 

In April, we welcomed Chris Good to the Board as an independent 
Non-Executive Director. Chris’s deep understanding of the consumer 
care industry and in particular his insights into beauty care markets and 
consumers are of great value to Croda and the Board. His appointment 
strengthens the consumer care knowledge and experience around the 
Board table and supports Croda’s continued transition to a pure play 
Consumer Care and Life Sciences business. Helena Ganczakowski 
retired from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM in April and on 
behalf of the Committee and the Board I would like to thank Helena  
for her outstanding contribution to the Board, both as Remuneration 
Committee Chair and Senior Independent Director, for her insight and 
support. Jacqui Ferguson has taken on the role of Senior Independent 
Director, in addition to her role as Remuneration Committee Chair.

In December we announced that our CFO, Louisa Burdett, would be 
leaving Croda in June 2024 having accepted another role as CFO. We 
are sorry that Louisa is leaving but she has our very best wishes when 
she departs this summer. A search for her replacement is underway.

The process for Board appointments is led by the Nomination 
Committee which makes recommendations to the Board for approval. 
It is the Nomination Committee’s responsibility to keep Board 
composition under review, including Director independence and 
tenure. During the year the Committee reviewed the composition and 
skills of the Board using the skills matrix on page 95 as well as taking 
into account recent and likely future Board changes. Following review, 
it decided to initiate a search for an additional Non-Executive Director 
with recent and relevant financial experience to further strengthen the 
composition of the Audit Committee. The Committee is using an 
external search firm to assist in this process and we will report on the 
outcome of this process in due course. 

Keith Layden’s and my own appointment were considered by the 
Committee. My term was extended up to the 2024 AGM and Keith’s 
for another year. This is in line with the Nomination Committee policy 
that once a Non-Executive Director has served six years, any extension 
to their term is on a year by year basis. 

“This year the Committee spent significant 
time searching for a new Chair of the 
Board. After a comprehensive selection 
process led by the Senior Independent 
Director, the Board decided to appoint 
Danuta Gray to succeed me and to help 
steer Croda through this next phase.”

Dame Anita Frew DBE
Chair of the Nomination Committee

The Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed annually and 
can be found in the governance section at www.croda.com.

Diversity and inclusion
As a global organisation, we aim to recruit talented people that reflect 
the diverse nature of the countries in which we operate. We value the 
unique contributions that each employee brings to our business, and 
we are committed to creating an inclusive work environment where all 
our employees can fulfil their full potential. Diversity at Board level and 
throughout the organisation provides a broad range of perspectives, 
supporting the achievement of our strategy and contributing to our 
success and the Board views all aspects of diversity as important 
considerations when reviewing its composition. Our Board Diversity 
Policy, a copy of which is available in the corporate governance  
section at www.croda.com, is reviewed regularly and confirms our 
commitment to meeting or exceeding the target set by the FTSE 
Women Leaders and Parker reviews and our current Board 
composition exceeds the targets recommended. 

We are also pleased to report on the new Board diversity targets 
introduced in the Listing Rules in 2022. Our chosen reference date  
is 31 December 2023 and, as at that date, the Company had met  
all three of the Board diversity targets of having 40% women on the 
Board, at least one ethnic minority director on the Board and having  
a woman in at least one senior Board role. We exceed all these 
requirements with a fully gender balanced Board, two Board members 
from ethnic minority backgrounds and three women in the senior 
Board positions of Chair, Senior Independent Director and Chief 
Financial Officer. Since the reference date, Danuta Gray was appointed 
to the Board as Chair designate and following Danuta’s appointment, 
we continue to meet all three of the new Board diversity targets. We 
have not set any targets for senior management, but this is something 
we will be considering. In line with the new Listing Rule disclosure 
requirements, more detailed information relating to the gender and 
ethnic diversity of Croda’s Board and Executive Committee can be 
found in the tables on page 94. 

As at 31 December 2023, the gender balance of the Executive 
Committee and senior management teams (direct reports to the 
Executive Committee) stood at 39% female. We continued to increase 
the diversity of our leaders below Board and Executive Committee 
level. 40% of our Senior Leadership Group (comprising 36 of our most 
senior employees) are female, with the Senior Leadership Group made 
up of employees across 12 nationalities. While appointments at all 
levels will continue to be made based on skill and ability, all forms of 
diversity are key to ensuring that we have the right mix of backgrounds, 
knowledge and experience to meet our future business needs. 
Although there continues to be work to do to create further diversity 
and gender balance in the underlying management teams, diversity 
and inclusion is central to succession planning discussions and critical 
to the long-term sustainable success of our business. 

Succession planning
The Committee and the Board oversaw the introduction of a new 
Group organisational structure with all regional teams reporting into 
Consumer Care and Life Sciences to simplify business processes  
and ways of working. Some changes were made to the Executive 
Committee with the team reducing from ten to eight as regional  
delivery and central research were absorbed into each business. 
Sandra Breene was appointed as President Consumer Care and 
Daniele Piergentili continued in his role as President Life Sciences. 

Anthony Fitzpatrick will take on the expanded role of President 
Corporate Development and Industrial Specialties, Mark Robinson will 
continue in his role as President Operations and Michelle Lydon will 
continue as President Human Resources. Tom Brophy, our Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary, was also appointed as 
President Sustainability. The restructuring also provided opportunities 
in the underlying management teams for several individuals identified 
through the organisation’s review of talent and succession process.

Director induction
All Directors receive a comprehensive induction programme. This is 
tailored through discussion with the Chair and the Company Secretary 
and considers existing expertise and any Committee roles. All new 
Directors are given access to our electronic Board papers which 
provide easy access to key documents. Chris Good joined the Board 
in April and his induction started immediately to ensure that he had an 
understanding of our Purpose, the environment in which we operate 
and our core business activities as soon as possible. Further 
information on Chris’ induction programme is on page 97. During 2024 
the Company Secretary will be working closely with Danuta Gray on a 
comprehensive induction programme for her role as Chair of Croda. 

Other activities of the Committee 
The Committee reviewed the time commitment of the Non-Executive 
Directors which is assessed before appointment and on an annual 
basis thereafter. The Committee was satisfied that all the Non-
Executive Directors remain able to commit the required time for  
the proper performance of their duties. 

The Committee considered and concluded that, except for Keith 
Layden, all the Non-Executive Directors continue to fulfil the criteria  
of independence. As Keith was formerly an Executive Director of the 
Company, he is not currently considered to be independent.

This year’s annual Committee evaluation was externally facilitated by 
Heidrick & Struggles who have no other connection with the Company 
or individual Directors. The evaluation confirmed that the Nomination 
Committee was effective and well led with strong operating 
mechanisms. The very thorough and robust process led by the Senior 
Independent Director to find a successor for the current Chair was 
highlighted. See page 89 for further information on this year’s Board 
evaluation and page 96 for the Chair selection process. 

Looking ahead, the focus will be on the handover and transition  
to Danuta as the new Chair and to ensure an effective induction 
programme to support this. We will continue with the search process 
for a new CFO and a Non-Executive Director to ensure that the Board 
maintains an appropriate balance of skills, experience, knowledge  
and diversity.

Nomination Committee report continued

Chair of the Board selection process

Background
As Dame Anita Frew approached her ninth year on the Board,  
in 2023 a search commenced for her successor. Following  
a selection process involving five search firms, the Company 
appointed Egon Zehnder (EZ), an independent specialist 
executive search consultant to assist with the process. EZ has  
no other connection with the Company and has signed up to the 
diversity Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms. 
Helena Ganczakowski as the Senior Independent Director and 
subsequently Jacqui Ferguson who succeeded Helena as Senior 
Independent Director, led the process. 

Board discussion
Following individual discussions by EZ with each Board member, 
a set of objective criteria were defined, including the experience, 
leadership competencies and personal and cultural attributes 
required to fulfil the role of Chair and meet the requirements of 
Croda in the future.

Nomination Committee process
The Nomination Committee appointed a sub-committee, 
comprising Helena Ganczakowski, Jacqui Ferguson, Roberto 
Cirillo, Keith Layden and John Ramsay, to focus on the search 
and selection process. The sub-committee met regularly and 
reported back to the Nomination Committee.

Based on the role specification and having regard to the Board 
Diversity Policy, a longlist of potential candidates, from both the 
UK and overseas, was identified. Following an evaluation in 
relation to the assessment framework of potential, personality, 
leadership and experiential fit, seven candidates were selected  
for stage one interviews with EZ and Helena and Jacqui.  
Five candidates were then invited to proceed to a stage two 
interview with the rest of the members of the sub-committee.

Two final candidates were then invited to proceed to stage  
three of the selection process, which included interviews with 
Non-Executive and Executive Directors, the Chair and the 
President Human Resources. The candidates also visited 
Croda’s offices and laboratories in Cowick where the candidates 
met with members of the Executive Committee and their senior 
teams, enabling them to gain first hand insight into Croda and  
its culture. 

Nomination Committee and Board approval
Following detailed due diligence and feedback carried out by  
the Nomination Committee, it was determined that Danuta Gray 
possessed the required skills and experience to carry out the role 
and that she would bring sound leadership to Croda. She was 
considered the ideal candidate to promote the long term success 
of the Company for the benefit of all stakeholders and the Board 
approved her appointment as a Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 1 February 2024 prior to becoming Chair at the conclusion of 
the AGM in April 2024.

“I am delighted that the comprehensive 
search process for our next Chair has 
resulted in the appointment of Danuta. 
Danuta is a highly experienced Non-
Executive Director and Chair with a 
deep understanding of growing 
consumer focused and high 
technology businesses in international 
markets. She has served on the 
Boards of a variety of listed companies 
and her depth of Boardroom 
experience and strong understanding 
of UK governance will be of enormous 
benefit to Croda.”

Croda induction

Chris Good’s induction
The Company provides new Directors with a comprehensive 
induction programme tailored to their experience, background 
and relevant Committee membership. 

Chris Good joined the Board in April and his induction started 
immediately. He met with our corporate advisers and received 
briefings on the role and responsibilities of being a UK listed 
Company Director and matters relevant to his Committee roles. 
New Directors are encouraged to engage with the business and 
Chris met and heard from members of the Executive Committee 
and their teams responsible for the delivery of the Group’s 
strategy and key business operations. This enabled him to gain a 
deeper understanding of our Purpose, the environment in which 
we operate and our core business activities. He also visited a 
number of our sites both in the UK and overseas, including 
Rawcliffe Bridge and our Centre of Excellence in Goole, as well  
as sites in Singapore, France, Denmark, Mevisa and the US 
where he was able to observe our operations in action and meet 
colleagues to gain further insight into our culture and business 
operations. In the USA Chris also attended meetings with some  
of our key customers to better understand the challenges faced  
in the current business environment.

As the new Chair of the Sustainability Oversight Committee,  
Chris held a number of deep dive sessions with the Group 
Sustainability team and sustainability experts in the business,  
as well as attending external training and networking sessions in 
relation to sustainability. This has enhanced his knowledge and 
understanding of our sustainability strategy framework and how 
our Purpose is embedded into our culture, with our ambition to  
be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients and our 
Commitment to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030. 

“I received a comprehensive and tailored induction that provided 
me with the knowledge and information I needed as a first time 
Non-Executive Director and clarity on the key issues facing the 
Group, all of which was incredibly insightful. It was great to hear 
first-hand from a wide range of colleagues about the Group’s 
operations and I was particularly keen to listen to our customers 
and gain a deeper understanding of our relationship with them.  
I have been made to feel very welcome by the Board and all my 
Croda colleagues, and the induction has enabled me to hit the 
ground running and participate fully in Board and Committee 
meetings. I already knew that Croda was a truly sustainable 
company but to see a range of the projects in action has  
been invaluable.”

Chris Good
Non-Executive Director

Danuta Gray’s planned induction programme
The programme is structured to provide the information needed to engage in Board meetings in the same way as for other Non-Executive 
Directors joining the Board and then further expanded to develop the oversight required as Chair. In addition to time spent with senior 
management to understand areas of focus, time will be scheduled with Anita Frew in the three months prior to her retirement to gain her 
insights as Chair.

Sustainability Oversight Committee

Report of the Sustainability  
Oversight Committee 

I am pleased to present our first Sustainability Oversight  
Committee report. 

Following a number of discussions by the Board, the Audit Committee 
and Croda’s sustainability team during 2023, the Board established 
the Board level Sustainability Oversight Committee. The Committee’s 
support will be critical as the Group seeks to deliver on its 
sustainability leadership ambitions, manage climate and nature related 
risk, and navigate an increasingly complex and comprehensive ESG 
regulatory environment. 

The Board approved the Committee’s terms of reference (which can 
be found in the governance section at www.croda.com) and agreed 
that the responsibilities of the Sustainability Oversight Committee 
would be strategically focused, with the Audit Committee providing 
assurance on the accuracy and reliability of the Group’s sustainability 
disclosures through the oversight of the control environment in relation 
to data and information used in support of such disclosures. 

Committee membership
The Committee comprises myself as Chair and Jacqui Ferguson,  
Keith Layden and Nawal Ouzren as members. All other Directors are 
invited to attend Committee meetings, as are the CEO, CFO, Chief 
Sustainability Officer and the Group General Counsel, Company 
Secretary and President Sustainability. 

Key responsibilities
Croda’s sustainability strategy will continue to be developed by the 
Executive Committee and approved by the Board with the role of the 
Sustainability Oversight Committee to:

•  Monitor the execution and implementation of the sustainability 

strategy, including performance against KPIs

•  Monitor compliance with sustainability policies, regulations and  

best practice

•  Support the Board by considering in more depth the Group’s 

principal sustainability risks and opportunities

•  Oversee communication of the Group’s sustainability activities, 

including review of the sustainability reporting in the Annual Report

•  Provide input to the Board and other Board Committees on 

sustainability matters as required

Complementing the Committee’s role, the Audit Committee will 
continue to be responsible for overseeing the assurance programme 
of Croda’s sustainability commitments and the Remuneration 
Committee will continue to be responsible for monitoring and 
approving sustainability linked performance metrics as well as the 
alignment of senior executives’ individual objectives with Group 
sustainability goals. Cross Committee representation and collaboration 
will continue to provide a link between all the Board Committees and 
to ensure alignment. 

“At Croda, we recognise the fundamental 
importance of taking action to drive 
progress against our sustainability 
leadership agenda. The establishment  
of the Board Sustainability Oversight 
Committee reflects the Board’s continued 
commitment and focus in this area.”

Chris Good
Non-Executive Director

Detailed responsibilities are set out in the Committee’s terms  
of reference. They can be found in the governance section at 
www.croda.com.

Specific focus areas in 2024
Looking ahead, the Committee has identified the following areas of

and beyond.

Audit Committee report

Report of the Audit Committee 

Dear fellow shareholder,

Report of the Audit Committee for the year ended 
31 December 2023
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the year ended 
31 December 2023. This report provides shareholders with an 
overview of the work undertaken by the Committee and the key areas 
considered when monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
reporting and the effectiveness of its system of internal control and risk 
management processes. 

During the year, I received regular updates from the CFO, the wider 
global finance team, KPMG’s Lead Audit Partner and the VP Risk and 
Assurance. The dedication and commitment from the Croda executive 
management team, the audit teams and Croda employees have once 
again delivered high-quality and robust audit processes.

In December we announced that our CFO Louisa Burdett will be 
leaving the business in June 2024. Louisa is leaving with our best 
wishes and a search for her successor is in hand, a process that  
is well underway and one in which I am heavily involved.

Committee membership and attendance
The Committee at the end of the year comprised six independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The experience of each Board member is 
outlined on pages 72 to 73. The Board considers that all members  
of the Audit Committee have the appropriate and relevant level of 
experience in financial matters as well as a diverse and broad range  
of competence relevant to the sector focus and the future strategic 
direction of the Group.

These skills and my own experience of over 30 years in international 
finance and extensive experience as an audit committee chair provide 
the Board with assurance that the Committee has the appropriate  
skills and breadth and depth of experience to ensure that it can be  
fully effective. Nevertheless a further Non-Executive Director is being 
sought for the Audit Committee who also has financial and accounting 
expertise. It also meets the Code requirement that at least one member 
has significant, recent and relevant financial experience.

The Chair of the Board, Keith Layden (a Non-Executive Director), the 
Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial 
Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance (who leads the internal audit 
function) and representatives from the external and internal auditors 
attend the meetings by invitation.

The Committee met five times during the year and has met twice  
since the financial year end with each meeting agenda including a 
range of topics across the Committee’s areas of responsibility. The 
Committee works to an agreed structured programme of business  
and meetings to coincide with key events around our financial calendar 
and, on behalf of the Board, to provide oversight of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control process. I report formally to the 
Board on the Committee’s activities after each meeting. 

To ensure the work of the Committee remains focused on the key and 
emerging issues, I regularly meet and speak separately with the CFO, 
the Group Financial Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance and the 
internal and external auditor. Meetings without the Executive Directors 
present are also held with the internal and external auditors to facilitate 
open dialogue and assurance. Before each Committee meeting, I also 
meet with the external auditors, the Group Financial Controller and the 
VP Risk and Assurance and before most meetings with the CFO to 
discuss control and compliance issues generally and specifically the 
detail of the year end and half year results, accounting judgements and 
disclosures. This helps me to ensure there is a shared understanding of 
the key issues, technical matters and judgements and to make sure 
sufficient time is devoted to them at the meetings.

“The Committee thanks the executive 
management team, the audit teams and 
Croda employees across the Group for 
their dedication and commitment to 
maintaining high standards of internal 
control and risk management in the  
current challenging market environment.”

John Ramsay
Chair of the Audit Committee

Detailed responsibilities are set out in the Committee’s terms of 
reference which are reviewed regularly. They can be found in the

  See page 103 for progress on these areas

Committee activity in 2023
The Committee’s core activities, as well as the additional focus areas, 
and an estimate of the proportion of time spent on them, are: 

•  Reviewed consideration given by management relating to various 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) thematic reviews and guidance  
for financial reporting.

Financial reporting (25%)

The Committee:
•  Monitored the Group’s financial statements and results 

announcements, including the Annual Report and the interim 
statement, and with support from the external auditor, reviewed 
those items in the Group’s financial statements that were material  
to our reporting. The Committee challenged management on the 
statements and the underlying accounting judgements, including 
goodwill impairment considerations, acquisition and hedge 
accounting considerations for the Solus Biotech acquisition and 
hyperinflationary accounting considerations. Following its review,  
and after considering the evidence and accounting papers provided 
by management, the Committee was satisfied with the explanations 
provided. Consideration was given to the appropriateness of 
accounting policies, critical accounting judgements and key  
sources of estimation of uncertainty. Recommendations were  
made to the Board supporting the half and full-year accounts  
and financial statements.

•  Monitored the Group’s financial performance and ensured that 

management’s judgements and estimates remained reasonable  
and prudent considering the two unscheduled trading updates 
issued in 2023.

•  Reviewed the Group’s external reporting framework and use of 
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) and the updated and 
new definitions to assess ongoing appropriateness. The Committee 
was satisfied that the APMs reviewed were consistent with market 
practice of both the peer group and wider FTSE 100 companies, 
and that disclosures and reconciliations to statutory measures  
were appropriate. 

•  Assessed the impairment testing reviews on goodwill balances on 
the Group’s balance sheet and was satisfied with the output of the 
reviews. In conjunction with the Board, challenged management  
on the assumptions and forecasts behind the financial modelling  
and stress testing conducted for the going concern assessment.  
A recommendation was made to the Board to support the going 
concern statement. Further information can be found on page 157.
•  Reviewed the viability assessment process undertaken in support  
of the long-term viability statement, based on severe but plausible 
scenarios (including different combinations of scenarios) arising from 
key risks and their impact on headroom and debt covenants. The 
Committee challenged the assessment period, assumptions and 
calculations in the modelling and scenarios, noting the effect they 
would have during the viability period and was satisfied that they 
were robust and well thought through. The Committee also 
considered and was satisfied with the appropriateness of the 
three-year period for assessing the viability and the severity of the 
stress-testing scenarios. A recommendation was made to the Board 
to support the long-term viability statement. Further information can 
be found on page 58.

•  Undertook regular reviews of the Group’s litigation. The Committee 
receives reports twice a year from the Group General Counsel, 
Company Secretary and President Sustainability and was satisfied 
with the approach to provisioning and disclosure.

•  Reviewed the accounting treatment of the Solus Biotech acquisition, 
including the purchase price allocation, the identification of cash 
generating units (CGUs) and the appropriateness of the foreign 
exchange hedge accounting applied to the acquisition. Impairment 
is not considered to be a key area of focus despite low headroom 
on the basis it is trading in line with expectations post-acquisition.

Dear fellow shareholder,

31 December 2023

I am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the year ended 

31 December 2023. This report provides shareholders with an 

overview of the work undertaken by the Committee and the key areas 

considered when monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 

reporting and the effectiveness of its system of internal control and risk 

management processes. 

During the year, I received regular updates from the CFO, the wider 

global finance team, KPMG’s Lead Audit Partner and the VP Risk and 

Assurance. The dedication and commitment from the Croda executive 

management team, the audit teams and Croda employees have once 

again delivered high-quality and robust audit processes.

In December we announced that our CFO Louisa Burdett will be 

leaving the business in June 2024. Louisa is leaving with our best 

wishes and a search for her successor is in hand, a process that  

is well underway and one in which I am heavily involved.

Committee membership and attendance

The Committee at the end of the year comprised six independent 

Non-Executive Directors. The experience of each Board member is 

outlined on pages 72 to 73. The Board considers that all members  

of the Audit Committee have the appropriate and relevant level of 

experience in financial matters as well as a diverse and broad range  

of competence relevant to the sector focus and the future strategic 

direction of the Group.

These skills and my own experience of over 30 years in international 

finance and extensive experience as an audit committee chair provide 

the Board with assurance that the Committee has the appropriate  

skills and breadth and depth of experience to ensure that it can be  

fully effective. Nevertheless a further Non-Executive Director is being 

sought for the Audit Committee who also has financial and accounting 

expertise. It also meets the Code requirement that at least one member 

has significant, recent and relevant financial experience.

The Chair of the Board, Keith Layden (a Non-Executive Director), the 

Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial 

Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance (who leads the internal audit 

function) and representatives from the external and internal auditors 

attend the meetings by invitation.

The Committee met five times during the year and has met twice  

since the financial year end with each meeting agenda including a 

range of topics across the Committee’s areas of responsibility. The 

Committee works to an agreed structured programme of business  

and meetings to coincide with key events around our financial calendar 

and, on behalf of the Board, to provide oversight of the Group’s risk 

management and internal control process. I report formally to the 

Board on the Committee’s activities after each meeting. 

To ensure the work of the Committee remains focused on the key and 

emerging issues, I regularly meet and speak separately with the CFO, 

the Group Financial Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance and the 

internal and external auditor. Meetings without the Executive Directors 

present are also held with the internal and external auditors to facilitate 

open dialogue and assurance. Before each Committee meeting, I also 

meet with the external auditors, the Group Financial Controller and the 

VP Risk and Assurance and before most meetings with the CFO to

detail of the year end and half year results, accounting judgements and 

disclosures. This helps me to ensure there is a shared understanding of 

the key issues, technical matters and judgements and to make sure

“The Committee thanks the executive

their dedication and commitment to 

maintaining high standards of internal 

control and risk management in the  

current challenging market environment.”

Audit Committee report continued

•  Reviewed and approved the response to the FRC request for 

information from its review of the Group’s 2022 Annual Report as 
part of its routine monitoring of corporate reporting, specifically to 
clarify whether the Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme was 
open to future accrual and how the Company expected to recover 
the scheme surplus through reduced future contributions. We were

We agreed to update our disclosures to make it clearer that the  
UK scheme remains open to future accrual and to new members. 
The letter also included suggestions concerning areas where the 
FRC believes users of the accounts would benefit from minor 
improvements to the Group’s existing disclosures. Our response 
enabled the FRC to close its enquiries. The FRC review is limited  
to the 2022 Annual Report, and it does not benefit from detailed 
knowledge of our business or an understanding of the underlying 
transactions entered into. Accordingly the review and comments 
received from the FRC provide no assurance that the Annual Report 
is correct in all material respects. 

•  Received presentations from the divisional Finance Directors of Latin 
America and Life Sciences which enabled the Committee to gain 
confidence in the depth of finance capability employed in the 
divisions as well as providing different perspectives and insights. 

Governance (10%)

The Committee:
•  Reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s anti-bribery and fraud 
procedures, including those for whistleblowing. The Committee 
received a report on the independent investigations that had been 
conducted in response to concerns raised under the whistleblowing 
and fraud policies and was satisfied with the conclusions, including 
follow-up actions. The Committee also reviewed a summary of the 
controls in place to mitigate the risk of fraud in the Group, along  
with a bottom-up fraud risk assessment prepared by management. 
The Committee was satisfied that the ethics and fraud programmes 
were effective. 

•  Undertook an external evaluation of the Committee’s effectiveness. 
Information on the evaluation process can be found on page 89.  
The results of the review concluded that the Committee continued  
to be effective. 

•  Compared its remit favourably with the FRC’s recently published 

‘Minimum Standards for Audit Committees’.

•  Reviewed the Committee’s terms of reference and confirmed that 
the role and responsibilities of the Committee are aligned with the 
2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. Minor changes were made 
to confirm the Committee’s assurance and monitoring role in relation 
to the Group’s sustainability disclosures.

•  Undertook its annual legal and compliance review of the corporate 

governance and regulatory requirements of the Committee, 
concluding that it was in full compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code and other corporate governance requirements.
•  Completed its annual review of the Group’s tax compliance policy 
and risks relating thereto. No significant updates were required.  
The policy is available at www.croda.com. 

•  Considered the impact of the retraction of UK corporate reform 
legislation on Croda’s preparation for the expected changes  
to legislation:

 – The Committee agreed that the work to enhance control design 
by standardising and leveraging automation should continue,  
as this would provide the benefit of improving visibility of control 
performance through consistent and accessible control evidence, 
which will be underpinned by the implementation of a new 
Integrated Risk Management system in 2024.

 – Work will continue on scoping ‘material information’ in relation  

to sustainability reporting given its strategic importance to Croda 
to ensure that reported sustainability information is materially 
accurate. The scoping work around ‘double materiality’ (impact 
and financial materiality) is also required under upcoming 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) legislation. 
 – Even though the proposal for a Fraud Statement was withdrawn, 
given the introduction of legislation regarding ‘failure to prevent 
fraud’, work in this area will continue. See page 53 for details  
on what has been done in 2023.

 – Although the Company will no longer need to publish an Audit 
Assurance Policy, the Committee believes it will be of value to 
Croda’s risk management programme to produce a 
comprehensive assurance map, which will allow a better 
assessment of the level of assurance currently in place, and 
gauge the appetite for more or less assurance over specific risks. 

 – The proposal to publish a resilience statement was withdrawn. 
Given the continued requirement for the Company to publish 
long-term viability and going concern statements, the Committee 
agreed that publication of a resilience statement would not add 
additional value to Croda’s stakeholders.

 – Monitoring the introduction of the revised corporate reforms will 

continue to be a focus area for the Committee in 2024. 

External audit (25%)

The Committee:
•  Discussed and approved the external audit plan, including the 

assessment of significant audit risks; the engagement risk profile;  
the use of data analytics; the scope of the audit in terms of 
coverage, the materiality level and the de minimis reporting 
threshold; the co-ordination of external audits; and the key members 
of the engagement team. The Committee monitored the progress 
made by the statutory audit team against the agreed plan and 
discussed issues as they arose.

•  Discussed and approved the increase to the external audit fee. 

Information on the audit fees can be found in note 3 on page 166.

•  Agreed with the auditor that there should be sufficient focus on 

areas of particular concern to the Committee (e.g. the acquisition  
of Solus Biotech and carrying value of goodwill in respect of the 
Flavours CGU).

•  Reviewed in-depth a range of indicators to judge the overall audit 
quality as described in the auditor effectiveness considerations on 
page 104. Received a report from the Lead Audit Partner to ensure 
sustainable high levels of audit quality and the necessary prevailing 
culture amongst staff.

•  Met with the auditor without management present. The Committee 
considered the auditor’s views. There were no significant issues  
to report. 

•  Considered the independence and objectivity of the auditor. The 
Committee confirmed the independence of the auditor as further 
described on page 105.

•  Considered the effectiveness of the external audit process, 

concluding that the audit was effective (see page 104) and a 
recommendation was made to the Board on the re-appointment  
of KPMG as auditor at the AGM. 

Internal audit and risk management (25%)

The Committee:
•  Reviewed the internal audit planning approach and its link to the 

Company’s strategic objectives and priorities, reviewed reports on 
the work of the internal audit function from the VP Risk and 
Assurance and monitored compliance with the Group risk assurance 
programme. The Committee approved the internal audit plan and 
the implementation of any resulting actions by management.

External auditor’s effectiveness 
During the year, the Committee assessed the effectiveness of KPMG 
as Group external auditor. To assist in the assessment, the Committee 
considered the quality of reports from KPMG and the additional 
insights provided by the audit team, particularly at partner level. It took 
account of the views of the CFO and Group Financial Controller, who 
had discussed subsidiary component audits with local audit partners, 
to gauge the quality of the team and knowledge and understanding  
of the business. The Committee also considered how well the auditor 
assessed key accounting and audit judgements and the way it  
applied constructive challenge and professional scepticism in  
dealing with management.

The Committee reviewed the output from a questionnaire completed 
by senior members of the finance team to obtain their views on KPMG’s 
effectiveness in carrying out the audit. The questionnaire covered: 

•  Structure of the external audit team and their quality and approach. 
•  The planning, delivery and execution of the audit.
•  The effectiveness of their reporting.
•  Effectiveness of communications between management and the 

audit team.

•  Robustness of the audit, including the independence of the external 
audit team and their ability to challenge management as well as 
demonstrate professional scepticism and independence.

•  The external audit team’s judgement. 

Scores were compared with previous years to understand trends and 
highlight areas of improvement. The independence, team size, seniority 
and expertise of the external audit team continued to be assessed 
positively. Examples included that the senior team had dealt with 
complex issues as they came up and were helpful in providing 
feedback on technical accounting and disclosure issues. Regional 
close-out meetings had been succinct and clear. Minor improvement 
areas were noted, which included the need for clearer upfront planning 
and effective communication on progress in some areas.

The Committee also reviewed a report produced by KPMG that 
summarised the internal measures that KPMG used to assess audit 
quality as well as responses to thematic areas identified by the FRC 
that were relevant to the Croda audit. And as mentioned above, the 
Committee received a report from the Lead Audit Partner on actions 
undertaken by KPMG to improve audit quality following the FRC report 
on the Carillion audit. 

There were several quality interventions that attributed to the overall 
audit quality and ensured independent challenge. These included the 
use of specialists, audit consultations, a technical review, a second line 
inflight review and finally an independent audit partner review. 

Governance

Audit Committee report continued

Looking ahead to 2024
In addition to our core business, the Committee has identified four 
focus areas for 2024. We will:

•  Maintain cyber security as a focus area for 2024 given it remains a 

principal risk.

•  Maintain focus on monitoring the impact of major business change 

programmes on Croda’s risk and control environment.

•  Maintain UK corporate reform as a focus area for 2024 and monitor 

progress of relevant control framework changes. 

•  Oversee the development of internal controls over the production 

and disclosure of non-financial information and oversee the provision 
of external assurance in respect of that information. 

Internal audit and risk management
I met with the VP Risk and Assurance several times during the year 
outside of the formal meetings to discuss the performance and  
output of the internal audit function and aspects of risk management. 
The VP Risk and Assurance attended each Committee meeting and 
presented an internal audit report that was reviewed and discussed 
fully, highlighting any major deviations from the annual plan agreed  
with the Committee. 

At each meeting, the Committee considered the results of the audits 
undertaken and the adequacy of management’s response to matters 
raised, including the time taken to resolve such matters. Particular 
focus was addressed to those areas where there was a major 
divergence between the outcome of the internal audit and the  
scoring of the self-assessment questionnaire, completed annually  
by each business unit. In these instances, the Committee challenged 
management as to what actions it was taking to minimise divergences 
arising in the future. 

In January 2024, the Committee conducted its annual review of the 
internal audit function, including its approach to audit planning and  
risk assessment, communication within the business and with the 
Committee and its relationship with the external auditor. Senior 
management feedback from sites, included in the 2023 audit 
programme, is gathered by questionnaire to support this process. 
Details on how the business monitors risk and how it implements  
its risk management framework are set out on pages 51 to 53.

Committee evaluation 
Through the annual Board evaluation process, see page 89, the 
performance of the Committee was assessed and the output of  
the evaluation was considered by the Committee in January 2024.

Overall, the evaluation concluded that the Committee was operating 
effectively and was efficiently led by an experienced Chair. The overall 
performance of the Committee and that of the Committee Chair were 
both highly rated. Members were well prepared for meetings and 
engaged in productive discussions with a healthy balance of support 
and constructive challenge for executives. 

Relationships between the Committee and Croda management were 
considered very effective. Senior leaders attended meetings as 
required which provided visibility into various business areas as well as 
the opportunity to strengthen relationships. Meetings were well run and 
adhered to a structured agenda and time frame with appropriate time 
allowed for more in-depth discussions when required. 

It was recognised that with the establishment of the Sustainability 
Oversight Committee, there was a need for liaison between the two 
Committee Chairs to ensure no overlap. The review highlighted the 
opportunity to further diversify discussions to enhance consideration  
of external factors such as AI, geopolitical risks and the broader 
economic landscape.

External auditor’s independence
The Committee and the Board place great emphasis on the objectivity 
of the Group’s external auditor, KPMG, in reporting to shareholders. 
Our Group policy on the provision of non-audit services by external 
auditors, which is on our website www.croda.com, sets out permitted 
and prohibited non-audit services and the controls over assignments 
awarded to the external auditor to ensure that audit independence is 
not compromised and the provision of such services does not impair 
the external auditor’s objectivity. 

In 2023, non-audit fees were £0.3m, significantly less than the total 
audit fees of £2.8m; the non-audit to audit fees ratio stands at 0.1:1. 
The non-audit fees include the approved fees for carrying out a  
limited assurance of significant climate and gender diversity KPIs  
as noted earlier.

The Committee undertook its annual review of the Group’s policies 
relating to external audit, including the policy that governs how and 
when employees and former employees of the Group’s auditor can be 
employed by the Company. No changes were made. The Committee 
also reviewed and accepted KPMG’s independence letter which 
annually confirms their independence and compliance with the FRC‘s 
ethical standard. In conclusion, the Committee agreed that KPMG 
were independent.

Significant financial statement reporting items
The Committee, with support from the external auditor, reviewed 
those items in the Group’s and Parent Company’s financial 
statements that have the potential to significantly impact reporting. 
These are set out below.

Goodwill impairment: The strategy of the Group includes 
acquiring new technologies and businesses operating in adjacent 
markets. As a result, goodwill represents a significant asset value 
on the balance sheet of £937.9m out of total net assets of 
£2,368.1m at 31 December 2023.

The Committee completed its annual impairment review of  
the carrying value of goodwill, as prepared by management, 
including the detailed sensitivity analysis to a number of underlying 
assumptions, including the current macroeconomic outlook  
and the broader consequences on the markets in which the 
Group operates. 

The Committee assessed the methodologies used and the 
adequacy of the management disclosures. Particular attention 
was given to the SIPO cash generating unit’s value in use model, 
which demonstrated a £20.8m impairment versus its carrying 
value as lower forecast sales and margin have reduced its future 
value projection and the Flavours cash generating unit’s value in 
use model based on its impairment in the prior year and low level 
of headroom. The Committee reviewed the methodology adopted 
to evaluate the risk of goodwill impairment. After challenge, the 
Committee was satisfied that the assumptions were reasonable 
and that no other impairments were necessary; however, 
enhanced disclosure was agreed to be appropriate for the 
Flavours cash generating unit, given the low headroom sensitivity 
of the calculations to certain assumptions.

Croda is in compliance with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014. 
We undertook an audit tender in 2017 and the Board appointed KPMG 
as external auditor. The first year to be audited by KPMG was the year 
ended 31 December 2018. Subject to the continued quality and 
effectiveness of the current auditor, we plan to re-tender ahead of a 
2028 appointment. The current Lead Audit Partner, Ian Griffiths, was 
appointed for the year ended 31 December 2021.

External auditor reappointment
As noted above, the Committee recommended to the Board that 
KPMG be offered for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. I will be 
available at the shareholder engagement event to respond to any 
questions shareholders may raise on the Committee’s activities in  
the year.

John Ramsay
Chair of the Audit Committee

Pensions: The Committee monitored the Group’s pension 
arrangements, in particular the funding of the defined benefit plan 
in the UK, which are sensitive to assumptions made in respect of 
discount rates, salary increases and inflation.

The Group engages external actuarial specialists. The Committee 
reviewed the actuarial assumptions used and compared them 
with those used by other companies. The external auditor also 
challenged the benchmark assumptions applied and conducted 
sensitivity analysis. Following their review, the Committee found 
the assumptions to be reasonable.

Parent Company’s carrying value of investments in 
subsidiaries and intercompany receivables: The Committee 
considered the carrying amount of the Parent Company’s 
investments in subsidiaries and intercompany debtors, held at 
cost less impairment, representing 99% of the Parent Company’s 
total assets (2022: 93%).

The recoverability of these balances is not considered 
judgemental; however, they are the most significant component  
of the Parent Company balance sheet and therefore require 
additional consideration as part of preparing the financial 
statements. This included comparing the carrying amount with  
the respective subsidiary’s net asset value, profitability and cash 
generation. After review, the Committee was satisfied that the 
recoverability of these balances was acceptable, and no 
impairments were necessary.

Remuneration Committee report

Report of the Remuneration Committee

A. Chair’s letter
On behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee, I am 
pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2023. 

This year has been a challenging year for the Group, with a weaker 
economic environment and customer destocking across consumer, 
crop and industrial markets impacting financial performance. Despite 
this, the Group continued to execute against the long-term growth 
strategy, driving sustainable innovation and continuing to invest in 
biotechnology, pharma expansion and capacity to support fast  
growth in Asia. We also took the opportunity to evolve our 
organisational structure, ensuring we are well positioned to  
capture future growth opportunities. 

As a knowledge-based business, attracting, developing and retaining 
high-quality people throughout the organisation is key to our success. 
The Committee believes that an effective reward structure, as part  
of a wider employee engagement framework, plays a key role in the 
continued achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives and in the 
delivery of sustainable, profitable growth. 

Last year we reviewed and updated our Remuneration Policy to ensure 
alignment with Croda’s evolving ambition and were pleased to receive 
94% votes in favour. The Remuneration Committee is not proposing 
any changes to the operation of the policy in 2024, being satisfied with 
the outcome of the review and operation of the policy in 2023, with 
reward outcomes aligned with the shareholder experience.

As Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I would like to thank my 
colleagues for their commitment and engagement throughout the year 
and to welcome Chris Good as a new member of the Committee. 

Remuneration out-turn for 2023
With a challenging trading environment in 2023, financial performance 
was weaker, with sales of £1.7bn down by 19% and adjusted 
operating profit of £320m down by 38%. Despite this, execution 
against our strategy continued, ensuring we are positioned for 
sustainable growth over the long term. 

Under our senior annual Bonus Plan the maximum opportunity for  
the CEO and CFO was 175% and 150% of base salary, respectively, 
based on profit performance (90% weighting) and an ESG metric  
(10% weighting). Consistent with the approach taken in prior years, 
bonusable profit was adjusted for the lipid system sales for our 
principal COVID-19 vaccine contract. In 2023, however, profit 
performance was below the threshold with no annual bonus payable 
for this element of the award. For 2023 the ESG metric was based on 
safety. However, given the weakness of the overall financial performance 
of the Group, it was recommended by management and supported by 
the Committee that no annual bonus should be payable for 2023.

2023 was the year in which PSP grants made in 2021 concluded their 
three-year cycle and the Committee reviewed performance against 
targets. Over the period, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance 
(35% weighting) was (23.5)%. This placed Croda below median when 
compared to our bespoke comparator group and this part of the 
award will not vest. Earnings per Share (EPS) growth over the period 
(35% weighting) was achieved at just above threshold at 5.6%. 
Consistent with last year, EPS was adjusted for the divestment  
of the majority of the PTIC business.

“The committee is satisfied that the 
operation of the policy balances the 
challenging market conditions, overall 
shareholder experience but recognises 
strategic progress and considers the 
attraction, motivation and retention  
of key talent.”

Report of the Remuneration Committee

A. Chair’s letter

On behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee, I am 

pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year 

ended 31 December 2023. 

This year has been a challenging year for the Group, with a weaker 

economic environment and customer destocking across consumer, 

crop and industrial markets impacting financial performance. Despite 

this, the Group continued to execute against the long-term growth 

strategy, driving sustainable innovation and continuing to invest in 

biotechnology, pharma expansion and capacity to support fast  

growth in Asia. We also took the opportunity to evolve our 

organisational structure, ensuring we are well positioned to  

capture future growth opportunities. 

As a knowledge-based business, attracting, developing and retaining 

high-quality people throughout the organisation is key to our success. 

The Committee believes that an effective reward structure, as part  

of a wider employee engagement framework, plays a key role in the 

continued achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives and in the 

delivery of sustainable, profitable growth. 

Last year we reviewed and updated our Remuneration Policy to ensure 

alignment with Croda’s evolving ambition and were pleased to receive 

94% votes in favour. The Remuneration Committee is not proposing 

any changes to the operation of the policy in 2024, being satisfied with 

the outcome of the review and operation of the policy in 2023, with 

reward outcomes aligned with the shareholder experience.

As Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I would like to thank my 

colleagues for their commitment and engagement throughout the year 

and to welcome Chris Good as a new member of the Committee. 

Remuneration out-turn for 2023

With a challenging trading environment in 2023, financial performance 

was weaker, with sales of £1.7bn down by 19% and adjusted 

operating profit of £320m down by 38%. Despite this, execution 

against our strategy continued, ensuring we are positioned for 

sustainable growth over the long term. 

Under our senior annual Bonus Plan the maximum opportunity for  

the CEO and CFO was 175% and 150% of base salary, respectively, 

based on profit performance (90% weighting) and an ESG metric  

(10% weighting). Consistent with the approach taken in prior years, 

bonusable profit was adjusted for the lipid system sales for our 

principal COVID-19 vaccine contract. In 2023, however, profit 

performance was below the threshold with no annual bonus payable 

for this element of the award. For 2023 the ESG metric was based on 

safety. However, given the weakness of the overall financial performance 

of the Group, it was recommended by management and supported by 

the Committee that no annual bonus should be payable for 2023.

2023 was the year in which PSP grants made in 2021 concluded their 

three-year cycle and the Committee reviewed performance against 

targets. Over the period, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance 

(35% weighting) was (23.5)%. This placed Croda below median when 

compared to our bespoke comparator group and this part of the 

award will not vest. Earnings per Share (EPS) growth over the period 

(35% weighting) was achieved at just above threshold at 5.6%. 

Consistent with last year, EPS was adjusted for the divestment  

of the majority of the PTIC business.

“The committee is satisfied that the 

operation of the policy balances the 

challenging market conditions, overall 

shareholder experience but recognises 

strategic progress and considers the 

attraction, motivation and retention  

of key talent.”

New and Protected Products (NPP) growth (15% weighting) met  
the stretching vesting target, with NPP sales growing by 3.3 times 
non-NPP sales over the period and full vesting achieved for this 
element of the award. The 2021 PSP cycle included sustainability 
metrics (15% weighting), split equally between Climate Positive and 
Land Positive targets. The Climate Positive metric was a reduction in 
scope 1 emissions from a 2020 baseline of 102,750 MT. For 2023, 
Scope 1 emissions were 86,740 MT representing a 15.6% reduction 
against the baseline which results in 100% of this condition vesting.  
For the Land Positive element, the target was met, and full vesting  
was achieved. 

The 2021 PSP award was subject to an Economic Value Added (EVA) 
underpin such that awards would be subject to a reduction (including 
potentially to nil) in the event that EVA had not improved over the 
three-year performance period. The EVA underpin was not met and  
the Committee therefore considered an appropriate reduction. 

As part of these deliberations the Committee also took into account  
the Discretion Framework where a range of factors are considered to 
ensure payout is consistent with and reflective of overall performance 
over the period. One consideration made, as part of the Discretion 
Framework, was that the outturn against emissions targets had 
benefitted from the lower volumes in the year. More details of all the 
considerations taken into account are set out on page 122. Taking into 
account the EVA underpin alongside the Discretionary Framework the 
Committee determined that the overall vesting of the PSP would be 
reduced by 10%. The resultant overall PSP vesting was 37.1% of the 
total award.

Performance framework for 2024
Croda’s strategy continues to focus on delivering sustainable,  
profitable growth by providing innovative and sustainable solutions  
to our customers. This is consistent with our Purpose, Smart science 
to improve livesTM, with our remuneration framework therefore 
underpinning our Purpose through performance measures and 
stretching targets. 

For 2024, the senior annual Bonus Plan will continue to be based on a 
profit performance metric (90% of the total award) and an ESG metric 
(10% of the total award). The ESG metric was introduced into the 
senior annual Bonus Plan as part of the policy review in 2023 and the 
focus of this metric varies each year, adapting to our evolving priorities 
in this area. For 2024 the focus will continue to be based on safety, 
building on the work done in 2023 to support the embedding of SHE 
as a Value through the entire workforce.

The PSP performance framework is unchanged in substance and  
will continue to include EPS growth (35% of the award), relative TSR 
(35% of the award) and NPP and sustainability targets (30% of the 
award). The NPP element (15% of total award) incentivises innovation 
based on NPP revenue, being revenue from those products that will 
drive our future growth. Innovating sustainably is core to Croda’s 
success, and we continue to focus management on the delivery of this. 
The sustainability element (15% of total award) will be focused on our 
‘Climate Positive’ sustainability commitments, which for this award will 
include scope 3 emissions targets as well as competency-building on 
scope 3 through our organisation. It is only through continued 
innovation and collaboration, that we can reduce scope 3 emissions

across the full life cycle of our customers’ products, and ultimately 
achieve our ambition to be ‘Climate Positive’.

In line with normal practice, the Committee reviewed targets ahead  
of 2024. Targets for our senior annual Bonus Plan continue to be set 
using a consistent and distinctive framework, focused on year-on-year 
growth in Bonusable Profit. Bonusable Profit is an established 
performance measure at Croda, which has been used for many years 
and is focused on operational profitability based on Group EBITDA.

For the PSP award to be granted in 2024, the Committee considered 
share price performance over last year, recognising the impact of the 
challenging macroeconomic environment. Performance is always 
considered holistically; each year the Committee applies our 
comprehensive Discretion Framework to satisfy itself that the outcome 
in terms of primary performance metrics has not been to the detriment 
of other measures of corporate performance. The Committee will review 
vesting outcomes against this Discretion Framework, with particular 
attention paid to share price performance to ensure Executive Directors 
do not benefit from any windfall gains. In addition to this we also have 
ROIC as an underpin in our PSP recognising that long-term ROIC 
performance continues to be a key focus for the business. The ROIC 
underpin, which is discretionary, has been revised for 2024 taking into 
account the current market environment. Safety also continues to be a 
specific underpin in our senior annual Bonus Plan.

Salaries for 2024
For 2024, there will be a general increase to salaries for UK employees 
of 3%. The Committee reviewed the salaries of our Executive Directors 
and determined that an increase of 3% would be awarded in line with 
that of the UK workforce. 

Board changes
Danuta Gray will join the Board with effect from 1 February 2024 and 
will succeed Anita as Chair at the conclusion of the Company’s AGM 
on 24 April 2024. Anita Frew will then retire from the Board after nine 
years as Croda’s Chair.

In anticipation of the appointment of a new Chair, the Committee 
instigated a review of the Chair fees recognising that in the nine years 
since Anita’s appointment, Croda has grown in size and complexity to 
become an established FTSE 100 company. This review, which was 
supported by Deloitte, also included an extensive review of the market 
to consider what other similar sized organisations paid in order to 
attract the desired skills and experience to lead an increasingly diverse 
and international business. It was ultimately determined that the fee  
for the new Chair would be set at £425,000. The Committee also 
determined that it would be appropriate for this fee to apply for  
Anita, as the current Chair, from 1 January 2024 for the remainder  
of her tenure. 

Louisa Burdett, Chief Financial Officer, will leave Croda in June 2024 
and the Board has commenced a search for her successor. 

Remuneration arrangements for Louisa Burdett have been managed in 
line with the Remuneration Policy and the proposed approach is in line 
with the approach that would be taken for other UK employees on 
giving notice. While Louisa remained eligible for an annual bonus for 
2023, as discussed above, no annual bonus will be payable to all 
executives reflecting Croda’s financial out-turn in the year. For 2024, 
she will receive a 3% salary increase, in line with the normal approach 
for UK employees that have given notice but will remain employed for 
part of the year, but will not be eligible for an annual bonus or PSP 
award. Further, all outstanding PSP awards will lapse.

Consideration of wider workforce and alignment of reward 
across the organisation
Our approach to workforce reward forms an important part of Croda’s 
philosophy and culture. One of the principles of Croda’s culture is to 
drive ‘One Croda’, and therefore many of the remuneration structures 

108

Croda International Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2023

that apply to the Executive Directors also apply further in the global 
organisation. The key difference being that remuneration for Executive 
Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and share 
ownership. Highlights of our approach to workforce pay include:

•  Our commitment to paying a Global Living Wage – in 2021 Croda 
established a Living Wage in each of the countries in which it 
operates and ensured that all employees receive this as a minimum. 
In 2023, we made progress in receiving certification from the Fair 
Wage Network (FWN), we expect to able to confirm this by the end 
of the first quarter of 2024.

•  Sharing of success with employees – achieved through the 

operation of various all-employee share plans, including our Free 
Share Plan which was introduced in 2021. We are pleased that 
workforce participation in these plans remains consistently strong 
year-on-year and allows our employees to become shareholders in 
the business. 

•  Generous and inclusive benefits – our holistic health and wellbeing 
benefit offering, which was enhanced in response to the cost-of-
living crisis, is highly valued across the workforce. In addition, our 
CARE defined benefit pension, which applies across our entire UK 
workforce, is a generous and inclusive benefit. 

In line with our ‘One Croda’ culture, our senior leaders all share the 
same performance metrics for the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP. 
Around 550 employees participate in the senior annual Bonus Plan  
and 65 of these are also in the PSP. We believe that this focuses our 
leadership on working together globally to deliver the best overall 
outcome for our customers and, in turn, our shareholders and  
other stakeholders.

Workforce engagement
Over the last two years, we have established a regular engagement 
programme to gain insight from employees across the Group. Through 
surveys, listening groups, site visits and a dedicated email, all Croda 
colleagues can give their feedback directly so we can better 
understand how they are feeling about certain areas of business.

Through the Purpose and Sustainability Commitment (PSC) survey,  
we have gained valuable feedback on how changes to reward in each 
location and support offered with cost-of-living have been positively 
received, a direct impact of last year’s Remuneration Committee review. 

We were also happy to see that questions related to wellbeing and 
safety have seen an uplift in the number of positive responses, building 
on the great work to truly embed safety as a value in the organisation 
that has taken place in 2023.

We continue to operate a dedicated email address so that employees 
can send questions or comments direct to the Remuneration 
Committee Chair.

Looking ahead
We remain confident that the Remuneration Policy that was approved 
in 2023 will continue to serve us well over the next two years and are 
not proposing any changes to its operation for 2024.

Going forward, we will continue to seek out opportunities to further 
enhance the remuneration approach at Croda, considering advice from 
our investors and other stakeholders such as listening groups with our 
employees. We remain committed to ensuring that our remuneration 
framework reflects the evolving needs of all of our stakeholders and the 
communities in which we operate.

Bonus Plan

Steve Foots - 175% of salary
Louisa Burdett - not eligible for 2024 (normal opportunity maximum for other Executive Directors is 150% of salary)* 

Underlying profitability for the performance-related Annual Bonus Plan (“Bonusable Profit”) is based on Group EBITDA for 
continuing operations before exceptional items, less a notional interest charge on working capital employed during the year. 
The targets for the awards are set out below:

The proposed safety measure for 2024 is in relation to the whole population of eligible employees 
(c.550 employees), and the extent to which the population:

1. Agree a quarterly communication (SAY) and engagement plan (DO) for their team and peers.
All leaders to set quarterly targets and capture progress in Croda’s global human resources 
information system (HRIS). Achievement is recorded via the employees end of year appraisal. 
90% of the cohort must achieve by year end for this element to be considered complete. 

2. Measure workforce engagement through a ‘Safety is a Value’ survey.
Based on Croda’s current ‘Pulse’ Survey which currently has around a 70% response rate 
globally we will launch a ‘Safety is a Value’ survey which must receive a 70% response rate 
across the whole organisation by year end for this element to be considered as complete.

3. Identify measures of success for their team and demonstrate achievement at year end.
All leaders must capture their objective in Croda’s global HRIS. Achievement is recorded via the 
employees end of year appraisal. 90% of the cohort must achieve by year end for this element to 
be considered complete. 

Two of the elements must be considered complete for a 5% payout. All of the elements must be 
considered complete for the full 10% to be payable.

Payments, and is after the cost of bonuses. For 2024, and consistent with prior years, the calculation is adjusted for the lipid system sales  
for the principal Covid-19 vaccine contract.

Commentary

•  No change in opportunity levels or the balance of performance measures. 
•  When determining bonus outcomes, the Committee applies the Discretion Framework which includes a range of factors, 

see page 114.

•  The Committee remains comfortable that the structure of the senior annual Bonus Plan does not encourage inappropriate 

risk-taking and that the mandatory deferral of one third of bonus into shares for a three-year period provides clear 
alignment with shareholders and fosters a longer-term link between annual performance and reward.

•  Malus and clawback provisions apply.
•  Full retrospective disclosure of targets and actual performance against these will be made in next year’s Annual Report  

on Remuneration.

•  The Committee considers the targets set for 2024 to be at least as demanding as in previous years and were set after 

taking due account of the Company’s commercial circumstances and the current market environment.

(maximum vesting).

Climate Positive – Two independent targets specifically focused on our upstream Scope 3 emissions:

1. Scope 3 emissions (10%) – Delivery of absolute upstream Scope 3 emissions reductions.

A reduction in upstream Scope 3 emissions aligned with our Science Based Target (SBT) 
trajectory from a 831,250 Mt CO2e adjusted baseline3 by end 2026, equating to an absolute 
reduction of 52,134Mt.

100% payout (10%) would be achieved if upstream Scope 3 emissions were reduced in line with 
or above target.

50% payout (5%) would be achieved if upstream Scope 3 emissions were reduced by 30,000Mt.

2. Scope 3 competency build (5%) – Target focused on competence building on Scope 3 to 
ensure all leaders have knowledge and skills applicable to Croda and to the key frameworks and 
standards used, and are accountable for ensuring the enablers are in place to support delivery of 
our Scope 3 reduction target.

100% payout (5%) would be achieved if 98% of all relevant4 leaders and employees (c.550 
individuals in total) complete the pre-set relevant training modules as part of the Sustainability 
Academy by the end of 2026. 

50% payout (2.5%) would be achieved if 95% of all relevant leaders and employees complete the 
pre-set relevant training modules.

Awards will be subject to a ROIC underpin such that vesting is subject to satisfactory ROIC performance over the three-year 
performance period, as determined by the Committee. In determining whether the underpin has been met, the Committee 
will consider a range of factors including, but not limited to, the intended time horizons for returns on capital deployed, and 
Croda’s long-term ROIC objective. In circumstances where the underpin is not met, the Committee may consider, in its 
absolute discretion, whether to reduce or cancel the vesting of awards.

1.  EPS growth p.a. is calculated on a simple average basis over the 
three-year period and therefore growth of 33% or more over three 
years is required for maximum vesting.

3.  Adjusted baseline is the three-year average Scope 3 emissions from 

2021 to 2023.

4.  Scope 3 emission reduction affects Croda’s entire value chain, from the 
sourcing of ingredients to the processing and formulation of products, 
and the delivery and engagement with customers and markets, as well 
as the management and disclosure of the relevant data. Therefore 
many different functions need to be involved, at different levels, across 
both businesses, including senior leadership teams.

Commentary

•  Louisa Burdett will not receive an award in 2024 due to her planned resignation.
•  Performance period 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2026.
•  An additional two-year holding period will apply for any shares vesting.
•  Malus and clawback provisions apply.
•  No change to the balance of NPP and sustainability metrics from last year. NPP and sustainability targets remain equally 

weighted at 15% of the total PSP. Sustainability targets aligned to key 2030 sustainability ambitions.

•  When assessing outcomes, the Committee applies the Discretion Framework which considers, for example, the 

management of EVA and ROIC, health and safety and sales growth and may adjust awards if it considers appropriate.  
The specific ROIC underpin has been revised for 2024 taking into account the current market environment.

•  Considering the share price performance over the last year, the Committee will review awards on vesting to ensure that 

participants do not benefit from any windfall gains arising.

How our reward strategy aligns to and supports the delivery of our business strategy
Over the last three years we have accelerated key elements of our strategy to transition to a dedicated Consumer Care and Life Sciences company. 
Across these markets, innovation and sustainability will be the core drivers of our future growth.

In developing and implementing our Remuneration Policy the Committee has been mindful to ensure that every element of reward directly aligns  
to our strategy, ensuring we provide and protect long-term shareholder value.

Element

Link to strategy

Clear and simple measure that supports our 
strategic objective of consistent bottom-line growth. 
One third of awards are deferred, further protecting

Sustainability is at the centre of Croda’s strategy  
and our senior annual Bonus Plan includes an ESG 
metric. One third of awards are deferred, further 
protecting shareholder value. 

A measure of earnings growth over a three-year 
period recognising that sustained growth can only 
come through relentless innovation.
Measured against our peers, a key indicator of 
long-term growth and shareholder value.

An established measure of innovation, the metric is 
growth of NPP, those products rewarding growth 
that is driven by innovation.

Since 2020 we have incorporated sustainability 
metrics directly linked to our ambitions to be 
Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030.

Our Discretion Framework
To enhance the rigour with which performance is reviewed the Committee has adopted a Discretion Framework which it applies when assessing 
bonus and long-term incentive plan outcomes.

As with all Board/Committee decisions (in line with section 172) we also reflect on the experience of all our stakeholders throughout the course  
of the plan periods.

or should an adjustment 
be considered?

How our Remuneration Policy reflects the UK Corporate Governance Code
When developing the Remuneration Policy, the Committee was mindful of the UK Corporate Governance Code and considers that the executive 
remuneration framework appropriately addresses the following factors:

Factors

Clarity

How these are addressed

Our commitment to openness and transparency is reflected in our reward principles. The Committee is committed to 
providing open and transparent disclosure on executive remuneration for our stakeholders.

Our arrangements are clearly disclosed and any changes to our Remuneration Policy and its operation are highlighted  
in a way that defines their alignment to both our strategic ambitions as well as the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.

Simplicity

Our executive remuneration arrangements, as well as those throughout the global organisation, are simple in nature and 
well understood by both participants and shareholders.

Risk

Our senior annual Bonus Plan, in which around 550 of our global employees participate, is primarily based on a single  
profit metric, with a simple key requirement that no bonus can be paid for this element until the previous year’s profit  
is exceeded.

The Committee considers that the structure of incentive arrangements does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking. 
Performance is based on a balance of metrics which also reflect our broader stakeholders, for example inclusion of 
sustainability targets and health and safety underpins. We then take a holistic assessment of performance using our 
Discretion Framework.

Annual bonus deferral, the PSP holding period and our shareholding guidelines provide a clear link to the ongoing 
performance of the business as well as alignment with shareholders. Executives will be rewarded for sustainable  
long-term shareholder return.

Malus and clawback provisions also apply for both the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP.

Predictability

Our Remuneration Policy contains details of maximum opportunity levels for each component of pay, with actual incentive 
outcomes varying depending on the level of performance achieved against specific measures.

Proportionality

Our Remuneration Policy directly aligns to our strategy and financial performance. The Committee considers performance 
from a range of perspectives. Poor financial performance is not rewarded.

Alignment 
to culture

Alignment to our ‘One Croda’ culture is clearly established in our Remuneration Policy. Our senior annual Bonus Plan has 
the same metrics for all participants. Our PSP metrics, and from 2023 our senior annual Bonus Plan ESG metric, reflect our 
commitment to sustainability. Pensions are also aligned across the workforce.

Workforce engagement
We continue to develop our approach to workforce engagement. We believe it is important to our culture and our values to have an active dialogue 
with employees on topics such as reward, recognition, motivation, wellbeing, safety, and inclusion. A summary of engagement activities undertaken 
to date is as follows:

Reward principles

Our reward principles, which were developed and approved during 2019, guide the way we recognise and 
remunerate all our global employees. These principles focus on total reward including intangible rewards and  
were strongly influenced by the results of our previous Global Employee Survey. These have been shared across 
the organisation.

Employee pulse surveys In 2023 a number of pulse surveys covering a range of topics, including culture and reward, were undertaken and 

Listening groups

findings were shared with the Board, management and employees to help guide decisions.
During 2023 the Chair of the Board and other Non-Executive Directors attended listening groups to better 
understand how employees felt on a range of different topics, including reward.
A dedicated email address has been established for employees to send comments or questions to the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee.

Committee members are updated annually on global employees’ terms and conditions and are made aware of any 
significant changes to policies and other pay-related matters.

How our Remuneration Policy relates to reward in the wider employee context
When making decisions about executive remuneration the Committee considers the pay and reward structures across the business. Annually, the 
President Human Resources provides the Committee with a review of workforce remuneration, and the Committee is updated periodically on any 
feedback received on remuneration practices across the Group.

One of the principles of Croda’s culture is to drive ‘One Croda’, therefore, many of the remuneration structures that apply to Executives also apply 
further in the global organisation, as set out in the table below. The key difference between the policy for Executive Directors compared to other 
employees is that remuneration for Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and share ownership.

We reviewed our Living Wage levels in 2023 and made any 
adjustments necessary in order to continue paying a Living Wage  
to all employees. Through 2023 we made good progress in gaining 
accreditation for our work from the Fair Wage Network and expect to 
be able to confirm this by the end of the first quarter of 2024. In 2022 
we also began the process of ensuring all our regular contractors are 
paid a Living Wage and plan to achieve this milestone by the end  
of 2024.

More than just pay
Our employees and our culture remain central to the continued 
success of Croda. We have continued to enhance our offering of 
activities available to employees, including:

•  We are proud of the training and development that we provide for 
employees and have set a target of ensuring all employees receive 
at least one week of training a year by the end of 2025. In 2023,  
our employees undertook over 197,000 hours of training with the 
average number of hours an employee completed being 34 hours.

•  In 2021 we relaunched and redesigned our core company 

development programmes for senior leaders and future leaders with 
our values at their heart. 2023 was the second year many of these 
programmes were able to run and all programmes have been 
positively received by employees.

•  In 2021 we also launched an inclusion-based global leadership 

programme, Phoenix Rising. In 2023, we invited a third cohort to 
begin this programme, with participants joining from all over the 
world, and invited the participants from 2021 and 2022 cohorts  
to meet at a week-long “Phoenix Rising Unites” learning event.  
We also ran a series of leadership webinars on diversity &  
inclusive leadership.

•  Each of our sites is tasked with ensuring at least four health and 

wellbeing events are run per year, with many sites running 
significantly more than this. We also continued with Employee 
Assistance Programmes in many of our countries. 

See pages 16 & 17 for further information on our culture including 
details on how we approach the recruitment, development and training 
of our workforce.

Sharing success across the business
The Committee believes in sharing success across the business and 
extending share ownership more widely across our employee base. 
This is promoted through the operation of our ‘Free Share Plan’ and  
a number of all-employee share schemes.

Free Share Plan
In 2021 we launched the ‘Free Share Plan’. Under this new plan, all 
employees globally who are not eligible for the senior annual Bonus 
Plan are gifted Croda shares (or the cash equivalent) if the senior 
annual Bonus Plan pays out. Unlike other elements of remuneration 
this award is not set as a multiple of salary, instead it rewards all eligible 
employees at the same value.

The Free Share Plan was developed in response to findings from the 
Global Reward Survey in 2020 and aims to share success more widely 
across the business and encourage share ownership.

As the senior annual Bonus Plan did not pay out for 2023, no award 
was made under the Free Share Plan.

All-employee share plans 
Workforce participation in these plans has remained consistently  
strong and is driven by our culture of employees feeling a strong  
loyalty to the business.

Living Wage
We were pleased to announce in 2018 that we gained accreditation in 
the UK as a Living Wage Employer from the Living Wage Foundation. 
In 2024, we will continue to ensure that all our UK employees and 
regular contractors are paid at, or above, the rates advised by the 
Living Wage Foundation.

In addition, the business continues to pursue its Global Living Wage 
target, one of our sustainability KPIs linked to the UN SDGs. In 2020 
we forged a partnership with the Fair Wage Network (FWN) to establish, 
using an independent and economically rigorous methodology, Living 
Wage levels across the world. In 2021, we compared our global wage 
levels to Living Wage comparators provided by the FWN and made all 
necessary adjustments to ensure that all our employees are now paid  
a Living Wage at a minimum.

 * The senior annual Bonus Plan and Croda Europe Discretionary Bonus Scheme did not pay out for 2019 (payable in 2020) or 2020 (payable in 2021). A small number 

of employees received a sales bonus but the median bonus for both female and male employees was zero giving a median bonus gap of 0%. 

We are confident that our gender pay gap is not an equal pay issue but is a result of a lack of female representation across our business at senior 
levels and particularly in production roles which represent the bulk of the workforce between the 25th and 75th percentile. Addressing this issue will 
require a long-term approach but we have already begun work to increase the number of females working in production and in senior positions.

Over 2023 42% of hires and promotions to leadership positions were female, with the number of women in leadership positions now at 39% 
(2022: 38%).

Other actions taken to address the gender pay gap include:

•  Ensuring balanced shortlists for all appointments where possible with a target of having 80% of shortlists gender balanced.
•  Further improving our talent and succession planning processes to help identify and nurture talent early in their career. 
•  Ensuring that our global talent development programmes continue to have a gender-balanced mix of participants.
•  Supporting female leaders in their development, offering attendance on programmes such as Solaris, a women’s executive leadership 

development programme for women specifically of Black heritage.

•  Finding ways to reduce shift work (especially night work) and to examine the feasibility of part-time and job share arrangements in our  

production facilities.

•  Continuing to invest in our STEM activities to encourage a wide range of applicants to apply for roles in our business.
