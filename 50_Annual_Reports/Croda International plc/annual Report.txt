Chair’s statement

Focused on delivery

“Our Purpose, Smart science to improve livesTM,  
is the bedrock of our approach and is embedded 
across our company through our strategy, and our 
approach to governance, risk and remuneration.”

Dame Anita Frew DBE
Chair

We use a number 
of Alternative 
Performance 
Measures (APMs) 
to assist in 
presenting the 
information in this 
report. For detail 
on any APMs 
used see the 
Finance review  
on page 50.

Navigating a challenging market 
environment
Four years after the outbreak of Covid-19, our markets 
have continued to see the ripple effects of the pandemic. 
The chemical industry has experienced a prolonged 
period of destocking, following on immediately from a 
period where customers rapidly increased inventory 
levels to meet surging demand as lockdowns were lifted. 

Delivering long-term performance
High inflation, rising interest rates and customer 
destocking had a significant effect on Croda’s financial 
performance in 2023 and the Board took the decision 
to issue two unscheduled trading updates through the 
year as the trading environment deteriorated. Overall 
pro forma sales were down 11%, adjusting for the 
divestment of the majority of the Performance 
Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses on 
30 June 2022, and operating profit was down 33%. 

Despite this disappointing financial performance, we 
have seen continued customer demand for Croda’s 
innovation and ingredients that are differentiated by their 
sustainability credentials. Both Consumer Care and Life 

Sciences have more than doubled their annual sales  
in the period since I became Chair in 2015 through  
a combination of organic growth and portfolio 
development, and our customer net promoter score 
has improved further from +23 in 2022 to +34 in 2023 
according to the latest survey. 

Most importantly, we have delivered continued progress 
in a difficult market environment whilst caring for each 
other right across our company. Despite the challenges 
we faced in 2023, we maintained our overall employee 
engagement score at 68%, with 71% of our people 
saying that they would recommend Croda as a place  
to work. We are continuing to improve our safety record 
and made good progress towards achieving our goal  
of embedding safety as a value, spending over 4,500 
hours coaching more than 500 senior leaders globally.

Our commitment to providing regular returns to 
shareholders is demonstrated by the Board’s decision 
to increase the 2023 full year dividend, despite lower 
adjusted earnings. During my tenure as Chair, we have 
increased the dividend from 69p for full year 2015 to 
109p for 2023, a compound annual growth rate of 6% 
over that eight-year period.

Strong fundamentals
Croda is built on exceptionally strong fundamentals. 
This includes our Purpose which guides the strategic 
choices we make, a culture where we put people first 
and an established business model which enables 
successful implementation of our strategy. 

Our Purpose, Smart science to improve livesTM, is the 
bedrock of our approach and is embedded across our 
company through our strategy and our approach to 
governance, risk and remuneration. By achieving our 
strategy we will deliver growth in our own business 
while creating positive impacts for the planet and 
society. Our governance framework covers both 
financial and non-financial performance, our appetite to 
risk is higher where that risk is integral to delivering on 
our Purpose and our Remuneration Policy incorporates 
sustainability-related targets. 

United by our strong sense of Purpose and our values, 
we work as one team. We also promote a ‘One Croda’ 
culture through our Remuneration Policy and high levels 
of employee share ownership. 

Croda has a well-established and powerful business 
model, founded on our own local, science-focused 
sales force. This direct selling model builds relationships 
with customers and provides us with insights about 
their challenges that are key to how we innovate.

Proven strategic direction
Following Croda’s significant strategic transition over 
recent years, we have a compelling focused portfolio 
operating in attractive market niches, with long-term 
technology trends creating valuable growth opportunities.

In the Consumer Care market, sustainability is the 
biggest single driver over the next decade, accelerating 
the demand for sustainable ingredients and driving 
legislation change. The Life Sciences market is being

Strong fundamentals

Chair’s statement continued

driven by the rise of biologics, complex molecules that 
are already transforming medicine and will transform 
agriculture over the next decade. These long-term 
growth drivers have remained intact in the challenging 
environment that we have seen in 2023 and our 
strategy is to leverage our leadership in innovation and 
sustainability to capture the opportunities for growth 
that they are creating.

Despite a tough year, we have continued to invest  
in R&D and manufacturing capacity. We started 
construction of three new manufacturing sites in China, 
India and the USA. We continued to invest in R&D in 
our fast-growing markets including China, Singapore, 
and Brazil and we opened up a new technical centre  
for our Pharma business in Hyderabad, India. We also 
welcomed Solus Biotech to the Croda family with 
exciting new growth platforms in ceramides and 
phospholipids that will contribute to our future growth.

Execution against our sustainability agenda, which is 
central to our strategy, has continued with the objective 
of delivering restorative impact throughout our value 
chain and in wider society. We remain on track to meet 
our 2030 Science Based Targets for greenhouse gas 
emissions and the Croda Foundation has sustainably 
improved the lives of more than 22 million people since 
the charity was founded in 2021. We also established a 
Board Sustainability Oversight Committee this year to 
guide and monitor progress.

Focused on operational improvements
Our focus in 2023 has been on ‘controlling what we 
can control’ to protect profitability alongside longer-term 
improvement programmes to drive efficiency savings by 
simplifying business processes and ways of working. 
This focus will ensure Croda is positioned to recover 
when the macro-environment improves. 

A new organisational structure has been effective since 
the start of 2024 with all regional teams, including sales, 
R&D, marketing, customer service and manufacturing, 
reporting into Consumer Care and Life Sciences. This 
simplifies how we work and will ensure we deliver more 
quickly and more efficiently for our customers. 

Profit-protection measures and changes to our ways of 
working have created further change and challenges for 
our employees in addition to tough trading conditions. 
Throughout 2023, our people have demonstrated their 
resilience, adaptability and determination and I wanted 
to take a moment to share my thanks and appreciation 
with everyone at Croda. 

A number of the improvements to business processes 
have been led by Louisa Burdett, Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO), who informed us in December that she has 
accepted a new role as CFO at Spirax-Sarco Plc and 
so will be leaving Croda in June 2024. We are sorry that 
Louisa is leaving but she will have our very best wishes 
when she departs this summer. In the meantime, she is 
continuing to make a valuable contribution to our future

organisation, leading the upgrade of our systems and 
driving other important improvements to the way we 
operate. The search for her successor is well underway 
and we will make a further announcement in due course.

“Execution against our sustainability 
agenda, which is central to our 
strategy, has continued with the 
objective of delivering restorative 
impact throughout our value chain 
and in wider society.”

Looking back and looking forwards
This will be my last letter to shareholders as I am 
stepping down as Croda Chair at the conclusion  
of Croda’s AGM on 24 April 2024. The Board has 
appointed Danuta Gray as my successor, who is 
currently Chair of Direct Line Insurance Group Plc and a 
Non-Executive Director at Burberry Group Plc. Danuta 
has held Board positions across a range of sectors for 
the past 19 years and has a deep understanding of 
growing consumer focused and technology-rich 
businesses in international markets. Danuta has already 
joined the Board so I have already had the opportunity 
to start handing over the reins to her.

Croda Foundation ‘Neverthirst’ project 

Improving access to clean water, hygiene and sanitation  
in rural Uganda

In 2021, we established the Croda Foundation, an independent charitable 
company funded solely by grants from Croda. The Foundation’s priority 
impact areas include improving access to healthcare, protecting and 
restoring ecosystems, and reducing hunger and poverty while improving 
livelihoods. Since 2021, the Foundation has sustainably improved the lives 
of more than 22 million people, funding 34 projects across 21 countries. 
One of these projects is improving access to clean water, basic hygiene and 
sanitation in rural Uganda, upgrading infrastructure, and training 250 people 
on improving sanitation through building their own household latrine. 

Chris Good also joined the Board in April 2023 having 
spent his career in the consumer care industry, most 
recently at Estée Lauder as a member of the Executive 
Committee. Chris’ insights into beauty care markets and 
consumers will be of great value to Croda and the Board.

In my first letter to shareholders as your Chair in 2016, I 
emphasised the Board’s commitment to high standards 
of corporate governance and to instilling the right culture, 
behaviours and approach to how we do business. We 
have never wavered from that commitment and I am 
pleased that the high standards of corporate governance 
at Croda were recognised in the recent independent 
Board review. Our achievements as a Board and as a 
company have benefitted from the contribution of all 
Board Directors past and present to whom I offer my 
heartfelt thanks. 

In 2015, I was one of only two female Board members. 
Today, Croda has exceeded the gender and ethnic 
diversity requirements of the Parker Review and the 
FTSE Women Leaders Review and operates a fully 
gender balanced Board. I am proud of the progress that 
we have made on this topic, in line with my belief that 
diversity of experience is critical to Board effectiveness. 

When I look back on almost a decade as Chair of Croda, 
I am pleased to have worked with Steve Foots and his 
executive team to transform Croda into a focused 
Consumer Care and Life Sciences company.  

Introducing Croda’s Chair-
designate, Danuta Gray

“With its talented 
employees, positive 
culture and refocused 
portfolio, Croda has an 
exciting future and I look 
forward to working with 
the Croda team to deliver 
on the opportunities that 
are ahead.”

Danuta was appointed to the Board on 1 February 2024 and will take over 
as Chair at the conclusion of the AGM on 24 April 2024. Danuta has held 
Board positions at FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies across a range of 
sectors and is currently Chair of Direct Line Insurance Group Plc and a 
Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee at 
Burberry Group Plc. She is also a member of the Board of Trustees of the 
Resolution Foundation and supporter of Employ Autism. She has extensive 
Non-Executive listed company Board experience having previously been 
Chair of St Modwen Property Plc and also serving on the Boards of 
Aldermore Bank Plc, Old Mutual Plc, Page Group Plc, Paddy Power Plc 
and Aer Lingus Plc.

This transition has involved continued investment and 
multiple acquisitions during my tenure and has opened 
exciting new growth opportunities for the business. 

It has been a great privilege to serve as your Chair and I 
am proud of the progress we have made. I would like to 
thank all of my Croda colleagues for their support and 
commitment and wish them all the best for the exciting 
future ahead.

by combining sustainability and 
innovation. By helping our 
customers to differentiate their 
products and meet their own 
ambitious sustainability goals,  
we deliver growth in our own 
business while creating positive 
impacts for planet and society.

What we do

We use our smart science to create high performance ingredients and technologies that 
improve people’s lives. 

We are a B2B company that, through direct local relationships, sells small quantities of 
high-value ingredients to customers of all sizes. These ingredients deliver vital functionality 
and downstream benefits at low inclusion levels, giving us a strong competitive advantage. 
We operate globally with a focus on high-value niches in consumer care and life science 
markets. We work closely with customers at every stage of the value chain and aim to 
enhance our reputation for innovation, sustainability and quality in everything that we do.

  Read more about how we are driving positive impacts and operational excellence across the value chain on page 14

The 
solutions  
we provide

Consumer Care
We develop innovative and 
sustainable ingredients that provide 
vital functionality to consumer care 
formulations, enabling customers 
to differentiate their products,  
build strong brands, meet their 
sustainability commitments and 
satisfy changing consumer 
requirements. For example,  
we extract wrinkle-reducing  
actives from plants that are  
critical ingredients in anti-ageing 
skin creams.

Life Sciences
Pharma
We develop components and 
systems for the delivery of Active 
Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), 
supporting customers across the 
whole lifecycle of a drug – from 
early-stage research to commercial 
manufacture. For example, our 
ingredients encapsulate the mRNA 
used in vaccines allowing it to be 
transported into human cells.

Agriculture
We are an innovation partner to 
major crop science companies and 
an increasing number of smaller 
customers, developing delivery 
systems to meet the sustainability 
challenges of current-generation 
products and to enable next-
generation solutions. For example, 
our technologies ensure crop care 
formulations are biodegradable in 
the soil.

Science Based Target. We are 
working to provide our customers 
with the verified product-level 
carbon footprint data that, together 
with the reduced and avoided 
emissions in use that our 
technologies can bring, will help 
them deliver on their climate targets.

science to improve the lives of 
people around the world, targeting 
vaccine solutions to the most 
challenging diseases and 
protecting millions of people

What our 
business 
needs

Our 
competitive 
advantages

Employees
We employ 5,852 individuals, with employee costs 
accounting for approximately 20% of our sales. We 
commercialise and develop their skills and knowledge 
to drive a high return on sales. The employee base is 
expanding globally, with notable growth in science-
based roles and increasing workforce diversity. 

Raw materials
Raw material costs constitute approximately 35%  
of our sales. Our raw materials primarily comprise 
bio-based (rather than petrochemical-derived) 
resources, including grown commodities and natural 
oils. Overall, raw material costs fell in 2023, following  
a period of significant inflation in 2021-22.

R&D
In 2023, we allocated £62m to in-house innovation. 
This investment is supplemented by a robust pipeline  
of technology acquisitions and over 500 open 
innovation partnerships. These collaborations with 
universities, SMEs and leading scientists enhance our 
R&D capabilities and provide access to specialised  
expertise and facilities. 

Supply chain and logistics
A global network of local warehouses ensures efficient 
delivery of ingredients to customers worldwide, despite 
recent global supply chain challenges. We have actively 
managed down our finished goods inventory back to 
pre-Covid levels. 

Sites and infrastructure
We invest 6-8% of sales in capital expenditure  
annually to maintain, develop, and decarbonise our 
sites and infrastructure. Targeted organic investments 
are being made to scale up our pharmaceutical 
technology platforms. 

Energy
Energy costs represent approximately 3% of our  
sales. Our efficient use of energy, sourced from diverse 
internal and external sources, minimises its proportion 
in our cost structure. Renewable energy was 37% of 
total energy use in 2023.

Capital
Our capital requirements are primarily met through 
loans and credit facilities, including a sustainable 
banking facility, with no significant debt maturing before 
2026. Our leverage ratio of 1.3x net debt to EBITDA is 
at the lower end of our targeted range of 1-2x over the 
medium-term cycle, providing flexibility for future 
organic growth and potential acquisitions.

Regulations
Operating globally, we adhere to relevant regulations 
governing our product ingredients and applications, 
with regulatory change often driving requirements  
for our innovation. Active involvement in shaping 
regulations and standards, alongside collaborative 
efforts with industry partners, helps maintain product 
efficacy, increase competitive advantage and build 
stakeholder confidence. 

1. ‘One Croda’ culture
United by our strong sense of Purpose and our values, 
we work as one team. We promote a ‘One Croda’ 
culture through our Remuneration Policy and high levels 
of employee share ownership. We strive to be more 
agile and entrepreneurial than our competitors, with a 
decentralised operating model that ensures decisions 
are made ‘close to customers’. 

  See pages 16-17

2. Customer intimacy 
We employ our own local, science-focused sales force 
who understand our customers, rather than using 
distributors. This direct selling model builds relationships 
with customers and provides us with insights about 
their challenges that are key to how we innovate. We 
complement direct selling with local innovation centres 
where we co-formulate with customers to accelerate 
their time-to-market. This intimacy coupled with 
innovation enables us to anticipate future demands 
faster than our competition, particularly more disruptive 
market changes, such as the demand for sustainable 
ingredients and solutions from novel technologies.

3. Innovation leadership
We are the leading innovator in our markets with a 
technology portfolio differentiated by protected 
intellectual property and know-how, including over 
1,600 patents across more than 275 patent families. 
This means our ingredients have unique attributes and 
deliver higher value to our customers. We have a 
collaborative, open innovation model which combines 
internal R&D with partnering and technology acquisitions.

4. Sustainability leadership
With a heritage of using natural raw materials and 
providing sustainable solutions, we have embedded  
a long-term sustainability strategy in the way we work  
to ensure we deliver on our Commitment to be the 
world’s most sustainable supplier of innovative 
ingredients by 2030. With consumers and other 
end-customers keen to make a positive impact through 
their purchasing decisions, the creation of sustainable 
ingredients and offering sustainability claims through  
the use of our products are key drivers of our future 
commercial success. 

5. Our approach to growth
Our growth strategy is focused on pioneering new 
market and technology niches where our leadership in 
innovation and sustainability allows us to compete on 
value rather than on price.

We operate flexible, capital-light manufacturing sites, 
rather than large continuous operation plans, producing 
ingredients in test tube quantities rather than tanker 
loads. Our principal focus is on driving the continued 
differentiation of our portfolio through innovation and 
sustainability. In parallel, we prioritise sales volumes  
in those parts of the portfolio where there is less 
differentiation to underpin consistent plant utilisation.

There is no one big competitor that spans all our 
markets; instead, there are different competitors in each 
of our niches. We have a broad base of customers, 
large and small, and a high number of customer/ 
product combinations which reduces our exposure  
to any specific customer, market or geography.

at 42 sites globally,  
all of which have 
decarbonisation 
roadmaps in place.

We employ our own 
sales teams rather  
than use distributors, 
enabling us to build 
close partnerships  
with our customers  
and anticipate  
future demands.

By using our 
innovative 
ingredients, 
customers  
maximise the impact  
of their products 
with minimum 
footprints, so that 
our smart science 
contributes to 
improving lives.

How we are creating value

We are increasing 
our partnerships with 
universities and 
SMEs to access a 
broader range of 
scientific expertise 
and ensuring that all 
innovation is 
impact-focused by 
considering the 
lifecycle of customer 
products during the 
design phase.

We are focused on 
ensuring our sourcing 
has a positive impact on 
planet and society and 
are transforming how 
we manufacture to  
meet our Sustainability 
Commitment and 
support customers  
in meeting theirs. We  
are improving our 
understanding of asset 
utilisation to aid capacity 
planning, particularly 
during this period  
of limited visibility  
and uncertain  
customer demand.

We are building  
a more complete 
picture of the wider 
benefits in use of  
our ingredients by 
engaging with 
customers to 
understand the  
full lifecycle of  
our products.

We are improving

Employees
We take the safety and wellbeing of our employees seriously and pay 
all employees globally a Living Wage. Our people can have engaging 
and rewarding careers, undertaking meaningful purpose-driven work 
that has a positive impact on society and the environment. We regularly 
engage with employees through surveys, listening groups and other 
face-to-face engagement mechanisms, to understand their 
perspective, recognising that our people drive the future success  
of our business. Key topics of engagement in 2023 included safety, 
cost-of-living support, the challenging trading environment and need to 
control costs, and the impact of our new operating model. With the 
majority of employees actively participating in share schemes, we 
benefit from strong alignment of interests between stakeholders. 

Customers and consumers
With sales of more than 6,000 products to more than 15,000 
customers, our solutions enable a broad range of customers to 
differentiate their products. Our customers value our product quality, 
responsive sales teams, technical support, and the impact that our 
innovative and sustainable ingredients can have. We engage regularly 
with customers through our direct selling model and through customer 
surveys with over 3,000 responses received in 2023. Our customer 
NPS increased by 11 points to +34 in 2023 and sits within the 
category of ‘Great’, reflecting our desire to be close to customers. 
Engagement in 2023 often covered stock management, online service 
and recent innovation. 

Suppliers
We are committed to fair payment practices but also partner with 
suppliers to help improve sustainability practices in supply chains.  
This includes helping them to understand our requirements on supply 
chain transparency, ethics, and human rights, with suppliers assessed 
through EcoVadis assessments. By 2023 83% of key suppliers by 
volume had been assessed by EcoVadis. With most of our carbon 
emissions embedded in our supply chain, engagement with suppliers 
to understand emissions data is critical in providing Product Carbon 
Footprint data to customers, but our focus goes beyond carbon, with  
a commitment to be Net Nature Positive and to reduce impacts on 
biodiversity. 

Innovation partners
Our innovation activities include collaboration with academia, SMEs 
and our customers to accelerate innovation. Our shared knowledge 
enables our innovation partners to secure funding, advance science 
and make breakthroughs, ultimately helping us to grow sales of New 
and Protected Products as we commercialise this innovation. To date 
nearly 600 innovation partners have collaborated on over 300 
innovation projects. Engagement topics in 2023 included sustainable 
innovation, leveraging biotechnology and green chemistry. 

Shareholders
We aim to deliver consistent top and bottom-line growth in a way that 
benefits the environment and society, which should deliver attractive 
returns to shareholders over the long term. We engage extensively with 
shareholders to help them understand our performance and strategy 
and to gain insight that can help guide our thinking. In 2023, 
engagement included discussions on the challenging trading conditions 
and the impact on financial performance. We also continued to engage 
on our non-financial performance and strategy, reflecting the 
importance of ESG practices to our investors. 

Communities
We support local communities through educational outreach and 
provide access to our smart science through the Croda Foundation, 
working to ensure that the local communities where we operate benefit 
from our presence. In 2023 Croda employees donated 5,310 hours of 
their time volunteering in local communities through the 1% Club and 
by the end of the year the Croda Foundation had improved the lives of 
more than 22 million people. Our community liaison activities are 
localised, ensuring our communities can engage on the issues 
significant to them.

NGOs
Acting responsibly ensures we satisfy regulatory requirements,  
protect our reputation and extend our positive impact through our 
influence within trade associations and other non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs). We engage with various NGOs on topics 
including upcoming regulations, supply chain sustainability and human 
rights both directly and through membership of industry working 
groups and task forces. This includes our work as part of Together for 
Sustainability, a consortia of chemical companies working to improve 
sustainability practices. In 2023, 88% of palm oil derivative volumes 
were RSPO certified.

Section 172(1) statement
The Board of Directors confirms that during the year under review, 
it has acted to promote the long-term success of the Company 
for the benefit of shareholders, whilst having due regard to the 
matters set out in Section 172(1) (a) to (f) of the Companies Act 
2006, being:

•  the likely consequences of any decision in the long term
•  the interests of the Company’s employees
•  the need to foster the Company’s business relationships with 

suppliers, customers and others

Measuring culture
Our Purpose and Sustainability Commitment (PSC) survey, introduced 
in 2022, helps us gain insight into how employees feel about aspects 
of Croda’s culture. Alongside town hall meetings and listening groups, 
the insight we gain is invaluable and helps us identify focus areas to 
improve employee experience and engagement. Overall, our PSC 
score for 2023 was 68%, flat against 2022, despite the challenging 
trading environment leading to increased pressure on our people. 

71% 

of employees are 
highly likely to 
recommend Croda as 
a great place to work 
to family and friends

75% 

of employees overall 
enjoy the work that 
they do

76% 

of employees are 
highly likely to see 
leaders and managers 
guiding them to 
achieve their  
activities safely

79%

of employees overall 
work to deliver their 
best as efficiently as 
they can

Looking below the headline score, we saw encouraging responses in 
areas for improvement that were identified in 2022 and became our 
focus for 2023. Reward and recognition saw improved responses, in 
part reflecting the cost-of-living pressures and our actions to support 
employees including one-off support payments, as well as the 
introduction of the Free Share Plan in 2021.

Employees’ ability to get involved with activities outside of their role and 
to focus on self-led development were scored less positively in 2023 
but remained ‘good’. We view this as a symptom of the requirement  
to focus on delivering value in a challenging year. Although feedback 
suggests employees feel their workloads are more manageable, we 
believe we have more work to do in ensuring employees have time to 
be curious, develop and to get involved in employee-led activities that 
contribute to our culture.

We have already laid the foundations to improve with changes 
implemented to our hiring and talent planning activities in 2023. For 
instance, we implemented Competency Insights profiles for new hires 
to aid in the review of areas for initial development for new employees. 
In talent planning, departments worked with HR Business Partners  
to highlight potential career paths, aligned to the competences and 
skills needed in different roles and different areas of the business.  
This gives employees a clearer idea of where to focus their 
development activities and helps managers have more  
meaningful development conversations.

Developing our Employee  
Value Proposition (EVP)

In 2023, we developed our EVP framework to support our people 
strategy and to help our people connect with the core ideas that 
enhance Croda’s culture. Our EVP focuses on:

Developing our people
The development and retention of high-quality people with the curiosity 
and ability to challenge conventional thinking and to further innovation 
ultimately determines the success of our business. Central to our 
philosophy is self-led development with extensive learning resources 
made available to our people. Our target is for all employees to receive 
at least one week’s training in 2024, with our people collectively 
undertaking over 197,000 hours of training in 2023, equivalent to 33.7 
hours of training per employee (2022: 26.1 hours). Our leadership 
development programmes offer a more structured approach to 
development with around 170 high-potential individuals participating  
in development programmes in 2023, with all those selected exhibiting 
model behaviours aligned with our values.

Our development programmes:
Leadership Development Group plus: For established senior colleagues 
in key roles, who may have completed other development programmes

Leadership Development Group: High performing, high potential  
senior colleagues

Accelerated Leadership Programme: High performing, mid-level 
colleagues showing leadership behaviours

Leading with purpose: A values-aligned development programme 
available to all grades

Phoenix Rising: For a cross section of colleagues looking to unlock 
potential and/or increase contribution – participants must display a 
strong commitment to inclusion and self development

Wellbeing and safety
Our leaders worked on embedding safety  
as a value in 2023, recognising that while 
priorities change, our values endure and 
guide how we behave. Through a tailored 
programme, more than 500 leaders have 
collectively undertaken over 4,500 hours of 
safety training aimed at building confidence 
around safety leadership and driving debate 
on safety. Scores for safety-orientated 
questions in our PSC questionnaires have 
improved, indicating that this focus is 
impacting how employees are feeling and 
interacting on safety initiatives. Our Total 
Recordable Injury Rate improved in 2023 
(see page 35) but remains too high and  
we hope improving sentiment and focus  
on safety by employees is a positive  
leading indicator.

A collaborative and supportive 
workplace
We embrace our differences, nurturing  
an inclusive and supportive culture where 
everyone feels valued, respected and 
empowered to contribute. Employee-led 
diversity and inclusion networks support us 
in raising awareness, creating connections 
and ensuring that all aspects of diversity  
are considered in decision-making. Our 1% 
club allows employees to spend working 
hours contributing to local communities, 
with 5,310 hours donated in 2023. Our 
voluntary employee turnover remains  
below industry averages and in 2023  
was 9.1% (2022: 8.5%), a small increase 
against the prior year reflecting the  
difficult trading environment in 2023  
and near-term uncertainty.

includes employee numbers, pay ratios, training and safety data.

Reward and recognition
We are committed to paying all employees a Global Living 
Wage and work closely with the Fair Wage Network to 
ensure employees continue to be paid more than this.  
Our reward framework supports our ‘One Croda’ culture 
with performance metrics for bonus schemes aligned 
across the Group. In addition, our Free Share Plan awards 
shares to employees who do not participate in our senior 
annual Bonus Plan when an award under this Bonus Plan 
is made, ensuring everyone shares in our success. Recent 
surveys indicate access to generous employee share 
plans is valued, with 83% of UK employees and 71%  
of non-UK employees participating in these schemes. 
Employees can also enjoy non-financial benefits, such as 
free healthcare plans, flexible working and other wellbeing 
focused benefits. 

Positive impact through sustainable innovation
A key aspect of Croda’s success is a can-do 
entrepreneurial spirit that pervades through our business. 
Our people have the freedom to find solutions, explore 
new ideas and collaborate to drive positive change, 
something that is celebrated through our annual ‘Purpose 
in Action’ awards. As a celebration of those who embody 
our Purpose and have a positive impact, the awards, 
hosted by Group Chief Executive, Steve Foots, recognise 
individuals and teams. In 2023, there were 98 projects 
nominated – many of which were employee-led initiatives 
born out of a drive to solve problems. The opportunity  
to have a positive impact through sustainable innovation  
is often a key factor in employees joining and staying  
with Croda.

Chief Executive’s statement

Strategic delivery in a  
challenging environment

As a consequence, sales volumes were down across all sectors. 
Adjusting for the divestment of the majority of the Performance 
Technologies and Industrial Chemicals (PTIC) business to Cargill  
on 30 June 2022, Group sales fell by 11% on a pro forma basis  
to £1,694.5m (2022 pro forma (pf): £1,898m), comprising  
positive price/mix, lower volumes, a contribution for the Solus  
Biotech acquisition completed in July and a small headwind from 
currency translation.

In 2023, average customer inventories were below 2022 levels but 
remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. In Consumer  
Care, indications are that destocking has largely worked its way through 
the supply chain with a slow improvement in sales volumes in the year. 
By contrast, weak industrial demand globally impacted Industrial 
Specialties where volumes remained weak. Similarly, customers in 
agriculture markets continued to reduce inventory levels throughout the 
second half year having started destocking in the second quarter, later 
than in other markets. In Pharma, our ability to react quickly with valuable 
lipid technology allowed us to support mRNA vaccine sales through the 
Covid-19 pandemic. Inevitably, as Covid demand fell, this resulted in 
lower shipments in 2023, contributing to just over half of the Life Sciences 
variance from prior year, but we still supplied c.$60m of Covid lipids in 
2023 (2022: c.$120m). The Covid experience did allow us to establish 
our technology and provided us with valuable insights, facilitating resilient 
non-Covid sales as customer drug pipelines continue to develop.

Significant volume declines across most of our markets at a similar  
time led to low levels of capacity utilisation at our manufacturing sites, 
particularly those that produce ingredients for multiple business units, 
with negative operating leverage impacting profit margins. Whilst there 
are likely to be some bounce-back costs as trading normalises, there  
are also opportunities for margin expansion from higher sales volumes 
and improved mix particularly if the recovery is broad-based across  
our markets.

IFRS operating profit was £247.5m (2022: £444.7m) and adjusted 
operating profit was £320.0m (2022 pf: £476m), adjusting for the one-off 
exceptional items outlined in the Finance review. The adjusted operating 
margin of 18.9% (2022 pf: 25%) was negatively impacted by the 
operating leverage effect of the reduction in volumes and lower sales of 
high-margin lipid systems for Covid-19 vaccine applications. Profit before 
tax (on an IFRS basis) was £236.3m (2022: £780.0m), with the prior year 
including a gain on the PTIC business divestment of £356.0m, and 
adjusted profit before tax was £308.8m (2022 pf: £463m).

Despite the impact of the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty, the 
technology trends that will drive our future growth have not changed  
with a continued transition to sustainable ingredients and biologics.  
We have successfully realigned our portfolio with these megatrends and 
are making strategic progress with continued investment through the 
downturn in R&D and capacity. Demand for innovation has remained 
strong among our customers, which will be key to driving a recovery  
in Croda’s performance as the macro-environment improves. Sales  
of New and Protected Products (NPP) held up well at 34% of total  
sales (2022: 35%), with an increase in the proportion of NPP sales  
in Consumer Care. Customer demand for our ingredients that are 
differentiated by their sustainability characteristics has also been  
resilient with sales of ECO surfactants, for example, up by more than 
20% year-on-year. 

Our commitment to sustainability is demonstrated by the progress  
we have continued to deliver in our non-financial performance.  
We remain on track to meet our 2030 Science Based Targets for 
emissions reduction, the Croda Foundation has already sustainably 
improved the lives of more than 22 million people and we delivered more 
than 4,500 hours of training to leaders as we embed safety as a value. 
Our sustainability leadership was recognised by CDP, which awarded us 
leadership status for the first time, complementing our long-standing triple 
A rating from MSCI. 

“Despite the impact of the prevailing 
macroeconomic uncertainty, the 
technology trends that will drive our  
future growth have not changed with  
an accelerating transition to sustainable 
ingredients and biologics.”

Steve Foots
Group Chief Executive

A challenging year with destocking and a weaker 
macro environment
Croda’s performance in 2023 reflects challenging market conditions 
throughout the year with customer destocking and weaker economic 
conditions. It follows a record performance in 2021 and 2022 when  
the Group significantly benefitted from customers building up inventory 
levels in the face of strong consumer demand, escalating prices and 
supply chain disruption. As central banks raised interest rates to manage 
inflation and market conditions softened, customers subsequently 
reduced inventory levels, albeit at different times across the different 
market segments and geographies that we serve. For Croda and the 
wider chemical industry, this resulted in a prolonged period of destocking 
that was unprecedented in the breadth of its impact across most 
markets, compounded by a slower economic recovery in China than 
some of our customers had anticipated.

Chief Executive’s statement continued

Managing challenging market conditions 
To mitigate the impact of tough trading conditions, we took some 
immediate actions to actively manage cash flow and address costs  
to protect profitability, while increasing customer sales activity to drive 
incremental sales growth. Production schedules were optimised to meet 
lower demand, reducing energy and freight costs. Underlying employee 
costs were broadly flat as inflation-based salary increases were offset by 
a hiring freeze and natural attrition. In addition, Group margin benefitted 
by one and a half percentage points due to negligible charges for variable 
remuneration. Cash flow improved through proactive management of 
working capital and our balance sheet remains strong, enabling us to  
pay an increased full year dividend and to continue to invest the £665m 
proceeds from the divestment of PTIC, the business we sold in 2022. 

Alongside these temporary cost reduction measures, we have been 
driving improvements that will deliver sustained benefits to our operational 
effectiveness over the longer term. Priorities have included consolidating 
our site footprint and delivering our ‘doing the basics brilliantly’ 
programme to drive ongoing efficiencies. This programme will improve 
customer experience and employee productivity through a combination 
of customer insights, digital technology, and streamlined processes. Our 
customer net promoter score (NPS) has improved further from +23 in 
2022 to +34 in 2023.

Following rapid portfolio transition in recent years through the acquisitions 
and divestments we have made, a new organisational structure has been 
in place since the start of 2024 to further streamline our operating model. 
Previously, the Consumer Care and Life Sciences sectors were 
responsible for strategy whereas the regions were responsible for 
performance. Now, all regional teams, including sales, R&D, marketing, 
customer service and manufacturing, report directly into Consumer  
Care and Life Sciences. The Presidents of these sectors are now fully 
accountable for their performance and strategy including innovation, 
sustainability and the acquisition of technologies aligned with our strategic 
priorities. This clarifies accountability, simplifies the organisation for our 
employees, is more cost efficient and will ensure we deliver faster and 
more effectively for our customers, positioning us well to take advantage 
of the recovery. 

Regional summary
Key drivers of performance were similar globally in 2023, notably a slow 
but steady improvement in Consumer Care in the second half year as 
customers worked through heightened inventory levels but a weakening 
performance in Life Sciences mainly driven by rapid destocking by Crop 
Protection customers which began in the second quarter. Performance  
in Asia reflected these global drivers, with Consumer Care improving and 
Life Sciences weakening during the year. Despite demand in China not 
recovering as quickly as some of our customers had anticipated, our 
direct Consumer Care sales to China were robust, partly owing to strong 
relationships with regional customers who value our innovation expertise. 
Sales fell in North America although the declines were less significant in 
the second half year and we began to win back some sales in Consumer 
Care which were lost in 2022 through our inability to supply ingredients 
for certain periods. Consumer Care sales grew in Europe, particularly in 
Beauty Care and Home Care. Latin America was the strongest region  
but saw adverse impacts from destocking in Crop Protection as well  
as significant currency movements during the second half year. 

Sector summary

Consumer Care – leadership in innovation and 
sustainability driving demand
Consumer Care sales fell 1% to £886.1m (2022: £897.8m) with strong 
double-digit percentage sales growth in Fragrances and Flavours (F&F) 
but lower underlying sales in Beauty Actives, Beauty Care and Home 
Care. Price/mix was up 2%, mainly due to a positive mix impact from 
Beauty Actives, with pricing broadly flat. Sales volumes were down 4% 

year-on-year but were up 9% in the second half year compared with the 
second half of 2022. Acquisitions added 1% due to sales of ceramides 
following the Solus Biotech acquisition, with foreign currency translation  
a small headwind for the full year. 

IFRS operating profit was £127.8m (2022: £144.5m) and adjusted 
operating profit was £160.3m (2022: £204.7m), resulting in adjusted 
operating margin reducing to 18.1% (2022: 22.8%). Four and a half 
percentage points of the margin decline was due to the operating gearing 
effect of continued weak volumes in Consumer Care, compounded by 
lower volumes in Life Sciences and Industrial Specialties which share the 
same manufacturing assets, with overheads therefore allocated across all 
sectors. Two percentage points of the margin decline was due to weaker 
mix, primarily as a result of strong growth of lower margin F&F sales, with 
the lower variable remuneration charge and earn out accrual release 
providing a two percentage point offset. 

In Consumer Care, our leadership in sustainability and innovation 
continues to drive customer demand for Croda’s differentiated ingredient 
portfolio. NPP improved to 42% of total sales (2022: 41%) and sales of 
sustainable ingredients such as ECO surfactants and biotech-derived 
ingredients were stronger than other ingredients in our portfolio. To 
support demand for lower carbon ingredients, we can now provide 
carbon footprint data for three quarters of the Beauty Care portfolio  
so that customers can quantify the benefits associated with using our 
ingredients in their products. Sales to Asia exceeded sales to North 
America for the first time with significant potential for further growth.  
We are prioritising the region for investment in R&D and manufacturing, 
particularly in China and India where underlying sales grew 12%. 

The stand-out performer in 2023 was F&F which delivered 18% 
underlying sales growth, benefitting from its distinctive positioning in 
fast-growing markets and agile, cost competitive model. F&F sales were 
up in all product categories and established regions, with the Middle  
East particularly strong. F&F’s excellent sales growth principally reflects 
its high exposure to local and regional customers outside North America 
and Europe, as well as sales synergies that are being realised under 
Croda’s ownership. 

In Beauty Actives, reported sales were up 4% or down 1% on an 
underlying basis (i.e. excluding the Solus Biotech acquisition). Positive  
mix helped offset weaker volumes as sales of Sederma active ingredients 
grew, particularly in China, whereas sales of lower value botanical 
ingredients fell. Beauty Actives supported customer product launches 
including the new Boots No7 Future Renew range and a new Deciem 
product that repairs scars caused by acne. Having completed our 
acquisition of Solus Biotech in July, we are excited about the opportunities 
that the addition of further fermentation-derived active ingredients, 
notably ceramides, are starting to open up. 

Performance remained weakest in Beauty Care with sales down 11% 
driven by lower volumes. Our approach here is to manage sales volumes 
in the less differentiated parts of the portfolio to help base-load our 
manufacturing assets and cover fixed costs, while accelerating 
differentiation by driving innovation, enhancing the sustainability profile of 
our ingredients, and transitioning our manufacturing processes to biotech 
and other low carbon technologies. The 20% plus growth in sales of ECO 
surfactants during a challenging year, and a continued increase in sales 
of sulphate-free ‘clean’ surfactants, illustrate continued customer demand 
for bio-based, lower carbon and biodegradable ingredients. 

The recovery of sales volumes in Home Care accelerated as the year 
progressed, with underlying sales down 1% year-on-year but up 12%  
in the second half compared with the second half of 2022. Once again  
it was sales of innovative ingredients differentiated by sustainability that 
led the way, including our range of biopolymers which extend the life of 
fabrics with future growth underpinned by a long-term contract with a  
key customer.

Chief Executive’s statement continued

Managing challenging market conditions 

To mitigate the impact of tough trading conditions, we took some 

immediate actions to actively manage cash flow and address costs  

to protect profitability, while increasing customer sales activity to drive 

incremental sales growth. Production schedules were optimised to meet 

lower demand, reducing energy and freight costs. Underlying employee 

costs were broadly flat as inflation-based salary increases were offset by 

a hiring freeze and natural attrition. In addition, Group margin benefitted 

by one and a half percentage points due to negligible charges for variable 

remuneration. Cash flow improved through proactive management of 

working capital and our balance sheet remains strong, enabling us to  

pay an increased full year dividend and to continue to invest the £665m 

proceeds from the divestment of PTIC, the business we sold in 2022. 

Alongside these temporary cost reduction measures, we have been 

driving improvements that will deliver sustained benefits to our operational 

effectiveness over the longer term. Priorities have included consolidating 

our site footprint and delivering our ‘doing the basics brilliantly’ 

programme to drive ongoing efficiencies. This programme will improve 

customer experience and employee productivity through a combination 

of customer insights, digital technology, and streamlined processes. Our 

customer net promoter score (NPS) has improved further from +23 in 

2022 to +34 in 2023.

Following rapid portfolio transition in recent years through the acquisitions 

and divestments we have made, a new organisational structure has been 

in place since the start of 2024 to further streamline our operating model. 

Previously, the Consumer Care and Life Sciences sectors were 

responsible for strategy whereas the regions were responsible for 

performance. Now, all regional teams, including sales, R&D, marketing, 

customer service and manufacturing, report directly into Consumer  

Care and Life Sciences. The Presidents of these sectors are now fully 

accountable for their performance and strategy including innovation, 

sustainability and the acquisition of technologies aligned with our strategic 

priorities. This clarifies accountability, simplifies the organisation for our 

employees, is more cost efficient and will ensure we deliver faster and 

more effectively for our customers, positioning us well to take advantage 

of the recovery. 

Regional summary

Key drivers of performance were similar globally in 2023, notably a slow 

but steady improvement in Consumer Care in the second half year as 

customers worked through heightened inventory levels but a weakening 

performance in Life Sciences mainly driven by rapid destocking by Crop 

Protection customers which began in the second quarter. Performance  

in Asia reflected these global drivers, with Consumer Care improving and 

Life Sciences weakening during the year. Despite demand in China not 

recovering as quickly as some of our customers had anticipated, our 

direct Consumer Care sales to China were robust, partly owing to strong 

relationships with regional customers who value our innovation expertise. 

Sales fell in North America although the declines were less significant in 

the second half year and we began to win back some sales in Consumer 

Care which were lost in 2022 through our inability to supply ingredients 

for certain periods. Consumer Care sales grew in Europe, particularly in 

Beauty Care and Home Care. Latin America was the strongest region  

but saw adverse impacts from destocking in Crop Protection as well  

as significant currency movements during the second half year. 

Sector summary

Consumer Care – leadership in innovation and 

sustainability driving demand

Consumer Care sales fell 1% to £886.1m (2022: £897.8m) with strong 

double-digit percentage sales growth in Fragrances and Flavours (F&F) 

but lower underlying sales in Beauty Actives, Beauty Care and Home 

year-on-year but were up 9% in the second half year compared with the 

second half of 2022. Acquisitions added 1% due to sales of ceramides 

following the Solus Biotech acquisition, with foreign currency translation

Beauty Actives, with pricing broadly flat. Sales volumes were down 4% 

Life Sciences – continued progress building industry-
leading positions in high-growth markets
Life Sciences sales were down 12% to £602.3m (2022: £682.3m), with 
approximately seven percentage points of the reduction due to lower 
sales of lipid systems for Covid-19 vaccine applications. On a reported 
basis, positive price/mix of 3% partly offset a 15% decline in volume,  
the majority of which was due to destocking by Crop Protection 
customers with a small effect from similar trends in consumer health. 
There was also a contribution from six months of phospholipid sales 
following completion of the Solus Biotech acquisition in July and a small 
foreign currency headwind.

IFRS operating profit was £131.7m (2022: £220.3m) and adjusted 
operating profit was £150.3m (2022: £229.4m), resulting in an adjusted 
operating margin of 25.0% (2022: 33.6%). Six percentage points of the 
margin reduction was the result of adverse price/mix mainly due to lower 
Covid lipid sales, and four percentage points was the result of the 
negative operating leverage effect of lower volumes, mainly in Crop 
Protection, partly offset by the benefit from a negligible variable 
remuneration charge. 

Crop Protection is developing sustainable crop care solutions as well as 
delivery systems for biopesticides, launching two new delivery systems, 
one specially designed for biologicals and the second for drone delivery. 
Following an exceptional 2022, when Crop Protection delivered both 
strong double-digit percentage volume growth and price/mix, the 
business started the year with good momentum, but began to experience 
rapid customer destocking in the second quarter. Volume weakness 
continued throughout the second half year, to fall 21% year-on-year with 
a small offset from positive price/mix, resulting in sales falling 19% overall. 
In Seed Enhancement, most sales are derived from providing just-in-time 
enhancement services for vegetable seeds so the business only saw a 
limited impact from destocking, delivering 9% sales growth driven by 
strong structural growth trends. Seed Enhancement is winning market 
share through its leadership in microplastic-free seed coatings which  
are in high demand following the EU’s decision to ban the use of 
microplastics in agriculture in the next five years. 

Pharma continued to make good progress with its industry-leading 
position in biologics drug delivery as well as recent partnerships and  
new product launches further strengthening the pipeline of opportunities. 
Pharma sales fell 11% but grew 3% excluding lipid sales for Covid-19 
vaccine applications. Whilst we were not immune from the challenges 
impacting the market, including customers reducing inventory levels, 
Covid normalisation and funding constraints for early-stage biotech 
companies, the breadth and diversification of our pharma portfolio 
enabled the business to deliver a resilient performance. Destocking 
primarily affected the heritage consumer health business where customer 
products are often sold over the counter, with lower Covid-19 demand 
adversely impacting Adjuvant Systems sales as well as lipids for 
Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. By contrast, drug delivery technologies for 
Small Molecule, Protein and Nucleic Acid applications continued to grow. 

To drive the growth of Protein/Small Molecule Delivery we opened an 
applications centre in ‘Genome Valley’, Hyderabad, India, and launched 
our first processing aid for biopharma (technologies which are integral  
to the production of therapeutic proteins) which secured its first sales 
within three months of launch. The future growth of Adjuvant Systems will 
benefit from the launch of a new proprietary lipid-based adjuvant and two 
new adjuvant partnerships agreed with Amyris and BSI. One of these is 
for a sustainable squalene adjuvant that is produced by fermentation, 
which is already being qualified by three major vaccine companies.  
In Nucleic Acid Delivery, shipments of c.$60m of lipid systems to our 
principal Covid vaccine customers occurred as planned at the end of  
the fourth quarter, benefitting sector operating profit margin. Continued 
growth will be driven by the commercialisation of new nucleic acid drugs 
with the number in development continuing to expand, and Croda 
supporting most of those that specify a lipid delivery system. The strong 
medium-term growth trajectory for Nucleic Acid Delivery is likely to be 
realised in three phases: firstly, mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases, 

where we are working closely with the Big Pharma companies driving this 
development; secondly, oncology applications which require more 
targeted delivery systems; and thirdly, gene editing therapies such as a 
CRISPR treatment for sickle cell anaemia which we are supporting and 
was recently approved by the US FDA.

Industrial Specialties – contributing to the efficiency of our 
manufacturing assets
Following the PTIC divestment, the retained business became Industrial 
Specialties (IS), operating a supply contract to the new owner of the 
divested business and contributing to the efficiency of our shared 
manufacturing site model by helping to optimise utilisation rates. On a pro 
forma basis, sales fell 35% to £206.1m principally due to lower volumes, 
reflecting destocking and weak industrial demand globally, and limiting 
the ability of IS to help optimise site utilisation. Pro forma adjusted 
operating profit fell 78% to £9.4m as negative operating leverage 
compounded the impact of lower volumes. The impact of these  
adverse market conditions on the SIPO joint venture in China resulted  
in a goodwill impairment charge of £20.8m taken at the 30 June 2023 
balance sheet date. Including the impairment charge, the reported IFRS 
operating loss was £12.0m (2022: £79.9m profit), with the prior period 
including the full contribution from the divested business.

Continued balance sheet strength
Our focus on active cash flow management in 2023 delivered excellent 
results with improved free cash flow reflecting a £29.1m working capital 
inflow (2022: £133.8m outflow) more than offsetting lower profit and 
higher capex. In particular, we focused on managing down our own 
inventories, with stock days falling by approximately 20% during 2023. 
We expect our finished goods inventories to be back to pre-pandemic 
levels by the end of the first quarter of 2024, mitigating the risk that selling 
from stock (manufactured from higher cost raw materials) has a 
detrimental impact on profit margins. 

With improved free cash flow of £165.5m (2022 restated: £157.4m), our 
balance sheet remains strong and we closed the year with net debt of 
£537.6m (2022: £295.2m), including the £227.4m consideration paid on 
completion of the Solus Biotech acquisition in July 2023. The resulting 
debt leverage ratio was 1.3x (2022: 0.5x), within our one to two times 
target range, despite the lower EBITDA.

Given the challenging market conditions, we reviewed the pace of in-flight 
capital expenditure projects, as well as all new proposals for non-safety-
critical projects, whilst continuing to invest in our refocused portfolio to 
drive profitable growth. This resulted in some capital expenditure originally 
planned for 2024 being delayed until 2025. Organic capital expenditure in 
2023 was broadly as expected at £170.1m (2022: £138.5m), focused on 
growing our R&D capability, in Asia especially, and expanding our 
manufacturing footprint to increase capacity.

With our strong balance sheet, we have been able to continue to invest 
despite the weaker macroeconomic environment. R&D investment 
included a new Consumer Care laboratory in Shanghai, China and a new 
applications centre in Hyderabad, India to support growing demand for 
protein and small molecule delivery from pharma customers. With our 
Pharma business a top priority for capital allocation, we also opened an 
adjuvant systems lab in Denmark and are due to expand our R&D 
capabilities for nucleic acid delivery at Alabaster in the USA and in 
Singapore in 2024.

Alongside investments that help deliver the carbon reduction roadmaps 
that we have put in place for all Croda sites, we have also invested in 
capacity expansion focused on Asia, including starting construction  
of a new surfactants plant in Dahej, India, and the first stage of a £30m 
investment in a combined Beauty Actives and F&F manufacturing facility 
in Guangzhou to grow domestic sales in China. In addition to our typical 
capital investment of around 6-8% of sales, we are investing an extra 
£175m over the period 2021 to 2024 to scale up Pharma production, 
particularly to meet forecast market demand for new nucleic acid drugs 
which are widely expected to come to the market from 2025, with the US 
and UK Governments co-investing up to an additional £75m combined. 
We have invested over £110m in the programme to date. As a result of

platforms, enhancing 
future growth.”

the review of phasing of current capital projects, total capital expenditure  
is expected to fall slightly in 2024, but with heightened levels of capex 
(compared to the pre-2021 period) continuing through 2025 as the 
Pharma facilities are built and capacity in Asia comes on-stream. 

We complement organic investment with selective acquisitions of adjacent 
technologies, particularly those which can accelerate our transition to 
greater use of natural raw materials or build new technology platforms, 
enhancing future growth. The acquisition of Solus Biotech from Solus 
Advanced Materials has excellent alignment with our strategic priorities, 
expanding our Asian manufacturing capability, adding a new biotechnology 
R&D hub in the region, and providing our Beauty Actives and Pharma 
businesses with access to Solus’ existing biotech-derived ceramide and 
phospholipid technologies, and its emerging capabilities in natural retinol. 
We will drive sales growth by leveraging Croda’s global selling network  
and formulation science expertise. 

Capital deployment will be executed within our consistent capital allocation 
policy, set out in the Finance review. Alongside organic and inorganic 
investment, the policy provides for a regular and increasing ordinary 
dividend to shareholders, while operating an appropriate balance sheet. 
With 32 years of unbroken dividend progression, consistent distribution  
to shareholders is a critical consideration for the Board. Therefore, despite 
temporarily taking us outside our stated through-the-cycle payout ratio of 
distributing 40-50% of earnings, we have proposed a small increase in the 
full year dividend at 109p a share (2022: 108p). The Board is keeping the 
Company’s future capital requirements under close review.

benefits associated with using them in their products. We are continuing 
to expand this data set to cover more of our ingredient portfolio and a 
broader range of sustainability factors. 

Innovation is at the heart of what we do, creating new market and 
technology niches. We filed more than 100 new patents in 2023  
and have stepped up our rate of innovation through more external 
partnerships, for example with Amyris and BSI for sustainable vaccine 
adjuvants. Even in the unprecedented market conditions that we have 
seen this year, customers are continuing to invest in new product 
development, drawing on Croda’s deep scientific expertise and 
application-focused innovation. The foundation of our innovation model  
is internal R&D investment, applying the expertise of our scientists at our 
global innovation centres to meet customer needs. Our R&D teams now 
report directly into Consumer Care and Life Sciences, ensuring that our 
priorities are customer driven. This is complemented by ‘big bet’ projects 
often delivered with partners from our open innovation network which 
provides access to universities and SMEs, helping develop new 
intellectual property. 

Strategic priorities
We are implementing specific strategic priorities to ensure our refocused 
portfolio delivers consistent top and bottom-line growth. Alongside our 
sector strategies we are (1) scaling biotech, (2) exploring acquisition 
opportunities to supplement organic capital deployment, (3) investing  
in fast growth in Asia, and (4) improving our customer and employee 
experience through our ‘doing the basics brilliantly’ programme.

‘Scaling biotech’ will transform our approach to sustainability, particularly 
in reducing customers’ scope 3 carbon emissions. Projects are underway 
to develop bio-based fragrance ingredients, prioritising aroma chemicals 
which are used in a high proportion of our fragrance references. Our 
Beauty Care business is adding biotech-derived surfactants to our 
existing ECO range, and Beauty Actives is launching novel anti-ageing 
actives developed through collaboration between our biotech and high 
throughput screening centres in the UK, France and Canada. This is  
one example of how Croda is reinforcing its leadership in biotechnology, 
established over more than a decade in plant cell cultures and 
fermentation, and now being enhanced by investment in processing  
for scale up, biocatalysis and synthetic biology. 

We are supplementing our organic investment with ‘acquisitions’, where 
our global scouting network identifies potential adjacent technology 
opportunities in Consumer Care and Life Sciences with the acquisition  
of Solus Biotech in South Korea completed in the year. 

Strategy overview – megatrends intact; continued 
strategic investment through the downturn; well 
positioned for market recovery

There are significant emerging opportunities for Croda across Asia 
particularly in consumer care and pharmaceutical markets. We are driving 
‘fast growth in Asia’, by investing in innovation and sales resource plus 
selective expansion in manufacturing. 

Strategy overview
Despite the challenging market conditions in 2023, the technology trends 
that will drive our future growth have not changed with continued demand 
for sustainable ingredients and a continued transition from small molecule 
active ingredients to large molecule biologics. Through the acquisitions and 
divestments we have made in recent years, we have successfully realigned 
our portfolio with these megatrends and our strategy of combining 
sustainability leadership with market-leading innovation is unchanged. 

In line with our Purpose of using Smart science to improve livesTM, we 
enable customers to realise their sustainability ambitions through the 
application of our innovation and the creation of sustainable ingredients. 
We are reinforcing our sustainability leadership by reducing the adverse 
impact of our operations, by replacing fossil-based ingredients with 
bio-based materials, reducing emissions, promoting biodiversity and 
ensuring our sourcing activities make a positive contribution to 
communities in our supply chains. Our sustainability leadership delivers 
benefits that are increasingly valued by our customers; for example, we 
can now provide cradle-to-gate product-level carbon footprint data for 
approximately 1,300 of our ingredients so that customers can quantify the 

Our ‘doing the basics brilliantly’ programme is simplifying our operating 
processes to improve employee productivity and driving efficiencies 
within our well-established customer-centric model including a new online 
ordering portal complemented by more self-serve data for customers. 
The programme is delivering good results including a 6% improvement 
for ‘ease of doing business’ alongside a further increase in overall net 
promoter score in our latest customer survey. 

Sector strategies
Our sector strategies are to ‘strengthen to grow’ Consumer Care  
and ‘expand to grow’ Life Sciences. We are ‘strengthening to grow’ 
Consumer Care to be the most innovative, sustainable and responsive 
solution provider globally. Even in the current trading environment, 
demand for innovation remains strong and we are continuing to enhance 
our portfolio by adding more fermentation-derived ingredients and 
high-performance replacements for fossil-based products. Similarly, we 
are broadening our unrivalled ability to substantiate ingredient claims to 
include product-level carbon footprint data, incorporating the impact of 

22

decarbonisation to 2030. Finally, the continued fragmentation of 
consumer markets plays to our strengths as we partner with customers 
large and small globally, enabling smaller customers to partner with us to 
launch their products quickly. 

The move to biologics is the key structural driver of growth in both 
pharmaceutical and agriculture markets over the next decade, and we 
are ‘expanding to grow’ Life Sciences to empower biologics delivery. In 
agriculture, this move will enable greater targeting of actives and reduced 
biodiversity impact. In this market we are positioned as an innovation 
partner for delivery systems, creating new systems specifically for the 
delivery of biopesticides and meeting the sustainability challenges of 
conventional pesticide delivery. In pharma markets, the move from 
chemical to biological active pharmaceutical ingredients is already 
underway and we have developed a portfolio focused on segments with 
the highest development and innovation needs. As a result, our pharma 
portfolio has a well-diversified risk profile and opportunity set, which we 
are expanding through new technologies from our own innovation 
pipeline and via partnerships. The competitive positioning of our Pharma 
business is extremely strong, providing delivery systems that are critical 
to next-generation drugs and with excellent customer relationships 
spanning drug discovery through to commercial supply. 

Future performance drivers
In Consumer Care, average customer inventory levels have fallen and 
volume recovery should be an important driver of near-term performance, 
particularly in Beauty Care which has broad market exposure and is 
larger than the other business units. Our approach in Beauty Care is  
to manage sales volumes in those parts of the portfolio where there  
is less differentiation to underpin consistent plant utilisation while also 
accelerating portfolio differentiation through innovation, sustainability and 
biotech. More recent additions to Consumer Care, including ceramides  
in Beauty Actives – which have significant growth potential, and the F&F 
business – which is delivering impressive sales growth albeit at margins 
which are below the average for Consumer Care, can also influence our 
future performance. Geographically, Asian consumer care markets are 
likely to grow faster than the rest of the world, particularly in India and 
China. While our direct sales to China have remained robust, a broad-
based recovery in Chinese consumer spending and travel would underpin 
improved global demand for consumer care products.

In Life Sciences, an end to destocking in Crop Protection markets  
would be an important driver of improved performance in the near term. 
However, the timing of this inflection point is uncertain as destocking 
started later, and customer concentration is higher, so demand can  
be determined by the buying decisions of four or five major customers.  
In addition, agriculture markets are seasonal, so a lack of demand can 
mean that a whole season is missed, but conversely when a recovery 
comes it is likely to have a more immediate effect. Historically, the market 
for field crop seeds experiences changes in demand later in the cycle, so 
the market environment could be tougher in 2024, but for Croda, this risk 
is mitigated by our focus on vegetable seeds as well as market leadership 
in microplastic-free seed coatings and the incremental opportunities that 
are being created by regulation change. 

The challenges that faced pharmaceutical markets in 2023, including  
the reset of demand post Covid-19, destocking and contraction in the 
availability of early-stage funding, appear to be temporary rather than 
structural, but their effects could continue into 2024. Over the longer 
term, accelerating growth and margins will be driven by incremental 
revenue from our own innovation pipeline and the commercialisation  
of new biologic drugs. The drivers of future performance in Pharma are 
therefore the rate of growth of our new delivery systems and vaccine 
adjuvants that we are bringing to the market, many of which are already 
generating revenue and have meaningful peak sales projections, and the 
pace of approval of new mRNA drugs and vaccines, a high proportion of 
which we are supporting during clinical trials and have invested capital in 
to be able to produce at scale when launched.

Outlook 
Consumer Care has started the year well and we are cautiously optimistic 
about the improving demand trend we experienced in January. Within 
Life Sciences, we expect the non-Covid Pharma business to grow but 
that destocking will continue in Crop Protection. Demand in Industrial 
Specialties is expected to remain weak.

Given the ongoing uncertainty in our end markets, the recovery trajectory 
for each of our business units remains difficult to predict and the range  
of possible outcomes in 2024 is therefore wider than usual at this stage 
of the year. Overall, however, the Group expects to deliver mid to high 
single digit percentage sales growth in 2024, excluding the c.$60m of 
Covid-19 lipid sales in 2023, with higher sales volumes more than 
offsetting lower price/mix.

We expect 2024 Group adjusted operating margin to be two to three 
percentage points lower than 2023 due to the following:

•  Different business mix effects year-on-year, with no Covid-19 lipid 

contribution and continued strong growth in Fragrances and Flavours.
•  Low overhead recovery is expected to persist as sales volumes remain 
depressed in Crop Protection and Industrial Specialties, two of the 
three businesses with the highest production volumes, alongside 
Beauty Care.

•  To support the return to sales growth, the cost base will reset back to 
a more normalised level from its low point in 2023. This will include the 
likely unwind in 2024 of the c.£25m benefit we saw in 2023 from a 
negligible variable remuneration charge. Some of this will be offset by 
modest cost savings from our recent reorganisation.

•  We will continue to invest to support our long-term strategy. Customer 

interest in innovation and sustainable ingredients remains strong, 
despite the current destocking cycle.

Using these assumptions and at current exchange rates, we expect 
Group adjusted profit before tax to be between £260m and £300m  
in full year 2024.

Croda will report sales performance quarterly during 2024 and we  
will provide an update on first quarter trading at the AGM on 24 April 
2024. Croda expects to return to its normal cycle of half yearly reporting 
in 2025.

With our strong balance sheet, improving cash flow and consistent 
investment in our refocused portfolio, Croda is well positioned to take 
advantage of the demand recovery when it occurs. We expect the 
Group’s performance to accelerate from 2025, generating continued 
increasing returns for our shareholders.

Meeting 
global 
challenges
Of the trends affecting 
our markets and supply 
chains, we have 
identified three key  
global challenges that 
our strategy helps  
to address.

Technology 
trends 
affecting our 
markets

Feeding a growing 
population and  
restoring nature

Living more sustainably 
within planetary 
boundaries

Global demand for health 
and wellbeing

Feeding a global population that  
is expected to reach 10 billion 
people by 2055 will require a 70% 
increase in agricultural output1. 
With most suitable land already 
farmed, increased output will  
come from higher yields and 
growing more resilient crops on 
less suitable land, supported by 
restoring degraded ecosystems 
and nature. 

Population growth and increasing 
consumption, fuelled by the 
expansion of the middle class 
particularly in developing countries, 
are putting pressure on planetary 
systems such as water, climate 
and biodiversity, and scarce  
natural resources. Addressing this 
challenge requires transformational 
new approaches to consumption 
and circularity. 

The pandemic has made 
consumers more conscious of  
their physical and mental wellbeing, 
and expanded demands on 
healthcare systems, already 
increasing due to a growing and 
ageing population. This has 
increased demand for effective 
ingredients that are underpinned 
by science and support physical 
and mental health.

Move to sustainable ingredients
With population growth and increasing 
consumption putting pressure on planetary 
systems, consumers are supporting companies 
they think are acting responsibly and providing 
solutions to the causes and impacts of climate 
change. This is influencing consumer decisions 
when it comes to the products that they buy. 

As a result, consumer-facing companies are 
looking for ingredients that enable them to 
deliver products with substantiated claims and 
transparent information about their social and 
environmental impacts. 

The move to sustainable ingredients is not 
confined to the consumer market, with crop 
science companies seeking biodegradable 
ingredients with a low carbon footprint, that can 
make a positive contribution to improving yields, 
soil health and biodiversity.

Growing demand for sustainable ingredients is 
also driving increased regulation by industry and 
national authorities.

Move to biologics
The move to biologics – large molecules 
manufactured using microorganisms rather than 
small molecules made by chemical synthesis –  
is transforming medicine and agriculture. 

Biologic drugs are much better at treating 
disease in a targeted way with fewer side effects, 
but they are hard to make, difficult to stabilise, 
and need sophisticated delivery systems. Nucleic 
acid drugs that teach the body to make its own 
medicine represent the next phase in the move 
to biologics, further enhancing patient outcomes 
and increasing drug complexity.

Biologically active technologies, including 
naturally occurring microbes and RNA 
interference, are also being used as precisely 
targeted, environmentally friendly pesticides.

The ability for these biologics to target  
specific elements in the host offers significant 
opportunities to reduce negative impacts  
on the planet and society.

Impact of high inflation
Four years after the outbreak of Covid-19, our market 
environment has continued to experience the ripple 
effects of the pandemic and subsequent surge in 
demand as lockdowns were lifted.

The challenges businesses faced meeting surging 
demand, compounded by the impact on energy and 
food prices of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, resulted in 
the highest inflation the global economy has seen for 
the last 15 years.

From early 2021 until mid-2022, in the face of 
escalating prices, our customers bought ingredients as 
early as possible to reduce their costs, resulting in the 
unprecedented stocking of supply chains.

From the start of 2022, central banks began increasing 
interest rates to manage inflation and reduce overall 
spending. As this monetary tightening took hold, 
customers began to reduce inventory levels, albeit at 
different times across the different market segments 
that we serve.

One impact of this change in the trading environment 
was that raw material costs fell during 2023 enabling  
us to reduce prices in market segments where price is 
important to competitiveness.

Higher interest rates have also negatively impacted  
the availability of funding, particularly for early-stage 
companies which often drive the development of 
nascent technologies in sectors such as 
pharmaceuticals. To date, the impact of this funding 
squeeze on Croda’s Pharma business has been limited, 
as the development of novel drugs that use our delivery 
systems, such as mRNA vaccines for respiratory 
diseases, are principally driven by ‘Big Pharma’. 

With inflation now falling and the US Federal Reserve 
indicating that the period of tightening monetary policy 
could be over, interest rates are likely to fall in 2024, 
supporting lower volatility in customer demand.

Rapid and indiscriminate destocking
The chemical industry has experienced a prolonged 
period of destocking with an impact across all markets. 

In 2021-22, customers carried higher levels of inventory 
to meet surging demand, avoid disruptions and as a 
hedge against inflation. With higher interest rates in 2023, 
customers have freed up capital held in excess stock.

Destocking has been compounded by a weaker 
demand environment, particularly in China, where the 
economy has not recovered from Covid-19 as fast as 
some of our customers were anticipating. 

As a result, order visibility has been shorter than normal, 
and sales volumes were down across most markets. 
This led to low levels of capacity utilisation at our 
‘shared’ manufacturing assets (that produce ingredients 
for multiple business units) with negative operating 
leverage impacting profit margins.

Encouragingly, customer demand for our ingredients 
that are differentiated by their sustainability 
characteristics has been resilient and demand for 
innovation has remained strong. 

In 2023 customer inventories remained elevated 
compared to pre-pandemic levels. In Consumer Care 
inventory levels reduced through the year as shown in 
the chart below, but in Crop Protection inventory levels 
remained significantly elevated. Looking into 2024, 
whilst geopolitical risks remain heightened, customer 
inventory levels should continue to fall.

Driving Group efficiency

“There are further opportunities to 
drive efficiency savings by simplifying 
our business processes and driving 
improvements to the way we work 
that will deliver sustained benefits to 
our operational effectiveness over 
the longer term.”

Louisa Burdett
Chief Financial Officer

Given the challenging trading conditions in 2023, we took some 
immediate actions to address costs, at the same time as driving 
incremental sales growth by increasing customer sales activity and 
using quieter time during 2023 to bring forward maintenance and focus 
on other capital projects. Prioritising customer-facing activities will help 
ensure we can take advantage of the demand recovery when it occurs.

Tight cost control measures were implemented from the second 
quarter of 2023 to maximise profitability. A refreshed operational 
dashboard was also introduced to provide up-to-date performance 
data to leaders. As we saw volumes reset downwards, we optimised 
production to match the lower demand through plant shutdowns, 
reduced shift patterns, and introducing more ‘make to order’ contracts 
with customers. This helped us avoid costs, with energy and freight 
costs falling through the year and second half costs 12% lower than 
the first half. Outside of production, our main focus was on budgeted 
cost avoidance such as restricting travel, curtailing headcount and 
other common-sense measures. 

Annual salary increases were granted at the start of 2023 but a hiring 
freeze from Q2 onwards meant underlying employee headcount fell.  
In addition, a negligible charge for variable remuneration versus 2022 
benefitted operating profit margin. A new organisational structure has 
been in place since the start of 2024, with all regional teams now 
reporting into Consumer Care and Life Sciences. This will ensure we 
deliver more effectively for our customers and should result in annual 
cost savings of £9m from 2025. A £5.4m exceptional restructuring 

charge was recognised in the 2023 accounts associated with the 
introduction of this simpler operating model and we expect a charge  
of low single-digit millions in 2024 as further benefits are realised.  
In addition, we regularly review our site footprint and closed a site at 
Cikarang in Indonesia which principally served industrial customers.

There are further opportunities to drive efficiency savings by simplifying 
our business processes and driving improvements to the way we work 
that will deliver sustained benefits to our operational effectiveness over 
the longer term. A number of workstreams are already underway under 
our ‘doing the basics brilliantly’ programme, including through the use of 
artificial intelligence, data analytics, an online ordering tool that is saving 
hundreds of employee hours, and a multi-year SAP upgrade. 

We have actively managed our cash flow encouraging all employees  
to focus on generating cash, managing down our own inventories and 
collecting payments promptly. This delivered excellent results with 
improved free cash flow due to a working capital inflow and a significant 
reduction in inventory days which fell by around 20%. We expect our 
finished goods inventories to be back to pre-pandemic levels from a 
high point at the end of 2022 by the end of the first quarter of 2024, 
mitigating the risk that selling from stock (manufactured from higher cost 
raw materials) has a detrimental impact on profit margins. Enhanced by 
this improved free cash flow, our balance sheet remains strong with our 
debt leverage ratio within our target range of one to two times. 

During the year we reviewed the pace of all in-flight capital expenditure 
projects, as well as every new proposal for non-safety-critical projects. 
This ensured that we maintained strong capital discipline whilst 
continuing to invest through the downturn in our refocused portfolio  
to drive profitable growth.

In addition to continued organic capital expenditure to support 
significant opportunities for growth across Consumer Care and Life 
Sciences, on 4 July 2023, we completed the acquisition of Solus 
Biotech from Solus Advanced Materials for a total consideration  
of £227.4m, funded from cash and debt facilities. This brings 
biotechnology-derived ingredients into our portfolio including  
ceramides and phospholipids. 

With a track record of more than 30 years unbroken dividend 
progression, consistent distribution to shareholders is a key 
consideration for the Board. We have proposed a small increase  
in the full year dividend at 109p a share (2022: 108p). 

A balanced approach to capital allocation
Our continued capital deployment was executed within our consistent capital allocation policy which is to:

Reinvest for growth – invest in organic capital 
expenditure to drive shareholder value creation 
through new capacity, product innovation and 
expansion in attractive geographic markets to  
drive sales and profit growth;

Acquire disruptive technologies – to supplement 
organic growth, we are targeting a number of 
exciting technology acquisitions in existing and 
adjacent markets, with a focus on strengthening 
Consumer Care and expanding in Life Sciences with 
a particular emphasis on Pharma technologies; and

Provide regular returns to shareholders – pay a 
regular dividend to shareholders, representing 40 to 
50% of adjusted earnings over the business cycle;

Maintain an appropriate balance sheet – to meet 
future investment and trading requirements, targeting 
a leverage ratio of 1 to 2x over the medium-term cycle. 
We consider returning excess capital to shareholders 
when leverage falls below our target range and 
sufficient capital is available to meet our investment 
opportunities. The Board is keeping the Company’s 
future capital requirements under close review.

Focused on operational delivery

Driving operational delivery in 2023

Our focus in 2023 has been on ‘controlling what we 

can control’ to protect profitability, alongside longer-

term improvement programmes to drive efficiency 

savings by simplifying business processes and ways 

of working. This focus will ensure Croda is positioned 

to recover when the macro-environment improves. 

Cost measures  

to protect profitability

Several cost measures have been 

implemented since June 2023 to protect 

profitability. Actions include tighter budgetary 

control of fixed costs, optimising production 

through plant shutdowns and reduced shift 

patterns, at the same time as increasing sales 

activity to meet ongoing customer demand  

for innovation. 

Leveraging data analytics

Croda is exploring the use of data science and 

Artificial Intelligence (AI). By investing in data 

science capabilities, including visualisation tools, 

we have been able to protect existing revenue 

through targeted customer retention, improve the 

speed and accuracy of assessing the carbon 

footprints of our ingredients, and cut the time our 

scientists need to identify effective formulations for 

a range of products – from months to days.

Over the past 15 years the Group has transformed from a specialty chemicals 
business focused predominantly on industrial markets to one serving consumer, 
agricultural, and pharmaceutical markets. As the scale of the Group and 
operating margins have expanded over time, profits have risen, with consistently 
strong conversion of profit into cash.

1.  Cash conversion defined as operating cash flow (pre-interest and tax) divided 

by EBITDA.

Strong compounding financial performance over many years, supported by a 
conservative capital allocation policy and powerful business model, has enabled 
us to pay a growing dividend for more than 30 years. Since 2008 the ordinary 
dividend has grown by an average of 12% a year. In 2023 the dividend was 
increased by 0.9% with robust cash flow and a conservative leverage position 
(net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.3x) supporting continued growing returns  
to shareholders.

At the same time as delivering on our absolute Science Based Target aligned 
with the 1.5˚C pathway, we are decoupling value growth from our impact  
on climate.

Our emissions intensity measured relative to ‘value added’ shows significant 
continuous improvements since 2018. This aligns with our approach to growth, 
focusing on low-volume, high-value ingredients that add significant value in our 
customers’ solutions.

We have improved effective use of water in manufacturing our ingredients, 
reducing our total water volumes used by 35% since 2018. We have been 
prioritising efforts to reduce our water footprint over many years and in 2020 
launched a holistic water impact metric. Focused on water use in our direct 
control, this builds on previous metrics to include location specific water issues 
(e.g. flood risk, water scarcity and quality) alongside volume. Our target is to 
reduce our water impact in the most stressed locations by 50% by 2030. 

  See page 15 of our Sustainability Impact Report.

Absolute land area saved

Land saved over 2019 baseline

Definition
Our operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (associated with burning fuels 
onsite and purchased electricity) in absolute terms.

Definition
Land area saved through the application of our crop protection and seed 
enhancement technologies, using 2019 as our baseline year.

Target
By 2030, we will have achieved our Science Based Target, reducing scope  
1 and 2 emissions by 46.2% from our 2018 baseline.

Performance
Since 2018, our baseline year, our total scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have 
reduced by 33%. While our 2023 scope 1 and scope 2 emissions are tracking 
well below our Science Based Target, the challenging business environment  
and associated reduction in sales volumes in 2023 contributed to the lower 
emissions output. Although volumes are expected to recover, we remain 
confident in achieving our Science Based Target. 

R

Target
Throughout this decade, the land saved through the application of our 
technologies will exceed any increase in land used to grow our raw materials  
by at least a factor of two, and by 2030 we will save a minimum of 200,000 
hectares per year more than in 2019.

Performance
In 2023, the use of our agricultural ingredients and new technologies saved 
58,815 hectares of land versus our 2019 baseline of 92,223 hectares, 
translating to a total land saving of 151,038 hectares in 2023. We remain on 
track to hit our 2024 intermediate milestone of saving at least 80,000 hectares 
per year more than in 2019, and our 2030 target of saving 200,000 hectares per 
year more than in 2019.

Progress on our Commitments in 2023

Climate Positive
As we continue to deliver on our Science Based Target (SBT) for  
GHG emissions reduction, we recognise the value to our customers  
of sharing product-level carbon footprint (PCF) data, to help their 
decision-making as they formulate. In 2023 we launched PCF data to 
our Consumer Care customers, covering scope 1, 2 and upstream 
scope 3 emissions with a methodology aligned to industry standards. 
The majority of our carbon footprint is emissions associated with the 
production of our raw materials. We are therefore fully engaged with 
suppliers, both directly and as members of the chemical industry 
consortium, Together for Sustainability (TfS), to gain greater clarity on 
emissions and started to receive primary scope 3 data from leading 
players in 2023. We also completed our first downstream scope 3 
inventory analysis, which demonstrated the importance of 
understanding indirect consumer emissions throughout the  
full lifecycle of a product. 

Land Positive
In addition to our land saved target we aim to bring an average of  
two crop technological breakthroughs to market each year until 2030. 
In 2023, we launched four products which protect biodiversity and 
mitigate the impact of changing climate and land degradation,  
bringing our total launched since 2020 to nine. Our use of raw 
materials derived from bio-based and other natural sources brings 
with it a responsibility to understand and address our dependencies 
on ecosystems and impacts on nature and biodiversity. In 2023 we 
were selected to join World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development’s (WBCSD) Science Based Target for Nature Preparer 
Group, in line with our ambition to contribute to a Nature Positive 
world by 2030. In response to the first release of SBTs for Nature, 
which aim to refine understanding of our impacts on freshwater,  
as well as protecting and restoring terrestrial ecosystems, this small 
group of WBCSD members is working to help organisations develop 
their goals for nature.

Definition
The number of incidents per 200,000 hours worked where a person  
has sustained an injury, including all lost time, restricted work and medical 
treatment cases (excludes Covid-19 cases).

Target
Achieve TRIR of 0.3 by the end of 2024.

Definition
The PSC score is a gauge of employee satisfaction measured through employee 
surveys and expressed as a percentage.

Target
Our target is to improve the PSC score by 8 percentage points against the 2022 
baseline by 2026.

Performance
The headline TRIR decreased to 0.72 in 2023 (2022: 0.74). While a step in the 
right direction, this remains unacceptably high compared with our target and 
from the beginning of 2023 proactive safety leadership was embedded in our 
leadership development programme and became part of the Group annual 
bonus scheme for the first time. More than 4,500 hours of safety training was 
provided to over 500 of our most senior leaders across all functions and 
geographies to embed safety as a value.

Performance
Participation in 2023 was just under 80% of total headcount across the year 
(consistent with 2022). The PSC score for 2023 was 68%, matching the score 
achieved in 2022 despite a tough trading environment and period of change for 
our employees. We have made progress in areas such as reward, recognition 
and safety, with questions in these areas seeing improvements across our sites. 
The survey results have helped identify areas of focus such as having manageable 
workloads and employees feeling they are able to develop at Croda.

People Positive
Our People Positive Commitment impacts both our employees  
and wider society. In 2022, through the use of our solar protection 
ingredients, Croda delivered on its 2030 target to protect more than 
60 million people from potentially developing skin cancer caused by 
harmful UV rays. In 2023 we progressed towards our target of 
contributing to the successful development and commercialisation  
of 25% of WHO-listed pipeline vaccines and have already achieved 
our 2024 milestone of 10 clinical phase III trials, two years ahead of 
schedule. We are continuing to work towards gender balance in our 
management. In 2023, we increased the number of women in senior 
positions to 39%∆ (2022: 38%). The Croda Foundation was established 
in 2021 to help sustainably improve one million lives. In 2023, 
super-charged by additional funding accepted from Croda, it has 
sustainably improved the lives of over 22 million people, providing  
34 grants across 21 countries.

Fundamentals
The Fundamentals element of our Commitment represents the social 
licence required for a multinational company such as Croda to operate 
in 2030. We consider all stakeholders in our ecosystem and strive to 
adopt best practices in environmental protection, labour and human 
rights, ethics and sustainable procurement. As we evolve our 
approach to delivering on our Commitment to become Climate, Land 
and People Positive by 2030, many of these Fundamental targets 
align closely with our strategies to reduce our negative impacts and 
increase our positive impacts on climate, nature and society.

Definition
New and Protected Products (NPP) are sales protected by virtue of being newly 
launched, protected by intellectual property or by unique quality characteristics. 
Measuring the proportion of NPP sales relative to total sales at constant currency is 
our established KPI for innovation. Over time we are transitioning to measuring 
absolute growth in NPP sales. This transition simplifies our NPP metric but more 
importantly recognises the importance of our non-NPP sales, particularly sales 
of those products that do not meet our rigid NPP criteria but have superior 
sustainability profiles and are delivering strong growth on that basis. 

Target
We seek to drive NPP sales growth at least as fast as total sales over the cycle, 
targeted at mid to high single-digit percentage growth.

Performance
The proportion of sales of NPP has grown over the long term from 20.5% in 
2012 to reach 33.5% in 2023. The small reduction in NPP sales as a proportion 
of total sales in 2023 reflects a reduction in the sales of Covid-19 lipids. In the 
year, Group NPP sales fell by 4%, excluding the impact of Covid-19 lipid sales 
and the PTIC divestment, a less significant fall than for Group sales as a whole.

Delivering innovation in 2023
Our innovation capability comprises not just our own self-funded  
R&D programmes but also a growing network of innovation partners, 
including SMEs and academia. These innovation partners often have 
expertise in specialist fields such as biotechnology or pharma, and 
expand our innovation capacity to help accelerate key projects.  
We continued to grow our open innovation network in 2023 and by  
the end of the year had collaborated with more than 580 innovation 
partners on around 300 innovation projects since adopting this open 
innovation model. 

Innovation efforts are focused on bringing differentiated solutions to 
customers and doing so in a way that has a positive downstream 
impact and can help customers achieve their sustainability ambitions, 
while ensuring we deliver progress against our own 2030 sustainability 
targets. We are focused on key platform technologies such as 
synthetic biology, biocatalysis and downstream processing and are 
also investing to scale biotechnology and expand sustainable chemistry. 

Developing sustainable alternatives to existing ingredients remains a 
key focus of our innovation efforts and in 2023 new projects included  
a partnership aimed at developing bio-based and biodegradable 
polymers for liquid polymer solutions, which are often used in personal 
care and crop care applications for rheology modification. Another 
project is focused on using biotechnology to generate sustainable 
terpenes, key ingredients in flavours and fragrances which are typically 
produced by chemical synthesis of petrochemical-derived raw materials.

Definition
Total sales growth measured at constant currency. 

Definition
Adjusted operating profit as a percentage of sales.

Target
Mid-single digit percentage growth in Consumer Care and high-single digit 
percentage growth in Life Sciences. 

Performance
Sales in 2023 were down 18.5% at constant currency, with underlying sales 
down 19.1% and a small contribution of 0.6% from the acquisition of Solus 
Biotech, which completed in July 2023. Adjusting for the divestment of PTIC 
which completed in June 2022, pro forma sales were down 11%. This 
comprises positive price/mix growth of 5%, with volumes 16% lower,  
reflecting the challenging trading conditions in 2023.

Target
Return on sales over the medium term at or above 25% in Consumer Care and 
at or above 30% in Life Sciences, dependent on the mix of growth in each of the 
business units that comprise the two sectors. 

Performance
Group return on sales reduced to 18.9% in 2023 (2022: 24.7%). This reflects 
significant volume declines across multiple markets leading to low utilisation 
levels across our shared manufacturing sites and reduced overhead coverage, 
as well as a reduction in sales of high margin lipid systems for Covid-19 from 
around $120m in 2022 to approximately $60m.

revised in 2023 to adjust for the net pension asset/liability and the historical 
ROIC numbers shown have been restated.

Target
ROIC of at least two times cost of capital. 

Performance
The post-tax ROIC reduced to 8.3% (2022: 14.4%) with lower operating profit, 
as well as growth in average invested capital reflecting continued investment in 
the year to support future growth in both Consumer Care and Life Sciences.

Target
At least mid-single digit percentage EPS growth per annum. 

Performance
EPS fell to 167.6p (2022: 272.0p) as a result of the lower sales and operating 
profit margin. Net finance costs were lower in 2023, principally due to the 
proceeds from the PTIC divestment in June 2022, but the effective tax rate  
on adjusted profit was slightly higher at 23.9% (2022: 22.8%).

Market opportunities

Positively impacting everyday life
Croda is a global leader in speciality ingredients 
providing high-performance technologies behind the 
world’s biggest brands. Long-term trends such as  
an ageing population are driving consumption, with 
increased penetration of consumer care products 
across all cultures of the world. Beauty, in particular,  
is becoming synonymous with wellbeing, confidence 
and self-esteem at every stage in life. 

With growing economies and an expanding middle 
class, Asia and the Middle East represent significant 
growth opportunities. We are implementing our 
objective to achieve fast growth in Asia and are well 
placed to serve regional and indie customers whose 
importance is growing in the region. 

Science and sustainability are driving consumers and 
our customers. Consumers are always on the look-out 
for improved performance and new trends, with Croda 
delivering new ideas with proven substantiated claims. 
Consumers also prefer products that are good for  
them and the planet, as well as highly effective.  
We are complementing our leading range of sustainable 
ingredients with assured information about their impacts 
and an R&D programme focused on delivering 
sustainability benefits in use to our customers.

Customers also want intimate relationships with key 
suppliers to reduce time to market so our ability to 
facilitate fast innovation is creating new opportunities. 
We supply key ingredients, with on-trend formulations, 
complemented by regulatory expertise to ensure that 
all-important element – speed.

Across consumer markets, we are focused on 
faster-growing niches which value our innovation, 
including anti-ageing, hair conditioners and mineral

Strategy 
Croda creates critical Consumer Care ingredients that are both sustainable and 
underpinned by performance. Our business model helps us to win; operating in  
over 120 countries, Croda supports customers large and small globally. 

The Consumer Care strategy anticipates and responds to the megatrends influencing 
consumer behaviour and shaping our customers’ needs. In an era defined by rapid 
global economic shifts and evolving consumer desires, our strategy positions us at  
the forefront of the market, ready to meet the demands of an increasingly discerning 
consumer base. Consumers will pay a premium for high-quality, innovative 
formulations and substantiated product claims. They also want to live their lives more 
sustainably and this is impacting their decisions when it comes to the products to buy.

Our ambition is to be the world’s most sustainable, innovative and responsive solution 
provider. Already recognised as a market-leading innovator, our strategy is to continue 
to strengthen Consumer Care in fast growth niches, by accelerating innovation, 
expanding our sustainable product portfolio and enhancing our customer intimacy. 
Leadership requires us to deliver sustainable ingredients with the best performance 
and data to support customer claims. We will also lead in formulation science and 
application technologies.

Our innovation is improving the sustainability of our ingredients and finding high 
performance replacements for fossil-based products. We showcase our ingredients, 
educate customers on their use and develop finished formulations for customers, 
incorporating both our performance-based ingredients and emotion-driven fragrances 
and botanicals to deliver complete solutions. This is particularly attractive to smaller 
companies, who can partner with Croda to launch products to the market at pace. 

With the personal care market in Asia developing rapidly, we have a ‘fast grow’ 
programme to expand our technical and sales presence. This is being supported  
by selective expansion in manufacturing and a focus on acquisition opportunities, 
targeting adjacent active technologies and natural ingredients. We have completed  
the acquisition of Solus BioTech, a global leader in premium, biotechnology-derived 
materials located in South Korea. With over 30 years of expertise in the development 
of naturally derived ceramides, the acquisition broadens Croda’s offering of high 
performance, natural ingredients for luxury beauty customers in Asia and globally.

Consumer Care

Performance summary – leadership in innovation and 
sustainability driving demand
Consumer Care sales fell 1% to £886.1m (2022: £897.8m) with strong 
double-digit percentage sales growth in F&F but lower underlying sales 
in Beauty Actives, Beauty Care and Home Care. Price/mix was 2% 
mainly due to a positive mix impact from Beauty Actives, with pricing 
broadly flat. Sales volumes were down 4% year-on-year but were up 
9% in the second half compared with the second half of 2022. 
Acquisitions added 1% due to sales of ceramides following the Solus 
Biotech acquisition, with foreign currency translation a small headwind 
particularly in the second half year.

IFRS operating profit was £127.8m (2022: £144.5m) and adjusted 
operating profit was £160.3m (2022: £204.7m), resulting in adjusted 
operating margin reducing to 18.1% (2022: 22.8%). Four and a half 
percentage points of the margin decline was due to the operating 
gearing effect of continued weak volumes in Consumer Care, 
compounded by lower volumes in Life Sciences and Industrial 
Specialties which share the same manufacturing assets. Two 
percentage points of the margin decline was due to weaker mix as a 
result of strong growth of lower margin F&F sales, with the negligible 
variable remuneration charge and provision release associated with  
an earn-out on the Iberchem acquisition providing a partial offset. 

In Consumer Care, our leadership in sustainability and innovation 
continues to drive demand for Croda’s differentiated ingredient 
portfolio. Sales of New and Protected Products (NPP) improved to 
42% of total sales (2022: 41%) and sales of sustainable ingredients 
such as ECO surfactants and biotech-derived ingredients were 
stronger than other ingredients in our portfolio. We can now provide 
product-level carbon footprint data to our customers so that they  
can quantify the benefits associated with using around 1,300 of our 
ingredients in their products, supporting a structural shift in behaviour 
by customers and consumers towards sustainable ingredients. The 
focus of our work has been on Beauty Care where Product Carbon 
Footprints are now available for three quarters of our portfolio. 

Sales to Asia exceeded sales to North America for the first time  
with significant potential for further growth, particularly for premium 
products driven by the increasing number of middle-class consumers. 
To maximise fast growth in Asia, we have prioritised investment in 
R&D, sales and production in China and India in particular where 
underlying sales grew 12% in 2023. While our performance in China 
has remained robust, owing to strong relationships with regional 
brands built on our innovation expertise, a broad-based recovery in 
Chinese consumer spending and travel would underpin improved 
global demand for consumer care products.

The stand-out performer in 2023 was Fragrances and Flavours (F&F) 
which delivered 18% underlying sales growth, benefitting from  
its distinctive positioning in fast-growing markets and agile, cost 
competitive model. F&F sales were up in all product categories  
and established regions, with the Middle East particularly strong.  
This excellent sales growth principally reflects F&F’s high exposure  
to local and regional customers outside North America and Europe  
as well as sales synergies that are being realised under Croda’s 
ownership. These include a new multi-million pound a year sales 
opportunity to supply fragrances to a multinational company in regions 
where F&F has local production. Projects are also underway to further 
increase the proportion of bio-based fragrance ingredients, to continue 
the move towards lower carbon and a more natural footprint. 
Approved R&D and manufacturing investment programmes are 
underway in China, Indonesia, France and Spain to continue the 
growth momentum.

Croda International Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2023

In Beauty Actives, reported sales were up 4% but down 1% on an 
underlying basis (i.e. excluding the Solus Biotech acquisition). Positive 
mix helped offset weaker volumes as Sederma active ingredients grew, 
particularly in China, whereas sales of lower-value botanicals fell. The 
business supported new customer products with peptides for the new 
Boots No7 Future Renew range and for a new Deciem product that 
repairs scars caused by acne. Our ingredients are increasingly derived 
from biotechnology, both plant stem cells and fermentation, and we 
recently launched LuceaneTM, an anti-ageing active with its origins in 
marine biotechnology, and an active ingredient that fades age spots 
caused by the sun. Having completed the Solus Biotech acquisition  
in July 2023, we are excited about the opportunities that the addition  
of further fermentation-derived active ingredients to our portfolio are 
starting to open up, with strong customer demand already evident  
for ceramides. We will drive rapid sales growth of Solus ingredients  
by leveraging Croda’s global selling network and formulation  
science expertise.

Performance remained weakest in Beauty Care, which has broad 
market exposure and is larger than the other business units, with sales 
down 11% driven by lower volumes. Our approach in Beauty Care is to 
manage sales volumes in the less differentiated parts of the portfolio to 
underpin consistent plant utilisation and cover fixed costs. We are also 
working to win back business in North America which we lost in 2022 
through our inability to supply. In parallel, we are accelerating the 
differentiation of the Beauty Care portfolio by driving innovation, 
enhancing the sustainability profile of our ingredients, and transitioning 
our manufacturing processes to biotech and other low carbon 
technologies. Already a sustainability leader, the business is adding 
further high-performance replacements for fossil-based products,  
such as biotech-derived surfactants to reinforce a number one position 
in sustainable surfactants. In hair care, our focus is on biodegradable 
hair care ingredients and non-animal alternatives for hair conditioning. 
In sun protection, we specialise in mineral sunscreens that deliver 
superior SPF protection, are ‘reef safe’ and appear clear on the skin. 
The continued fragmentation of beauty care markets plays to our 
strengths as we partner with customers large and small enabling  
them to launch their products quickly. We are leveraging this position 
as go-to-market partner at our innovation centres globally where we 
offer to co-create customer products. 

The recovery of sales volumes in Home Care accelerated as the year 
progressed, with underlying sales down 1% year-on-year but up 12% 
in the second half compared with the second half of 2022. Once again 
it was sales of two technology platforms that are differentiated by 
sustainability that led the way – bio-based ECO surfactants for 
household care and biopolymers which extend the life of fabrics.  
We also agreed a long-term contract with a key customer that 
underpins future sales of our biopolymer range. 

Alongside investments that help deliver the carbon reduction roadmaps 
that we have put in place for all sites, Consumer Care investment is 
focused on Asia to support continued growth momentum. In China,  
we opened a new laboratory in Shanghai and started work on a £30m 
combined Beauty Actives and F&F manufacturing facility in Guangzhou 
to grow domestic sales. In India, we commenced construction of a 
new surfactants plant at a greenfield site in Dahej. The acquisition of 
Solus Biotech in South Korea has also given us another state-of-the-art 
plant in the region and strengthened our presence across Asia.

to local and regional customers outside North America and Europe  

as well as sales synergies that are being realised under Croda’s 

ownership. These include a new multi-million pound a year sales 

opportunity to supply fragrances to a multinational company in regions 

where F&F has local production. Projects are also underway to further 

increase the proportion of bio-based fragrance ingredients, to continue 

the move towards lower carbon and a more natural footprint. 

Approved R&D and manufacturing investment programmes are 

underway in China, Indonesia, France and Spain to continue the 

growth momentum. 

In Beauty Actives, reported sales were up 4% but down 1% on an 

underlying basis (i.e. excluding the Solus Biotech acquisition). Positive 

mix helped offset weaker volumes as Sederma active ingredients grew, 

particularly in China, whereas sales of lower-value botanicals fell. The 

business supported new customer products with peptides for the new 

Boots No7 Future Renew range and for a new Deciem product that 

repairs scars caused by acne. Our ingredients are increasingly derived 

from biotechnology, both plant stem cells and fermentation, and we 

recently launched LuceaneTM, an anti-ageing active with its origins in 

marine biotechnology, and an active ingredient that fades age spots 

caused by the sun. Having completed the Solus Biotech acquisition  

in July 2023, we are excited about the opportunities that the addition  

of further fermentation-derived active ingredients to our portfolio are 

starting to open up, with strong customer demand already evident  

for ceramides. We will drive rapid sales growth of Solus ingredients  

by leveraging Croda’s global selling network and formulation  

science expertise.

Performance remained weakest in Beauty Care, which has broad 

market exposure and is larger than the other business units, with sales 

down 11% driven by lower volumes. Our approach in Beauty Care is to 

manage sales volumes in the less differentiated parts of the portfolio to 

underpin consistent plant utilisation and cover fixed costs. We are also 

working to win back business in North America which we lost in 2022 

through our inability to supply. In parallel, we are accelerating the 

differentiation of the Beauty Care portfolio by driving innovation, 

enhancing the sustainability profile of our ingredients, and transitioning 

our manufacturing processes to biotech and other low carbon 

technologies. Already a sustainability leader, the business is adding 

further high-performance replacements for fossil-based products,  

such as biotech-derived surfactants to reinforce a number one position 

in sustainable surfactants. In hair care, our focus is on biodegradable 

hair care ingredients and non-animal alternatives for hair conditioning. 

In sun protection, we specialise in mineral sunscreens that deliver 

superior SPF protection, are ‘reef safe’ and appear clear on the skin. 

The continued fragmentation of beauty care markets plays to our 

strengths as we partner with customers large and small enabling  

them to launch their products quickly. We are leveraging this position 

as go-to-market partner at our innovation centres globally where we 

offer to co-create customer products. 

The recovery of sales volumes in Home Care accelerated as the year 

progressed, with underlying sales down 1% year-on-year but up 12% 

in the second half compared with the second half of 2022. Once again 

it was sales of two technology platforms that are differentiated by 

sustainability that led the way – bio-based ECO surfactants for 

household care and biopolymers which extend the life of fabrics.  

We also agreed a long-term contract with a key customer that 

underpins future sales of our biopolymer range. 

Alongside investments that help deliver the carbon reduction roadmaps 

that we have put in place for all sites, Consumer Care investment is 

focused on Asia to support continued growth momentum. In China,  

we opened a new laboratory in Shanghai and started work on a £30m 

combined Beauty Actives and F&F manufacturing facility in Guangzhou 

to grow domestic sales. In India, we commenced construction of a 

new surfactants plant at a greenfield site in Dahej. The acquisition of 

Solus Biotech in South Korea has also given us another state-of-the-art 

plant in the region and strengthened our presence across Asia.

Growing our portfolio of premium beauty actives 
with the addition of naturally-derived ceramides
With the acquisition of Solus Biotech, which completed in July 
2023, we added naturally-derived ceramides to our broad 
offering of premium beauty actives ingredients. Ceramides 
help form a protective layer, reinforcing the skin’s natural barrier 
and improving hydration while reducing free radicals and 
protecting against damage from pollution. Although ceramides 
are naturally found in the skin, their concentration depletes 
with age, and they are increasingly recognised as a ‘miracle’ 
ingredient with the number of new personal care products 
containing ceramides doubling over the last five years. The 
acquisition not only broadens our beauty actives offering to 
include ceramides, but also expands our biotechnology 
capabilities and brings a new site in South Korea which  
will act as a springboard into premium markets in Asia. 

Enabling customers to make purchasing decisions 
aligned to their environmental goals
In October 2023, we launched product carbon footprint 
(PCF) statements for around 1,300 of our Beauty Care 
ingredients, representing about three quarters of the revenue 
for our Beauty Care portfolio. The statement is a cradle-to-
gate life cycle assessment that provides our customers with 
the total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with 
the ingredient, from sourcing the raw materials through to 
when the final product leaves our factory gates.

PCFs allow customers to make more informed purchasing 
decisions as they work towards their own decarbonisation 
plans. This means customers can assess the benefits of 
using Croda ingredients in terms of the GHG impact on  
their finished product.  

For Croda, PCFs enable us to see our GHG emissions at 
a product level so we can understand where our product 
portfolio is successfully helping us meet our decarbonisation 
targets and opportunities to further reduce our impact. They 
will also help us prioritise the carbon claims of new ingredients 
as a source of competitive advantage.  

The Croda proprietary tool automates the calculation of 
cradle-to-gate product carbon footprints and was created  
by a team comprising data scientists, mathematicians,  
and accountants as well as sustainability specialists.

Leveraging biotechnology to deliver advanced 
ingredients with improved sustainability profiles
Utilising biotechnology, including plant cell cultures and the 
fermentation of microorganisms, to create innovative 
ingredients is not new to Croda and is something we have 
been doing in our Beauty Actives business for more than 30 
years. By enabling us to exploit the cellular and biomolecular 
processes of living organisms outside of animals, biotechnology 
makes it possible to produce alternatives to ingredients which 
are currently manufactured with synthetic chemistry using 
solvents, catalysts and in some cases hazardous materials.  
The use of biotechnology therefore offers the potential to 
develop innovative active ingredients, using natural ingredients 
with sustainable supply chains, while improving certain 
processes to deliver time savings and higher yields.

In 2023, we launched LuceaneTM, a patented active ingredient 
that counteracts hypoxia ageing by stimulating and protecting 
cell respiration and energy production, while also inducing 
micropollutant removal within cells. Studies have shown 
LuceaneTM slows down the ageing process by five years  
after just one month of application, reducing signs of  
fatigue and improving skin radiance. Manufactured using  
the fermentation of marine microorganisms, LuceaneTM is  
100% natural, fully biodegradable, RSPO certified and uses 
sustainable manufacturing with complete waste recovery, 
demonstrating how our smart science can deliver advanced 
ingredients sustainably.

Expanding Life Sciences

Market opportunities – Pharma 

Life Sciences vision

Pioneering the future of healthcare
In pharmaceutical markets, Croda focuses on providing 
systems that deliver Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 
(APIs) to the target site in the body, maintain stability 
and improve efficacy. 

We are pioneering the future of healthcare by focusing 
on segments with a high development need. Our key 
differentiator is innovation, creating new ingredients 
from sustainable sources with a unique quality.

For protein delivery we provide a range of speciality 
excipients for challenging formulations including 
injectables. In adjuvant systems, we are the only 
independent supplier with a full component portfolio 
and the ability to put those vaccine adjuvants together 
to power the therapeutic vaccines of the future. We are 
the leading innovator of components for nucleic acid 
delivery, capable of both developing new systems and 
scaling them up to support commercial roll out.

In total we have over 5,000 customers across the  
whole pharmaceutical lifecycle. Our approach is to 
develop delivery systems for candidate drugs in 
early-stage research, generating revenue from providing 
materials during clinical development and then as the 
principal supplier of the delivery system if the drug is 
commercialised. Our broad base means we are exposed 
to a wide range of customers, drugs and applications. 

Market opportunities – Agriculture

Innovating for global food security 
The agriculture industry is at a pivotal moment, facing 
the dual imperatives of delivering higher yields to feed  
a growing population and reducing chemical use as 
required by tighter regulation. Through our deep 
understanding of plant science, we can contribute  
to increasing food production without the need to  
use more land, thereby helping to improve global  
food security. 

We are helping address the challenges with 
conventional pesticides by developing low carbon, 
biodegradable delivery systems to enable sustainable 
formulations and promote soil health. Our drift reduction 
technologies target crop spraying and are a key enabler 
of new farming practices such as drone application.  
We are also first to market with microplastic-free seed 
coatings many years before regulatory change and are 
enhancing seeds so that they germinate in the more 
challenging conditions created by climate change.

Whilst the market for biopesticides is much smaller than 
the market for conventional pesticides, it is growing 
much faster, presenting the opportunity for agriculture 
to have a much lower impact on biodiversity. We are 
creating solutions for a more sustainable future by 
developing delivery systems for biopesticides in which 
the active ingredients are microorganisms rather than 
chemicals and even nucleic acids that target a specific 
pest or inactivate a disease.

Strategy
In Life Sciences, Croda focuses on providing delivery systems for active 
pharmaceutical and crop ingredients. Our technologies deliver the active, improve its 
efficacy and solve challenges of stability and sustainability in customer formulations. 

Our global footprint gives us presence in the major crop regions and access to leading 
pharma R&D. Our strength in North America and Western Europe is now leveraged 
through expansion in Asia and Latin America. Working as an innovation partner to the 
major crop science companies, we have also expanded with medium and smaller-
sized customers, especially local customers in Latin America, India and China.  
Our acquisition of research-focused Avanti in 2020 expanded our pharma customer 
base to span drug discovery and clinical trial stages, alongside our established 
commercialisation business. These relationships extend beyond global brands to 
academia, start-ups and biotech, where significant breakthrough discovery happens.

Our strategy is to expand Life Sciences to empower biologics delivery, enabling the 
move from small chemically synthesised molecules to large and complex biologics, a 
megatrend which is transforming the pharmaceutical market and which will transform 
agriculture. In Pharma, we focus on segments with the strongest growth and highest 
innovation needs, leveraging our delivery systems and technology platforms to create 
new solutions for customers. In our Agriculture business, we are reinforcing our 
leadership with sustainable solutions and leveraging our expertise to accelerate the 
transition to biopesticides, which will enable greater targeting of actives and reduced 
biodiversity impact.

To deliver this strategy, we are investing in innovation, knowledge and capacity. Our 
R&D investment is creating an extensive innovation pipeline. We are increasing our 
knowledge base in innovation, sales and manufacturing, co-investing with national 
governments who recognise the importance of biologics in the 21st century. We are 
supplementing organic growth with acquisition of new technology platforms, building 
on the successful growth of our vaccine adjuvant platform, acquired in 2018 and 
already doubled in sales, and our lipid systems platform, acquired in 2020, the first to 
deliver a commercial Covid-19 mRNA delivery system and widely utilised within the 
fast-evolving gene editing market.

Life Sciences

Performance summary – continued progress building 
industry-leading positions in high-growth markets
Life Sciences sales were down 12% to £602.3m (2022: £682.3m), with 
approximately seven percentage points of the reduction due to lower 
sales of lipid systems for Covid-19 vaccine applications. On a reported 
basis, positive price/mix of 3% partly offset a 15% decline in volume, 
the majority of which was due to destocking by Crop Protection 
customers with a small effect from similar trends in consumer health. 
There was also a contribution from phospholipid sales following 
completion of the Solus Biotech acquisition in July 2023 and a small 
foreign currency headwind. Sales of New and Protected Products 
(NPP) as a percentage of total sector sales fell to 29% (2022: 42%)  
or by one percentage point to 31% (2022: 32%) excluding the impact 
from Covid-19 lipid sales.

IFRS operating profit was £131.7m (2022: £220.3m) and adjusted 
operating profit was £150.3m (2022: £229.4m), resulting in an adjusted 
operating margin of 25.0% (2022: 33.6%). Six percentage points of  
the margin reduction was the result of adverse price/mix mainly due  
to lower Covid lipid sales, and four percentage points was the result  
of the negative operating leverage effect of lower volumes mainly in 
Crop Protection, partly offset by the benefit from a negligible variable 
remuneration charge. Shipments of c.$60m of lipid systems to our 
principal Covid vaccine customers occurred as planned at the end  
of the year benefitting second half operating profit margin.

Crop Protection is meeting the ‘innovation gap’ created by regulatory 
pressure to reduce pesticide use by developing sustainable crop care 
solutions as well as delivery systems for crop biologics that are 
enabling customers to transition to biopesticides. We recently launched 
our first delivery system specially designed for biopesticides, which has 
secured sales in all regions, and a new product that meets the growing 
demand for drone application particularly in Asia. Following an 
exceptional 2022, when Crop Protection delivered both strong 
double-digit percentage volume growth and price/mix, the business 
started the year with good momentum, but began to experience rapid 
customer destocking in the second quarter, with Q2 volumes down 
more than 30% compared with Q1. Volume weakness continued 
throughout the second half year, to fall 21% year-on-year with a small 
offset from positive price/mix, resulting in sales falling 19% overall. An 
end to destocking in Crop Protection markets would be an important 
driver of improved Life Sciences performance in the near term but the 
timing of this inflection point is uncertain as destocking started later 
than in other markets, and customer concentration is higher, so 
demand can be determined by the buying decisions of four or five 
major customers. In addition, agriculture markets are seasonal,  
so a lack of demand can mean that a whole season is missed,  
but conversely when a recovery comes it is likely to have a more 
immediate effect. 

In Seed Enhancement, a significant proportion of sales are derived 
from providing just-in-time enhancement services for vegetable seeds. 
As such, the business only sees a limited impact from stocking cycles 
and delivered a 9% sales increase, driven by strong structural growth 
trends. Seed Enhancement is winning market share through its 
leadership in microplastic-free seed coatings which are in high demand 
globally following the European Union’s recent adoption of measures 
that will ban the use of microplastics in agriculture in the next five years. 
Historically, the market for field crop seeds experiences changes in 
demand later in the cycle, so the market environment could be tougher 
in 2024, but for Croda, this risk is mitigated by our focus on vegetable 
seeds, our sustainability leadership and the incremental opportunities 
that are being created by regulation change.

Croda International Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2023

Pharma continued to make good progress with its industry-leading 
position in biologics drug delivery as well as recent partnerships and 
new product launches further strengthening the pipeline of opportunities. 
Pharma sales fell 11% but grew 3% on an underlying basis excluding 
lipid sales for Covid-19 vaccine applications. The period also saw the 
first sales of phospholipids for drug delivery and intravenous nutrition 
following the completion of the Solus Biotech acquisition in July 2023. 
Whilst we were not immune from the challenges impacting the market, 
including customers reducing inventory levels, Covid normalisation and 
funding constraints for early-stage biotech companies, the breadth and 
diversification of our pharma portfolio enabled the business to deliver a 
resilient performance. Destocking primarily affected our heritage, 
consumer health ingredients for over-the-counter medicines, with lower 
Covid-19 demand adversely impacting Adjuvant Systems sales as well 
as lipids for Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. These challenges appear to be 
temporary rather than structural, but their effects could continue into 
2024. By contrast, drug delivery technologies for Small Molecule, 
Protein and Nucleic Acid applications continued to grow. 

Over the longer term, accelerating growth and margins will be driven  
by the commercialisation of new biologic drugs, many of which we are 
supporting during clinical trials, augmented by incremental revenue 
from our own innovation pipeline. 

Protein/Small Molecule Delivery provides delivery systems for both 
the more mature small molecule drugs and the higher growth protein 
and monoclonal antibody (mAb) applications. Through the Solus 
Biotech acquisition, we have added naturally derived phospholipids  
to our portfolio which can be used as delivery systems for protein  
and small molecule actives, and for intravenous nutrition. In line with 
our strategy, we also expanded into bioprocessing aids, a target 
adjacency, launching Virodex as an aid for biopharma manufacturing 
and a superior alternative to a competitor product that is now banned 
in Europe. The first sales of Virodex were secured within three months 
of launch. 

Adjuvant Systems is the leading independent supplier of adjuvants 
which are used as immune response boosters in both commercialised 
vaccines and those in development. It will benefit from two new adjuvant 
partnerships agreed during the year with Amyris and BSI. One of these 
is a sustainable squalene adjuvant that is produced by fermentation 
and is free from shark-derived material that forms the basis of 
competing adjuvants, and is already being qualified by three major 
vaccine companies. We have also expanded our adjuvants portfolio 
through new launches from our own innovation pipeline including 
PHAD, a new proprietary lipid-based adjuvant already sampled into 
over 20 vaccine projects.

The growth of Nucleic Acid Delivery will be driven by the 
commercialisation of new nucleic acid drugs with the number in 
development continuing to grow, and Croda supporting the majority  
of those that specify a lipid delivery system. Clinical trials of nucleic 
acid-based drugs have increased rapidly over the last 12 months as 
pharma industry pipelines continue to grow. The strong medium-term 
growth trajectory for our Nucleic Acid Delivery platform is likely to be 
realised in three phases: firstly, mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases 
which are expected to come to the market from 2025, where we are 
working closely with the Big Pharma companies driving this 
development; secondly, oncology applications which require more 
targeted delivery systems; and thirdly, gene editing therapies such as a 
CRISPR treatment for sickle cell anaemia which we are supporting and 
was recently approved by the US FDA.

funding constraints for early-stage biotech companies, the breadth and 

diversification of our pharma portfolio enabled the business to deliver a 

resilient performance. Destocking primarily affected our heritage, 

consumer health ingredients for over-the-counter medicines, with lower 

Covid-19 demand adversely impacting Adjuvant Systems sales as well 

as lipids for Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. These challenges appear to be 

temporary rather than structural, but their effects could continue into 

2024. By contrast, drug delivery technologies for Small Molecule, 

Protein and Nucleic Acid applications continued to grow. 

Over the longer term, accelerating growth and margins will be driven  

by the commercialisation of new biologic drugs, many of which we are 

supporting during clinical trials, augmented by incremental revenue 

from our own innovation pipeline. 

Protein/Small Molecule Delivery provides delivery systems for both 

the more mature small molecule drugs and the higher growth protein 

and monoclonal antibody (mAb) applications. Through the Solus 

Biotech acquisition, we have added naturally derived phospholipids  

to our portfolio which can be used as delivery systems for protein  

and small molecule actives, and for intravenous nutrition. In line with 

our strategy, we also expanded into bioprocessing aids, a target 

adjacency, launching Virodex as an aid for biopharma manufacturing 

and a superior alternative to a competitor product that is now banned 

in Europe. The first sales of Virodex were secured within three months 

of launch. 

Adjuvant Systems is the leading independent supplier of adjuvants 

which are used as immune response boosters in both commercialised 

vaccines and those in development. It will benefit from two new adjuvant 

partnerships agreed during the year with Amyris and BSI. One of these 

is a sustainable squalene adjuvant that is produced by fermentation 

and is free from shark-derived material that forms the basis of 

competing adjuvants, and is already being qualified by three major 

vaccine companies. We have also expanded our adjuvants portfolio 

through new launches from our own innovation pipeline including 

PHAD, a new proprietary lipid-based adjuvant already sampled into 

over 20 vaccine projects.

The growth of Nucleic Acid Delivery will be driven by the 

commercialisation of new nucleic acid drugs with the number in 

development continuing to grow, and Croda supporting the majority  

of those that specify a lipid delivery system. Clinical trials of nucleic 

acid-based drugs have increased rapidly over the last 12 months as 

pharma industry pipelines continue to grow. The strong medium-term 

growth trajectory for our Nucleic Acid Delivery platform is likely to be 

realised in three phases: firstly, mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases 

which are expected to come to the market from 2025, where we are 

working closely with the Big Pharma companies driving this 

development; secondly, oncology applications which require more 

targeted delivery systems; and thirdly, gene editing therapies such as a 

CRISPR treatment for sickle cell anaemia which we are supporting and 

was recently approved by the US FDA. 

During the year, we opened an applications centre in ‘Genome Valley’, 
Hyderabad, India to support growing demand for protein and small 
molecule delivery. With our Pharma business a top priority for capital 
allocation, we also opened an adjuvant systems lab in Denmark and 
are due to expand our R&D capabilities for nucleic acid delivery at 
Alabaster in the USA and in Singapore in 2024. We are investing an 

extra £175m over the period 2021 to 2024 to scale up Pharma 
production, particularly to meet forecast market demand for new 
nucleic acid drugs which are widely expected to come to the market 
from 2025, with the US and UK Governments co-investing up to an 
additional £75m combined. We have invested over £110m in the 
programme to date.

Helping to prevent and treat life-threatening 
diseases with our drug delivery systems
Adjuvants are used in vaccines to enhance the 
immunogenicity of antigens, inducing a stronger 
immune response and improving the efficacy of the 
vaccine. We are a leading supplier of aluminium and 
saponin-based adjuvants, used in traditional 
preventative vaccines, with a growing portfolio of 
advanced adjuvant systems for use in next generation 
vaccines. This means we can positively contribute  
to the growing demand for health and wellbeing.  
We are making progress towards our target of 
contributing to the development of at least 25% of 
vaccines identified as priorities by the World Health 
Organisation and are also providing adjuvant systems 
for new therapeutic vaccines such as a personalised 
vaccine for patients with melanoma. 

In 2023 we signed two partnership agreements for the 
supply of biotechnology-derived Squalene and QS-21 
adjuvants. With Squalene commonly sourced from 
shark liver and QS-21 produced by harvesting the 
bark of mature soap trees in Chile, these agreements 
ensure we will positively contribute to both patient 
health and biodiversity by establishing sustainable 
supply chains.

Improving agricultural output without negatively 
impacting nature
The application of coatings makes seeds easier to sow 
and the inclusion of micronutrients and plant protection 
products improves the overall performance of seeds 
while reducing the need for crops to be sprayed after 
planting. As such, seed treatment has a positive 
environmental impact, but many seed coatings contain 
polymer-based binding agents, leaving microplastics in 
the soil when the seed coatings break down.

Croda has addressed this issue, becoming the first 
company to develop high-performing microplastic-free 
seed coatings for use on both vegetable and field crop 
seeds. The European Union has adopted legislation 
which bans the use of microplastics in agriculture 
within the next five years resulting in increasing 
demand for microplastic-free coatings which have 
already been applied to seeds covering several million 
acres. With soil health becoming ever more important, 
we expect to deliver incremental growth with 
microplastic-free seed coatings not just in Europe,  
but in other regions such as Latin America too.

Industrial Specialties

Industrial Specialties plays a critical 
role in our business contributing  
to overall asset utilisation and 
therefore profitability.

Contributing to the efficiency of our  
manufacturing assets 
With the divestment of the majority of Croda’s Performance 
Technologies and Industrial Chemicals (PTIC) business on 30 June 
2022, the retained industrials business, including the SIPO joint venture 
in China, became Industrial Specialties (IS). IS leverages investments in 
Consumer Care and Life Sciences, our core sectors, and plays a 
critical role in our manufacturing site model. This includes contributing 
sales volumes to our shared production assets and thereby enhancing 
overall asset utilisation, cost absorption, and ultimately profitability, as 
well as monetising co-streams so that we maximise the value of all our 
products. The business is regionally led, to enable flexible optimisation 
of manufacturing capacity matched against local demand, with global 
leadership from an Executive Committee member. It also operates  
a medium-term supply contract to Cargill, the new owner of the 
divested business.

The 2022 comparator year comprised the full PTIC business in the  
first half year and the retained business in the second half year. It is 
estimated that, had the divestment occurred at the start of 2022, sales 
in 2022 would have been £191m lower at £318m and 2022 adjusted 
operating profit would have been £39m lower at £42m. On this pro 
forma basis, sales fell 35% to £206.1m principally due to lower 
volumes, reflecting destocking and weak industrial demand globally. 
The effect of weak demand was similar on both sales direct from 
Croda and to Cargill as part of the supply agreement and limited the 
ability of IS to help optimise site utilisation. Pro forma adjusted 
operating profit fell 78% to £9.4m as negative operating leverage 
compounded the impact of lower volumes. The impact of these 
adverse market conditions on the SIPO joint venture in China resulted 
in a goodwill impairment charge of £20.8m taken at the 30 June 2023 
balance sheet date. Including the impairment charge, the reported 
IFRS loss was £12.0m (2022: £79.9m profit), with the prior period 
including the full contribution from the divested business.

Louisa Burdett
Chief Financial Officer

Focused on profit protection and active cash 
management
A weak macroeconomic environment and customer destocking had a 
significant effect on Croda’s financial performance in 2023 with sales 
down 11% and adjusted operating profit down 33% both on a pro 
forma basis. Given the challenging trading conditions, we took some 

immediate actions to address costs alongside driving improvements to 
the way that we work that will deliver sustained benefits over the long 
term. We actively managed our cash flow, resulting in a significant 
reduction in working capital and inventory days, and our balance sheet 
remains strong, enabling us to continue to invest through the downturn 
to drive future growth. 

Currency translation
The US Dollar and the Euro together represent approximately 65%  
of the Group’s currency translation exposure. Sterling was broadly  
flat against the US Dollar at an average for the year of US$1.243  
(2022: US$1.237) and weakened slightly against the Euro to €1.149 
(2022: €1.174) on a similar basis. The impact of changes in exchange 
rates for other smaller currencies, which represent 35% of the 
exposure, was more significant. Overall, the negative impact from 
currency translation was £9.1m on sales and £10.3m on adjusted 
operating profit. The disproportionate impact on adjusted operating 
profit reflected a £6m adverse effect from the application of IAS 29 
(‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’) to reporting in 
Argentina and Turkey, and a £2m foreign exchange loss from the 
devaluation of the Argentine peso, with the balance from the net effect 
of other currency movements. The transactional impact of foreign 
currency exchange was not material. 

Impact of PTIC divestment
The Group successfully completed the divestment of the majority of the 
Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals (PTIC) business on 
30 June 2022, with the retained industrials business, including the 
SIPO joint venture in China, becoming Industrial Specialties (IS). Given 
the divested business did not meet the requirements for classification 
as a discontinued operation, the first half of 2022 included the full PTIC 
business and the second half year only the retained business. It is 
estimated that, had the divestment occurred at the start of 2022, sales 
in 2022 would have been approximately £191m lower at £318m and 
2022 adjusted operating profit would have been approximately £39m 
lower at £42m. Pro forma 2022 results have been adjusted for the 
divestment. On this basis, IS sales fell 35% to £206.1m and adjusted 
operating profit fell 78% to £9.4m.

Reported sales were down 18.9% to £1,694.5m (2022: £2,089.3m). 
On a pro forma basis they were down 11%. Within this, price/mix 
improved by 5%, supported by positive mix in Consumer Care and 
weaker IS sales. Group volumes reduced by 16% pro forma, with  
a weaker macroeconomic environment and continued customer 
destocking across consumer, crop and industrial markets having a 
significant impact. While sales volumes remain significantly lower than 

2022, they are slowly improving in Consumer Care and were 9% higher 
in the second half of 2023 than they were in the second half of 2022. 
Sales of ceramides and phospholipids contributed 1% following 
completion of the Solus Biotech acquisition in July, with a 1% 
headwind from currency translation mainly due to movements  
in smaller currencies to which the Group has less exposure.

Cost of sales benefitted from a 12% reduction in raw material costs in 
2023, with freight and energy costs also reducing as we progressed 
through the year. In addition, underlying employee costs were broadly 
flat as a hiring freeze and natural attrition offset inflation-based  
salary increases.

Significant volume declines across most of our markets at a similar time 
led to low levels of capacity utilisation at our manufacturing sites, with 
negative operating leverage impacting profit margins. IFRS operating 
profit was £247.5m (2022: £444.7m) and profit before tax £236.3m 
(2022: £780.0m), the prior period having included the gain on the PTIC 
divestment of £356.0m. IFRS profit before tax included a charge for 
adjusting items of £72.5m (2022: £72.1m charge excluding the gain  

on business disposal), comprising a goodwill impairment of £20.8m  
to the carrying value of the Chinese SIPO joint venture in Industrial 
Specialties, a charge for amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 
£36.7m (2022: £34.3m), acquisition costs of £9.6m (2022: £nil) and 
restructuring costs associated with changes to the Group’s operating 
model of £5.4m (2022: £nil). Prior year adjusting items included a gain 
on contingent consideration on a previous acquisition of £6.1m and an 
impairment charge of £42.2m, reflecting a £34.6m write-down of 
goodwill in the Flavours cash generating unit and a £7.6m write-off of 
unusable manufacturing equipment in Japan. The adjusting charge 
within net interest related to unwind of the discount on contingent 
consideration of £1.7m.

Group adjusted operating profit reduced by 33% on a pro forma basis 
to £320.0m (2022 pf: £476m), with an adjusted operating margin of 
18.9% (2022 pf: 25%). With a large reduction in sales volumes, the 
biggest impact on margin was operating leverage, with reduced fixed 
overhead coverage accounting for a reduction in operating margin of 
around five percentage points. Adverse mix, principally lower Covid-19 
lipid sales, also had an impact, reducing operating margin by around 
three percentage points.

There were a number of non-trading impacts that benefitted the 
adjusted operating margin by a total of approximately two percentage 
points. The most significant of these was a one and a half percentage 
point benefit from a negligible variable remuneration charge due to the 
impact of a lower share price on share scheme costs and because  
the annual bonus for 2023 was not triggered. Consumer Care also 
benefitted from the release of an accrual for an earn out associated 
with the Iberchem acquisition. Following the PTIC divestment, 
associated dis-synergy costs that were previously allocated to the 
divested business have been reallocated across the Consumer Care 
and Life Sciences sectors. This benefitted Industrial Specialties but 
reduced the operating margin in Consumer Care and Life Sciences  
by approximately half a percentage point each. 

Whilst there are likely to be some bounce-back costs in 2024 as 
trading normalises, including a higher charge for variable remuneration 
and higher employee costs, there are also opportunities for margin 
expansion from higher sales volumes and improved mix, particularly if 
volume recovery is broad-based across all markets. There will also be 
benefits from our simplified operating model.

Net finance costs were £11.2m (2022: £19.0m), with receipt of 
£665.0m proceeds from the PTIC divestment on 30 June 2022 and 

payment of the £227.4m consideration for Solus Biotech on 4 July 
2023 being the main drivers of changes over recent periods, as well as 
higher interest rates. Net finance costs are expected to be £15-20m in 
2024. Adjusted profit before tax was £308.8m (2022 pf: £463m). The 
effective tax rate on adjusted profit was 23.9% (2022: 22.8%) and the 
effective tax rate on IFRS profit was 27.2% (2022: 16.2%). The 2023 
IFRS tax rate was higher than the effective tax rate on adjusted profit 
as the exceptional costs were mainly capital in nature and therefore not 
tax deductible. The prior year IFRS tax rate was lower than the effective 
tax rate on adjusted profit having benefitted from corporate tax 
exemptions available on the PTIC divestment. Releases of prior year 
tax provisions benefitted the Group’s adjusted effective tax rate by 
approximately two percentage points, otherwise there were no 
significant adjustments between the Group’s expected and reported 
adjusted tax charge based on its accounting profit. IFRS basic earnings 
per share (EPS) were 122.5p (2022: 465.8p) and adjusted basic EPS 
were 167.6p (2022: 272.0p).

Improving free cash flow
As a result of active cash management during 2023, free cash flow 
improved to £165.5m (2022 restated: £157.4m), with a working capital 
inflow of £29.1m (2022: £133.8m outflow). The working capital inflow 
was principally driven by lower inventory with stock days falling by 
approximately 20%. The improvement in working capital was despite 
the impact on receivables of approximately $60m of lipid sales shipped 
to our principal Covid-19 vaccine customers during the final quarter.

Net capital expenditure was £170.1m (2022: £138.5m), driving future 
growth opportunities and supported by government funding grants in 
the Pharma business.

Closing net debt was £537.6m (2022: £295.2m), including payment of 
the £227.4m consideration for the Solus Biotech acquisition that was 
funded from cash and debt facilities. The balance sheet remains strong 
with a leverage ratio of 1.3x EBITDA (2022: 0.5x), within our 1-2x target 
range. As at 31 December 2023, the Group had committed funding in 
place of £1,050.0m, with undrawn committed facilities of £381.2m and 
£172.5m in cash. We received the most favourable rate of interest on 
our sustainable banking facility as our emissions reductions met the 
specified targets.

Retirement benefits
The post-tax asset on retirement benefit plans at 31 December 2023, 
measured on an accounting valuation basis under IAS 19, was £64.9m 
(2022: £75.2m). Cash funding of the various plans is driven by the 
schemes’ ongoing actuarial valuations. The Trustee and Company are 
working on the 30 September 2023 triennial actuarial valuation for the 
largest pension plan, the UK Croda Pension Scheme. Initial results 
shared with the Company show that the funding position has improved 
and that the cost of providing benefits has fallen.

Delivering long-term performance

Alternative Performance Measures (APMs):
We use a number of APMs to assist in presenting information in this 
report. We use such measures consistently at the half year and full 
year, and reconcile them as appropriate. Whilst the Board believes  
the APMs used provide a meaningful basis upon which to analyse  
the Group’s financial performance and position, which is helpful to  
the reader, it notes that APMs have certain limitations, including  
the exclusion of significant recurring items, and may not be directly 
comparable with similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 

The measures used in this statement include: 

•  Constant currency results: these reflect current year performance  

for existing business translated at the prior year’s average exchange 
rates. Constant currency results are the primary measure used by 
management to monitor the performance of overseas business 
units, since they remove the impact of currency translation into 
Sterling, the Group’s reporting currency, over which those overseas 
units have no control. Constant currency results are similarly useful 
to shareholders in understanding the performance of the Group 
excluding the impact of movements in currency translation over 
which the Group has no control. The definition of constant currency 
profit has been revised in the year to reflect the impact on the Group 
of its operations in hyperinflationary countries. Constant currency 
results are reconciled to reported results in the review of financial 
performance below. The APMs are calculated as follows:

a. For constant currency profit, translation is performed using  
the entity reporting currency before the application of IAS 29 
hyperinflation and any associated one-off foreign exchange  
gains or losses;

b. For constant currency sales, local currency sales are translated 
into the most relevant functional currency of the destination 
country of sale (for example, sales in Latin America are primarily 
made in US Dollars, which is therefore used as the functional 
currency). Sales in functional currency are then translated  
into Sterling using the prior year’s average rates for the 
corresponding period;

•  Underlying results: these reflect constant currency values adjusted  
to exclude acquisitions in the first year of impact. They are used by 
management to measure the performance of each sector before  
the benefit of acquisitions are included, in order to assess the 
organic performance of the sector, thereby providing a consistent 
basis on which to make year-on-year comparison. They are seen as 
similarly useful to shareholders in assessing the performance of the 
business. Underlying results are reconciled to reported results in the 
Finance Review;

•  Pro forma results: these reflect the current year performance 

measured against 2022 adjusted for the estimated impact of the 
divestment of the majority of Performance Technologies and 
Industrial Chemicals on 30 June 2022. Given the divested business 
did not meet the requirements for classification as a discontinued 
operation, the first half of 2022 included the full PTIC business and 
the second half year only included the retained business. The Board 
believes that the pro forma information assists shareholders by 
providing a meaningful basis upon which to analyse business 
performance and make year-on-year comparisons. Pro forma 
analysis is used by management for budgeting and reporting 
purposes including the internal assessment of operating performance 
across the Group. In the first half of 2022, it is estimated that the 
divested operations contributed revenue of £191m, adjusted 
operating profit of £39m and adjusted profit before tax of £33m.  
Pro forma results are presented on a rounded basis due to the 
estimated nature of the measures. The level of estimation risk in 
arriving at the pro forma numbers is not considered material for the 
Group. Pro forma adjustments only impact Industrial Specialties and 
the Group, with no changes to Consumer Care or Life Sciences;

•  Adjusted results: these are stated before exceptional items  

(as disclosed in the review of financial performance below) and 
amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, and tax 
thereon. The Board believes that the adjusted presentation (and the 
columnar format adopted for the Group income statement) assists 
shareholders by providing a meaningful basis upon which to analyse 
business performance and make year-on-year comparisons. The 
same measures are used by management for planning, budgeting 
and reporting purposes and for the internal assessment of operating 
performance across the Group. The adjusted presentation is 
adopted on a consistent basis for each half year and full year results;
•  Operating margin or return on sales: this is adjusted operating profit 

divided by sales, at reported currency. Management uses the 
measure to assess the profitability of each sector and the Group,  
as part of its drive to grow profit by more than sales value, in turn by 
more than sales volume, as set out in the Chief Executive’s Review;

•  Return on invested capital (ROIC): this is adjusted operating profit 

after tax divided by the average adjusted invested capital. Adjusted 
invested capital represents net assets adjusted for net debt, net 
retirement benefit assets/(liabilities), earlier goodwill written off to 
reserves and accumulated amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets. The definition of ROIC has been revised in the year to 
exclude the Group’s net retirement benefit balances from invested 
capital, given they are not operating in nature. Comparative 
information has been restated to reflect the new definition, resulting 
in restated ROIC of 14.4% for 2022 (previously 14.1%). Calculations 
and reconciliations are provided in the five year record of the 
Group’s Annual Report. The Board believes that ROIC is a key 
measure of efficient capital allocation, in line with its policy set, with 
its aim being to maintain a ROIC of at least two times the cost of 
capital over the cycle, and that it is useful to shareholders in 
assessing the superior returns delivered by the Group and the 
impact of deploying more capital to grow future returns faster;
•  Net debt: comprises cash and cash equivalents (including bank 

overdrafts), current and non-current borrowings and lease liabilities. 
Management uses this measure to monitor debt funding levels and 
compliance with the Group’s funding covenants which also use this 
measure. It believes that net debt is a helpful additional measure for 
shareholders in assessing the risk to equity holders and the capacity 
to invest more capital in the business;

•  Leverage ratio: this is the ratio of net debt to Earnings Before 

Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) adjusted to 
include EBITDA from acquisitions or disposals in the last 12 month 
period. EBITDA is adjusted operating profit plus depreciation and 
amortisation. Calculations and reconciliations are provided in the  
five year record of the Group’s Annual Report. The Board monitors 
the leverage ratio against the Group’s debt funding covenants and 
overall appetite for funding risk, in approving capital expenditure and 
acquisitions. It believes that the APM is a helpful additional measure 
for shareholders in assessing the risk to equity holders and the 
capacity to invest more capital in the business;

•  Free cash flow: comprises net cash generated from operating 

activities adjusted for the cash effect of exceptional items less net 
capital expenditure and payment of lease liabilities, plus interest 
received. The definition of free cash flow has been revised in the year 
to better align with the most directly reconcilable line in the Group’s 
IFRS cash flow statement. Comparative information has been 
restated to reflect the new definition resulting in restated free cash 
flow of £157.4m for 2022 (previously £167.4m). The Board uses free 
cash flow to monitor the Group’s overall cash generation capability, 
to assess the ability of the Company to pay dividends and to finance 
future expansion, and, as such, it believes this is useful to 
shareholders in their assessment of the Group’s performance; 
•  New and Protected Products (NPP): these are products which are 
protected by virtue of being either newly launched, protected by 
intellectual property or by unique quality characteristics. NPP is  
used by management to measure and assess the level of innovation 
across the Group.

Risk management

Managing risks

Risk strategy
Effective risk management enables the business to protect and create 
value, helping us to identify opportunities and minimise threats to the 
delivery of our strategy and to build resilience within our business model.

Risk governance
Our Board owns and oversees our risk management programme,  
with overall responsibility for ensuring that our risks are aligned with our 
goals and strategic objectives. The Audit Committee assists the Board 
in monitoring the effectiveness of our risk management and internal 
control policies, procedures and systems.

Risk monitoring
Global visibility of risks identified by regions, sites and sectors is 
obtained through bottom-up risk registers that are continuously 
updated in our risk and control system. Using our global risk 
management framework (page 52), bottom-up risks are combined  
with top-down risks, the latter being identified and owned by a  
member of the Executive Committee, in our Executive Risk Register.

Movements to the Executive Risk Register are reviewed by the Risk 
Committee during quarterly meetings, which also has standing agenda 
items to review and monitor internal and external emerging risks; IT  
and cyber risks; internal audit; and safety, health, environmental and 
quality (SHEQ) assurance. The Committee also provides the Board  
with visibility of the principal risks facing the organisation through 
quarterly reports.

Risk management
While our Board owns and oversees our risk management  
programme, risk management accountability is embedded  
throughout our organisation: 

•  Our first line of defence, our employees, have a responsibility  

to manage day-to-day risk in their own areas guided by Group 
policies, procedures, control frameworks and risk appetite. Local 
management, and ultimately the Executive, ensure that risks are 
managed and actioned according to these frameworks

•  The second line of defence is provided by management team review 
of each risk register, culminating in review by the Risk Committee
•  The third line of defence is through assurance over the effectiveness 
of mitigating controls, which is provided through internal audits, 
supplemented by reports from external assurance providers

•  Our Global Crisis Management Plan, which is in place to manage 

significant risk events, is owned by the Executive Committee

•  Croda’s Group Fraud Policy, Group Code of Conduct, Group Code 
of Ethics and Group Whistleblowing Policy in addition to our controls 
framework are in place to prevent and detect fraud. Annually the 
Audit Committee reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of 
Company’s anti-fraud procedures. See case studies on page 53 for 
more details on what we have done in 2023 to enhance our fraud 
risk management

•  The process for managing climate related risks is fully embedded as 
part of our global risk management process (more details on climate 
related risks are provided on pages 59 to 69).

Risk appetite
Our risk appetite is the level of risk that Croda is willing to 
accept in the pursuit of a specific objective or strategy.

We define a risk appetite score for each risk subcategory, 
using a one (‘risk averse’) to six (‘risk open’) scale. For 
example, the risk subcategory for SHE sits at the lower end 
of the scale, meaning that we are not willing to accept risks 
of this nature and these must be reduced to a level as low as 
reasonably practical. At the other end of the scale sits the 
subcategory for innovation, an area where we are willing to 
accept risks to seize significant opportunities. Assessing risks 
against our risk appetite allows us to review and challenge 
the level of risk that we are taking for each of our key risks,  
to identify areas where additional controls may be needed,  
or where the level of control may be too onerous. 

Our risk appetite statements are compiled based on our 
Company values, strategy and capacity to absorb risk.

We use our risk appetite statements as an effective tool to 
communicate the Company’s appetite towards each type  
of risk, providing a consistent guidance for decision-making 
throughout the organisation.

Emerging risks
We consider emerging risks and opportunities as part of our risk 
landscape and define them as those whose effects have not yet  
been substantially realised and whose evolution is highly uncertain.

The Risk Committee reviews emerging risks and opportunities from 
internal and external sources at its quarterly meetings and considers 
whether they should be included in our risk register.

Emerging risks can be slow moving, when they have potential to 
materialise in more than a year, as well as rapid velocity, those that 
may materialise within the next year. The later are closely monitored 
and actively managed (see Artificial Intelligence case study on page 53).

Principal risks
We consider principal risks to be those risks, or combination of risks, 
that, were they to arise and not be effectively mitigated, would cause 
serious disruption to our business model, threatening future 
performance, solvency, liquidity or our ability to deliver our strategy. 
Risks at this level are recorded in our Executive Risk Register with  
a high pre-control score.

The Group’s principal risks, as reported in the financial statements  
for the year ended 31 December 2022, were revenue generation; 
product and technology innovation and protection; digital technology 
innovation; delivering sustainable solutions – Climate and Land Positive; 
management of business change; our people – culture, wellbeing, 
talent development and retention; product quality; loss of significant 
manufacturing site; ethics and compliance; and security of business 
information and networks. During our periodic risk reviews, we 
confirmed that all principal risks reported in 2022 remain relevant and 
no new principal risks were identified. The following principal risks were 
identified as heightened relative to 2022:

•  Revenue generation risk increased during 2023 as the risk of 

continuous escalation of geopolitical conflicts may exert further 
downward force on demand, consequently impacting revenue. 
Despite a difficult year with significant revenue and profit reductions, 
Croda’s business model has remained resilient as evidenced by 
strong cash generation.

•  Security of business information and networks risk also heightened 
in likelihood during 2023 because of evolving technologies and 
increasingly sophisticated malicious activities worldwide.

Focus on fraud risk management
Croda has a strong governance and reporting structure,  
set within a culture that reinforces ‘doing the right thing’  
and embeds counter fraud behaviours throughout the 
organisation. It is Croda policy that we will not tolerate fraud. 
A culture of honesty, propriety and vigilance, which includes 
individuals at all levels, is fundamental to managing fraud 
prevention and detection. In 2023 the following changes 
were made to strengthen our risk management framework 
and enhance our ability to identify and mitigate fraud risks:

•  a new risk subcategory ‘Fraud’ was added to our 

framework under the risk category ‘External Environment’ 

•  a risk appetite scored ‘Risk Averse’ was associated with 
this new subcategory (see details of our risk appetite 
scoring scale on page 51)

•  an associated risk appetite statement was crafted to 

reinforce stringent risk management practices throughout 
the organisation

Following these changes to our risk management framework, 
comprehensive bottom-up risk reviews with focus on fraud 
were performed at regions, sites, and functions. This diligent 
and holistic approach allows us to proactively identify 
vulnerabilities and implement targeted measures against 
fraud from the ground up.

Emerging risk of Artificial Intelligence
The mass use of Generative Artificial Intelligence, intertwined 
with AI’s transformative potential, presents a significant 
emerging risk, demanding close monitoring and proactive 
management. At Croda, we acknowledge Artificial 
Intelligence as both an emerging risk and opportunity.

Understanding the substantial impact of AI on business 
growth and operational efficiency, we are committed to 
deploying AI in a controlled, risk-conscious manner. This 
approach aims to uncover efficiency gains and unlock new 
business capabilities while mitigating associated risks.

To steer this journey responsibly and sustainably, Croda has 
instituted a multidisciplinary AI Steering Committee which is 
overseen by the Executive Committee. Its primary goal is to 
provide strategic guidance, ensuring the ethical, effective, 
and responsible implementation of AI technologies across 
the Company. By prioritising maximal value generation while 
minimising risks, the Committee aims to foster our values of 
‘Responsible’, ‘Innovative’ and ‘Together’ (see details on our 
values on page 16).

Why this matters to us

Our ambition is to deliver consistent top and 
bottom-line growth, with profit growing ahead of 
sales, ahead of volume. To grow, we need to 
innovate and also keep pace with our customers 
as they serve consumers globally in established 
markets and higher-risk developing markets. 
Failure to manage these challenges and the 
consequences of geopolitical tensions will 
adversely impact delivery of our growth objective. 
Acquisitions of adjacent technologies will dilute 
growth if they are not effectively integrated.

How we respond

Through our global sector sales, marketing and 
technology teams, we identify consumer trends 
and respond swiftly to satisfy customer needs 
through key technologies. 

Our direct selling model enhances customer 
intimacy (see our competitive advantages – 
customer intimacy on page 13 for details).

Our resilient business model and focus on 
controlling costs, managing cash flow and 
increasing sales activity helps to mitigate the 
impact of difficult trading conditions (see our 
competitive advantages – our approach to  
growth on page 13 for details).

What we have done in 2023

•  Focused on our ‘doing the basics brilliantly’ 
programme which aims to improve the 
customer experience and employee productivity

•  Reorganisation designed to simplify and  

enable faster decision-making and localised 
customer response

•  Progressed well with construction of new 
manufacturing site in Dahej, India, which  
will add capacity in fast-growth markets
•  Broke ground on new site in China for 

fragrances and botanicals that will bring 
production closer to customer

•  Expanded our R&D footprint in fast-growth 

countries such as new Pharma lab in 
Hyderabad, India

Innovation is the lifeblood of our business. It plays  
a critical role across our operations; it differentiates 
us from the competition, protects sales and 
improves our margins. Failure to leverage our 
global innovation teams could lead to a reduction  
in New and Protected Products (NPP) impacting 
growth and margin. 

Failure to protect our intellectual property (IP) in 
these products in existing and new markets could 
undermine our competitive advantage.

Our technical research and development (R&D) 
teams, based in our customer innovation centres 
and application laboratories globally, focus 
innovation on customer and market needs and  
are embedded across our business (see value 
creation, from discovery to supply – problem 
discovery on page 14 for details).

We invest in: R&D, Open Innovation and Smart 
Partnership programmes, developing premium 
niches and disruptive technology acquisitions  
(see value creation, from discovery to supply – 
solution development on page 14 for details).

Our specialist IP team protects new products and 
technologies, defending our IP and challenging 
third-party IP where appropriate (see our 
competitive advantages – innovation leadership  
on page 13 for details).

•  Invested in our biotech capabilities enhancing 
the necessary skills and expertise to drive 
innovation in a strategic technology area
•  Obtained further external funding to support 
projects such as novel sustainable fragrance 
molecules, which can be considered 
transformational for Croda in our long-term 
innovation focus

•  Maintained strong NPP revenues demonstrating 
our commitment to the commercialisation of our 
investment in R&D

•  Enhanced the performance of our high 

throughput screening capabilities, which has 
supported the accelerated development of a 
number of candidate solutions focused on 
developing customer needs

Why this matters to us

Digital technology is a significant disruptor, rapidly 
changing markets that we operate in, changing  
the way we interact with our external partners  
and each other. New and established customers 
expect a high level of online service, from 
researching ingredients to procurement, and failure 
to meet these needs ahead of competitors will 
impact growth, hinder R&D knowledge sharing  
and create inefficient processes.

How we respond

Our digital specialist teams focus on what our 
business needs (see page 13 for details) and 
provide global leadership to take advantage  
of the fast-evolving digital world. They deliver  
an integrated market-facing environment that 
encompasses our entire value creation business 
model (see page 14 for details).

Digital pilot projects embedded in the organisation 
support agile, local trials of innovative ideas, which 
can grow into global roll outs. 

We have made a bold Commitment to be Climate, 
Land and People Positive by 2030, aligning our 
smart science with United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). We are committed to 
delivering improvements in line with the objective  
to limit global temperature rises to no more than 
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Climate change, 
biodiversity loss and rising inequality are changing 
consumer and other end-user demands, making 
sustainability leadership a key differentiator for  
our customers.

Failure to remain ahead of our competitors and to 
deliver on our stretching 2030 targets will damage 
our reputation as a sustainability leader and 
compromise growth.

The Executive-level Sustainability Committee, 
which meets quarterly and is chaired by our  
Chief Sustainability Officer, monitors progress  
and allocates the necessary resources to meet  
our targets, with accountability embedded across 
the organisation. The central Sustainability team 
provides subject matter expertise, assists in 
measuring and reporting internally and leads  
our external reporting and assurance of 
non-financial data.

We see more opportunity than risk in  
climate change.

See our competitive advantages – sustainability 
leadership on page 13, and our value creation – 
ingredient manufacture and global impact on page 
14 for details.

Delivery of our strategy requires significant 
business change globally, including acquisition  
of businesses and investment in our capital 
expenditure programme which is taking place  
in an environment of cost inflation and interruptions 
to availability of materials. Such transformational 
change has the potential to distract the 
organisation, resulting in failure to deliver  
expected results, or at worst destroy value.

Ineffective management of change could result  
in a failure to integrate new acquisitions effectively 
and impact the realisation of expected benefits.

We have refocused our portfolio, so our  
capabilities address consumer and our customer 
needs (see value creation, from discovery to supply 
– global needs on page 14 for details).

The Board and Executive have oversight of the 
strategic change programme and receive regular 
updates on status and progress. 

Skilled programme managers, supported  
by external consultants, lead our delivery of  
change programmes and our Capital Project 
Director monitors and oversees the capital 
investment programme.

9. Ethics and compliance 

10. Security of business information 
and networks 

Why this matters to us

At Croda, compliance is at the heart of everything 
we do. We strive to conduct our business in 
accordance with all applicable laws and 
regulations, including UK ethics legislation which 
has extra territorial scope, competition laws, data 
privacy laws, tax laws and human rights legislation. 

Our continued growth into higher-risk markets  
and the introduction of new regulation create  
an elevated compliance and reputational risk.

Society and business are subject to more 
numerous and increasingly sophisticated threats  
to security, including hackers, viruses and 
ransomware attacks, while keeping our data  
safe is subject to increasingly stringent regulatory 
requirements globally. Our business model relies 
heavily on the availability of IT networks and 
systems; an extended interruption of these  
services may result in an inability to operate.

How we respond

Our Group Ethics Committee has responsibility  
for the development, reinforcement, oversight  
and cascade of the Group’s ethics strategy and 
programme, Code of Conduct and other policies 
and procedures. The Ethics Committee meets 
quarterly to consider new legislation, review the 
effectiveness of current processes (including 
monitoring annual training programmes) and 
promote the importance of ethics and compliance 
across our business and amongst key stakeholders.

Our Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness  
of the Group’s compliance procedures on an 
annual basis.

We run our key applications in distributed 
computing environments with regular failover 
testing and penetration testing being undertaken. 
Our information security specialists monitor our IT 
services and networks, oversee cyber protection 
solutions and provide regular educations globally 
about cyber awareness, data protection and 
responsible use of emerging tools, whilst internal 
and external auditors review and report on the 
operation of cyber and system controls annually.

What we have done in 2023

•  Appointed a Global Compliance Director and  
a Compliance Manager for further refining and 
improving the ethics programme

•  Focused on designing and developing a human 

rights programme

•  Continued with the ethics integration of newly 
acquired companies. This year we integrated

Long-term viability statement

Confirmation of viability
Based on their assessment of its prospects and viability, the Directors confirm 
that they have an expectation that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years to 
31 December 2026. The Directors also considered it appropriate to prepare  
the financial statements on a going concern basis, as explained in the Group 
accounting policies (page 157). 

Assessment of viability
We assess viability through two lenses: a ‘top-down’ test which quantifies the 
magnitude of profit or loss required to endanger liquidity and our bank covenants 
and a ‘bottom-up’ assessment that makes use of downside scenario models, 
which reflect the key risks facing the Group, to test against the Group’s financial 
headroom and leverage over the viability period.

We evaluate the Group’s future outlook through five-year strategic and capital 
investment plans, with three-year detailed financial modelling being prepared. 
Most of the detailed sector delivery plans also look forward three years, including 
product innovation, manufacturing expansion timescale and market development. 
We chose to use a three-year period for the viability assessment because, given 
the inherent uncertainty of long-term planning, we believe this is the horizon that 
provides the most appropriate balance between accuracy and long-term visibility.

Our strategic plan is built from a bottom-up sector view considering different 
macroeconomic scenarios and near-term risk factors, including weaker demand, 
inflation and raw material price changes. The base case model and downside 
scenarios are used to assess the impact for both the viability statement and the 
going concern assessments. For more on going concern see page 157.

Top-down liquidity headroom
We assess our overall capacity to withstand catastrophic events by stress testing 
the EBITDA reduction required to trigger a default under our funding covenants, 

and liquidity headroom available from committed debt facilities, including any 
which mature within the viability period:

•  Bank leverage covenant: the leverage ratio at the end of 2023 of 1.3x remains 

substantially below the maximum covenant level under the Group’s debt 
facilities of 3.5x. Based on 2023 results, stress testing assesses that EBIT 
would need to fall by more than 70% to trigger an event of default. In the event 
that breaching the maximum covenant level was possible, we would also take 
additional unmodelled action to conserve cash and improve the covenant 
position (we also test the impact on our interest covenant; however, with a 
high level of fixed rate debt, it is difficult to construct a plausible scenario which 
endangers compliance with this covenant);

•  Unused committed liquidity headroom: at 31 December 2023, the Group had 
committed funding in place of £1,050m, with undrawn committed facilities  
of £381.2m (see page 49 for more details). Current committed debt facilities 
largely mature in the third year of the viability period and, in normal lending 
market circumstances, we would expect to have adequate access to renew 
facilities as these mature. The Company therefore expects to have the 
necessary liquidity headroom available to cope with unexpected risk events 
during the viability period.

Bottom-up risk scenario headroom
Using the ‘base case’ model, individual downside scenario events were  
identified and modelled. In addition, five severe but plausible combinations of 
these individual scenario events were tested to assess the potential combined 
downside impact on the liquidity and covenant headroom of the Group over  
the three-year viability period. None of the individual scenarios or scenario 
combinations was found to endanger the liquidity or covenant requirements  
over the viability period. 

The key scenarios tested were as follows:

Scenario

Key assumptions

New entrants or enhanced competition in our market 
space make significant inroads into our business

Loss of business in Consumer Care, Life Sciences and Industrial 
Specialties

Regulatory or reputational issues affecting individual 
products or product groups

Disruptive production or digital customer interaction 
technologies are brought to the market by competitors 
and we lose competitiveness

Loss of contribution from significant products

Loss of business in a major technology platform and competitive 
attrition within Consumer Care and Life Sciences customers

Escalation of geopolitical upheaval results in sanctions 
to relevant countries and the global economy moving 
into recession, with significant business loss

No sales to sanctioned country and lower sales elsewhere, with 
greater impact in Consumer Care than in Life Sciences reflecting 
the different levels of exposure to discretionary income

Failure to secure supply of key raw materials

Loss of contribution from products affected by lack of 
constrained raw materials

Catastrophic incident leading to complete loss of a 
manufacturing site

Uninsured loss of major manufacturing site resulting in lost 
margin for an extended period

Major ethics and compliance breach leading to 
government investigation and fine

Loss of business due to reputational damage, in addition to cost 
of fines and legal expenses

Loss of main ERP system for prolonged time

Cyber attack

Failure to demonstrate delivery against sustainability 
commitments

Product quality failure leading to a product recall

Failure to deliver expected benefits from acquisitions

Persistent inflation combined with failure to recover cost 
increases in the market

Failure to attract, retain and develop the necessary skills 
to deliver the expected growth

Loss of contribution margin during the ERP outage, mitigated by 
business continuity actions

A significant cyber attack damages reputation and results in 
disruption of processes, in addition to costs of data recovery

Reputational damage, leading to loss of business in all sectors

Financial impact from damages and legal costs in addition to 
loss of business due to reputational damage. Greater impact in 
Life Sciences due to nature of product applications

Commercial synergies from recent acquisitions (e.g. Solus 
Biotech) are not realised

Partially absorb increases in raw material and freight costs

Sales growth rate is affected by lack of necessary skills

The principal risks to which these scenarios relate are as follows:

Non-financial disclosures

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

Croda has long recognised the scale of the climate emergency, which we believe creates both opportunities and risks to our future growth.  
We develop innovative products which help our customers to reduce their own carbon footprint and we set stretching climate related targets  
as part of our Commitment to become Climate Positive1 by 2030 (page 34 and Sustainability Impact Report (SIR) – page 13).

On pages 59 to 67 of this report we summarise material climate related disclosures consistent with the four pillars and 11 disclosures proposed  
by the TCFD, including the “Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures” released in October 
2021. As part of these disclosures we have considered the guidance in Section C “Guidance for all Sectors” and Section E “Supplemental 
Guidance for Non-Financial Groups – Materials and Buildings” of the TCFD Annex. We also reference links to further information which can be 
found in our Annual Report, Sustainability Impact Report (SIR) and Reporting Data Pack (RDP) to supplement our compliance. We cross refer to  
our SIR throughout this TCFD section as that report offers us additional space to explain our strategic Climate Positive commitment, to illustrate this 
through case studies (SIR page 12) and enhance our explanation of our targets, metrics and progress (SIR pages 9 to 13). We continue to work to 
remain aligned with evolving climate and non-financial disclosure requirements as required by the Listing Rules.

Following Committee discussions, 
the Board established a 
Sustainability Oversight Committee 
(page 98) to increase the capacity 
and competence of the Board to 
govern our sustainability approach.

Implementation of the 
Sustainability Oversight 
Committee which will meet 
quarterly. See page 98 for 
key responsibilities and 
focus areas. 

The Audit Committee approved the 
appointment of KPMG to provide 
limited assurance of the Group 
Climate Positive KPIs (pages 64 
and 103). 

Audit Committee will 
continue oversight  
of non-Financial KPIs as  
we review the scope of 
metrics assured. 

The Audit Committee 
continues to monitor ESG 
reporting and disclosures 
and how we comply.

for sustainability risks, 
controls and oversight

Roll out awareness  
and training across the

to assessment of  
climate risks.

A sustainability competence 
framework for Board membership 
was devised and used in 2023. 
The induction received by Chris 
Good included deep dive sessions 
with Group Sustainability (page 97).

The Board attended a dedicated 
training session aligned with our 
sustainability strategy.

The terms of reference for the 
Sustainability Committee were 
reviewed, approved in April, and 
include risk and compliance with 
accountability at Executive level. 
The Sustainability Committee 
focused on Executives as 
members only and increased time 
spent on monitoring and reviewing 
of climate related risks. 

The role of the sustainability 
champions has been further 
defined, setting best practice  
for cascading communication  
on climate throughout  
the organisation.

How we comply

As one of the three pillars of our Commitment (page 10), 
climate risks and opportunities are core to our overall 
strategy and as such the Board considers climate 
related issues as part of its annual review of the strategy 
described on page 77. The Board is accountable for all 
risks, including those relating to climate, and reviews 
these annually. It receives a quarterly report from the 
Chief Sustainability Officer, as well as minutes and 
discussion materials from each Sustainability Committee 
meeting, which consider progress against climate 
targets, including the risks to delivering these. 

The Board approves significant capital expenditure  
and acquisition proposals and has oversight of the 
innovation strategy, considering how these align with 
our climate and decarbonisation goals. 

The Remuneration Committee agrees climate related 
performance objectives which are incorporated into 
senior leadership remuneration (page 112).

The Board guides the leadership values we look for in 
Croda to ensure we build future leadership capabilities 
to include sustainability and decarbonisation know-how. 

The Board delegates responsibility for running the 
business to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the 
Executive Committee, which includes responsibility for 
managing climate related issues. A sub-committee,  
the Sustainability Committee, meets at least quarterly, 
chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer who is 
supported by the Group Sustainability team. The 
Committee comprises senior leaders (including an 
executive sponsor for Climate Positive, the President  
of Global Operations, Mark Robinson) from across the 
business, each of whom has a responsibility to identify 
further strategic opportunities, understand the risks 
posed in delivery of the strategy, monitor progress 
towards declared targets and coordinate Group-wide 
engagement with our sustainability targets.

Through our risk management framework (page 52) 
climate related risks are captured, assessed, mitigated 
and owned at the appropriate level of the organisation.

Our Sustainability Professionals Network and local 
sustainability champions facilitate best practice sharing 
throughout the organisation, reporting progress back to 
management. Our organisation structure is shown in the 
Governance section (page 99).

1.  ‘Climate Positive’ is not considered a technical term with recognised definition, it is the branding Croda have used for our combined climate targets since we publicly 

launched this strategy in 2020 and indicates our efforts to go further than reducing our own carbon footprint.

How we comply

Our definition of short, medium and long-term  
time horizons is included on page 62 and they are 
aligned with business planning and our sustainability 
strategic commitments to 2030 and interim 
milestones for delivery.

Climate related physical and transitional risks and 
opportunities are assessed using our global risk 
framework, described on page 52 of this report.  
They include increased raw material costs, carbon 
pricing, emerging regulation and the effects on our 
people and working environment. The four most 
impactful climate related risks, and how these were 
selected, are described in more detail on page 65  
of this report, together with a summary of other less 
impactful risk themes identified from our bottom-up  
risk registers.

Delivery of climate-related commitments identified in 
our Climate Positive strategy form a core part of our 
overall business strategy and as such the impact of 
not delivering our climate related objectives is 
significant. We reflect this in our principal business 
risks on page 55. The financial impact of the four 
highest risks in our register is described in more  
detail on pages 66 to 67 of this report.

We include a GHG emissions metric in a revolving 
credit facility (RCF), with carbon emission targets in 
the seven-year agreement aligning with our 2030 
Climate Positive commitments. Savings are 
reinvested into the decarbonisation capital 
expenditure programme. 

Since 2020 we have applied an internal shadow 
carbon price to capital investment to help to prioritise 
projects that will reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions 
(SIR page 10). 

All capital projects over £100k are required to 
complete a sustainability impact assessment. The 
impact of increased capital cost on impairment and 
useful economic life is considered on page 157.

Since 2021 carbon budgets have been presented 
annually alongside the financial budgets at regional 
and sector level, which consider the impact of the 
short and long-term site decarbonisation plans.

Supported by external consultants, Accenture, we 
have a detailed climate scenario analysis (CSA) of the 
most impactful climate related risks identified against 
three future climate related scenarios to assess our 
resilience to these risks. Under each scenario we 
consider impact across six, five-year time periods, 
which is significantly in excess of our strategic 
planning horizon but is in line with our commitment  
to be net zero and our SBT targets.

Our methodology is described in more detail on  
page 62. 

What we have  
done in 2023

The Sustainability Committee 
reviewed significant sustainability 
related risks, transferring 
ownership to business owners  
as appropriate to allow improved 
monitoring and control. 

Group Sustainability were kept 
informed of plans for a new 
enterprise risk management 
system and will support 
development of a framework for 
climate and other sustainability 
risks as it is rolled out in 2024. 

Our business teams finalised  
2030 decarbonisation roadmaps. 
These include scope 3 emissions, 
enabling the sectors to make 
portfolio management decisions 
incorporating carbon footprint 
data, which will inform the 
development of the next  
generation of low carbon products.

It is worth noting that carbon 
offsets form no part of our 
decarbonisation strategy to 2030.

Croda has developed a tool to 
automate the calculation of 
cradle-to-gate product carbon 
footprints. Assisting in business 
decision-making this has now 
been launched to customers 
representing around 70% of our 
Beauty Care portfolio.

During the year, the pace of all  
of our non-safety-critical projects 
was reviewed, including some 
decarbonisation projects. This  
has introduced some temporary 
delays, but we remain confident  
in our ability to meet our Science 
Based Target by the end of 2029.

Feasibility study completed to 
scope out an approach to net

organisation’s 
processes for 
identifying and 
assessing climate 
related risks

b) and c)
Describe the 
organisation’s 
processes for 
managing climate-
related risks.
Describe how 
processes for 
identifying, assessing 
and managing 
climate related risks 
are integrated into 
the organisation’s 
overall risk 
management.

How we comply

The process for identifying climate related risks, 
assessing both their impact and likelihood, is fully 
embedded as part of our global risk management 
process which is described on page 51. New and 
emerging risks and opportunities can be identified at a 
local level (mainly physical risks) or by the Sustainability 
Committee (emerging risks requiring action to be driven 
globally, or requiring more granular analysis). We have 
used the TCFD framework to support our assessment  
of climate related risks.

Impact and likelihood scoring for all risks uses the 
six-point scoring methodology defined in the Group  
risk framework.

Emerging risks and opportunities include those resulting 
from the rapidly evolving climate and sustainability 
regulation. In both cases a business owner is identified, 
and the risk is assessed for both impact and likelihood 
using the global risk framework. As the impact of 
emerging risks on specific sites or regions is understood, 
local business owners are identified, and the risks are 
moved to local risk ownership to drive mitigating actions.

Our Group risk framework, described on page 52, 
includes risk/opportunity areas across six categories 
and 17 subcategories, against which risk owners identify 
local interpretations. Sub-categories most relevant to 
climate include growth (organic and inorganic), 
innovation, production, sourcing, supply chain, and 
external environment, which incorporate the risks and 
opportunities referred to in appendix 1 of Implementing 
the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures June 2017. 

Whole Group transitional and emerging risks and 
opportunities are currently identified by the Sustainability 
Committee through the ‘sustainability risk register’. When 
fully defined, these risks are migrated into the appropriate 
local risk register and transferred to local ownership. This 
includes risks identified through scenario analysis.

Local physical climate related risks (both acute and 
chronic) are already embedded and managed in  
local risk registers with local owners and mitigation 
actions defined.

What we have  
done in 2023

We have worked with external 
consultants to complete a gap 
analysis of our global footprint 
against emerging and current 
climate regulation to identify 
emerging risks relating to  
the changes. This included 
preparation of a workflow  
to support our plans for 
compliance with the EU 
Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (EU) 
2022/2464 (CSRD).

We have completed an initial 
review of our readiness to 
report against International 
Sustainability Standards Board 
(ISSB) reporting requirements, 
mapping against our current 
response to SASB. 

The Decarbonisation and 
Process Technology Director 
led a review to test for  
and secure the continued 
viability of the site level 
decarbonisation roadmaps. 

The Sustainability Committee 
reviewed significant 
sustainability related risks, 
transferring ownership to 
business owners as 
appropriate to allow improved 
monitoring and control. 

New enterprise risk 
management system 
commissioned which will 
improve the tagging and  
local monitoring of climate 
related risks.

Next steps and timeframes 
supporting further 
improvement

Perform double materiality 
assessment in 2024 to 
confirm scope of 
reporting for CSRD.

Enhance framework  
for sustainability risks, 
controls and oversight  
in new enterprise risk 
management system. 

Formally embed 
accountabilities  
for climate related  
risks across our  
business teams.

Launch the Sustainability 
Academy to develop our 
knowledge and 
competence enabling the 
wider Croda community 
to assist in the 
identification of risks and 
mitigation improvements.

Climate scenario analysis (CSA) methodology
The CSA was conducted using a standard methodology in line with the TCFD’s guidance. Climate scenarios defined primarily by the Network  
for Greening the Financial Systems (NGFS) and supplemented with comparable Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) and Orbitas Finance 
scenarios, were used to model the potential climate related risks and opportunities that Croda may be exposed to, which were identified through 
our risk assessment process described in more detail on pages 53 to 55 of this report.

Three time horizons:
Short-term: 0 - 3 years, this is aligned with our time horizon used in our viability assessment (page 58) and with our interim sustainability milestones 
focused on delivery by or ahead of this date. This time horizon encompasses the typical life time of our plant and equipment. 

Medium-term: 3 – 10 years, this is aligned to our strategic planning horizons. This time horizon encompasses targets supporting our Commitment 
to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030.

Long-term: 10 – 30 years, this is aligned to our longer-term aspirations including our Commitment to be net zero by 2050.

Six time points:
The assessment considered six time points, each five years apart, from 2025 to 2050, with 2030 reflecting our medium-term timeframe. 

Defining financial impact materiality:
Risk impact is assessed using the same six point financial impact scale used in our group risk framework and is colour coded as follows: 

Risk impact score
1-2
3-4
5-6

Financial impact
Opportunity – Minor Impact
Low – Moderate Impact
High – Critical Impact

Building the scenarios:
In line with good practice Croda commits to formally review the CSA at least every 3 years. The CSA was first performed in 2021, then refined and 
re-baselined in 2022 to remove the contribution of the majority Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals business divested in June 2022 
and include the climate footprint of businesses acquired in 2021. Multi-disciplinary workshop groups reviewed the assumptions for forecasting our 
growth (using financial assumptions used in our strategic forecasting process), and our demands for each of raw materials, energy and people.  
The baseline for our energy estimates and site water use are taken from our non-financial reporting system, Sphera, which is fed with quarterly 
actual data from all our sites globally. There have been no material changes to the organisation in 2023, and periodic risk reviews confirmed that  
our principal risks reported in 2022 remain relevant and no new principal risks were identified (see page 55). No factors were identified to impact  
on the validity of the 2022 CSA. 

Modelled in conjunction with external scenario data from the NGFS, Orbitas Finance and SSP to forecast and quantify the potential levels of climate 
related financial risk in line with Croda’s risk matrix, the results of our 2022 assessment are shared on pages 66 and 67.

For each transitional risk we also considered the impact under the assumption that Croda continues to operate as today (business as usual) and 
secondly that mitigating actions to meet our verified science based targets are successfully implemented. This clearly illustrates the significance of 
the mitigating steps Croda is taking.

Croda climate scenario analysis has been conducted at an organisational level, however regions or sites that have material contributions to the 
overall risks have been identified, affording the opportunity to account for any dominant locations in the assumptions used.

Metrics and targets

a) Disclose the 
metrics used by 
the organisation  
to assess climate 
related risks and 
opportunities  
in line with its 
strategy and risk 
management 
process

b) Disclose scope 
1, scope 2 and, if 
appropriate, scope 
3 greenhouse gas 
emissions and the 
related risks

c) Describe the 
targets used by  
the organisation  
to manage climate 
related risks and 
opportunities and 
performance 
against targets

How we comply

Our sustainability strategy (page 36) defines strategic targets 
and milestones for 2030, progress towards which is reported 
quarterly to the Executive and Board. The metrics used to 
assess progress, and a description of the targets are presented 
in more detail on page 64 and in our Sustainability Impact 
Report on pages 13, 18, 23 and 26, and cover the following:

•  Absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and emissions 

intensity

•  Energy usage
•  Land use and land area saved
•  Water Impact
•  Bio-based Raw Material 
•  Process Waste to Landfill

Further climate related measures have been proposed for our 
primary transition and physical risks. These are presented 
alongside the relevant target on pages 66 and 67.

The Remuneration Committee includes sustainability targets  
in the Performance Share Plan for senior executives currently 
relating to 15% of the award (page 122).

We apply a shadow carbon price to capital expenditure 
projects, aiding prioritisation of those that result in reduced 
scope 1 and 2 emissions. This price is set at £124/tonne  
in line with the UK Government Green Guide.

Refer to page 157 for consideration of climate change  
on our financial impact performance and position.

Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions and our 
calculation methodology are disclosed on page 64. 

Information on energy, water and waste is recorded in our 
Sphera system by all Croda locations globally as a single 
source of data for reporting of these and scope 1 and 2 
emissions metrics. Our scope 3 upstream emissions are 
calculated using our automated corporate dashboard. 

Our 2023 GHG emissions and many other climate metrics 
(marked ∆ throughout this reporting suite) have been assured 
(limited assurance) under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410 by 
KPMG, our independent assurance provider (opinion statement 
can be found at www.croda.com/sustainability). We have 
re-stated our reporting for 2018 - 2022 (see SIR page 25  
for details). This has been re-verified by Accenture with  
their formal independent verification statement available  
at www.croda.com/sustainability, which also includes a 
summary of the calculation methodologies used.

Our chosen calculation of carbon intensity is not industry 
standard and uses ‘value add’ as a measure of profit. This 
allows us to demonstrate how we are decoupling economic 
growth from environmental impact.

We have set strategic targets and milestones for 2030 as 
described in section a) above. Progress towards meeting  
these targets is reported quarterly to the Executive and Board. 
All targets are absolute. Supplemental information on our 
performance and progress is available in more detail on  
pages 9 to 13 of our Sustainability Impact Report.

Refer to page 157 for consideration of climate change on our 
financial impact performance and position. 

Next steps and timeframes 
supporting further improvement

Determine means to develop 
further meaningful metrics 
against TCFD and ISSB 
recommendations supported 
by quality data.

Develop improved data 
management controls, 
reviewing opportunities to 
enhance reporting accessibility 
to leadership at business, 
Executive and Board level.

Commence development of 
Net Zero Roadmaps for key 
technology platforms, to 
support the transformation  
and future preparedness of  
our business to grow.

What we have  
done in 2023

Conducted a review against the 
cross-industry metrics identified in 
Table A2.1 of the 2021 Implementation 
Guidance. New metrics have been 
proposed to assist better 
understanding of our exposure to  
key transitional and physical risks.  
See page 66 and 67. Further work  
is required to allow us to propose 
meaningful metrics for Climate  
Related Opportunities and Capital 
Deployment. In 2023 we have 
updated our Capex system to allow 
future tracking of our spend on 
decarbonisation. The results of  
our planned double materiality 
assessment in 2024 will aid 
identification of future measures. 

In addition, we have completed an 
initial review of our readiness to report 
against International Sustainability 
Standards Board (ISSB) reporting 
requirements, reflecting on the extent 
of our disclosures across this report, 
our Sustainability Impact Report and 
our Reporting Data Pack. Further 
works will be completed in 2024 to 
enhance our response. 

Croda has developed a tool  
to automate the calculation of 
cradle-to-gate product carbon 
footprints. Assisting in business 
decision making this has now  
been launched to customers 
representing around 70% of  
our Beauty Care portfolio.

We have worked with Accenture  
to develop a downstream scope  
3 inventory. This is based on life  
cycle assessment and extended  
input and output models. See page 
11 of the SIR for the results of this 
modelling and potential benefits to  
our customers. 

A detailed description of the targets 
and our progress towards these in 
2023 is included in our Sustainability 
Impact Report page 13.

A full financial and non-financial  
data pack has been developed  
and is available on our website at 
www.croda.com/sustainability

KPMG engaged to provide limited 
assurance of our 2023 performance 
against a set of climate positive KPIs. 
Their opinion and our reporting criteria 
document are available online at 
www.croda.com/sustainability.

Develop improved data 
management controls, 
reviewing opportunities to 
enhance reporting accessibility 
to leadership at business, 
Executive and Board level.

Review scope of KPIs for 
inclusion in limited assurance  
in 2024 to reflect strategic 
priorities and anticipation of 
future regulatory demands.

Since 2018, our baseline year, our total scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions have reduced by 33%. Within this, scope 1 emissions 
decreased by 17% and we have seen a greater than 69% reduction in 
scope 2 emissions. Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our UK 
operations were 15,095 TCO2e in 2023 (2022: 17,271 TCO2e) 
representing approximately 15% of our global GHG emissions.

In 2023 upstream scope 3 emissions decreased by 27% and we are 
now able to report downstream scope 3 emissions for the first time 
(see page 11 of our Sustainability Impact Report for more detail).

Limited assurance of GHG emissions data∆
∆ indicates where metrics have been assured (limited assurance) under 
ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410 by KPMG, our independent assurance 
provider. See www.croda.com/sustainability for details. 

Emissions intensity
Our chosen measure of GHG emission intensity divides our GHG 
emissions (including market-based scope 2 emissions) by value 
added2, a measure of our business activity. The GHG emission 
intensity for 2023 has been calculated using assured scope 1 and 
scope 2 emissions data and estimated value added. The result for 
2022 uses verified4 scope 1 and 2 emissions and an estimated value 
added if the PTIC divestment have been completed at 01 January 
2022. Results for 2018-2021 use actual value added and scope 1  
and scope 2 emissions inclusive of the divested locations. 

64

Croda International Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2023

On this basis, our GHG emissions intensity has improved by 55% 
since 2018, indicating we are decoupling growth from climate impact.

Energy consumption and efficiency improvements
In 2023 we consumed 777,947,568 kWh (2022: 884,613,001kWh) of 
energy across our global operations. This included 101,237,029 kWh 
(2022: 112,990,828 kWh) consumed by UK operations.

As part of our strategy to improve the efficiency of energy 
consumption, 28 projects were implemented globally, realising 
22,231,185 kWh of annualised efficiency improvements, equivalent to 
3,798 TCO2e avoided emissions.

1.  Our GHG inventory has been completed in accordance with the Greenhouse 

Gas Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) 
using the operational controls approach. Scope 1 emissions are calculated 
using UK Government emission conversion factors for greenhouse gas 
company reporting. Scope 2 emissions have been calculated in line with the 
market-based method set out in the GHG Protocol Scope 2 standard.
2.  Value add: Croda Group adjusted operating profit before depreciation, 

amortisation and Group employment costs including Directors, Share based 
payment costs and non-exceptional redundancies, at reported currency. 
3.  Our scope 3 emissions are calculated in accordance with The GHG Protocol 
Corporate Value Chain Scope 3 standard and cover all relevant upstream 
categories. Scope 3 emissions are calculated using primarily LCA data, and 
where this is not available, an Extended Environmental Input-Output (EEIO) 
model method – using spend data, to quantify the emissions associated with  
a sector of the economy in a given geography.

4.  Emissions data for 2018 – 2022 has been restated and verified by Accenture 

see www.croda.com/sustainability for their verification statement. See page 25  
of SIR for more information.

Identifying our highest impact climate risks and opportunities
Climate related risks and opportunities are identified at all levels of our organisation and are assessed for both impact and likelihood using our global 
risk framework (page 52). Detailed scenario analysis was originally conducted in 2021 to investigate the risks identified to have the highest financial 
impact from these bottom-up assessments. The updated modelling in 2022 reduced the impact of climate on labour productivity which, we 
removed from our disclosure, and increased our assessment of water usage which we then introduced. We have enhanced our reporting in 2023  
to reflect our assessment of water impacts, disruption from both water stress and flooding, rather than simple water usage. We consider the 
geographical impact of these key risks below.

Transitional risks

Climate risk

Description of risk/opportunity

Geographical impact

Impact of carbon 
pricing on our 
emissions

Rising carbon emissions from our sites may impact 
profits through increased direct costs if emissions are 
taxed. Evolving local regulation in key markets and 
regions, such as the EU carbon border tax, will add 
further pressure.

Atlas Point is our largest contributor to scope 1 & 2 emissions 
and when viewed with our other manufacturing sites in North 
America this region is the most material, accounting for c.43% 
of our scope 1 & 2 emissions.

Impact of carbon 
pricing on the cost of 
utilities, particularly 
natural gas

The increasing cost of natural gas resulting from 
recent geopolitical issues may increase further as  
a result of carbon pricing. Natural gas is a key utility 
used in our manufacturing process, accounting for 
58% of our energy consumption.

Atlas Point is currently our largest consumer of natural gas and 
when viewed with our other manufacturing sites in North 
America this region is the most material, accounting for more 
than 50% of our natural gas consumption.

Physical risks

Climate risk

Description of risk/opportunity

Geographical impact

Climate change 
impact on the 
availability of natural 
raw materials

Water impact – water 
stress and flood risk

Potential changes in mean global temperatures are 
likely to affect the location, yield and type of crops 
grown around the world, with a resulting impact on 
raw material availability and cost. Palm oil derivatives 
form a significant volume of our raw materials and this 
trend is expected to continue. 

As such the future change in the price of palm 
derivatives will have a direct effect on the cost  
of palm-based products/ingredients.

Changes in global climate can significantly increase/
decrease precipitation at a given location over time. 
Potential changes in precipitation, reduced rainfall 
over extended periods and extreme rainfall events are 
likely to affect Croda sites 1) water stressed locations 
by causing droughts or 2) in areas of increased 
riverine floodrisk. This can have financial implications 
for local industry by impacting regional water supply, 
with loss of production due to flood damage leading 
to lost revenue and potential loss of business.

The use of palm oil derivatised raw materials is spread  
across our operations. Asia has the highest use c.46% 
followed by Western Europe c.28% of our total purchased 
palm oil derivatives.

Changes in global climate have varied localised effects and 
therefore periods of both high and low precipitation levels will 
become increasingly extreme and prolonged. Sites located in 
water stressed areas across Southern Europe, Northern Africa 
and Latin America are expected to face increasingly arid 
conditions. As reported in 2022 the scenario analysis has 
demonstrated that there is no material financial risk associated 
with operating our sites in water stressed regions.

Sites located in riverine flood risks in India, and those with 
recent flood events in Alabaster and Mevisa, are expected to 
face increasing risks. The results for the flood risk component 
have been reported on page 67.

Other climate related risks/opportunities identified
Other climate related risks currently assessed to have a lower impact are identified in our risk registers across products and services, distribution 
and supply chain, suppliers, R&D, operations and acquisitions and divestments.

The tables below set out the assumptions used, the risk profile generated and our planned mitigations for each of the four key climate risks 
selected. Our analysis shows that the financial risks they present to Croda could be managed by currently planned mitigating actions meaning that 
we would not have to materially change our strategy or business model and indicating confidence in the resilience of both. The impact of climate 
change is considered under our Accounting Policies, see page 157. 

Impact of carbon pricing on our emissions

Driver for assumptions

Risk profile and financial impact

Mitigations and measures

Using Croda revenue and  
GHG emissions projections, the 
potential cost impact of increased 
carbon prices associated with 
Croda emissions (scope 1 and 2) 
was calculated. Predicted 
emissions were reviewed for 
assumptions of both no climate 
action (pro-rata for 2021 
performance) and achievement of 
our net zero strategy, considering 
our validated SBT trajectory  
to 2030.

The cost was modelled across 
the future climate related 
scenarios using carbon price 
models at an organisational level 
from the NGFS database.

In a Hot House World scenario, the additional  
cost of carbon tax increases is limited, resulting in 
a minor level of financial risk to the business out  
to 2050.

In both the Disorderly and Orderly transition 
scenarios the additional costs due to higher levels 
of carbon taxation and restrictive measures are 
forecast to expose Croda to high levels of financial 
risk beyond 2035 and 2040 respectively assuming 
a business-as-usual emissions trajectory. 

(Worst case of Disorderly transition)

This is mitigated when following the planned 
emissions reduction trajectory in line with Croda’s 
current verified Science Based Targets. 

(Disorderly transition after incorporating 
decarbonisation strategy)

Croda has a verified 1.5oC 2030 Science Based Target. Every location, 
including non-manufacturing sites, has a decarbonisation road map towards 
achieving a 50% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions by the end of  
2029. The quality assessment process for these was externally validated  
by Accenture.

Whilst a high proportion of the reduction is based on alternative energy 
sources, assuring a high confidence level, our plans also cover reducing 
energy consumption and increasing energy efficiency. For example, our 
manufacturing site in Spain installed a heat recovery system and solar panels 
that led to a reduction in annual CO2 emissions of 15%., Incotec’s new highly 
sustainable Aquarela site in Holambra, Brazil has 788 solar panels installed 
on the roof, aiming to generate 100% of its electricity consumption, our site 
in Chocques, France, receives steam, vital for process heating, from a local 
municipal waste incinerator verified as having zero impact on the site’s scope 
2 emissions and several UK collaborative funding opportunities have been 
applied for to further accelerate the decarbonisation of our heat. For further 
details see pages 9 to 13 of our Sustainability Impact Report.

We apply a shadow carbon price to capital expenditure projects, aiding 
prioritisation of those that result in reduced scope 1 and 2 emissions. This 
price is set at £124/tonne in line with the UK Government Green Guide.

Related targets and metrics:

By 2030, we will have achieved our SBTs, reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions 
by 46.2% from a 2018 baseline, in line with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, 
and reducing upstream scope 3 emissions by 13.5%

(see page 64 for progress)

Impact of carbon pricing on utilities, particularly natural gas

Driver for assumptions

Risk profile and financial impact

Mitigations and measures

Using Croda revenue and natural 
gas usage projections, this 
scenario assessed the possible 
cost to Croda of increased 
natural gas prices. Predicted 
natural gas usage was reviewed 
for assumptions of both no 
climate action (pro-rata for 2021 
performance) and achievement of 
our decarbonisation strategy. The 
cost was modelled across the 
future climate related scenarios 
using natural gas price models at 
an organisational level from the 
NGFS database. 

In a business-as-usual energy usage trajectory, the 
Hot House World scenario saw the lowest levels of 
financial risk, with a moderate risk level to 2050.

In both the Disorderly and Orderly transition 
scenarios the additional costs due to natural gas 
price increases are expected to expose Croda to 
high levels of financial risk from 2045 and 2050 
respectively. 

The development of our decarbonisation road maps has enabled all 
locations to assess the opportunities for migrating to alternative energy 
sources, reducing energy consumption and increasing energy efficiency. 
Notable projects relating to natural gas substitution include the installation of 
a bioethanol boiler on our manufacturing site in Brazil, our Singapore site has 
switched from steam heat tracing to electrical, using less natural gas, and 
our Atlas Point site at Delaware, USA has increased its landfill gas burning 
capability in 2023 to replace part of its natural gas demand. As a material 
consumer, the latter will substantially reduce Croda’s overall exposure to 
natural gas pricing. 

(Worst case of Disorderly transition)

This is mitigated to low risk levels by implementing 
Croda’s current decarbonisation strategy, resulting 
in reduced usage of natural gas:

Mitigations and measures

The potential changes in the  
cost of sales that Croda may be 
exposed to has been modelled 
using the future percentage 
increase of palm oil prices 
(Orbitas – Climate Transition Risk 
Analyst Brief: Indonesian Palm 
Oil) against the total volumes  
and price of palm oil derivatives 
purchased by Croda in 2021. 
Indonesia is the dominant origin 
of Croda’s supply.

The cost of palm oil is forecast to 
expose Croda to varying levels  
of risk across the two different 
climate related scenarios – 
Current Policies and Net Zero 
2050 – for which clear models 
are available.

In the Hot House World scenario, the cost of palm 
oil increase is limited, resulting in a low level of 
financial risk to the business out to 2035, at which 
point the cost of palm oil is forecast to drop below 
the 2021 baseline cost resulting in a cost saving 
opportunity for the business, driven by continual 
efficiency improvement in farming technologies 
(partially supported by Croda crop innovation) 
driving prices down.

In an Orderly transition scenario, a predicted 
increase in the cost of palm oil (driven by increasing 
demand for palm oil as an alternative to fossil 
based oils for fuel) is expected to drive initially 
moderate impacts towards critical levels of financial 
risk by 2045.

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified palm oil cultivation  
leads to increased yields due to more efficient farming practices, increasing 
availability of palm and palm kernel oil without further deforestation. Being  
a leading voice in industry and working with coalitions such as Action for 
Sustainable Derivatives (ASD) to drive further industry transition to RSPO 
helps to mitigate the risks associated with increased pricing due to lack  
of availability. 

88.4% of our palm derivative purchases in 2023 were RSPO-certified and 
>99% of purchased volumes in 2022 were mapped back to either refineries, 
mills or plantations, working with ASD. For further details see page 15 of our 
Sustainability Impact Report.

Our focus on high value niches and differentiated products with unique 
characteristics also helps to mitigate this risk by enabling us to pass on raw 
material cost increases to our customers.

(Orderly transition) 

Related targets and metrics 

By 2030, over 75% of our organic raw materials by weight will be bio-based, 
absorbing carbon from the atmosphere as they grow. 59% in 2023∆ and 
59% in 2022 of our organic raw materials were bio-based.

We seek to improve mapping in 2024 to allow future reporting of % revenue 
linked to bio-based raw materials. 

Water Impact - Riverine Flood risk

Driver for assumptions

Risk profile and financial impact

Mitigations and Measures

In all three forecasted climate scenarios (Hot 
House World, Disorderly and Orderly), the 
predicted cost increase as a result of Annual 
Expected Damage from River Floods reaches 
‘high’ levels of financial risk to the business by 
2040. This gradual increase in financial exposure is 
replicated across all four sites in the analysis.

(Orderly transition)

The most at-risk sites were 
identified as either being within 
areas of Extremely High Riverine 
Flood Risk from the WRI 
Aquaduct tool or have recently 
been exposed to flooding events. 

 Using Croda revenue and 
assessment of financial impact 
(loss production leading to lost 
revenue and potential loss of 
business), this scenario assessed 
the possible cost to Croda of 
damage from river floods. The 
cost was modelled across the 
future climate related scenarios in 
line with expected annual growth 
rate (CAGR) and increase in 
Annual Expected Damage from 
River Floods for India from the 
NGFS database. India was 
chosen due to the higher risk  
of flooding at Croda’s sites in  
this area.

Following a specific risk assessment conducted by Croda’s insurers, with 
recommended controls, the residual risk is relatively low to the business. 

Specific measures underway include implementing flood mitigation strategies 
including flood monitoring, hard defences in the form of flood barriers and 
soft defences such as marshland/wetlands. 

Contingency plans and controls are in place for these variations and  
flooding scenarios. Croda has multiple sites which can produce products 
which alleviates this issue, and there is a large investment in the region to 
mitigate this.

To measure our water use impact, Croda developed an internal  
methodology that considers the entire water cycle and accounts for the 
social, environmental, and business impacts of water use. Six Croda sites 
were identified as being located in regions exposed to the highest levels of 
disruption from water impacts (flooding or water stress) and have defined 
realistic water impact reduction roadmaps.

Related targets and metrics:

Reduce our water use impact by 50% from our 2018 baseline: By the end of 
2022 there had been an 18% reduction from the baseline water impact 
score for our six material sites. 

% revenue for sites with significant risk of Flood: 14.9% 2023, 13.7% 2022.

Note this is gross risk and does not account for transfer of production at 
alternative locations.

Board approved the creation of a Board-level 
Sustainability Oversight Committee (BSOC)

Executive Director. The new Committee will 
create additional capacity at Board level to 
give due attention to this growing area of 
governance and develop the ESG competency 
of Board members. The BSOC met for the 
first time in January 2024.

Chair’s introduction

Chair’s letter

“Effective governance together with  
the strength of leadership of our Board 
continued to support the Executive  
on strategic investment through  
challenging conditions.”

Dame Anita Frew DBE
Chair

This report, together with the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
set out on pages 106 to 134, describes how the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code principles have been applied 
by the Company. The Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Code for the period under review. The 2018 
UK Corporate Governance Code is available at www.frc.org.uk.

Croda International Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2023

Dear fellow shareholder
It has been a challenging year for our business and whilst the trading 
environment is now beginning to improve, high inflation, rising interest 
rates and customer destocking had a significant effect on our financial 
performance. However, effective governance together with the strength 
of leadership of our Board continued to support the Executive on 
strategic investment through challenging conditions. 

Health and safety continues to be a key focus and is at the top of the 
agenda at every Board meeting. It is also a key focus for site visits, with 
a briefing document prepared so that site specific key health and safety 
information is available in advance of the visit thereby allowing the 
visiting Director to effectively challenge any particular areas of concern 
or educate themselves on good practice for wider learnings. In June, 
the Board attended a safety training day at the Leek site where the 
Group’s safety values were reiterated and the Board was able to 
engage with both process safety protocols and the behavioural safety 
of our employees and contractors. 

The Board remained focused on sustainability and achieving our 
ambition to be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients, 
by becoming Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030. Reflecting 
the Board’s commitment, it approved the creation of a Sustainability 
Oversight Committee to provide the Board with enhanced oversight of 
sustainability matters and strategy implementation as well as ensuring 
compliance with relevant regulations. In July, the sustainability team 
provided the Board with a training session which focused on the 
leadership role the Board has in ensuring that Croda responds to social 
and environmental risks. See pages 98 to 99 for further information on 
the Sustainability Oversight Committee and the Board’s focus on 
sustainability on page 77.

The Board oversaw the introduction of a new organisational model, 
moving to a more agile, simplified matrix structure with all regional 
teams reporting into Consumer Care and Life Sciences to provide  
a solid foundation for the next phase of Croda’s development.  
This will drive greater accountability and responsiveness to customers, 
empower decision-making through the organisation and facilitate  
the onboarding of new talent more effectively. See page 81 for  
more information.

During 2023, the Board continued its oversight and challenge to the 
management team in delivering the Group’s strategy. This included 
taking part in two dedicated strategy sessions with the Executive 
Committee team with discussions focused on the changing market 
environment in Consumer Care and the need for a flexible strategy to 
meet the expectations of consumers. In Life Sciences, time was also 
spent understanding the evolution of the Pharma market towards 
emerging biopharma and genetic medicine modalities and the strategic 
focus on strengthening our current base, accelerating innovation and 
targeting complementary M&A. Further details on our Board strategy 
review can be found on page 77. 

The acquisition of Solus Biotech, a global leader in premium 
biotechnology-derived beauty actives, completed in July following the 
unconditional approval from the South Korean regulatory authorities. 
The acquisition provides access to biotech-derived ceramide and 
phospholipid technologies, and emerging capabilities in natural retinol 
and will significantly strengthen our Beauty Actives portfolio. Located  
in South Korea, Solus expands our Asian manufacturing capability and 
will create a new biotechnology R&D hub in the region. See page 80 
for more information on Solus Biotech.

 
 
The Board is always mindful of the impact of its decisions on our 
stakeholders and on the long-term sustainable success of the 
Company. On pages 78 to 83 we describe how the Board engaged 
with each of our key stakeholders and give some examples of how we 
have considered their interests in some of the Board decisions made 
during the year. The Board owns and oversees our risk management 
programme and has completed a robust assessment of the Group’s 
emerging and principal risks. Further information is on page 51. 

Our success depends on our skilled and highly committed employees 
and throughout 2023 our people have demonstrated their resilience, 
adaptability and determination to persevere in a very tough trading 
environment. During the year the Board met regularly with employees, 
through listening groups, Board presentations and site visits. Further 
details on how we engaged with our employees can be found on 
pages 78 and 84. 

Leadership and diversity 
Board succession planning continued to be a key focus this year  
with my retirement as Chair of the Board at the conclusion of the  
2024 AGM.

During the year the Nomination Committee undertook a search for a 
new Chair to take over when I step down at the AGM at the end of my 
nine-year tenure. Following a comprehensive search process, in 
September we announced that Danuta Gray had been appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director and Chair designate. Danuta joined the Board 
on 1 February 2024, and will succeed me as Chair at the conclusion  
of the AGM in April. Further information about the rigorous selection 
process led by Jacqui Ferguson, our Senior Independent Director,  
can be found on page 96. 

In December we announced that our CFO, Louisa Burdett, would be 
leaving Croda in June 2024. We are sorry that Louisa is leaving but she 
has our very best wishes. A search for her replacement is underway.

Helena Ganczakowski stepped down at the AGM in 2023 having 
served nine years as a Director. I extend grateful thanks, on behalf of 
the Board, for the outstanding contribution she has made to the Board 
and as Chair of the Remuneration Committee over the last nine years. 
Her insight, support and challenge will be missed and we wish her all 
the best. The Board undertook a search for a new Non-Executive 
Director to replace Helena and on 27 April 2023, Chris Good joined  
the Board as a Non-Executive Director. Chris has spent his executive 
career in the consumer care industry with more than 20 years at Estée 
Lauder Companies, a global leader in prestige beauty. Chris’ deep 
understanding of the consumer care industry and in particular his 
insights into beauty care markets and consumers are of great value to 
Croda and the Board. His appointment strengthens the consumer care 
knowledge and experience around the Board table, supporting our 
continued transition to a pure play Consumer Care and Life Sciences 
business. Further details on Chris’ induction can be found on page 97.

We believe that diversity in the Boardroom is essential for innovative 
thinking and improves the quality of decision-making. I am happy to 
report that the composition of the Board continues to exceed the new 
diversity requirements of the FCA Listing Rules as well as the ambitions 
set out in the FTSE Women Leaders Review and the Parker Review for 
FTSE 100 companies. Two of our Board members are from ethnic 
minority backgrounds. We are also comfortably in line with the 
requirement that listed companies should have at least one woman in a 
senior Board position with a female Chair, Senior Independent Director 
and Chief Financial Officer. Further information on Board diversity, 
including the new Listing Rule disclosure requirements, can be found 
on pages 93 to 94.

On the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the Board 
agreed to extend Keith Layden’s appointment for a further year and  
my appointment up to the 2024 AGM. This is in line with our policy  
to review appointments annually once six years’ tenure has been 
completed. Following the retirement of Helena Ganczakowski in April, 
Jacqui Ferguson was appointed as Senior Independent Director. Before 
making a recommendation to the Board, the Nomination Committee 
considers the contribution made to the Board and the Committees  
by the individual and their time commitments. No Director being 
considered for re-appointment took part in any discussion relating to 
their own appointment. Further information about the tenure of other 
Board members can be found on page 95.

Board evaluation
In accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, this 
year’s Board evaluation was externally facilitated and I am pleased to 
report that it confirmed that we continue to operate as a highly effective 
Board with many signature strengths. Details of the Board’s annual 
evaluation are set out on pages 88 to 89. 

Annual General Meeting
Our AGM will be held on 24 April 2024 and provides shareholders  
with a valuable opportunity to communicate with us and this dialogue  
is very important to the Board. As a result of the impact of Covid-19, 
from 2022 we offered shareholders a choice to attend the AGM in 
person or view the AGM remotely via a webcast. Take-up for remote 
attendance has, however, been very low with just one shareholder 
attending remotely in 2023 and no questions having been submitted  
by those attending remotely. In light of the apparent lack of demand  
for remote participation and to avoid unnecessary costs, we have 
decided to arrange our 2024 AGM on the basis that shareholders,  
their proxies and corporate representatives may attend in person 
without broadcasting the event. We will keep shareholder demand  
for remote participation under review in respect of our future AGMs.

It has been my great privilege to work with Croda and to serve as Chair 
of the Board since 2015. I would like to give thanks to my fellow Board 
members and all my colleagues working at Croda for their hard work, 
commitment and support during my nine-year tenure as Chair and I 
wish everyone every success for the exciting future ahead.

Board activity in 2023

Board meetings and structure in 2023
Board meetings are the main forum for the Directors to debate,  
review and challenge strategic, operational and governance matters 
concerning the Company, as required to ensure that the Directors 
discharge their duties including under Section 172(1) of the Companies 
Act 2006.

There were six scheduled meetings of the Board during the year plus 
two additional ad-hoc meetings to discuss business performance. 
Board meeting agendas are set through a collaborative process 
between the Chair, CEO and Company Secretary. The Chair ensures 
adequate time is allocated to allow effective discussion, with a typical 
agenda being structured to ensure a balance is maintained between 
reporting, approvals, strategy and governance.

Detailed planning is undertaken to create an annual Board agenda 
programme, which ensures important strategic, operational, financial, 
cultural and corporate governance items are discussed at the 
appropriate time during the year, with additional deep dives into  
key strategic areas. 

In addition to the formal meetings of the Board, a separate Strategy 
Day was held in June, attended by members of the Executive 
Committee and their senior management teams; see page 77 for  
more information. A further five-year strategic plan session was held  
in the autumn.

Singapore, Korea and the US. During site visits, Directors meet a wide 
range of employees and actively participate in workforce engagement 
sessions through listening groups, town halls and informal dinners as 
well as receiving business update presentations. These interactions 
allow Directors to have discussions and receive direct feedback from  
a cross section of employees, which fosters better and more informed

Board agendas and activity in 2023

Reporting – 
backward 
looking

The Board receives reports from members of the 
Executive Committee as well as the Board Committees, 
with reports from the CEO and CFO forming the main 
items for discussion at each meeting.

•  The CEO’s report focuses on strategic and operational 
activities. Safety is always the first matter he reports 
on with a focus on behavioural and process safety 
issues including relevant KPIs. He also reports on key 
Quality KPIs. The performance of each business is 
discussed, including sales, regional activity and 
competitor insights as well as any major customer, 
supplier and regulatory body issues. The global 
market and macroeconomic environments have  
also been a key focus given the challenging  
trading environment. 

Approvals – 
current 
issues

Approvals that form part of the matters reserved for  
the Board include corporate transactions, capital 
expenditure, significant commercial contracts, the 
financial statements, and dividends. For example, 
during 2023 the Board:

•  Approved the trading updates in April and October.
•  Approved capital investments in Guangzhou,  

China and at our sites in Leek in the UK and Lamar  
in the USA.

•  The CFO reports on monthly and year to date sales 
performance, profit, cash flow, cost base, capital 
expenditure and outlook for the year. She also 
reports during the year on performance against 
budget and treasury items (including liquidity) and 
keeps the Board abreast of investor discussions  
and feedback.

•  The Board receives quarterly reports from members 
of the Executive Committee in relation to all aspects 
of the business, including market sectors, regional 
delivery, sustainability, operations, innovation, people, 
risk and functional updates. These include 
sustainability related non-financial KPIs and are in 
addition to the deep dive sessions covered under  
the Board’s annual programme of business.

•  The Board closely monitors the trading environment 
and approved two unscheduled trading updates 
issued during the year.

•  Discussed acquisition opportunities, which were  

not progressed.

•  Approved Chris Good’s and Danuta  

Gray’s appointments.

•  Approved the Group’s IT strategy, including AI risks 

and opportunities.

•  Approval of the full year and half year dividends. 

Strategy – 
forward 
looking

Each Board meeting agenda includes items key to 
progressing the strategic objectives of the business to 
enable the Board’s understanding of the opportunities 
and challenges for the business in new markets, 
technologies and disruptive innovation. During the year 
the Board undertook strategic deep dives into the 
following areas:

•  The annual Board strategy review provided a focused 
opportunity to assess and review strategy to ensure it 
remained appropriate for the long-term sustainable 
success of the Company.

•  Monitored organic development proposals in 

technologies key to achieving the Group’s 2030 
Science Based Target and progressing its strategic 
focus on biotech operations and capability. 
•  Sustainability – as well as the annual review of 
sustainability leadership, the Board received a 
bespoke training session which included discussion 
on Croda’s operating context and position, 
commercial implications and an outside-in 
perspective; see page 77 for more information. 
•  Innovation – reviewed the Beauty Care business’ 

short and medium-term opportunities.

Key areas of focus throughout the year

Board focus on sustainability

Sustainability embedded in our decision-making 
During the year the Board remained focused on delivery of our 
sustainability Commitment, which is a fundamental aspect of how  
we work, how we are judged, and how we judge ourselves, as we 
decouple our continued growth and increasing shareholder value from 
our impacts on the environment. 

The Board approved the Group’s annual budget, which includes 
investments to achieve our Commitment and sustainability strategy  
and to ensure sufficient prioritisation of resource to support this. 

Sustainability plays a central role in decision-making with new 
investments having to meet our rigorous sustainability requirements.  
In September the Board approved the development of a greenfield 
manufacturing site at Guangzhou in China to help transform our 
Fragrance and Beauty Actives businesses in support of our fast  
grow Asia strategy. The Board considered the impact on the Group’s 
sustainability commitments, with the use of sustainable materials for 
construction, zero scope 1 emissions, no waste to landfill and progress 
to zero scope 2 emissions by buying renewable electricity as available. 
The acceleration of botanical actives sits alongside traditional Chinese 
medicine using locally sourced ingredients, meeting consumer demand 
for sustainability and ‘clean beauty’. 

The Board decided to proceed with the development of the Pharma 
expansion programme at the Lamar greenfield site in Pennsylvania in 
line with our strategy to grow our Nucleic Acid Delivery business and 
our commitment to contribute to the development and 
commercialisation of 25% of WHO-listed pipeline vaccines. The Board 
also took account of the site’s five-year plan to target a carbon free 
manufacturing footprint. 

In December 2022, the Board approved the acquisition of Solus 
Biotech, a global leader in premium biotechnology-derived ingredients 
for beauty care and pharmaceuticals. The acquisition enhances our 
sustainable biotechnology capabilities as well as consolidating our 
position as a global leader in sustainable actives with a North Asian 
manufacturing and innovation facility. 

Monitoring and awareness 
The Board receives quarterly sustainability reports which include a 
balanced scorecard against our Commitment and enable the Board  
to challenge the pace of change and resource allocation. The Board 

monitored progress against the decarbonisation roadmaps  
produced for all sites in 2022 and oversaw the development of  
scope 3 reporting, including the quantification of downstream 
emissions fundamental to Croda and our customers, and reviewed  
and challenged progress in meeting the key milestones forming part  
of our sustainability commitments. 

During the year a number of site visits were undertaken by our 
Directors and in advance of these a sustainability and safety briefing 
note is prepared to enable the visiting Director to have a Group 
perspective as well as focusing on relevant areas of interest and also 
any areas of concern.

As part of its annual risk review, the Board confirmed that ‘Delivering 
sustainable solutions – Climate and Land Positive’ continues to be a 
principal risk. See pages 51 to 53 for more information on our risk 
management process and pages 59 to 67 for our TCFD disclosures 
including our approach to identifying and assessing climate-related  
risk and integration into the risk management framework.

The Board and Audit Committee reviewed how best to ensure  
that the business complies with relevant standards and that it has 
assurance on the accuracy and reliability of climate-related and other 
sustainability disclosures and approved the appointment of an external 
assurance partner to provide limited assurance of significant climate 
and gender diversity KPIs.

Ensuring the Board has sufficient knowledge and expertise 
The Board determined in the 2022 Board evaluation that sustainability 
was an area that it would benefit from further training given the ever 
evolving regulatory and reporting landscape. In July the Board received 
a sustainability training session focusing on its leadership role in 
ensuring Croda responds to ESG risks and opportunities and the need 
for enhanced transparency to satisfy our stakeholders. The sessions 
helped to improve understanding, explore Croda’s leadership response 
and priorities and enrich the Directors’ own thinking and perspective. 

Following a number of discussions, the Board established the 
Sustainability Oversight Committee. The Committee’s support will be 
fundamental as the Group seeks to manage the risks that come with 
climate change and to navigate through an increasingly stringent 
regulatory environment. Further details are set out in the Sustainability 
Oversight Committee report on pages 98 to 99.

Strategy review
The annual Board strategy review provides a focused opportunity to  
assess and review the Company’s strategy and ensure that it continues  
to be appropriate. In 2023, the theme was delivery in a challenging  
market environment.

In Consumer Care, discussions centred around the changing market 
environment and meeting the social and environmental transparency 
expectations of consumers. In Life Sciences, discussions focused on the 
evolution of the Pharma market towards emerging biopharma and genetic 
medicine modalities and the strategic focus on accelerating innovation and 
targeting complementary M&A. The Board also discussed the alignment  
of Croda’s organisational structure and talent management with future 
growth areas.

The day comprised presentations and break out groups led by members  
of the divisional teams, which encouraged more informal and interactive 
discussion and provided enhanced opportunity for Directors to share their 
external perspectives. A wrap up plenary session at the end of the day 
ensured that agreed actions and follow-up were captured.

Stakeholder engagement

Engaging with our stakeholders

S172 statement
Our Directors are bound by their duties under the Companies Act 
2006 to promote the long-term success of the Company for the 
benefit of shareholders as a whole, having regard to other key 
stakeholders. The Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Financial 
Statements and the Sustainability Impact Report help our 
stakeholders assess how effectively the Board, supported by  
the Executive Committee, senior managers and employees, 
promoted the success of Croda and had regard to the factors set 
out in Section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 during the year. 
Please see page 15 for our Section 172(1) statement.

The Board recognises that engagement is essential to understand 
what matters most to our stakeholders and the likely impact of 
any key decisions. Having consideration for our stakeholders 
aligns with our Purpose and our values, both of which guide  
us in our approach to delivering our strategic commitments and 
promoting the long term success of Croda for our shareholders 
and society.

Development of a greenfield manufacturing facility  
in China
The Board approved a significant investment in the development of a greenfield 
site at Guangzhou in China to help to transform our Fragrance and Beauty 
Actives businesses in the region. 

In considering the investment, the Board considered a number of key issues 
including the Group’s strategy to fast grow Asia, the importance of protecting the 
existing business and supporting its future growth. The investment would assist 
in the retention of key personnel and expertise as well as supporting the increasing 
customer demand for locally sourced ingredients. It also demonstrated Croda’s 
belief and commitment in the local market and community. The investment 
aligned with Croda’s sustainability strategy and safety priorities by providing a 
state-of-the-art manufacturing facility providing a sustainable, carbon neutral, 
efficient and safe manufacturing facility to support the development of innovative 
and sustainable ingredients.

Having regard to the interests of all stakeholders, the Board concluded that it was 
in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to approve the 
investment in the project.

Completion of the acquisition of Solus Biotech 
The acquisition of Solus Biotech, a global leader in premium, biotechnology-
derived active ingredients for beauty care and pharmaceuticals, was approved by 
the Board in 2022 and completed in July 2023 following receipt of unconditional 
approval from the South Korean regulatory authorities.

The Board considered the impact of the acquisition on our stakeholders and 
determined that it was in the best interests of our shareholders as a valuable 
addition to the Croda portfolio and increasing the opportunity to deliver against 
many of the Group’s strategic goals, including expansion of Life Sciences, 
strengthening of Consumer Care, fast grow Asia and the scaling of Biotech.  
For customers, it consolidated Croda’s position as a global leader in producing 
sustainable actives as well as building the Group’s biotech knowledge base with 
a portfolio of fermented (biotech derived) ingredients to meet consumer demand 
for more sustainable ingredients. It also strengthened our regional and local 
community presence. Increasing the Group’s IP and proprietary know-how would 
provide opportunities for learning and development for both existing employees 
and our new employees from Solus Biotech. 

The Board monitored the integration of the new business, with the immediate 
priorities being to establish Croda’s core values, particularly in relation to safety, 
and to integrate Solus’ natural ingredients into Croda’s global selling network. 
This was as well as supporting the Solus team with Croda’s technical and

New organisational model
The Board oversaw the introduction of a new organisational 
business model with a more agile, simplified matrix structure to 
provide a solid foundation for the next phase of Croda’s evolution. 
This will drive greater accountability and responsiveness to 
customers, empower decision-making down the organisation  
and facilitate the onboarding of new talent more effectively.

The Board was kept closely appraised as plans were developed 
and progressed so that it could continue to review and evaluate 
the appropriateness of the new structure for execution of the 
Group’s strategy and focus on innovation, sustainability and 
growth, as well as ensuring that the potentially unsettling change 
was introduced sensitively and professionally and in line with 
Croda’s values. 

In considering the needs of the Group’s stakeholders, the Board 
recognised that although some employees would be adversely 
impacted, the new structure was in the best interests of 
employees as a whole as it would provide greater clarity on 
accountabilities and responsibilities with quicker decision-making 
and increased empowerment. It also determined that customers 
would benefit from better service levels and increased innovation, 
and for shareholders, the new structure would lead to a more 
competitive business generating increased revenues and profit.

While it will take time to fully bed down and will inevitably continue 
to evolve, the Board is confident that the new organisational 
model will provide a strong and enduring base on which Croda 
can move forward.

New super refining project
In line with the Pharma strategy to be a leading partner for high 
purity excipients and bioprocessing aids, the Board approved 
investment in additional super refining capabilities at our site  
in Leek.

In reviewing the proposal, the Board considered a number of key 
areas, including an understanding of the new technology required 
and the approach to project management with safety a key 
consideration for employees and contractors. The Board also 
considered the commercial case and the extent to which the 
development of high purity low carbon products would increase 
Croda’s product value proposition across the business. 

In considering investment in the project, the Board considered  
the interests of Croda’s stakeholders and concluded that the 
development would create opportunities for jobs and career 
development and provide a sustainable, efficient and safe 
workplace for employees and the local community. The Board 
also determined that customers and consumers would benefit 
from the enhanced and more sustainable product offering and  
for shareholders the investment would support the development 
of Croda’s Pharma protein delivery strategy.

Engagement in 2023
In 2023 we met with 369 institutions across 870 interactions, with  
26 of our top 30 investors meeting management at least once. 
Engagement levels were slightly lower than 2022 given the absence of 
any large investor seminars, but nonetheless remained high and above

engaged in roadshows after both full year and half year results, as well 
as roadshows in the USA, Germany, and France, ensuring investors 
had the opportunity to engage with them face-to-face.

As the trading environment rapidly deteriorated in the second quarter, 
the Board took the decision to issue an unscheduled trading update  
to the market in June. This was followed by another update in October 
as operating conditions remained challenging. Following both of these 
updates there was significant engagement with investors, with 
management making themselves available to discuss the trading 
dynamics and performance. 

In addition to both in-person and virtual meetings we hosted a range  
of site visits during the year, aimed at enabling investors to build an 
understanding of our operations and what differentiates our business 
first hand. These visits included multiple visits to Rawcliffe Bridge in 
Yorkshire, visits to our Beauty Actives and F&F businesses in France, a 
large group visit to our Seed Enhancement business in the Netherlands

Common investor questions

1. When do you expect customer destocking to end? 
Through 2023 our largest customers have reduced their inventories, 
impacting our sales volumes. While customers cannot reduce inventory 
levels indefinitely, calling an end to destocking is challenging. In 
Consumer Care, customer inventory levels in 2023 were lower than in 
2022 and our sales volumes improved during the year. Inventory levels 
remained heightened in Crop Protection, with customer destocking 
continuing throughout the year, and demand remained weak in 
Industrial Specialties. 

2. Why have operating margins reduced and will they 
return to previous levels? 
Across the Group we operate 11 large, multi-sector manufacturing 
sites. Historically the markets in which we operate have traded 
somewhat independently of each other, however in 2023 volume 
weakness impacted all our markets. This resulted in utilisation levels 
falling with reduced fixed overhead coverage at these sites impacting 
our margins. While we would expect margins to recover as utilisation 
improves, significant margin expansion will require a broad-based 
improvement across all markets. 

3. What is the future growth profile for the Pharma 
business?
Our Pharma business is focused on fast-growth niches where 
innovation needs are high. We expect the Pharma business to continue 
growing, excluding the Covid-19 lipids, for which we do not anticipate 
any revenue in 2024. Longer-term, our Nucleic Acid Delivery platform, 
which enabled the roll out of Covid-19 vaccines, has a particularly 
exciting growth pipeline with customers developing new mRNA 
vaccines that we expect to start commercialising from 2025. 

4. What is a ‘normal’ level of capital expenditure for the 
business? 
Capital expenditure has been elevated in recent years as we redeploy 
the investment proceeds from the disposal of our PTIC business which 
completed in 2022. This includes our Pharma investment programme 
of £175m which was initiated in 2021 and will continue through 2025. 
Longer-term we anticipate capital expenditure to maintain existing 
assets and provide future growth to be 6-8% of sales. 

5. What is your policy with regard to returning capital to 
shareholders?
Our capital allocation policy prioritises organic capital investment, 
complemented by bolt-on acquisitions and technology investments. 
We aim to maintain a strong balance sheet with net debt of 1-2x 
EBITDA and to make regular returns to shareholders through our 
ordinary dividend, with a track record of more than 30 years of 
progressive dividend growth. Our preference in the current trading

The Board and culture

Our Purpose 
Our Purpose, Smart science to improve lives™, is made possible 
thanks to our distinctive values-led culture and the positive impact our 
activities and ingredients have on the environment and world around 
us. Our ambition is to become the most sustainable supplier of 
innovative ingredients and to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 
2030. Our culture governs how we interact with our customers, how 
we work with each other, and guides our relationships with our 
stakeholders. Our customer-focused values of being Responsible, 
Innovative and Together are integral to the way we behave individually 
and collectively and to the way we do business. The Board seeks to 
continually reinforce these values so that the right behaviours cascade 
throughout the organisation, ensuring our culture and behaviours drive 
what we do.

The Board is responsible for assessing, monitoring and promoting our 
culture and understands the importance of setting the right tone from 
the top. The importance of personal traits that reflect Croda’s values 
and culture are a key part of the selection criteria when appointing a 
new Non-Executive Director or, as was the case this year, a new Chair. 
See page 96 for more information on the Chair selection process. 

Monitoring our culture
Great emphasis is placed by the Board on ensuring that our culture  
is aligned to our Purpose, values and strategy and one of the Board’s 
key focus areas is to monitor and assess culture across the Group. 
Although culture is not tangible and cannot be assessed by metrics 
alone, the Board uses multiple information sources and KPIs to help to 
judge and assess how our culture is embedded in the organisation, 
how it shows across employee sentiment, and how it is observed in 
behaviours and trends. These include:

•  Regular meetings with members of the Executive Committee  

and management.

•  Employee survey results and response rates.
•  Feedback from employee engagement. 
•  Quarterly safety and employee wellbeing data. 
•  Feedback from shareholders.
•  Employee retention rates.
•  Diversity and inclusion metrics – such as gender balance,  
balanced shortlists, diversity on development programmes.

•  Ethics and whistleblowing reports.

The Board monitors the results and response rates of the regular pulse 
surveys undertaken during the year by all our employees across the 
Group. Each survey has a focus on particular aspects of culture, for 
example, Croda being a ‘Great place to work’. In 2023 the surveys 
mirrored those of the previous year so that progress on regional and 
local actions to improve the workplace and employee experience could 
be assessed. 

During the year the Board had oversight of initiatives focused on 
facilitating inclusion such as the Solaris programme which supports the 
pipeline of talent from underrepresented groups, including those from 
an ethnic minority. Steve Foots gave a presentation at a Solaris alumni 
session which prompted views from different perspectives and 
increased the understanding of challenges faced by minority groups. 

As a business, we run a number of development programmes for high 
performing and high potential senior colleagues. The senior leader 
mentoring programme enables the Directors and Executive Committee 
members to interact directly with a diverse group of talent from a range 
of functions across the business and support them in their professional 
growth through guidance, support and knowledge transfer. During the 
year, separate sessions of the Group’s Leadership Development 
Group, for high performing and high potential senior colleagues, were 
attended by Steve Foots and Nawal Ouzren. Steve attended a session 
in San Francisco and Nawal attended Ashridge Business School for a 

84

Croda International Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2023

module on Leading with impact and authenticity. Nawal took part in 
group discussions, a Q&A and joined the group for dinner which 
provided her with the opportunity to provide her insights and 
experiences in senior leadership roles and a perspective from the 
Boardroom. A session of the Women Lead Affinity Group in the USA 
was attended by Anita Frew which enabled her to share her experience 
and perspectives as a successful female leader. As well as benefitting 
the participants, these interactions help the Directors to build 
relationships with our highest potential employees and leaders. The 
Board remains engaged in the furtherance of diversity and inclusion 
initiatives across the business.

In June, Croda was included in the Sunday Times Best Places to Work 
following a third-party assessment of culture and workplace experience 
which concluded that Croda reflected good practice for employee 
engagement and wellbeing in the workplace. The nationwide survey 
honours and celebrates Britain’s top employers and is a clear 
representation of the positive experience of our employees and 
Croda’s culture and values. 

Listening to our employees
In view of Croda’s global operations, the Board decided that the most 
effective way of organising its engagement with employees was to 
continue to share the responsibility among all Non-Executive Directors 
and to utilise the variety of mechanisms in place. The Board is 
comfortable that it can continue to rely on alternative methods to 
engage with employees, rather than one of the three methods outlined 
in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.

In addition to formal Board meetings, during the year our Non-
Executive Directors visited operational sites in India, Singapore, Spain, 
France, Denmark, and the USA in order to better understand the 
Group’s businesses and operations in these countries. These visits 
allow the Directors to observe the Group’s operations in action, 
reinforce their knowledge and enable them to experience at first hand 
the culture of the Group. As part of these visits, wherever possible,  
the visiting Director leads workforce engagement sessions including 
listening groups and town halls with a diverse range of employees.  
A wide range of topics are discussed including those that are particular 
to the site and those of a more business and strategic nature. Topics 
which arose during the year included: knowledge management, safety, 
local business opportunities, organisational effectiveness, digitisation 
and data, human performance initiatives, serving customers and 
current trading. Feedback is then provided to the Board on discussions 
held and the Board’s response on key themes and insights is in turn 
relayed back to those employees who attended thereby creating a 
feedback loop between the Board and employees. The Company 
Secretary takes responsibility for any actions requiring follow up. 
Perspectives from employees are taken into account in decision-
making. For example, employee feedback regarding challenges around 
operational effectiveness within a matrix structure was a key factor in 
the development of the Group’s new organisational model. See page 
81 for more details.

As well as individual site visits, during the year the Board undertook a 
safety focused visit to our site at Leek which included discussions with 
the site management team, process engineers and safety managers. 
Extensive construction activities were underway at the time of the visit 
which enabled the Board to understand the additional process safety 
risks and protocols in place. In February the Board held an informal 
lunch with the Product Safety and Regulatory Affairs team at the 
Cowick office. As well as meeting the team, this provided the Board 
with key insights into the areas of innovation, ingredient defence and 
global registrations as well enabling a better understanding of the key 
challenges faced by the team.

Governance of a site visit
Where – the CEO and Company Secretary identify relevant sites that 
are of particular interest in terms of strategic focus, organic 
development or any specific issues. The aim is for the Board to gain 
insight into as wide a range of operations and locations as possible. 

Itinerary – detailed itineraries and agendas are planned and agreed 
well in advance with the local site management teams to ensure 
maximum benefit is derived out of the time available. In advance of the 
visit, Directors receive briefings on safety, sustainability and any other 
relevant matters specific to the site. 

Visit – Directors meet with the local management teams and receive 
presentations on a variety of topics, including safety, strategy, 
sustainability, business and financial performance, distribution and 

marketing. At operational sites, Directors undertake a tour which 
enables direct engagement with process engineers, operators and 
research scientists on the ground. An informal dinner is held to facilitate 
more relaxed interaction with the local team. Workforce engagement 
sessions are usually included and, where possible, customer meetings 
are also organised. 

Feedback – Directors present feedback of their observations to the 
Board and the Company Secretary takes responsibility for ensuring 
that any follow up actions are allocated to individuals with outcomes 
reported to the Board. Feedback from the Board on observations 
following employee engagement sessions is given to employees  
who attended.

Board leadership

The Company is led by an effective and entrepreneurial Board, whose 
role is to promote the long-term sustainable success of the Company, 
generating value for shareholders and contributing to wider society. 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the overall leadership of the 
Group. In this role, it oversees the development and delivery of a clear 
Group strategy in line with our Purpose.

At the date of this report, the Board comprises 11 Directors: the  
Chair; the Group Chief Executive; the Chief Financial Officer; seven 
independent Non-Executive Directors, including from 1 February 2024, 
the Chair designate; and one non-independent Non-Executive Director, 
who was the Company’s Chief Technology Officer until his retirement  
in 2017. The size of the Board allows time for constructive debate  
and challenge on key elements of the Company’s performance  
and strategic projects and enables all Directors’ views to be heard.  
It monitors operational and financial performance against agreed goals 
and objectives and ensures that appropriate controls and systems exist 
to manage risk and that there are the necessary financial resources 
and people with the necessary skills to achieve the strategic goals the 
Board has set. The Non-Executive Directors have a broad range of 
business, financial and international skills and experience, which 
provide appropriate balance and diversity of thought. The Executive 
Directors use the specific areas of expertise of the Non-Executive 
Directors as a source of ideas, experience, as well as challenge when 
developing strategic plans. The Directors’ biographical details are on 
pages 72 to 73. The Board maintains a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its approval. These matters include approving the  
Group’s strategy and budget, material corporate transactions and the 
authorisation of capital expenditure above delegated authority limits. 
They also include matters relating to risk management, approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts, dividends, appointing new Directors  
and significant communications to shareholders. The full schedule  
of matters reserved for the Board can be found in the governance 
section at www.croda.com.

The Board discharges some of its responsibilities directly and others 
through its Committees, details of which can be found on page 87.  
In recognition of the importance of sustainability in achieving our 
Purpose and delivering our strategy as well as the growing and 
increasingly complex regulatory landscape, in 2023 the Board decided 
to establish a Sustainability Oversight Committee. Further details of the 
role of the Sustainability Oversight Committee are on pages 98 to 99.

Execution of the strategy and day-to-day management of the 
Company’s business is delegated to the Executive Committee, and 
subsequently to senior leadership teams where relevant, with the 
Board retaining responsibility for overseeing, guiding and holding 
management to account. In addition to its monthly scheduled 
meetings, the Board met and heard from the Executive Committee 
members, senior management and a wider range of colleagues on a 
regular basis. Contributions from the Executive Committee members 
can be found throughout this report.

The terms of reference for each Board Committee can be found at 
www.croda.com.

Division of responsibilities 

Chair

culture of openness and debate and effective communication between 
the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. She creates an 
environment at Board meetings in which all Directors are able to 
contribute to discussions and feel comfortable in engaging in healthy 
debate and constructive challenge.

Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director provides a sounding board for the 
Chair and acts as an intermediary for the Non-Executive Directors,

communication through the Chair or Executive Directors has not been 
successful or where it may not seem appropriate. During the year, our 
Senior Independent Director played a critical role in leading the search 
for our new Chair. 

Independent Non-Executive Directors
The role of the independent Non-Executive Directors is central to an 
effective and accountable Board structure as they provide strategic 
and specialist guidance together with effective governance. They 
constructively challenge the Executive Directors and scrutinise the 
performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives 
and ensure all stakeholder views are considered.

Non-independent Non-Executive Director
Having served Croda for 34 years, the latter six of which were as a 
member of the Board, Keith Layden is not considered independent. 
However, because of his experience, Keith contributes strongly to the 
Board’s culture and personality, and adds unique and valuable insight 
as well as constructive challenge to Board discussions, in particular in 
relation to innovation and R&D.

Group Chief Executive 
The Group Chief Executive has day-to-day responsibility for the 
effective management of the Group’s business and for ensuring that 
Board decisions are implemented. He plays a key role in devising and 
reviewing Group strategies for discussion and approval by the Board. 
The Group Chief Executive is tasked with providing regular reports to 
the Board.

Chief Financial Officer
The role of Chief Financial Officer is to bring a commercial and  
financial perspective to the Boardroom. Working with the Group Chief 
Executive, she is responsible for the leadership and management of 
the Company according to the strategic direction set by the Board. 
She leads the global finance function and oversees the relationship  
with the investment community. 

Group General Counsel and Company Secretary
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary is Secretary to 
the Board and its Committees. He works closely with the Chair in the 
formulation of meeting agendas and annual agenda programmes. He 
ensures that Board procedures are complied with and also advises on

Croda complies with the Financial Reporting Council’s Reporting Code 
in having experienced Non-Executive Directors who represent a source 
of advice, strong judgement and challenge to the Executive Directors. 
At present there are nine such Directors, including the Chair, the Chair 
designate and the Senior Independent Director, each of whom has 
significant commercial experience. Details of their experience is on 
pages 72 to 73. 

The independence of the Non-Executive Directors is kept under  
review to ensure continuing independence and objective judgement. 
The Chair was independent upon her appointment in 2015 and both 
the Chair as head of the Board and the Chief Executive as head of 
executive management have clearly defined roles. Further information 
on their roles is included on page 86. With the exception of Keith 
Layden, the Board considers that all Non-Executive Directors who 
served during the year are independent in character and judgement, 
with no relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, their judgement. Keith Layden is not considered 
independent, having served as the Company’s Chief Technology 
Officer prior to retirement from the Company and appointment as  
a Non-Executive Director in May 2017. 

Director induction
New Non-Executive Directors receive a tailored induction that focuses 
on the Group’s culture and values, stakeholders, strategy, structure, 
operations and governance. The aim is to enable a new Director to 
integrate into the Board as quickly as possible so that they are able to 
contribute to business and strategy discussions and provide effective 
challenge. Induction programmes are developed by the Company 
Secretary and discussions start well in advance of the appointment 
date to tailor the experience to the existing knowledge and experience 
and include meetings with members of the Board and Executive 
Committee, key senior managers and the Group’s audit partner  
and other key advisers. A schedule of country and site visits is also 
arranged which enables a new Director to gain insight into business 
operations and culture. See page 97 for further information on Chris 
Good’s induction programme this year and the planned induction for 
Danuta Gray for her role as Chair of Croda. 

All new Directors are given access to our electronic Board papers 
which provide easy and immediate access to key documents including 
previous Board and Committee papers; recent reports from the 
external auditor; the Group’s risk register and Schedule of Principal

Risks; the latest budget and strategic plan; recent sell-side analyst 
reports and feedback from our stakeholder engagement programmes; 
information on our sustainability initiatives; matters reserved for the 
Board; the Committee terms of reference and other key policies. 

Training 
All Directors keep their knowledge and skills up to date and include 
training discussions with the Chair in their annual performance reviews. 
As required, professional advisers are invited to provide in-depth 
updates and the Board also receives updates on market trends  
and environmental, technological and social considerations when 
appropriate. The Company Secretary provides regular updates to the 
Board and its Committees on regulatory and corporate governance 
matters and Directors receive training on their duties under Section 
172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 as part of their induction process 
from the Group’s corporate lawyers. All Directors participate in online 
compliance training courses as required, including competition law and 
anti-bribery and corruption. At induction, and as requirements change, 
training is provided on governance, legal and regulatory matters and 
specific training is provided when requested by the Directors. In June, 
the Board attended a site safety training day at Leek where the 
Group’s safety values were reiterated and the Board was able to 
engage with both process safety protocols and the behavioural safety 
of our employees and contractors. In July, the Sustainability team 
provided the Board with a training session which focused on the 
leadership role the Board has in ensuring that Croda responds to  
social and environmental risks. See page 77 for further information.  
To remain up to date with wider issues the Directors are encouraged  
to participate in events hosted by external organisations to develop 
broader perspectives. For example, during the year Chris Good 
attended a sustainability event hosted by Critical Eye to enhance  
his knowledge in this area.

Board evaluation 
The Board undertakes a formal review of its performance and that of its 
Committees each year and, in line with our three-year cycle, this year’s 
review was carried out by an external facilitator. Heidrick & Struggles 
were appointed and were able to build upon their existing knowledge 
of Croda and its Board, following their external review in 2020. The 
process included virtual interviews with all Board members and 
selected executives, an anonymous online questionnaire, in-person 
observations of Board and Committee meetings, and a review of

Board evaluation 

The Board undertakes a formal review of its performance and that of its 

Committees each year and, in line with our three-year cycle, this year’s 

review was carried out by an external facilitator. Heidrick & Struggles 

were appointed and were able to build upon their existing knowledge 

All new Directors are given access to our electronic Board papers 

of Croda and its Board, following their external review in 2020. The 

which provide easy and immediate access to key documents including 

process included virtual interviews with all Board members and 

previous Board and Committee papers; recent reports from the 

selected executives, an anonymous online questionnaire, in-person 

external auditor; the Group’s risk register and Schedule of Principal 

observations of Board and Committee meetings, and a review of 

relevant documents. Heidrick & Struggles presented a review of their 
findings to the Board at its December meeting highlighting the areas  
of greatest effectiveness as well as areas for development. See below 
for more information on this year’s externally facilitated review. 

The Chair and Non-Executive Directors met without the Executive 
Directors present to allow an additional opportunity to discuss areas 
relevant to the operation of the Board. The Non-Executive Directors 
also met on their own, without the Chair.

The Senior Independent Director met with the Chair to provide 
feedback on her performance following discussions with the other 
Non-Executive Directors and the Executive management to gather their 
views. It was agreed that the Chair remained dedicated to her role and 
that she creates a culture of trust, openness and debate, facilitating an 
atmosphere of challenge whilst encouraging the effective contribution 
of all Board members. 

The Chair met and provided feedback to each Non-Executive Director 
and the Executive Directors. Following these discussions, the Chair 
was satisfied that all the Directors continued to be effective and 
demonstrate commitment to the role, including having time to attend  
all necessary meetings and to carry out all their duties. 

Conflicts of interest
The Board has an established process in place for reviewing and 
monitoring potential conflicts of interests. The Company’s Articles of 
Association allow the non-conflicted members of the Board to 
authorise an actual or potential conflict situation. Directors holding 
significant commitments outside the Company are required to disclose 
them prior to appointment and on an ongoing basis when there are 
any changes. Actual and potential conflicts of interest are included  
on a register which is maintained by the Company Secretary and 
reviewed annually.

During the year the Chair and the Company Secretary discussed  
any potential or perceived conflict of interest with John Ramsay’s 
directorship of DSM/Firmenich following their merger in 2023, and 
concluded that no conflict of interest existed but that this would be 

kept under review. As a precaution, the Board approved any situational 
conflict that may arise.

During the appointment of any new Non-Executive Directors other 
commitments are taken into account, in addition to whether or not  
a conflict or potential conflict would exist. Details of the professional 
commitments of the Non-Executive Directors are included in their 
biographies on pages 72 to 73. The Board is satisfied that these  
do not interfere or conflict with the performance of their duties for  
the Company. 

Board support 
Each Director has access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. Where necessary, the Directors may take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. Board papers are 
made available electronically one week in advance of meetings, which 
ensures that each Director has the time and resources to fulfil their 
duties. A resource centre within the web portal provides access to 
useful information about the Group, including corporate governance 
materials, finance and strategy information, Group policies and 
procedures, and information on topics such as risk and insurance. 
In order to build and increase Non-Executive Directors’ familiarity with, 
and understanding of, the Group’s people, businesses and markets, 
senior managers regularly make presentations at Board meetings. 

Board re-election 
Following the individual performance assessments, the Board is 
satisfied that each Director continues to perform effectively, allocates 
sufficient time for their duties and remains fully committed to their role. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive Directors 
can be viewed at www.croda.com. Contracts for Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors can be inspected during normal business 
hours at the Company’s registered office by contacting the Company 
Secretary and will also be available for inspection at the AGM. The 
Directors, with the exception of Anita Frew, will be proposed for 
election and re-election at the AGM on 24 April 2024 and details  
are in the Notice of Meeting.

Board evaluation 

Outcome
Overall the evaluation concluded that the Board was highly 
effective with many signature strengths. 

Strengths
Board dynamics – the Board is open, collegiate, collaborative, 
approachable, supportive and interested. Egos are noticeably 
absent and there is a high degree of trust with the Board seen as 
‘one’ with good relationships amongst the Directors and with the 
executive team. A strong onboarding process has led to the 
successful integration of new Directors.

Composition – the Board possesses comprehensive coverage 
across all markets and segments of Croda’s businesses with the 
newest Board members bringing a breadth of experience and 
relevant expertise. The composition of the Board is aligned with 
strategy. There has also been an improvement in diversity, both in 
terms of gender and ethnicity as well as background. Overall the 
Board is seen as having the skills and backgrounds to effectively 
steer strategic directions. 

Commitment – all Board members are personally committed to 
Croda’s success and dedicate time outside the Boardroom, for 

example, site visits, sub-committee membership and specialist 
conversations, as needed. Board members come well prepared 
for meetings, aided by a focused agenda and timely issued  
Board packs.

Opportunities and future areas of focus 
Accountability – although there is a high level of challenge  
to executives, this could be greater and the inclusion of more 
data-driven perspectives in Board presentations would enhance 
the evaluation of strategic proposals put forward by the 
executives. Increased use of outside-in perspectives would also 
help to facilitate challenge and bring fresh perspectives to guide 
effective decision-making. 

Culture – whilst recognising the importance and strengths of 
Croda’s culture, consideration should be given to the potential 
need to explore which aspects can be evolved to support the 
business’ next phase of growth. 

Succession pipeline – there is opportunity for the Board to 
place more regular emphasis on Croda’s long-term succession 
and talent pipeline, increasing the time spent on wider executive 
succession as well as regular review of capabilities, skills and 
leadership skills.

Audit, risk and internal control

Fair, balanced and understandable 
To assist the Board in determining whether the Annual Report was  
fair, balanced and understandable, the annual report team prepared  
a Board paper that, amongst other things, reviewed the process of 
preparation of the report, the controls in place to ensure consistency 
and reliability of the underlying information, identified the material 
positive and negative matters referred to in the report to ensure 
balanced content and provided details of the level of senior oversight  
of the content of the report.

The Annual Report and Accounts process is designed to give the 
Board enough time to assess whether it is fair, balanced and 
understandable, as required by the Code. The key themes and 
messages to be included in the Annual Report and Accounts are 
considered by the Board early in the process.

The Board considered whether the Annual Report and Accounts 
contained the necessary information for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy. 
The Directors received a full draft of the Annual Report and provided 
feedback. This review ensures that each Director has an opportunity to 
highlight any areas requiring further clarity as well as suggesting issues 
and areas that were not adequately covered or on which the report 
may have placed too much emphasis.

The key messages in the narrative in the Strategic Report and 
Governance sections of the Annual Report and Accounts were 
reviewed to ensure they were consistent with the financial reporting 
contained in the financial statements. The Board reviewed the new and 
amended APM definitions made during the year and believed that clear 
explanations had been provided for the KPIs.

The Board reviewed whether the Annual Report and Accounts 
disclosed the successes and the challenges that had been faced in  
the period and that the narrative and analysis effectively balanced the 
information needs and interests of each of our key stakeholder groups. 
In particular, the Board had regard to the current macroeconomic and 
geopolitical issues and the potential for wider impact alongside 
continued inflationary pressures.

The framework and layout were considered to be clear and coherent, 
with a consistent tone throughout and clearly signposted linkage 
between all sections, in a manner that reflected a comprehensive 
narrative and highlighted the key messages appropriately throughout. 

Following this assessment, the Board was of the opinion that the 2023 
Annual Report and Accounts are representative of the year and present 
a fair, balanced and understandable overview, providing the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess the Group’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.

Risk management and internal control
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for ensuring the 
maintenance of a sound system of internal controls and risk 
management, in accordance with the guidance set out in the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial Business Reporting 2014, and in the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The Board receives updates on principal 
risks and risk appetite on an annual basis.

Transparent policies and procedures 
Executive management have established an organisational structure 
with clear operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated 
authority which was reviewed by the Board (page 87). In particular, 
there are clear procedures and defined authorities for the following:

Financial reporting and financial statements review
Policies and procedures governing the financial reporting process and 
preparation of the financial statements are owned by the Chief Financial 
Officer and clearly and transparently communicated through the Group 
Policies system. In order to assess the financial statements, the Audit 
Committee regularly reviews reports from members of the finance team 
and the external auditor who is invited to attend the Committee’s 
meetings. When conducting its review the Committee considers 
material accounting assumptions and estimates made by 
management, any significant judgements or key audit matters identified 
by the auditor (pages 143 to 145), compliance with relevant accounting 
standards and other regulatory reporting requirements, including the 
2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, and the accounting policies 
and procedures applied (pages 101 to 103).

Internal audit function
The internal audit function is a key element of the Group’s corporate 
governance framework. Its role is to provide independent and objective 
assurance, advice and insight on governance, risk management and 
internal controls to the Board and Audit Committee and the Group.  
It supports the Group’s strategy and objectives by evaluating and 
assessing the effectiveness of risk management systems, business 
policies and procedures, system and key internal controls. In reporting 
on their reviews, internal audit makes recommendations to address 
issues and improve processes. Once recommendations are agreed 
with management, the internal audit function monitors their 
implementation and reports to the Audit Committee on progress at 
every meeting. See pages 101 to 103 of the Audit Committee report.

Following this assessment, the Board was of the opinion that the 2023 

Annual Report and Accounts are representative of the year and present 

a fair, balanced and understandable overview, providing the necessary 

information for shareholders to assess the Group’s position, 

performance, business model and strategy.

Capital investment
The Investment and Performance Committee (a sub-committee of the 
Executive Committee) operates a clearly defined capital expenditure 
process including detailed business plan appraisal, risk analysis and 
authorisation. The Global Capital Project Director has developed  
a framework for managing major capital expenditure, and post-
investment review processes are completed by internal audit  
(at the Audit Committee’s request).

Business risk management 
As described on page 51 the Executive Committee has established  
an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing emerging 
and principal risks. The Board receives updates on principal risks and 
risk appetite on an annual basis and the Audit Committee receives 
reports from internal audit on the effectiveness of mitigating controls  
in place over selected principal risks at each meeting. The Group Risk 
Committee, a sub-committee of the Executive Committee (page 87), 
meets on a quarterly basis to monitor and review both current and 
emerging risks.

Internal controls
There is a documented framework of required internal controls for 
business processes, IT, safety, quality and compliance, which form 
part of our business as usual activities and which are documented  
in controls manuals. Policies governing the internal controls are 
documented in the Group Policies system, which is available online  
to all employees, and each Group policy is owned by a member of the 
Executive Committee. Confirmation that the controls are being adhered 
to is the responsibility of managers, who together with their teams 
complete an annual self-assessment process against all controls which 
provides a snapshot of the control environment at the start of the year. 
Compliance with controls is tested by the internal audit team as part of 
their annual plan of work approved by the Audit Committee each year, 
as well as being tested by other internal assurance providers; see page 
103 for more information.

The Board discharged its responsibility for monitoring the operational 
effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems 
throughout the year using a process which involved:

•  Delegation of review of systems of risk management and internal 
control to the Audit Committee, whose activities are described in 
detail on pages 100 to 105.

•  Receipt of written confirmations from senior management.
•  Board review of the report on significant control weaknesses. 
•  Annual review of risk appetite statements and principal risks  

(page 51).

These processes have been in place for the full financial year up to the 
date on which the financial statements were approved by the Board. 
The systems are designed to mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.

For the full statement of Directors’ responsibilities see  
page 138.

Nomination Committee report

Report of the Nomination Committee

I am pleased to present the Nomination Committee report for the year 
ended 31 December 2023.

Main activities and priorities in 2023

Board changes
A key focus in 2023 was the search for a new Chair to succeed  
me when I step down at the conclusion of this year’s AGM. After  
a comprehensive selection process led by the Senior Independent 
Director, the Board decided to appoint Danuta Gray to succeed me 
and to help steer Croda through this next phase. Danuta joined the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director in February and will be appointed 
as Chair at the conclusion of the AGM in April 2024. The selection 
process was led by Jacqui Ferguson in her capacity as Senior 
Independent Director with the whole Board engaged in the process 
throughout. The independent specialist executive search consultant 
Egon Zehnder (EZ) was appointed to assist the Committee with the 
process. EZ is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for 
Executive Search Firms, and has no other connection with Croda  
or its individual Directors. See page 96 for further information on the 
Chair selection process. 

In April, we welcomed Chris Good to the Board as an independent 
Non-Executive Director. Chris’s deep understanding of the consumer 
care industry and in particular his insights into beauty care markets and 
consumers are of great value to Croda and the Board. His appointment 
strengthens the consumer care knowledge and experience around the 
Board table and supports Croda’s continued transition to a pure play 
Consumer Care and Life Sciences business. Helena Ganczakowski 
retired from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM in April and on 
behalf of the Committee and the Board I would like to thank Helena  
for her outstanding contribution to the Board, both as Remuneration 
Committee Chair and Senior Independent Director, for her insight and 
support. Jacqui Ferguson has taken on the role of Senior Independent 
Director, in addition to her role as Remuneration Committee Chair.

In December we announced that our CFO, Louisa Burdett, would be 
leaving Croda in June 2024 having accepted another role as CFO. We 
are sorry that Louisa is leaving but she has our very best wishes when 
she departs this summer. A search for her replacement is underway.

The process for Board appointments is led by the Nomination 
Committee which makes recommendations to the Board for approval. 
It is the Nomination Committee’s responsibility to keep Board 
composition under review, including Director independence and 
tenure. During the year the Committee reviewed the composition and 
skills of the Board using the skills matrix on page 95 as well as taking 
into account recent and likely future Board changes. Following review, 
it decided to initiate a search for an additional Non-Executive Director 
with recent and relevant financial experience to further strengthen the 
composition of the Audit Committee. The Committee is using an 
external search firm to assist in this process and we will report on the 
outcome of this process in due course. 

Keith Layden’s and my own appointment were considered by the 
Committee. My term was extended up to the 2024 AGM and Keith’s 
for another year. This is in line with the Nomination Committee policy 
that once a Non-Executive Director has served six years, any extension 
to their term is on a year by year basis. 

“This year the Committee spent significant 
time searching for a new Chair of the

Diversity and inclusion
As a global organisation, we aim to recruit talented people that reflect 
the diverse nature of the countries in which we operate. We value the 
unique contributions that each employee brings to our business, and 
we are committed to creating an inclusive work environment where all 
our employees can fulfil their full potential. Diversity at Board level and 
throughout the organisation provides a broad range of perspectives, 
supporting the achievement of our strategy and contributing to our 
success and the Board views all aspects of diversity as important 
considerations when reviewing its composition. Our Board Diversity 
Policy, a copy of which is available in the corporate governance  
section at www.croda.com, is reviewed regularly and confirms our 
commitment to meeting or exceeding the target set by the FTSE 
Women Leaders and Parker reviews and our current Board 
composition exceeds the targets recommended. 

We are also pleased to report on the new Board diversity targets 
introduced in the Listing Rules in 2022. Our chosen reference date  
is 31 December 2023 and, as at that date, the Company had met  
all three of the Board diversity targets of having 40% women on the 
Board, at least one ethnic minority director on the Board and having  
a woman in at least one senior Board role. We exceed all these 
requirements with a fully gender balanced Board, two Board members 
from ethnic minority backgrounds and three women in the senior 
Board positions of Chair, Senior Independent Director and Chief 
Financial Officer. Since the reference date, Danuta Gray was appointed 
to the Board as Chair designate and following Danuta’s appointment, 
we continue to meet all three of the new Board diversity targets. We 
have not set any targets for senior management, but this is something 
we will be considering. In line with the new Listing Rule disclosure 
requirements, more detailed information relating to the gender and 
ethnic diversity of Croda’s Board and Executive Committee can be 
found in the tables on page 94. 

As at 31 December 2023, the gender balance of the Executive 
Committee and senior management teams (direct reports to the 
Executive Committee) stood at 39% female. We continued to increase 
the diversity of our leaders below Board and Executive Committee 
level. 40% of our Senior Leadership Group (comprising 36 of our most 
senior employees) are female, with the Senior Leadership Group made 
up of employees across 12 nationalities. While appointments at all 
levels will continue to be made based on skill and ability, all forms of 
diversity are key to ensuring that we have the right mix of backgrounds, 
knowledge and experience to meet our future business needs. 
Although there continues to be work to do to create further diversity 
and gender balance in the underlying management teams, diversity 
and inclusion is central to succession planning discussions and critical 
to the long-term sustainable success of our business. 

Succession planning
The Committee and the Board oversaw the introduction of a new 
Group organisational structure with all regional teams reporting into 
Consumer Care and Life Sciences to simplify business processes  
and ways of working. Some changes were made to the Executive 
Committee with the team reducing from ten to eight as regional  
delivery and central research were absorbed into each business. 
Sandra Breene was appointed as President Consumer Care and 
Daniele Piergentili continued in his role as President Life Sciences. 

Anthony Fitzpatrick will take on the expanded role of President 
Corporate Development and Industrial Specialties, Mark Robinson will 
continue in his role as President Operations and Michelle Lydon will 
continue as President Human Resources. Tom Brophy, our Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary, was also appointed as 
President Sustainability. The restructuring also provided opportunities 
in the underlying management teams for several individuals identified 
through the organisation’s review of talent and succession process.

Director induction
All Directors receive a comprehensive induction programme. This is 
tailored through discussion with the Chair and the Company Secretary 
and considers existing expertise and any Committee roles. All new 
Directors are given access to our electronic Board papers which 
provide easy access to key documents. Chris Good joined the Board 
in April and his induction started immediately to ensure that he had an 
understanding of our Purpose, the environment in which we operate 
and our core business activities as soon as possible. Further 
information on Chris’ induction programme is on page 97. During 2024 
the Company Secretary will be working closely with Danuta Gray on a 
comprehensive induction programme for her role as Chair of Croda. 

Other activities of the Committee 
The Committee reviewed the time commitment of the Non-Executive 
Directors which is assessed before appointment and on an annual 
basis thereafter. The Committee was satisfied that all the Non-
Executive Directors remain able to commit the required time for  
the proper performance of their duties. 

The Committee considered and concluded that, except for Keith 
Layden, all the Non-Executive Directors continue to fulfil the criteria  
of independence. As Keith was formerly an Executive Director of the 
Company, he is not currently considered to be independent.

This year’s annual Committee evaluation was externally facilitated by 
Heidrick & Struggles who have no other connection with the Company 
or individual Directors. The evaluation confirmed that the Nomination 
Committee was effective and well led with strong operating 
mechanisms. The very thorough and robust process led by the Senior 
Independent Director to find a successor for the current Chair was 
highlighted. See page 89 for further information on this year’s Board 
evaluation and page 96 for the Chair selection process. 

Looking ahead, the focus will be on the handover and transition  
to Danuta as the new Chair and to ensure an effective induction 
programme to support this. We will continue with the search process 
for a new CFO and a Non-Executive Director to ensure that the Board 
maintains an appropriate balance of skills, experience, knowledge  
and diversity.

Nomination Committee report continued

Chair of the Board selection process

Background
As Dame Anita Frew approached her ninth year on the Board,  
in 2023 a search commenced for her successor. Following  
a selection process involving five search firms, the Company 
appointed Egon Zehnder (EZ), an independent specialist 
executive search consultant to assist with the process. EZ has  
no other connection with the Company and has signed up to the 
diversity Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms. 
Helena Ganczakowski as the Senior Independent Director and 
subsequently Jacqui Ferguson who succeeded Helena as Senior 
Independent Director, led the process. 

Board discussion
Following individual discussions by EZ with each Board member, 
a set of objective criteria were defined, including the experience, 
leadership competencies and personal and cultural attributes 
required to fulfil the role of Chair and meet the requirements of 
Croda in the future.

Nomination Committee process
The Nomination Committee appointed a sub-committee, 
comprising Helena Ganczakowski, Jacqui Ferguson, Roberto 
Cirillo, Keith Layden and John Ramsay, to focus on the search 
and selection process. The sub-committee met regularly and 
reported back to the Nomination Committee.

Based on the role specification and having regard to the Board 
Diversity Policy, a longlist of potential candidates, from both the 
UK and overseas, was identified. Following an evaluation in 
relation to the assessment framework of potential, personality, 
leadership and experiential fit, seven candidates were selected  
for stage one interviews with EZ and Helena and Jacqui.  
Five candidates were then invited to proceed to a stage two 
interview with the rest of the members of the sub-committee.

Two final candidates were then invited to proceed to stage  
three of the selection process, which included interviews with 
Non-Executive and Executive Directors, the Chair and the 
President Human Resources. The candidates also visited 
Croda’s offices and laboratories in Cowick where the candidates 
met with members of the Executive Committee and their senior 
teams, enabling them to gain first hand insight into Croda and  
its culture. 

Nomination Committee and Board approval
Following detailed due diligence and feedback carried out by  
the Nomination Committee, it was determined that Danuta Gray 
possessed the required skills and experience to carry out the role 
and that she would bring sound leadership to Croda. She was 
considered the ideal candidate to promote the long term success 
of the Company for the benefit of all stakeholders and the Board 
approved her appointment as a Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 1 February 2024 prior to becoming Chair at the conclusion of 
the AGM in April 2024.

“I am delighted that the comprehensive 
search process for our next Chair has 
resulted in the appointment of Danuta. 
Danuta is a highly experienced Non-
Executive Director and Chair with a 
deep understanding of growing 
consumer focused and high 
technology businesses in international 
markets. She has served on the 
Boards of a variety of listed companies 
and her depth of Boardroom 
experience and strong understanding 
of UK governance will be of enormous 
benefit to Croda.”

Croda induction

Chris Good’s induction
The Company provides new Directors with a comprehensive 
induction programme tailored to their experience, background 
and relevant Committee membership. 

Chris Good joined the Board in April and his induction started 
immediately. He met with our corporate advisers and received 
briefings on the role and responsibilities of being a UK listed 
Company Director and matters relevant to his Committee roles. 
New Directors are encouraged to engage with the business and 
Chris met and heard from members of the Executive Committee 
and their teams responsible for the delivery of the Group’s 
strategy and key business operations. This enabled him to gain a 
deeper understanding of our Purpose, the environment in which 
we operate and our core business activities. He also visited a 
number of our sites both in the UK and overseas, including 
Rawcliffe Bridge and our Centre of Excellence in Goole, as well  
as sites in Singapore, France, Denmark, Mevisa and the US 
where he was able to observe our operations in action and meet 
colleagues to gain further insight into our culture and business 
operations. In the USA Chris also attended meetings with some  
of our key customers to better understand the challenges faced  
in the current business environment.

As the new Chair of the Sustainability Oversight Committee,  
Chris held a number of deep dive sessions with the Group 
Sustainability team and sustainability experts in the business,  
as well as attending external training and networking sessions in 
relation to sustainability. This has enhanced his knowledge and 
understanding of our sustainability strategy framework and how 
our Purpose is embedded into our culture, with our ambition to  
be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients and our 
Commitment to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030. 

“I received a comprehensive and tailored induction that provided 
me with the knowledge and information I needed as a first time 
Non-Executive Director and clarity on the key issues facing the 
Group, all of which was incredibly insightful. It was great to hear 
first-hand from a wide range of colleagues about the Group’s 
operations and I was particularly keen to listen to our customers 
and gain a deeper understanding of our relationship with them.  
I have been made to feel very welcome by the Board and all my 
Croda colleagues, and the induction has enabled me to hit the 
ground running and participate fully in Board and Committee 
meetings. I already knew that Croda was a truly sustainable 
company but to see a range of the projects in action has  
been invaluable.”

Chris Good
Non-Executive Director

Danuta Gray’s planned induction programme
The programme is structured to provide the information needed to engage in Board meetings in the same way as for other Non-Executive 
Directors joining the Board and then further expanded to develop the oversight required as Chair. In addition to time spent with senior 
management to understand areas of focus, time will be scheduled with Anita Frew in the three months prior to her retirement to gain her 
insights as Chair.

Sustainability Oversight Committee

Report of the Sustainability  
Oversight Committee 

I am pleased to present our first Sustainability Oversight  
Committee report. 

Following a number of discussions by the Board, the Audit Committee 
and Croda’s sustainability team during 2023, the Board established 
the Board level Sustainability Oversight Committee. The Committee’s 
support will be critical as the Group seeks to deliver on its 
sustainability leadership ambitions, manage climate and nature related 
risk, and navigate an increasingly complex and comprehensive ESG 
regulatory environment. 

The Board approved the Committee’s terms of reference (which can 
be found in the governance section at www.croda.com) and agreed 
that the responsibilities of the Sustainability Oversight Committee 
would be strategically focused, with the Audit Committee providing 
assurance on the accuracy and reliability of the Group’s sustainability 
disclosures through the oversight of the control environment in relation 
to data and information used in support of such disclosures. 

Committee membership
The Committee comprises myself as Chair and Jacqui Ferguson,  
Keith Layden and Nawal Ouzren as members. All other Directors are 
invited to attend Committee meetings, as are the CEO, CFO, Chief 
Sustainability Officer and the Group General Counsel, Company 
Secretary and President Sustainability. 

Key responsibilities
Croda’s sustainability strategy will continue to be developed by the 
Executive Committee and approved by the Board with the role of the 
Sustainability Oversight Committee to:

•  Monitor the execution and implementation of the sustainability 

strategy, including performance against KPIs

•  Monitor compliance with sustainability policies, regulations and  

best practice

•  Support the Board by considering in more depth the Group’s 

principal sustainability risks and opportunities

will continue to provide a link between all the Board Committees and 
to ensure alignment. 

“At Croda, we recognise the fundamental 
importance of taking action to drive 
progress against our sustainability 
leadership agenda. The establishment  
of the Board Sustainability Oversight 
Committee reflects the Board’s continued 
commitment and focus in this area.”

Audit Committee report

Report of the Audit Committee 

Dear fellow shareholder,

Report of the Audit Committee for the year ended 
31 December 2023
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the year ended 
31 December 2023. This report provides shareholders with an 
overview of the work undertaken by the Committee and the key areas 
considered when monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
reporting and the effectiveness of its system of internal control and risk 
management processes. 

During the year, I received regular updates from the CFO, the wider 
global finance team, KPMG’s Lead Audit Partner and the VP Risk and 
Assurance. The dedication and commitment from the Croda executive 
management team, the audit teams and Croda employees have once 
again delivered high-quality and robust audit processes.

In December we announced that our CFO Louisa Burdett will be 
leaving the business in June 2024. Louisa is leaving with our best 
wishes and a search for her successor is in hand, a process that  
is well underway and one in which I am heavily involved.

Committee membership and attendance
The Committee at the end of the year comprised six independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The experience of each Board member is 
outlined on pages 72 to 73. The Board considers that all members  
of the Audit Committee have the appropriate and relevant level of 
experience in financial matters as well as a diverse and broad range  
of competence relevant to the sector focus and the future strategic 
direction of the Group.

These skills and my own experience of over 30 years in international 
finance and extensive experience as an audit committee chair provide 
the Board with assurance that the Committee has the appropriate  
skills and breadth and depth of experience to ensure that it can be  
fully effective. Nevertheless a further Non-Executive Director is being 
sought for the Audit Committee who also has financial and accounting 
expertise. It also meets the Code requirement that at least one member 
has significant, recent and relevant financial experience.

The Chair of the Board, Keith Layden (a Non-Executive Director), the 
Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial 
Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance (who leads the internal audit 
function) and representatives from the external and internal auditors 
attend the meetings by invitation.

The Committee met five times during the year and has met twice  
since the financial year end with each meeting agenda including a 
range of topics across the Committee’s areas of responsibility. The 
Committee works to an agreed structured programme of business  
and meetings to coincide with key events around our financial calendar 
and, on behalf of the Board, to provide oversight of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control process. I report formally to the 
Board on the Committee’s activities after each meeting. 

To ensure the work of the Committee remains focused on the key and 
emerging issues, I regularly meet and speak separately with the CFO, 
the Group Financial Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance and the 
internal and external auditor. Meetings without the Executive Directors 
present are also held with the internal and external auditors to facilitate 
open dialogue and assurance. Before each Committee meeting, I also 
meet with the external auditors, the Group Financial Controller and the 
VP Risk and Assurance and before most meetings with the CFO to 
discuss control and compliance issues generally and specifically the 
detail of the year end and half year results, accounting judgements and 
disclosures. This helps me to ensure there is a shared understanding of 
the key issues, technical matters and judgements and to make sure 
sufficient time is devoted to them at the meetings.

“The Committee thanks the executive 
management team, the audit teams and 
Croda employees across the Group for 
their dedication and commitment to 
maintaining high standards of internal 
control and risk management in the  
current challenging market environment.”

John Ramsay
Chair of the Audit Committee

  See page 103 for progress on these areas

Committee activity in 2023
The Committee’s core activities, as well as the additional focus areas, 
and an estimate of the proportion of time spent on them, are: 

•  Reviewed consideration given by management relating to various 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) thematic reviews and guidance  
for financial reporting.

Financial reporting (25%)

The Committee:
•  Monitored the Group’s financial statements and results 

announcements, including the Annual Report and the interim 
statement, and with support from the external auditor, reviewed 
those items in the Group’s financial statements that were material  
to our reporting. The Committee challenged management on the 
statements and the underlying accounting judgements, including 
goodwill impairment considerations, acquisition and hedge 
accounting considerations for the Solus Biotech acquisition and 
hyperinflationary accounting considerations. Following its review,  
and after considering the evidence and accounting papers provided 
by management, the Committee was satisfied with the explanations 
provided. Consideration was given to the appropriateness of 
accounting policies, critical accounting judgements and key  
sources of estimation of uncertainty. Recommendations were  
made to the Board supporting the half and full-year accounts  
and financial statements.

•  Monitored the Group’s financial performance and ensured that 

management’s judgements and estimates remained reasonable  
and prudent considering the two unscheduled trading updates 
issued in 2023.

•  Reviewed the Group’s external reporting framework and use of 
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) and the updated and 
new definitions to assess ongoing appropriateness. The Committee 
was satisfied that the APMs reviewed were consistent with market 
practice of both the peer group and wider FTSE 100 companies, 
and that disclosures and reconciliations to statutory measures  
were appropriate. 

•  Assessed the impairment testing reviews on goodwill balances on 
the Group’s balance sheet and was satisfied with the output of the 
reviews. In conjunction with the Board, challenged management  
on the assumptions and forecasts behind the financial modelling  
and stress testing conducted for the going concern assessment.  
A recommendation was made to the Board to support the going 
concern statement. Further information can be found on page 157.
•  Reviewed the viability assessment process undertaken in support  
of the long-term viability statement, based on severe but plausible 
scenarios (including different combinations of scenarios) arising from 
key risks and their impact on headroom and debt covenants. The 
Committee challenged the assessment period, assumptions and 
calculations in the modelling and scenarios, noting the effect they 
would have during the viability period and was satisfied that they 
were robust and well thought through. The Committee also 
considered and was satisfied with the appropriateness of the 
three-year period for assessing the viability and the severity of the 
stress-testing scenarios. A recommendation was made to the Board 
to support the long-term viability statement. Further information can 
be found on page 58.

•  Undertook regular reviews of the Group’s litigation. The Committee 
receives reports twice a year from the Group General Counsel, 
Company Secretary and President Sustainability and was satisfied 
with the approach to provisioning and disclosure.

•  Reviewed the accounting treatment of the Solus Biotech acquisition, 
including the purchase price allocation, the identification of cash 
generating units (CGUs) and the appropriateness of the foreign 
exchange hedge accounting applied to the acquisition. Impairment 
is not considered to be a key area of focus despite low headroom 
on the basis it is trading in line with expectations post-acquisition.

Dear fellow shareholder,

31 December 2023

I am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the year ended 

31 December 2023. This report provides shareholders with an 

overview of the work undertaken by the Committee and the key areas 

considered when monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 

reporting and the effectiveness of its system of internal control and risk 

management processes. 

During the year, I received regular updates from the CFO, the wider 

global finance team, KPMG’s Lead Audit Partner and the VP Risk and 

Assurance. The dedication and commitment from the Croda executive 

management team, the audit teams and Croda employees have once 

again delivered high-quality and robust audit processes.

In December we announced that our CFO Louisa Burdett will be 

leaving the business in June 2024. Louisa is leaving with our best 

wishes and a search for her successor is in hand, a process that  

is well underway and one in which I am heavily involved.

Committee membership and attendance

The Committee at the end of the year comprised six independent 

Non-Executive Directors. The experience of each Board member is 

outlined on pages 72 to 73. The Board considers that all members  

of the Audit Committee have the appropriate and relevant level of 

experience in financial matters as well as a diverse and broad range  

of competence relevant to the sector focus and the future strategic 

direction of the Group.

These skills and my own experience of over 30 years in international 

finance and extensive experience as an audit committee chair provide 

the Board with assurance that the Committee has the appropriate  

skills and breadth and depth of experience to ensure that it can be  

fully effective. Nevertheless a further Non-Executive Director is being 

sought for the Audit Committee who also has financial and accounting 

expertise. It also meets the Code requirement that at least one member 

has significant, recent and relevant financial experience.

The Chair of the Board, Keith Layden (a Non-Executive Director), the 

Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial 

Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance (who leads the internal audit 

function) and representatives from the external and internal auditors 

attend the meetings by invitation.

The Committee met five times during the year and has met twice  

since the financial year end with each meeting agenda including a 

range of topics across the Committee’s areas of responsibility. The 

Committee works to an agreed structured programme of business  

and meetings to coincide with key events around our financial calendar 

and, on behalf of the Board, to provide oversight of the Group’s risk 

management and internal control process. I report formally to the

Audit Committee report continued

•  Reviewed and approved the response to the FRC request for 

information from its review of the Group’s 2022 Annual Report as 
part of its routine monitoring of corporate reporting, specifically to 
clarify whether the Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme was 
open to future accrual and how the Company expected to recover 
the scheme surplus through reduced future contributions. We were 
able to confirm that the UK scheme remains open to new members 
and future service accrual, clarifying that the surplus can be 
recovered through a reduction in future service contributions.  
We agreed to update our disclosures to make it clearer that the  
UK scheme remains open to future accrual and to new members. 
The letter also included suggestions concerning areas where the 
FRC believes users of the accounts would benefit from minor 
improvements to the Group’s existing disclosures. Our response 
enabled the FRC to close its enquiries. The FRC review is limited  
to the 2022 Annual Report, and it does not benefit from detailed 
knowledge of our business or an understanding of the underlying 
transactions entered into. Accordingly the review and comments 
received from the FRC provide no assurance that the Annual Report 
is correct in all material respects. 

•  Received presentations from the divisional Finance Directors of Latin 
America and Life Sciences which enabled the Committee to gain 
confidence in the depth of finance capability employed in the 
divisions as well as providing different perspectives and insights. 

Governance (10%)

The Committee:
•  Reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s anti-bribery and fraud 
procedures, including those for whistleblowing. The Committee 
received a report on the independent investigations that had been 
conducted in response to concerns raised under the whistleblowing 
and fraud policies and was satisfied with the conclusions, including 
follow-up actions. The Committee also reviewed a summary of the 
controls in place to mitigate the risk of fraud in the Group, along  
with a bottom-up fraud risk assessment prepared by management. 
The Committee was satisfied that the ethics and fraud programmes 
were effective. 

•  Undertook an external evaluation of the Committee’s effectiveness. 
Information on the evaluation process can be found on page 89.  
The results of the review concluded that the Committee continued  
to be effective. 

•  Compared its remit favourably with the FRC’s recently published 

‘Minimum Standards for Audit Committees’.

•  Reviewed the Committee’s terms of reference and confirmed that 
the role and responsibilities of the Committee are aligned with the 
2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. Minor changes were made 
to confirm the Committee’s assurance and monitoring role in relation 
to the Group’s sustainability disclosures.

•  Undertook its annual legal and compliance review of the corporate 

governance and regulatory requirements of the Committee, 
concluding that it was in full compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code and other corporate governance requirements.
•  Completed its annual review of the Group’s tax compliance policy 
and risks relating thereto. No significant updates were required.  
The policy is available at www.croda.com. 

•  Considered the impact of the retraction of UK corporate reform 
legislation on Croda’s preparation for the expected changes  
to legislation:

 – The Committee agreed that the work to enhance control design 
by standardising and leveraging automation should continue,  
as this would provide the benefit of improving visibility of control 
performance through consistent and accessible control evidence, 
which will be underpinned by the implementation of a new 
Integrated Risk Management system in 2024.

 – Work will continue on scoping ‘material information’ in relation  

to sustainability reporting given its strategic importance to Croda 
to ensure that reported sustainability information is materially 
accurate. The scoping work around ‘double materiality’ (impact 
and financial materiality) is also required under upcoming 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) legislation. 
 – Even though the proposal for a Fraud Statement was withdrawn, 
given the introduction of legislation regarding ‘failure to prevent 
fraud’, work in this area will continue. See page 53 for details  
on what has been done in 2023.

 – Although the Company will no longer need to publish an Audit 
Assurance Policy, the Committee believes it will be of value to 
Croda’s risk management programme to produce a 
comprehensive assurance map, which will allow a better 
assessment of the level of assurance currently in place, and 
gauge the appetite for more or less assurance over specific risks. 

 – The proposal to publish a resilience statement was withdrawn. 
Given the continued requirement for the Company to publish 
long-term viability and going concern statements, the Committee 
agreed that publication of a resilience statement would not add 
additional value to Croda’s stakeholders.

 – Monitoring the introduction of the revised corporate reforms will 

continue to be a focus area for the Committee in 2024. 

External audit (25%)

The Committee:
•  Discussed and approved the external audit plan, including the 

assessment of significant audit risks; the engagement risk profile;  
the use of data analytics; the scope of the audit in terms of 
coverage, the materiality level and the de minimis reporting 
threshold; the co-ordination of external audits; and the key members 
of the engagement team. The Committee monitored the progress 
made by the statutory audit team against the agreed plan and 
discussed issues as they arose.

•  Discussed and approved the increase to the external audit fee. 

Information on the audit fees can be found in note 3 on page 166.

•  Agreed with the auditor that there should be sufficient focus on 

areas of particular concern to the Committee (e.g. the acquisition  
of Solus Biotech and carrying value of goodwill in respect of the 
Flavours CGU).

•  Reviewed in-depth a range of indicators to judge the overall audit 
quality as described in the auditor effectiveness considerations on 
page 104. Received a report from the Lead Audit Partner to ensure 
sustainable high levels of audit quality and the necessary prevailing 
culture amongst staff.

•  Met with the auditor without management present. The Committee 
considered the auditor’s views. There were no significant issues  
to report. 

•  Considered the independence and objectivity of the auditor. The 
Committee confirmed the independence of the auditor as further 
described on page 105.

•  Considered the effectiveness of the external audit process, 

concluding that the audit was effective (see page 104) and a 
recommendation was made to the Board on the re-appointment  
of KPMG as auditor at the AGM. 

Internal audit and risk management (25%)

The Committee:
•  Reviewed the internal audit planning approach and its link to the 

Company’s strategic objectives and priorities, reviewed reports on 
the work of the internal audit function from the VP Risk and 
Assurance and monitored compliance with the Group risk assurance 
programme. The Committee approved the internal audit plan and 
the implementation of any resulting actions by management.

on areas requiring attention by the project teams as the  
projects progressed. 

the Operations Technology control environment. The Chief 
Information Officer presented to the Committee to discuss strengths, 
weaknesses and action plans as well as the findings of third-party 
audits. The Committee received quarterly updates, including 
progress against agreed KPIs, and challenged management on  
the rate of progress on cyber security and asked management to 
consider ways of accelerating the work. For more information see 
the table below. 

•  Assisted the Board in its assessment of the Group’s emerging and 
principal risks. The Committee assessed the results of the 2022 risk 
assurance activity carried out by internal audit and considered any 
additional key risks as a result of acquisitions during the year. The 
Committee reviewed and approved the 2023 internal audit plan and 
scope of the peer reviews.

•  Met with the internal auditors without management present. There 

were no significant issues identified.

internal audit function. The Committee concluded that the internal 
audit team, supported by PwC resource, was effective.

•  Received a presentation summarising the bottom-up fraud risk 

review undertaken during the year. This reinforced management’s 
high-level risk assessment previously reported to the Committee 
which indicated that processes and controls were generally well 
designed to address fraud risks. See page 53 for more information.

•  Received a presentation on the Group’s updated Business 
Continuity Plan framework and the planned risk based roll  
out approach. 

Specific focus areas for 2023 (15%)

External auditor’s effectiveness 
During the year, the Committee assessed the effectiveness of KPMG 
as Group external auditor. To assist in the assessment, the Committee 
considered the quality of reports from KPMG and the additional 
insights provided by the audit team, particularly at partner level. It took 
account of the views of the CFO and Group Financial Controller, who 
had discussed subsidiary component audits with local audit partners, 
to gauge the quality of the team and knowledge and understanding  
of the business. The Committee also considered how well the auditor 
assessed key accounting and audit judgements and the way it  
applied constructive challenge and professional scepticism in  
dealing with management.

The Committee reviewed the output from a questionnaire completed 
by senior members of the finance team to obtain their views on KPMG’s 
effectiveness in carrying out the audit. The questionnaire covered: 

•  Structure of the external audit team and their quality and approach. 
•  The planning, delivery and execution of the audit.
•  The effectiveness of their reporting.
•  Effectiveness of communications between management and the 

audit team.

•  Robustness of the audit, including the independence of the external 
audit team and their ability to challenge management as well as 
demonstrate professional scepticism and independence.

•  The external audit team’s judgement. 

Scores were compared with previous years to understand trends and 
highlight areas of improvement. The independence, team size, seniority 
and expertise of the external audit team continued to be assessed 
positively. Examples included that the senior team had dealt with 
complex issues as they came up and were helpful in providing 
feedback on technical accounting and disclosure issues. Regional 
close-out meetings had been succinct and clear. Minor improvement 
areas were noted, which included the need for clearer upfront planning 
and effective communication on progress in some areas.

The Committee also reviewed a report produced by KPMG that 
summarised the internal measures that KPMG used to assess audit 
quality as well as responses to thematic areas identified by the FRC 
that were relevant to the Croda audit. And as mentioned above, the 
Committee received a report from the Lead Audit Partner on actions 
undertaken by KPMG to improve audit quality following the FRC report 
on the Carillion audit. 

There were several quality interventions that attributed to the overall 
audit quality and ensured independent challenge. These included the 
use of specialists, audit consultations, a technical review, a second line 
inflight review and finally an independent audit partner review. 

Governance

Audit Committee report continued

Looking ahead to 2024
In addition to our core business, the Committee has identified four 
focus areas for 2024. We will:

•  Maintain cyber security as a focus area for 2024 given it remains a 

principal risk.

•  Maintain focus on monitoring the impact of major business change 

programmes on Croda’s risk and control environment.

•  Maintain UK corporate reform as a focus area for 2024 and monitor 

progress of relevant control framework changes. 

•  Oversee the development of internal controls over the production 

and disclosure of non-financial information and oversee the provision 
of external assurance in respect of that information. 

Internal audit and risk management
I met with the VP Risk and Assurance several times during the year 
outside of the formal meetings to discuss the performance and  
output of the internal audit function and aspects of risk management. 
The VP Risk and Assurance attended each Committee meeting and 
presented an internal audit report that was reviewed and discussed 
fully, highlighting any major deviations from the annual plan agreed  
with the Committee. 

At each meeting, the Committee considered the results of the audits 
undertaken and the adequacy of management’s response to matters 
raised, including the time taken to resolve such matters. Particular 
focus was addressed to those areas where there was a major 
divergence between the outcome of the internal audit and the  
scoring of the self-assessment questionnaire, completed annually  
by each business unit. In these instances, the Committee challenged 
management as to what actions it was taking to minimise divergences 
arising in the future. 

In January 2024, the Committee conducted its annual review of the 
internal audit function, including its approach to audit planning and  
risk assessment, communication within the business and with the 
Committee and its relationship with the external auditor. Senior 
management feedback from sites, included in the 2023 audit 
programme, is gathered by questionnaire to support this process. 
Details on how the business monitors risk and how it implements  
its risk management framework are set out on pages 51 to 53.

Committee evaluation 
Through the annual Board evaluation process, see page 89, the 
performance of the Committee was assessed and the output of  
the evaluation was considered by the Committee in January 2024.

Overall, the evaluation concluded that the Committee was operating 
effectively and was efficiently led by an experienced Chair. The overall 
performance of the Committee and that of the Committee Chair were 
both highly rated. Members were well prepared for meetings and 
engaged in productive discussions with a healthy balance of support 
and constructive challenge for executives. 

Relationships between the Committee and Croda management were 
considered very effective. Senior leaders attended meetings as 
required which provided visibility into various business areas as well as 
the opportunity to strengthen relationships. Meetings were well run and 
adhered to a structured agenda and time frame with appropriate time 
allowed for more in-depth discussions when required. 

It was recognised that with the establishment of the Sustainability 
Oversight Committee, there was a need for liaison between the two 
Committee Chairs to ensure no overlap. The review highlighted the 
opportunity to further diversify discussions to enhance consideration  
of external factors such as AI, geopolitical risks and the broader 
economic landscape.

External auditor’s independence
The Committee and the Board place great emphasis on the objectivity 
of the Group’s external auditor, KPMG, in reporting to shareholders. 
Our Group policy on the provision of non-audit services by external 
auditors, which is on our website www.croda.com, sets out permitted 
and prohibited non-audit services and the controls over assignments 
awarded to the external auditor to ensure that audit independence is 
not compromised and the provision of such services does not impair 
the external auditor’s objectivity. 

In 2023, non-audit fees were £0.3m, significantly less than the total 
audit fees of £2.8m; the non-audit to audit fees ratio stands at 0.1:1. 
The non-audit fees include the approved fees for carrying out a  
limited assurance of significant climate and gender diversity KPIs  
as noted earlier.

The Committee undertook its annual review of the Group’s policies 
relating to external audit, including the policy that governs how and 
when employees and former employees of the Group’s auditor can be 
employed by the Company. No changes were made. The Committee 
also reviewed and accepted KPMG’s independence letter which 
annually confirms their independence and compliance with the FRC‘s 
ethical standard. In conclusion, the Committee agreed that KPMG 
were independent.

Significant financial statement reporting items
The Committee, with support from the external auditor, reviewed 
those items in the Group’s and Parent Company’s financial 
statements that have the potential to significantly impact reporting. 
These are set out below.

Goodwill impairment: The strategy of the Group includes 
acquiring new technologies and businesses operating in adjacent 
markets. As a result, goodwill represents a significant asset value 
on the balance sheet of £937.9m out of total net assets of 
£2,368.1m at 31 December 2023.

The Committee completed its annual impairment review of  
the carrying value of goodwill, as prepared by management, 
including the detailed sensitivity analysis to a number of underlying 
assumptions, including the current macroeconomic outlook  
and the broader consequences on the markets in which the 
Group operates. 

The Committee assessed the methodologies used and the 
adequacy of the management disclosures. Particular attention 
was given to the SIPO cash generating unit’s value in use model, 
which demonstrated a £20.8m impairment versus its carrying 
value as lower forecast sales and margin have reduced its future 
value projection and the Flavours cash generating unit’s value in 
use model based on its impairment in the prior year and low level 
of headroom. The Committee reviewed the methodology adopted 
to evaluate the risk of goodwill impairment. After challenge, the 
Committee was satisfied that the assumptions were reasonable 
and that no other impairments were necessary; however, 
enhanced disclosure was agreed to be appropriate for the 
Flavours cash generating unit, given the low headroom sensitivity 
of the calculations to certain assumptions.

Croda is in compliance with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014. 
We undertook an audit tender in 2017 and the Board appointed KPMG 
as external auditor. The first year to be audited by KPMG was the year 
ended 31 December 2018. Subject to the continued quality and 
effectiveness of the current auditor, we plan to re-tender ahead of a 
2028 appointment. The current Lead Audit Partner, Ian Griffiths, was 
appointed for the year ended 31 December 2021.

External auditor reappointment
As noted above, the Committee recommended to the Board that 
KPMG be offered for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. I will be 
available at the shareholder engagement event to respond to any 
questions shareholders may raise on the Committee’s activities in  
the year.

John Ramsay
Chair of the Audit Committee

Pensions: The Committee monitored the Group’s pension 
arrangements, in particular the funding of the defined benefit plan 
in the UK, which are sensitive to assumptions made in respect of 
discount rates, salary increases and inflation.

The Group engages external actuarial specialists. The Committee 
reviewed the actuarial assumptions used and compared them 
with those used by other companies. The external auditor also 
challenged the benchmark assumptions applied and conducted 
sensitivity analysis. Following their review, the Committee found 
the assumptions to be reasonable.

Parent Company’s carrying value of investments in 
subsidiaries and intercompany receivables: The Committee 
considered the carrying amount of the Parent Company’s 
investments in subsidiaries and intercompany debtors, held at 
cost less impairment, representing 99% of the Parent Company’s 
total assets (2022: 93%).

The recoverability of these balances is not considered 
judgemental; however, they are the most significant component  
of the Parent Company balance sheet and therefore require 
additional consideration as part of preparing the financial 
statements. This included comparing the carrying amount with  
the respective subsidiary’s net asset value, profitability and cash 
generation. After review, the Committee was satisfied that the 
recoverability of these balances was acceptable, and no 
impairments were necessary.

Remuneration Committee report

Report of the Remuneration Committee

A. Chair’s letter
On behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee, I am 
pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2023. 

This year has been a challenging year for the Group, with a weaker 
economic environment and customer destocking across consumer, 
crop and industrial markets impacting financial performance. Despite 
this, the Group continued to execute against the long-term growth 
strategy, driving sustainable innovation and continuing to invest in 
biotechnology, pharma expansion and capacity to support fast  
growth in Asia. We also took the opportunity to evolve our 
organisational structure, ensuring we are well positioned to  
capture future growth opportunities. 

As a knowledge-based business, attracting, developing and retaining 
high-quality people throughout the organisation is key to our success. 
The Committee believes that an effective reward structure, as part  
of a wider employee engagement framework, plays a key role in the 
continued achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives and in the 
delivery of sustainable, profitable growth. 

Last year we reviewed and updated our Remuneration Policy to ensure 
alignment with Croda’s evolving ambition and were pleased to receive 
94% votes in favour. The Remuneration Committee is not proposing 
any changes to the operation of the policy in 2024, being satisfied with 
the outcome of the review and operation of the policy in 2023, with 
reward outcomes aligned with the shareholder experience.

As Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I would like to thank my 
colleagues for their commitment and engagement throughout the year 
and to welcome Chris Good as a new member of the Committee. 

Remuneration out-turn for 2023
With a challenging trading environment in 2023, financial performance 
was weaker, with sales of £1.7bn down by 19% and adjusted 
operating profit of £320m down by 38%. Despite this, execution 
against our strategy continued, ensuring we are positioned for 
sustainable growth over the long term. 

Under our senior annual Bonus Plan the maximum opportunity for  
the CEO and CFO was 175% and 150% of base salary, respectively, 
based on profit performance (90% weighting) and an ESG metric  
(10% weighting). Consistent with the approach taken in prior years, 
bonusable profit was adjusted for the lipid system sales for our 
principal COVID-19 vaccine contract. In 2023, however, profit 
performance was below the threshold with no annual bonus payable 
for this element of the award. For 2023 the ESG metric was based on 
safety. However, given the weakness of the overall financial performance 
of the Group, it was recommended by management and supported by 
the Committee that no annual bonus should be payable for 2023.

2023 was the year in which PSP grants made in 2021 concluded their 
three-year cycle and the Committee reviewed performance against 
targets. Over the period, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance 
(35% weighting) was (23.5)%. This placed Croda below median when 
compared to our bespoke comparator group and this part of the 
award will not vest. Earnings per Share (EPS) growth over the period 
(35% weighting) was achieved at just above threshold at 5.6%. 
Consistent with last year, EPS was adjusted for the divestment  
of the majority of the PTIC business.

“The committee is satisfied that the 
operation of the policy balances the 
challenging market conditions, overall 
shareholder experience but recognises 
strategic progress and considers the 
attraction, motivation and retention  
of key talent.”

Report of the Remuneration Committee

A. Chair’s letter

On behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee, I am 

pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year 

ended 31 December 2023. 

This year has been a challenging year for the Group, with a weaker 

economic environment and customer destocking across consumer, 

crop and industrial markets impacting financial performance. Despite 

this, the Group continued to execute against the long-term growth 

strategy, driving sustainable innovation and continuing to invest in 

biotechnology, pharma expansion and capacity to support fast  

growth in Asia. We also took the opportunity to evolve our 

organisational structure, ensuring we are well positioned to

As a knowledge-based business, attracting, developing and retaining 

high-quality people throughout the organisation is key to our success. 

The Committee believes that an effective reward structure, as part  

of a wider employee engagement framework, plays a key role in the 

continued achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives and in the 

delivery of sustainable, profitable growth. 

Last year we reviewed and updated our Remuneration Policy to ensure 

alignment with Croda’s evolving ambition and were pleased to receive 

94% votes in favour. The Remuneration Committee is not proposing 

any changes to the operation of the policy in 2024, being satisfied with 

the outcome of the review and operation of the policy in 2023, with 

reward outcomes aligned with the shareholder experience.

As Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I would like to thank my 

colleagues for their commitment and engagement throughout the year 

and to welcome Chris Good as a new member of the Committee. 

Remuneration out-turn for 2023

With a challenging trading environment in 2023, financial performance 

was weaker, with sales of £1.7bn down by 19% and adjusted 

operating profit of £320m down by 38%. Despite this, execution 

against our strategy continued, ensuring we are positioned for

New and Protected Products (NPP) growth (15% weighting) met  
the stretching vesting target, with NPP sales growing by 3.3 times 
non-NPP sales over the period and full vesting achieved for this 
element of the award. The 2021 PSP cycle included sustainability 
metrics (15% weighting), split equally between Climate Positive and 
Land Positive targets. The Climate Positive metric was a reduction in 
scope 1 emissions from a 2020 baseline of 102,750 MT. For 2023, 
Scope 1 emissions were 86,740 MT representing a 15.6% reduction 
against the baseline which results in 100% of this condition vesting.  
For the Land Positive element, the target was met, and full vesting  
was achieved. 

The 2021 PSP award was subject to an Economic Value Added (EVA) 
underpin such that awards would be subject to a reduction (including 
potentially to nil) in the event that EVA had not improved over the 
three-year performance period. The EVA underpin was not met and  
the Committee therefore considered an appropriate reduction. 

As part of these deliberations the Committee also took into account  
the Discretion Framework where a range of factors are considered to 
ensure payout is consistent with and reflective of overall performance 
over the period. One consideration made, as part of the Discretion 
Framework, was that the outturn against emissions targets had 
benefitted from the lower volumes in the year. More details of all the 
considerations taken into account are set out on page 122. Taking into 
account the EVA underpin alongside the Discretionary Framework the 
Committee determined that the overall vesting of the PSP would be 
reduced by 10%. The resultant overall PSP vesting was 37.1% of the 
total award.

Performance framework for 2024
Croda’s strategy continues to focus on delivering sustainable,  
profitable growth by providing innovative and sustainable solutions  
to our customers. This is consistent with our Purpose, Smart science 
to improve livesTM, with our remuneration framework therefore 
underpinning our Purpose through performance measures and 
stretching targets. 

For 2024, the senior annual Bonus Plan will continue to be based on a 
profit performance metric (90% of the total award) and an ESG metric 
(10% of the total award). The ESG metric was introduced into the 
senior annual Bonus Plan as part of the policy review in 2023 and the 
focus of this metric varies each year, adapting to our evolving priorities 
in this area. For 2024 the focus will continue to be based on safety, 
building on the work done in 2023 to support the embedding of SHE 
as a Value through the entire workforce.

The PSP performance framework is unchanged in substance and  
will continue to include EPS growth (35% of the award), relative TSR 
(35% of the award) and NPP and sustainability targets (30% of the 
award). The NPP element (15% of total award) incentivises innovation 
based on NPP revenue, being revenue from those products that will 
drive our future growth. Innovating sustainably is core to Croda’s 
success, and we continue to focus management on the delivery of this. 
The sustainability element (15% of total award) will be focused on our 
‘Climate Positive’ sustainability commitments, which for this award will 
include scope 3 emissions targets as well as competency-building on 
scope 3 through our organisation. It is only through continued 
innovation and collaboration, that we can reduce scope 3 emissions

across the full life cycle of our customers’ products, and ultimately 
achieve our ambition to be ‘Climate Positive’.

In line with normal practice, the Committee reviewed targets ahead  
of 2024. Targets for our senior annual Bonus Plan continue to be set 
using a consistent and distinctive framework, focused on year-on-year 
growth in Bonusable Profit. Bonusable Profit is an established 
performance measure at Croda, which has been used for many years 
and is focused on operational profitability based on Group EBITDA.

For the PSP award to be granted in 2024, the Committee considered 
share price performance over last year, recognising the impact of the 
challenging macroeconomic environment. Performance is always 
considered holistically; each year the Committee applies our 
comprehensive Discretion Framework to satisfy itself that the outcome 
in terms of primary performance metrics has not been to the detriment 
of other measures of corporate performance. The Committee will review 
vesting outcomes against this Discretion Framework, with particular 
attention paid to share price performance to ensure Executive Directors 
do not benefit from any windfall gains. In addition to this we also have 
ROIC as an underpin in our PSP recognising that long-term ROIC 
performance continues to be a key focus for the business. The ROIC 
underpin, which is discretionary, has been revised for 2024 taking into 
account the current market environment. Safety also continues to be a 
specific underpin in our senior annual Bonus Plan.

Salaries for 2024
For 2024, there will be a general increase to salaries for UK employees 
of 3%. The Committee reviewed the salaries of our Executive Directors 
and determined that an increase of 3% would be awarded in line with 
that of the UK workforce. 

Board changes
Danuta Gray will join the Board with effect from 1 February 2024 and 
will succeed Anita as Chair at the conclusion of the Company’s AGM 
on 24 April 2024. Anita Frew will then retire from the Board after nine 
years as Croda’s Chair.

In anticipation of the appointment of a new Chair, the Committee 
instigated a review of the Chair fees recognising that in the nine years 
since Anita’s appointment, Croda has grown in size and complexity to 
become an established FTSE 100 company. This review, which was 
supported by Deloitte, also included an extensive review of the market 
to consider what other similar sized organisations paid in order to 
attract the desired skills and experience to lead an increasingly diverse 
and international business. It was ultimately determined that the fee  
for the new Chair would be set at £425,000. The Committee also 
determined that it would be appropriate for this fee to apply for  
Anita, as the current Chair, from 1 January 2024 for the remainder  
of her tenure. 

Louisa Burdett, Chief Financial Officer, will leave Croda in June 2024 
and the Board has commenced a search for her successor. 

Remuneration arrangements for Louisa Burdett have been managed in 
line with the Remuneration Policy and the proposed approach is in line 
with the approach that would be taken for other UK employees on 
giving notice. While Louisa remained eligible for an annual bonus for 
2023, as discussed above, no annual bonus will be payable to all 
executives reflecting Croda’s financial out-turn in the year. For 2024, 
she will receive a 3% salary increase, in line with the normal approach 
for UK employees that have given notice but will remain employed for 
part of the year, but will not be eligible for an annual bonus or PSP 
award. Further, all outstanding PSP awards will lapse.

Consideration of wider workforce and alignment of reward 
across the organisation
Our approach to workforce reward forms an important part of Croda’s 
philosophy and culture. One of the principles of Croda’s culture is to 
drive ‘One Croda’, and therefore many of the remuneration structures 

108

Croda International Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2023

that apply to the Executive Directors also apply further in the global 
organisation. The key difference being that remuneration for Executive 
Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and share 
ownership. Highlights of our approach to workforce pay include:

•  Our commitment to paying a Global Living Wage – in 2021 Croda 
established a Living Wage in each of the countries in which it 
operates and ensured that all employees receive this as a minimum. 
In 2023, we made progress in receiving certification from the Fair 
Wage Network (FWN), we expect to able to confirm this by the end 
of the first quarter of 2024.

•  Sharing of success with employees – achieved through the 

operation of various all-employee share plans, including our Free 
Share Plan which was introduced in 2021. We are pleased that 
workforce participation in these plans remains consistently strong 
year-on-year and allows our employees to become shareholders in 
the business. 

•  Generous and inclusive benefits – our holistic health and wellbeing 
benefit offering, which was enhanced in response to the cost-of-
living crisis, is highly valued across the workforce. In addition, our 
CARE defined benefit pension, which applies across our entire UK 
workforce, is a generous and inclusive benefit. 

In line with our ‘One Croda’ culture, our senior leaders all share the 
same performance metrics for the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP. 
Around 550 employees participate in the senior annual Bonus Plan  
and 65 of these are also in the PSP. We believe that this focuses our 
leadership on working together globally to deliver the best overall 
outcome for our customers and, in turn, our shareholders and  
other stakeholders.

Workforce engagement
Over the last two years, we have established a regular engagement 
programme to gain insight from employees across the Group. Through 
surveys, listening groups, site visits and a dedicated email, all Croda 
colleagues can give their feedback directly so we can better 
understand how they are feeling about certain areas of business.

Through the Purpose and Sustainability Commitment (PSC) survey,  
we have gained valuable feedback on how changes to reward in each 
location and support offered with cost-of-living have been positively 
received, a direct impact of last year’s Remuneration Committee review. 

We were also happy to see that questions related to wellbeing and 
safety have seen an uplift in the number of positive responses, building 
on the great work to truly embed safety as a value in the organisation 
that has taken place in 2023.

We continue to operate a dedicated email address so that employees 
can send questions or comments direct to the Remuneration 
Committee Chair.

Looking ahead
We remain confident that the Remuneration Policy that was approved 
in 2023 will continue to serve us well over the next two years and are 
not proposing any changes to its operation for 2024.

Going forward, we will continue to seek out opportunities to further 
enhance the remuneration approach at Croda, considering advice from 
our investors and other stakeholders such as listening groups with our 
employees. We remain committed to ensuring that our remuneration 
framework reflects the evolving needs of all of our stakeholders and the 
communities in which we operate.

For the PSP award to be granted in 2024, the Committee considered 

share price performance over last year, recognising the impact of the 

challenging macroeconomic environment. Performance is always 

considered holistically; each year the Committee applies our 

comprehensive Discretion Framework to satisfy itself that the outcome 

in terms of primary performance metrics has not been to the detriment 

of other measures of corporate performance. The Committee will review 

vesting outcomes against this Discretion Framework, with particular 

attention paid to share price performance to ensure Executive Directors 

do not benefit from any windfall gains. In addition to this we also have 

ROIC as an underpin in our PSP recognising that long-term ROIC 

performance continues to be a key focus for the business. The ROIC 

underpin, which is discretionary, has been revised for 2024 taking into 

account the current market environment. Safety also continues to be a 

specific underpin in our senior annual Bonus Plan.

Salaries for 2024

For 2024, there will be a general increase to salaries for UK employees 

of 3%. The Committee reviewed the salaries of our Executive Directors 

and determined that an increase of 3% would be awarded in line with 

that of the UK workforce. 

Board changes

Danuta Gray will join the Board with effect from 1 February 2024 and 

will succeed Anita as Chair at the conclusion of the Company’s AGM 

on 24 April 2024. Anita Frew will then retire from the Board after nine 

years as Croda’s Chair.

In anticipation of the appointment of a new Chair, the Committee 

instigated a review of the Chair fees recognising that in the nine years 

since Anita’s appointment, Croda has grown in size and complexity to 

become an established FTSE 100 company. This review, which was 

supported by Deloitte, also included an extensive review of the market 

to consider what other similar sized organisations paid in order to 

attract the desired skills and experience to lead an increasingly diverse 

and international business. It was ultimately determined that the fee  

for the new Chair would be set at £425,000. The Committee also

1. Agree a quarterly communication (SAY) and engagement plan (DO) for their team and peers.
All leaders to set quarterly targets and capture progress in Croda’s global human resources 
information system (HRIS). Achievement is recorded via the employees end of year appraisal. 
90% of the cohort must achieve by year end for this element to be considered complete. 

2. Measure workforce engagement through a ‘Safety is a Value’ survey.
Based on Croda’s current ‘Pulse’ Survey which currently has around a 70% response rate 
globally we will launch a ‘Safety is a Value’ survey which must receive a 70% response rate 
across the whole organisation by year end for this element to be considered as complete.

3. Identify measures of success for their team and demonstrate achievement at year end.
All leaders must capture their objective in Croda’s global HRIS. Achievement is recorded via the 
employees end of year appraisal. 90% of the cohort must achieve by year end for this element to

Payments, and is after the cost of bonuses. For 2024, and consistent with prior years, the calculation is adjusted for the lipid system sales  
for the principal Covid-19 vaccine contract.

Commentary

•  No change in opportunity levels or the balance of performance measures. 
•  When determining bonus outcomes, the Committee applies the Discretion Framework which includes a range of factors, 

see page 114.

•  The Committee remains comfortable that the structure of the senior annual Bonus Plan does not encourage inappropriate 

risk-taking and that the mandatory deferral of one third of bonus into shares for a three-year period provides clear 
alignment with shareholders and fosters a longer-term link between annual performance and reward.

•  Malus and clawback provisions apply.
•  Full retrospective disclosure of targets and actual performance against these will be made in next year’s Annual Report  

on Remuneration.

•  The Committee considers the targets set for 2024 to be at least as demanding as in previous years and were set after 

taking due account of the Company’s commercial circumstances and the current market environment.

Subject to overall positive Group profit growth and a minimum average of 3% NPP growth per 
year (25% vesting), with payments being made on a sliding scale up to 7% growth per year 
(maximum vesting).

Climate Positive – Two independent targets specifically focused on our upstream Scope 3 emissions:

1. Scope 3 emissions (10%) – Delivery of absolute upstream Scope 3 emissions reductions.

A reduction in upstream Scope 3 emissions aligned with our Science Based Target (SBT) 
trajectory from a 831,250 Mt CO2e adjusted baseline3 by end 2026, equating to an absolute 
reduction of 52,134Mt.

100% payout (10%) would be achieved if upstream Scope 3 emissions were reduced in line with 
or above target.

50% payout (5%) would be achieved if upstream Scope 3 emissions were reduced by 30,000Mt.

2. Scope 3 competency build (5%) – Target focused on competence building on Scope 3 to 
ensure all leaders have knowledge and skills applicable to Croda and to the key frameworks and 
standards used, and are accountable for ensuring the enablers are in place to support delivery of 
our Scope 3 reduction target.

100% payout (5%) would be achieved if 98% of all relevant4 leaders and employees (c.550 
individuals in total) complete the pre-set relevant training modules as part of the Sustainability 
Academy by the end of 2026. 

50% payout (2.5%) would be achieved if 95% of all relevant leaders and employees complete the 
pre-set relevant training modules.

Awards will be subject to a ROIC underpin such that vesting is subject to satisfactory ROIC performance over the three-year 
performance period, as determined by the Committee. In determining whether the underpin has been met, the Committee 
will consider a range of factors including, but not limited to, the intended time horizons for returns on capital deployed, and 
Croda’s long-term ROIC objective. In circumstances where the underpin is not met, the Committee may consider, in its 
absolute discretion, whether to reduce or cancel the vesting of awards.

1.  EPS growth p.a. is calculated on a simple average basis over the 
three-year period and therefore growth of 33% or more over three 
years is required for maximum vesting.

2.  TSR group: Akzo Nobel, Ashland, Avantor, BASF, Catalent, Chr. 
Hansen, Clariant, Elementis, Evonik, Givaudan, IFF, Johnson 
Matthey, Kerry, DSM-Firmenich, Lonza, Merck, Novozymes, 
Syensqo, Symrise, Synthomer, Tate & Lyle and Victrex

3.  Adjusted baseline is the three-year average Scope 3 emissions from 

2021 to 2023.

4.  Scope 3 emission reduction affects Croda’s entire value chain, from the 
sourcing of ingredients to the processing and formulation of products, 
and the delivery and engagement with customers and markets, as well 
as the management and disclosure of the relevant data. Therefore 
many different functions need to be involved, at different levels, across 
both businesses, including senior leadership teams.

Commentary

•  Louisa Burdett will not receive an award in 2024 due to her planned resignation.
•  Performance period 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2026.
•  An additional two-year holding period will apply for any shares vesting.
•  Malus and clawback provisions apply.

Croda’s long-term ROIC objective. In circumstances where the underpin is not met, the Committee may consider, in its

How our reward strategy aligns to and supports the delivery of our business strategy
Over the last three years we have accelerated key elements of our strategy to transition to a dedicated Consumer Care and Life Sciences company. 
Across these markets, innovation and sustainability will be the core drivers of our future growth.

In developing and implementing our Remuneration Policy the Committee has been mindful to ensure that every element of reward directly aligns  
to our strategy, ensuring we provide and protect long-term shareholder value.

One third of awards are deferred, further protecting

Sustainability is at the centre of Croda’s strategy  
and our senior annual Bonus Plan includes an ESG 
metric. One third of awards are deferred, further 
protecting shareholder value. 

A measure of earnings growth over a three-year 
period recognising that sustained growth can only 
come through relentless innovation.
Measured against our peers, a key indicator of 
long-term growth and shareholder value.

An established measure of innovation, the metric is 
growth of NPP, those products rewarding growth 
that is driven by innovation.

Since 2020 we have incorporated sustainability 
metrics directly linked to our ambitions to be 
Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030.

To enhance the rigour with which performance is reviewed the Committee has adopted a Discretion Framework which it applies when assessing 
bonus and long-term incentive plan outcomes.

of the plan periods.

How our Remuneration Policy reflects the UK Corporate Governance Code
When developing the Remuneration Policy, the Committee was mindful of the UK Corporate Governance Code and considers that the executive 
remuneration framework appropriately addresses the following factors:

Factors

Clarity

How these are addressed

Our commitment to openness and transparency is reflected in our reward principles. The Committee is committed to 
providing open and transparent disclosure on executive remuneration for our stakeholders.

Our arrangements are clearly disclosed and any changes to our Remuneration Policy and its operation are highlighted  
in a way that defines their alignment to both our strategic ambitions as well as the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.

Simplicity

Our executive remuneration arrangements, as well as those throughout the global organisation, are simple in nature and 
well understood by both participants and shareholders.

Risk

Our senior annual Bonus Plan, in which around 550 of our global employees participate, is primarily based on a single  
profit metric, with a simple key requirement that no bonus can be paid for this element until the previous year’s profit  
is exceeded.

The Committee considers that the structure of incentive arrangements does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking. 
Performance is based on a balance of metrics which also reflect our broader stakeholders, for example inclusion of 
sustainability targets and health and safety underpins. We then take a holistic assessment of performance using our 
Discretion Framework.

Annual bonus deferral, the PSP holding period and our shareholding guidelines provide a clear link to the ongoing 
performance of the business as well as alignment with shareholders. Executives will be rewarded for sustainable  
long-term shareholder return.

Malus and clawback provisions also apply for both the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP.

Predictability

Our Remuneration Policy contains details of maximum opportunity levels for each component of pay, with actual incentive 
outcomes varying depending on the level of performance achieved against specific measures.

Proportionality

Our Remuneration Policy directly aligns to our strategy and financial performance. The Committee considers performance 
from a range of perspectives. Poor financial performance is not rewarded.

Alignment 
to culture

Alignment to our ‘One Croda’ culture is clearly established in our Remuneration Policy. Our senior annual Bonus Plan has 
the same metrics for all participants. Our PSP metrics, and from 2023 our senior annual Bonus Plan ESG metric, reflect our 
commitment to sustainability. Pensions are also aligned across the workforce.

Workforce engagement
We continue to develop our approach to workforce engagement. We believe it is important to our culture and our values to have an active dialogue 
with employees on topics such as reward, recognition, motivation, wellbeing, safety, and inclusion. A summary of engagement activities undertaken 
to date is as follows:

Reward principles

Our reward principles, which were developed and approved during 2019, guide the way we recognise and 
remunerate all our global employees. These principles focus on total reward including intangible rewards and  
were strongly influenced by the results of our previous Global Employee Survey. These have been shared across 
the organisation.

Employee pulse surveys In 2023 a number of pulse surveys covering a range of topics, including culture and reward, were undertaken and

A dedicated email address has been established for employees to send comments or questions to the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee.

Committee members are updated annually on global employees’ terms and conditions and are made aware of any 
significant changes to policies and other pay-related matters.

How our Remuneration Policy relates to reward in the wider employee context
When making decisions about executive remuneration the Committee considers the pay and reward structures across the business. Annually, the 
President Human Resources provides the Committee with a review of workforce remuneration, and the Committee is updated periodically on any 
feedback received on remuneration practices across the Group.

One of the principles of Croda’s culture is to drive ‘One Croda’, therefore, many of the remuneration structures that apply to Executives also apply 
further in the global organisation, as set out in the table below. The key difference between the policy for Executive Directors compared to other 
employees is that remuneration for Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and share ownership.

We reviewed our Living Wage levels in 2023 and made any 
adjustments necessary in order to continue paying a Living Wage  
to all employees. Through 2023 we made good progress in gaining 
accreditation for our work from the Fair Wage Network and expect to 
be able to confirm this by the end of the first quarter of 2024. In 2022 
we also began the process of ensuring all our regular contractors are 
paid a Living Wage and plan to achieve this milestone by the end  
of 2024.

More than just pay
Our employees and our culture remain central to the continued 
success of Croda. We have continued to enhance our offering of 
activities available to employees, including:

•  We are proud of the training and development that we provide for 
employees and have set a target of ensuring all employees receive 
at least one week of training a year by the end of 2025. In 2023,  
our employees undertook over 197,000 hours of training with the 
average number of hours an employee completed being 34 hours.

•  In 2021 we relaunched and redesigned our core company 

development programmes for senior leaders and future leaders with 
our values at their heart. 2023 was the second year many of these 
programmes were able to run and all programmes have been 
positively received by employees.

•  In 2021 we also launched an inclusion-based global leadership 

programme, Phoenix Rising. In 2023, we invited a third cohort to 
begin this programme, with participants joining from all over the 
world, and invited the participants from 2021 and 2022 cohorts  
to meet at a week-long “Phoenix Rising Unites” learning event.  
We also ran a series of leadership webinars on diversity &  
inclusive leadership.

•  Each of our sites is tasked with ensuring at least four health and 

wellbeing events are run per year, with many sites running 
significantly more than this. We also continued with Employee 
Assistance Programmes in many of our countries. 

See pages 16 & 17 for further information on our culture including 
details on how we approach the recruitment, development and training 
of our workforce.

Sharing success across the business
The Committee believes in sharing success across the business and 
extending share ownership more widely across our employee base. 
This is promoted through the operation of our ‘Free Share Plan’ and  
a number of all-employee share schemes.

Free Share Plan
In 2021 we launched the ‘Free Share Plan’. Under this new plan, all 
employees globally who are not eligible for the senior annual Bonus 
Plan are gifted Croda shares (or the cash equivalent) if the senior 
annual Bonus Plan pays out. Unlike other elements of remuneration 
this award is not set as a multiple of salary, instead it rewards all eligible 
employees at the same value.

The Free Share Plan was developed in response to findings from the 
Global Reward Survey in 2020 and aims to share success more widely 
across the business and encourage share ownership.

As the senior annual Bonus Plan did not pay out for 2023, no award 
was made under the Free Share Plan.

All-employee share plans 
Workforce participation in these plans has remained consistently  
strong and is driven by our culture of employees feeling a strong  
loyalty to the business.

regular contractors are paid at, or above, the rates advised by the 
Living Wage Foundation.

In addition, the business continues to pursue its Global Living Wage 
target, one of our sustainability KPIs linked to the UN SDGs. In 2020 
we forged a partnership with the Fair Wage Network (FWN) to establish, 
using an independent and economically rigorous methodology, Living 
Wage levels across the world. In 2021, we compared our global wage 
levels to Living Wage comparators provided by the FWN and made all 
necessary adjustments to ensure that all our employees are now paid  
a Living Wage at a minimum.

of employees received a sales bonus but the median bonus for both female and male employees was zero giving a median bonus gap of 0%. 

We are confident that our gender pay gap is not an equal pay issue but is a result of a lack of female representation across our business at senior 
levels and particularly in production roles which represent the bulk of the workforce between the 25th and 75th percentile. Addressing this issue will 
require a long-term approach but we have already begun work to increase the number of females working in production and in senior positions.

Over 2023 42% of hires and promotions to leadership positions were female, with the number of women in leadership positions now at 39% 
(2022: 38%).

Other actions taken to address the gender pay gap include:

•  Ensuring balanced shortlists for all appointments where possible with a target of having 80% of shortlists gender balanced.
•  Further improving our talent and succession planning processes to help identify and nurture talent early in their career. 
•  Ensuring that our global talent development programmes continue to have a gender-balanced mix of participants.
•  Supporting female leaders in their development, offering attendance on programmes such as Solaris, a women’s executive leadership 

development programme for women specifically of Black heritage.

•  Finding ways to reduce shift work (especially night work) and to examine the feasibility of part-time and job share arrangements in our  

production facilities.

•  Continuing to invest in our STEM activities to encourage a wide range of applicants to apply for roles in our business.

UK CEO pay ratio
The table below sets out the ratio of the CEO’s ‘single figure’ total remuneration to the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile full-time equivalent total 
remuneration of the Company’s UK employees. The pay ratios are calculated on a Group-wide basis by reference to UK employees only.

Under the regulations, there are three methodologies that companies can choose to report their pay ratio, known as Option A, B and C. For 2023 
we have chosen to continue to use the Government’s preferred option, Option A. Using this methodology, we have determined the full-time 
equivalent total remuneration for all UK employees and have ranked this data to identify employees whose remuneration places them at the 25th, 
50th and 75th percentile. The pay ratios are then calculated by comparing total remuneration for these three employees against our CEO ‘single 
figure’ total remuneration.

1.  Calculations for the workforce exclude severance pay, notice pay, SIP repayments, fractional share payments, SAR payments and relocation expenses.
2.  The calculations for the workforce exclude the value of the defined benefit pension plan due to the difficulty of calculating these figures for our complex historical 

pension arrangements.

3.  Calculations of sales bonus for a small number of the workforce reflect an estimate at the time of the calculation of the ratio. The actual amounts paid to these 

employees will be finalised in March 2024 and the ratio will be updated in next year’s report to reflect the actual amounts paid. 

4.  Calculations for the workforce include amounts granted under the Restricted Share Plan and Free Share Plan. Unlike the PSP these figures will not be restated  

at vesting.

5.  Excludes Non-Executive Directors, contractors and employees who left during the relevant year.
6.  New starters, part-time employees and employees on long-term sick and maternity are included; their salary has been amended to reflect a full-time and  

full-year salary.

 * The ratio for 2022 has been restated. This is to reflect the updated CEO ‘single figure’ total remuneration for 2022, which was due to the 2022 PSP award being 
updated to reflect the actual share price at vesting. Where relevant PSP calculations for the workforce have also been updated on the same basis. Annual bonus 
amounts for the workforce have also been updated to reflect the actual amounts paid in March 2023.

**  The CEO pay ratio for 2018 was calculated using Option C, which enabled us to calculate, on an indicative basis, the total remuneration packages of three individual 
UK employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile. Option C was used in 2018 because the full administrative process to enable us to calculate the equivalent total 
remuneration for UK employees was not in place.

The CEO pay ratio is calculated based on the total remuneration payable to the CEO, which could include payments under the senior annual  
Bonus Plan and PSP. The outcomes of these elements are directly linked to performance, with the value of the PSP also incorporating share price 
growth. It is therefore expected that the ratios will fluctuate significantly year-on-year to reflect Croda’s performance. In respect of the 2023 figures, 
as the senior annual Bonus Plan did not pay out and the PSP has paid out at a lower level, from 100% in 2022 to 37.1% in 2023, the ratio has 
decreased significantly.

Annual bonus
The annual bonus for Executive Directors in 2023 was calculated by reference to profit and safety performance. In line with our well established 
practice, profit targets were set based on the amount by which the profit for the year exceeded the profit for 2022 (the ‘Bonusable Profit’). 
Bonusable Profit is focused on operational profitability based on Group EBITDA, and, consistent with last year, was adjusted for the divestment of 
our PTIC business and the lipid system sales for our principal Covid-19 vaccine contract.

While not applicable for 2023, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce (including to zero) the amount of any payment under the 
scheme if it considers the safety, health or environment (SHE) performance is in serious non-compliance with the Croda SHE policy statement, 
document of minimum standards. In addition, the Committee can also reduce any payment (including to zero) if it considers the underlying business 
performance of the Company is not sufficient to support the payment of any bonus. The Committee also applies the Discretion Framework, a 
rigorous framework for the application of judgement and discretion, when reviewing awards (see page 114).

2.  EPS growth p.a. is calculated on a simple average basis over the three-year period. The calculation of the EPS growth has been adjusted for the divestment of the

3.  Emissions in 2020 were independently verified by Avieco.

The PSP awards granted in March 2021 were subject to an EVA 
underpin such that an improvement in EVA over the three-year PSP 
performance period was required. In circumstances where the 
underpin is not achieved, the underpin operates such that the 
Committee considers an appropriate reduction (including to nil) to the 
vesting of awards. In certain circumstances, the Committee retains the 
right not to apply discretion.

The EVA in respect of 2023 did not exceed EVA in 2020 (the year  
prior to the start of the performance period). The Committee therefore 
considered the level of reduction to apply to the PSP vesting outcome. 

In relation to the EVA underpin, the Committee took into account  
the following:

•  Consideration of the various factors which had impacted EVA 
performance over the period, which included both business 
performance as well as external factors such as market challenges, 
interest rate increases and their impact on the notional cost of capital 
in the EVA calculation. 

•  The degree to which the overall PSP vesting outcome had already 
been impacted, in particular through the TSR and EPS metrics 
which align to shareholder value and profitability. The TSR outcome 
was zero, and the Adjusted EPS outcome was at threshold. These 
measures together comprised 70% of the award, and therefore 
overall vesting had already been significantly impacted by the 
downturn in performance in the final year of the performance period. 

122

Croda International Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2023

•  That on an aggregate basis, EVA over the performance period was 

significantly positive.

As part of its deliberations the Committee also took into account  
the Discretion Framework where a range of factors are considered to 
ensure payout is consistent with and reflective of overall performance 
over the period. Our PSP performance framework includes 
consideration of both financial performance, as well as innovation and 
sustainability, which are key drivers to Croda’s long term strategic 
success. The Committee noted the strong performance in innovation 
via NPP performance, and in relation to sustainability, the land savings, 
and the specific actions that have contributed to a reduction in our 
Scope 1 emissions. However the Committee also recognised that the 
outturn against the emissions targets had benefitted from the lower 
volumes in the year. 

Taking into account both the EVA underpin and the Discretion 
Framework, it was considered that a downwards adjustment of 10% 
was appropriate, reducing the overall PSP vesting outcome from 
41.2% to 37.1%. 

Overall, considering the adjustments to both the annual bonus and 
PSP out-turns, the Committee is satisfied that incentive outcomes  
are reflective of overall performance.

The forecast vesting value of the awards made in March 2021 is 
included in the 2023 single figure table on page 120. Any shares 
vesting will be subject to a two-year holding period.

performance as well as external factors such as market challenges, 

interest rate increases and their impact on the notional cost of capital 

in the EVA calculation. 

•  The degree to which the overall PSP vesting outcome had already 

been impacted, in particular through the TSR and EPS metrics 

which align to shareholder value and profitability. The TSR outcome 

was zero, and the Adjusted EPS outcome was at threshold. These 

measures together comprised 70% of the award, and therefore 

overall vesting had already been significantly impacted by the 

downturn in performance in the final year of the performance period. 

Taking into account both the EVA underpin and the Discretion 

Framework, it was considered that a downwards adjustment of 10% 

was appropriate, reducing the overall PSP vesting outcome from 

41.2% to 37.1%. 

Overall, considering the adjustments to both the annual bonus and 

PSP out-turns, the Committee is satisfied that incentive outcomes  

are reflective of overall performance.

The forecast vesting value of the awards made in March 2021 is 

included in the 2023 single figure table on page 120. Any shares 

vesting will be subject to a two-year holding period.

The 2023 PSP awards were granted in two installments. The first grant of 225% and 175% of salary for Steve Foots and Louisa Burdett, 
respectively, was made on 17 March 2023 at the same time as awards for other employees. Following the approval of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy at the 2023 AGM, which included an increase to the maximum PSP of 25% of base salary for both Steve Foots and Louisa Burdett a further 
grant of 25% of salary was made on 2 May 2023.

The 2023 PSP awards are subject to a performance condition which is split into three parts: 35% EPS, 35% TSR, and 30% sustainability metrics, 
including NPP. Performance targets were disclosed in full last year, see page 112 of our Annual Report and Accounts 2022. Vesting will take place 
on a sliding scale. A ROIC underpin applies across the entire award, also detailed on page 112 of our Annual Report and Accounts 2022.

Any shares vesting will be subject to a two-year holding period.

Jez Maiden retired in 2023 and as such was not granted a PSP award for 2023. Louisa Burdett will forfeit this award considering her resignation. 

All-employee share plans
Executive Directors are invited to participate in the HMRC tax-approved UK Sharesave Scheme and the Croda Share Incentive Plan (SIP) in line 
with, and on the same terms as, the wider UK workforce.

SIP
Details of shares purchased and awarded to Executive Directors under the SIP are shown in the table below. A brief description of the SIP is set out

There have been no changes in the interests of any Director between 31 December 2023 and the date of this report, except for the purchase of five 
SIP shares and the award of five matching shares by Steve Foots during January and February 2024. Jez Maiden was not eligible to remain in the 
SIP after his retirement and therefore holding at the end of 2023 was nil. As Louisa Burdett had under one year of service through 2023 she was 
not eligible to participate in the SIP. 

 * Jez Maiden also had seven additional shares acquired through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

 * Neither Steve Foots, Jez Maiden or Louisa Burdett were active members of the Croda Pension Scheme in 2023 or 2022.

Croda has a number of different pension plans in the countries in which we operate. Pension entitlements for Executive Directors are tailored to 
local market practice, length of service and the participant’s age. In 2016, a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) scheme was introduced 
with a cap applied to pension benefits; at this time the cap was set at £65,000. The cap is increased each year in line with inflation, and from April 
2024 will be £80,445. Employees who earn in excess of the pension cap or who cannot be members of the plan due to tax limitations receive a 
pension supplement. For Executive Directors this supplement is up to 20% of salary in line with the wider UK workforce.

Steve Foots’ historic pension provision
Steve Foots was a member of the Croda Pension Scheme up to 
31 January 2021. Steve Foots accrued pension benefits under the 
Croda Pension Scheme up to this date with a CARE accrual rate of 
1/60th and an entitlement to retire at age 60. From 6 April 2011 
onwards, pension benefits accruing were based on a capped salary. 
This cap was £187,500 until April 2014 at which point it reduced to 
£150,000, and due to annual allowance regulations and changes to 
the pension scheme, reduced to £37,500 in April 2016 (reduced from 
the scheme cap of £65,650 due to annual allowance regulations) and 
reduced again in April 2020 to £15,000 following new annual allowance 
regulations. If Steve Foots retires before the age of 60, a reduction will 
be applied to the element of his pension accrued before 6 April 2006, 
unless he is retiring at the Company’s request. In the event of death,  
a pension equal to two thirds of the Director’s pension would become 
payable to the surviving spouse. Steve Foots’ pension in payment is 
guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum 
of 10% per annum for benefits accrued before 6 April 2006, and in line 
with inflation up to a maximum of 2.5% per annum for benefits accrued 
from 6 April 2006 onwards.

Steve Foots is entitled to death-in-service benefits from an Excepted 
Life Policy. Steve Foots elected to opt out of the Croda Pension 
Scheme from 31 January 2021 and therefore only now receives a 
pension supplement of 20% of salary.

Louisa Burdett’s pension provision
Louisa Burdett elected not to join the Croda Pension Scheme and was 
therefore paid a pension supplement of 20% of salary in 2023. She is 
entitled to death-in-service benefits from an Excepted Life Policy.

Jez Maiden’s pension provision
Jez Maiden elected not to join the Croda Pension Scheme and was 
therefore paid a pension supplement of 20% of salary in 2023. He  
was entitled to death-in-service benefits from an Excepted Life Policy.

1.  The benefits for Non-Executive Directors relate to the undertaking of business travel on behalf of Croda and ensuring the Directors are not out of pocket for related 
tax. No taxable business travel expenses were claimed by Non-Executive Directors in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore there are no comparable 
figures to give a % change in 2021. In 2022, Non-Executive Directors travel returned to pre-pandemic levels, however, reflective of the low levels of travel in the prior 
year, the % change figures are not meaningful. These are 35,311% for Dame Anita Frew DBE, 471% for Roberto Cirillo, 1,726% for Jacqui Ferguson, 238% for 
Helena Ganczakowski, 4,744% for Keith Layden, 727% for John Ramsay and -73% for Julie Kim. For a full breakdown of the benefits for non-Executive Directors 
see page 127.

2.  Bonus including annual bonus, DBSP and sales bonus.
3.  The senior annual Bonus Plan and Croda Europe Discretionary Bonus Scheme did not pay out for 2019 or 2020 and therefore there is no comparable figure to give 
a % change in 2021 for Executive Directors or the Average employee of the Group’s parent Company. For the Average UK employee, the % change in 2020 relates 
to only a small number of employees who received a sales bonus. As the senior annual Bonus Plan and Croda Europe Discretionary Bonus Scheme paid out in full 
for 2021, the bonus received by the Average UK employee in 2021 is significantly higher and as such the % change is not meaningful.

4.  Excluding Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors.
5.  Louisa Burdett appointed 1 January 2023.
6.  Jez Maiden retired from the Company on 31 May 2023. His salary and benefits were paid up until the date of his departure.
7.  In 2020 Helena Ganczakowski was appointed as the Senior Independent Director and John Ramsay was appointed as the Chair of the Audit Committee.  

Their fees were pro-rated accordingly.

8.  Helena Ganczakowski was replaced by Jacqui Ferguson as the Chair of the Remuneration Committee on 1 September 2022 and the fees for both were  

pro-rated accordingly. 

9.  Helena Ganczakowski stepped down from the Board on 26 April 2023.
10. John Ramsay was appointed to the Board on 1 January 2020 and therefore has no comparable remuneration figures for 2019.
11. Julie Kim was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2021 and voluntarily decided to waive her fees for 2021 and January 2022, she therefore has no comparable 

remuneration figures for 2020 or 2021.

12. Nawal Ouzren was appointed to the Board 1 February 2022 and therefore has no comparable remuneration figures for 2021.
13. Chris Good was appointed to the Board 27 April 2023 and therefore has no comperable remuneration figures for 2022.

Performance-related senior annual Bonus Plan – to incentivise and reward delivery of the Group’s key annual objectives and to 
contribute to longer-term alignment with shareholders

The senior annual Bonus Plan provides  
for payment of an annual bonus to  
Executive Directors and other senior 
employees of the Group, subject to  
certain performance conditions. 

Normally one third of any bonus payable is 
compulsorily deferred into shares for three 
years through the Deferred Bonus Share  
Plan (DBSP).

The Committee has the discretion to permit 
DBSP awards to benefit from dividends on 
shares that vest.

The balance of the bonus is paid in cash.

Group Chief Executive: 175% of salary.

•  The majority of the bonus will typically be based 

Other Executive Director: 150% of salary.

In exceptional circumstances, and only 
in connection with recruitment, annual 
awards may be made up to 200% of 
salary. This maximum does not apply to 
the incumbent Executive Directors at 
the time the Policy is approved.

on challenging financial targets set in line with the 
Group’s KPIs (for example profit growth targets).

•  For a minority of the bonus, targets related to 
other Group measures, such as sustainability, 
may be included where this is considered 
appropriate by the Committee.

•  For a profit measure, bonus normally starts to 

accrue once the threshold target is met, from 0% 
payable rising on a graduated scale to 100% for 
outperformance. Were an additional financial KPI 
metric to be introduced, the amount payable for 
threshold performance would not exceed 25%  
of maximum.

•  In relation to any sustainability measure, the 
structure of the target will vary based on the 
nature of the target set.

•  The Committee applies a Discretion Framework, 
which includes health, safety and environmental 
performance, when determining the actual overall 
level of individual bonus payments and it may 
adjust the bonus awards (including potentially 
reducing to zero) if it considers it appropriate  
to do so.

•  Bonuses paid are subject to provisions that 

enable the Committee to recover value overpaid 
through the withholding of variable pay previously 
earned or granted (malus) or through requesting 
a payment from an individual (clawback) in the 
event of a misstatement of results, an error in 
assessing the performance conditions, serious 
misconduct, serious reputational damage or 
material corporate failure. The provisions will 
operate for a three-year period following the  
date on which the bonus is paid.

Performance Share Plan (PSP) – to incentivise and reward the execution of business strategy over the longer term and to reward 
sustained growth in profit and shareholder value

The PSP provides for awards of free shares 
(i.e. either conditional shares or nil-cost 
options) normally made annually which vest 
after three years subject to continued service 
and the achievement of challenging 
performance conditions. 

Shares are subject to a two-year post-vesting 
holding period.

The Committee has the discretion to permit 
awards to benefit from the dividends paid on 
shares that vest.

Normal maximum opportunity of:

•  Group Chief Executive: 250%  

of salary.

•  Other Executive Director: 200%  

of salary.

In exceptional circumstances  
(e.g. recruitment), awards may be 
granted up to 300% of salary (e.g. to 
compensate for value forfeited from  
a previous employer).

financial (e.g. EPS), shareholder return  
(e.g. relative TSR) and strategic targets  
(e.g. sustainability). The performance targets  
may also include an additional underpin  
(e.g. a ROIC underpin).

•  Targets will normally be tested over three years.
•  In relation to financial targets (e.g. EPS growth 

and TSR) 25% of awards subject to such targets 
will vest for threshold performance with a 
graduated scale operating through to full  
vesting for equalling or exceeding the maximum 
performance targets (no awards vest for 
performance below threshold). In relation  
to strategic targets or underpin targets, the 
structure of the target will vary based on the 
nature of target set (e.g. for milestone strategic 
targets it may not always be practicable to set 
such targets using a graduated scale and so 
vesting may take place in full for strategic targets 
if the criteria are met in full).

•  Vesting is also dependent on application of the 
Discretion Framework, including satisfactory 
underlying financial performance of the Group 
over the performance period, and the Committee 
may adjust outcomes (including potentially 
reducing to zero) if it considers it appropriate  
to do so.

•  There are also provisions that enable the 

Committee to recover value overpaid through the 
withholding of variable pay previously earned or 
granted (malus) or through requesting a payment 
from an individual (clawback) in the event of a 
misstatement of results, an error in assessing  
the performance conditions, serious misconduct, 
serious reputational damage or material 
corporate failure. The provisions will operate for a 
three-year period following the date on which the 
PSP awards vest.

Directors’ report

Other disclosures
Pages 70 to 138 inclusive, together with the sections of the 
Annual Report and Accounts incorporated by reference, constitute 
a Directors’ Report that has been drawn up and presented in 
accordance with applicable English company law; the liabilities of the 
Directors in connection with that report are subject to the limitations 
and restrictions provided by that law.

Research and development 
Research and development activities are undertaken with the prospect 
of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.

Dividends 
The Directors are recommending a final dividend of 62.0p per share 
(2022: 61.0p). If approved by shareholders, total dividends for the year 
will amount to 109.0p per share (2022: 108.0p). Details of dividends 
are shown in note 8 on page 169; details of the Company’s Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan can be found on page 204. The Company has 
established various Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) in connection with 
the obligation to satisfy future share awards under employee share 
incentive schemes. The trustees of the EBTs have waived their rights  
to receive dividends on certain Ordinary Shares of the Company held 
in the EBTs. Such waivers represent less than 1% of the total dividend 
payable on the Company’s Ordinary Shares. Further details of the 
EBTs can be found in note 24 on page 193. 

Directors 
The Company’s Articles of Association (Articles) give the Directors 
power to appoint and replace Directors. Under the terms of  
reference of the Nomination Committee, any appointment must be 
recommended by the Nomination Committee for approval by the 
Board of Directors. The present Directors of the Company are shown 
on pages 72 to 73. 

In line with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, each 
Director will be standing for election or re-election at the AGM, with  
the exception of Anita Frew who will retire at the AGM. Details of the 
Directors’ service contracts are given in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 127 to 128. 

Apart from the share option schemes, long-term incentive schemes 
and service contracts, no Director had any beneficial interest in any 
contract to which the Company or a subsidiary was a party during the 
year. A statement indicating the beneficial and non-beneficial interests 
of the Directors in the share capital of the Company, including share 
options, is shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 125.

The Directors are responsible for managing the business of 
the Company and may exercise all the powers of the Company subject 
to the provisions of relevant statutes, the Company’s Articles and any 
directions given by special resolution.

Directors’ indemnities 
The Company maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance  
that gives appropriate cover for any legal action brought against its 
Directors. The Company has also granted indemnities to each of its 
Directors, members of the Executive Committee and the Company 
Secretary, which represent ‘qualifying third party indemnity provisions’ 
(as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006), in relation to 
certain losses and liabilities that the Directors, Executive Committee 
members or Company Secretary may incur to third parties in the 
course of acting as Directors or the Company Secretary or as 
employees of the Company or of any associated company. In addition, 
such indemnities have been granted to other officers of the Company 
who are Directors of subsidiary companies within the Group. Such 
indemnities were in place during 2023 and at the date of approval of 
the Group financial statements.

Share capital 
At the date of this report, 142,536,884 Ordinary Shares of 10.609756p 
each have been issued and are fully paid up and quoted on the London 
Stock Exchange. At the date of this Report, the Company has issued 
and fully paid up 21,900 7.5% Cumulative Preference Shares, 498,434 
6.6% Cumulative Preference Shares and 615,562 5.9% Cumulative 
Preference Shares, all of £1 each (the Preference Shares). The rights 
and obligations attached to the Company’s Ordinary Shares and 
Preference Shares are set out in the Articles. The Articles are available 
on the Company’s website www.croda.com or copies can be obtained 
from Companies House in the UK or by writing to the Company 
Secretary. There are no restrictions on the voting rights attached to  
the Company’s Ordinary Shares or on the transfer of securities in the 
Company. The 7.5% Cumulative Preference Shares do not confer on 
the holders any right to receive notice of or to be present or to vote at 
any general meeting of the Company unless the cumulative preferential 
dividend on such shares is more than 12 calendar months in arrears. 
The 6.6% and 5.9% Cumulative Preference Shares do not confer on 
the holders any right to receive notice of or to be present or to vote at 
any general meeting of the Company, unless the cumulative preferential 
dividend on such shares is more than six calendar months in arrears or 
the business of the general meeting includes the consideration of a 
resolution for reducing the share capital of the Company, to sell the 
undertaking of the Company or to alter the Articles. No person holds 
securities in the Company that carry special rights with regard to 
control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights. 

Power to issue or buy back shares 
At the 2023 AGM, authority was given to the Directors to allot unissued 
shares in the Company up to a maximum amount equivalent to 
approximately one third of the issued share capital, excluding shares 
held in treasury, for general purposes, plus up to a further one third of 
the Company’s issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, 
but only in the case of a rights issue.

A further special resolution passed at that meeting granted authority to 
the Directors to allot equity securities in the Company for cash, without 
regard to the pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Both 
of these authorities expire on the date of the 2024 AGM, that is 24 April 
2024, and so the Directors propose to renew them for a further year.

characteristic or is disadvantaged by conditions or requirements that 
cannot be shown to be justified. Group human resources policies are 
clearly communicated to all of our employees and are available through 
the Company intranet. 

Recruitment and progression: It is established policy throughout the 
business that decisions on recruitment, career development, promotion 
and other employment related issues are made solely on the grounds 
of individual ability, achievement, expertise and conduct.

people with disabilities, having regard to their particular aptitudes and 
abilities. Should an employee become disabled during their

employment with reasonable adjustments being made to the 
workplace and role where feasible. Retraining is provided if necessary.

workforce. The continuous development of all of our employees 
is key to meeting the future demands of our customers, especially

Involvement: We are committed to ensuring that employees share 
in the success of the Group. Owning shares in the Company is an 
important way of strengthening involvement in the development  
of the business and bringing together employees’ and shareholders’ 
interests. In 2023, 83% of our UK employees and 71% of our non-UK 
employees participated in one of our all-employee share plans, 
indicating employees’ continued desire to be involved in the Company. 

Employees are kept informed of matters of interest to them in a  
variety of ways, including the Company magazine, Croda Way; 
quarterly updates; the Company intranet, SharePoint; team briefings; 
podcasts; webinars; Yammer, and Croda Now email messages.  
These communications help achieve a common awareness of the 
financial and economic factors affecting the performance of Croda  
and of changes within the business. We are committed to providing 
employees with opportunities to share their views and provide 
feedback on issues that are important to them. The Directors maintain 
oversight of employee matters through the Board and Committee 
meeting processes and information flows, including regular updates on 
employee matters and employee feedback received through employee 
engagement surveys. How the Directors engaged with employees and 
considered their interests when taking key decisions is further detailed 
on pages 78 to 81.

accordance with applicable law and regulations. 

Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that

statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and 
of the Group’s profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of 
the Group and parent Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to: 

•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply  

them consistently; 

•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable,  

relevant, reliable and prudent; 

•  for the Group financial statements, state whether they  
have been prepared in accordance with international 
accounting standards in conformity UK-adopted  
international accounting standards; 

•  for the parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the parent Company financial statements; 

•  assess the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue 

as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern; and 

•  use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 

at any time the financial position of the parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 

Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 

In accordance with Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 
(“DTR”) 4.1.16R, the financial statements will form part of the 
annual financial report prepared under Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rule (“DTR”) 4.1.17R and 4.1.18R. The auditor’s 
report on these financial statements provides no assurance over 
whether the annual financial report has been prepared in 
accordance with those requirements.

Responsibility statement of the Directors in 
respect of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 

•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 

applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and 

•  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face. 

We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.

Vs 
FY22 

Our risk assessment considers the Group’s operations, the macro-economic 
environment and other relevant external factors which impact the results of the 
Group. Having considered these external factors, we have identified the below 
key audit matters. 
The estimated recoverable amount of the Flavours goodwill is sensitive to changes 
in key assumptions. There is limited headroom in the model and therefore the 
recoverable amount of goodwill in the Flavours CGU continues to be a key audit 
matter, however the level of risk has reduced compared to FY22 as a result of the 
impairment recognised the prior year. We have identified the valuation of the 
Flavours Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to be a significant risk of error.  
We have identified the valuation of the UK defined benefit pension scheme liabilities 
as a key audit matter given the scheme remains open to future accrual and new 
members, and due to the significant estimation uncertainty with regards to key 
assumptions used for determining the valuation of gross defined benefit liabilities. 
The sensitivity of the estimation is heightened when there is volatility in the macro-
economic conditions, as currently experienced in the UK in FY22 and FY23. 
Following the divestment of the PTIC (“Performance Technologies and Industrial 
Chemicals”) businesses in FY22, the key focus for the Parent Company audit is 
the recoverability of the shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by 
Group undertakings given they represent a significant portion of the Company's 
assets; accordingly this has been reinstated as a key audit matter. 
During the year, the Audit Committee (“AC”) met five times. KPMG are invited to attend all AC meetings and are provided with an 
opportunity to meet with the AC in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have 
set out communications with the AC in section 4, including matters that required particular judgement for each. The matters included in 
the Audit Committee Chair’s report on pages 100 to 105 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings.

We have not performed any non-audit services during FY23 or subsequently 
which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.  
We were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year ended  
31 December 2018. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for  
the 6 financial years ended 31 December 2023.  
The Group engagement partner is required to rotate every five years. As these are 
the third set of the Group’s financial statements signed by Ian Griffiths, he will be 
required to rotate off after the FY25 audit.

Materiality  
(item 6 below) 

The scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and our assessed risk of material misstatement.  
We have determined overall materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole at £16m (FY22: £18m) and for the Parent 
Company financial statements as a whole at £8.7m (FY22: £8.7m).  
Consistent with FY22, we determined that Group profit before tax from continuing operations (“PBT”) normalised for goodwill 
impairment, and restructuring costs, remains the benchmark for the Group as the Group is a profit-making trading business.  
As such, we based our Group materiality on normalised PBT, of which it represents 4.7% (FY22: 4.7%).  
Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements was determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company  
total assets of which it represents 0.3% (FY22: 0.3%).

Group scope  
(item 7 below) 

We have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group’s components are likely to 
include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, the type of procedures to be performed at these 
components and the extent of involvement required from our component auditors around the world. 
Of the Group’s 86 reporting components, we subjected 8 (FY22: 11) to full scope audits for Group purposes and 6 (FY22: 4)  
to specified risk-focused audit procedures as these are not individually significant but were included in the scope of our Group 
reporting work in order to provide further coverage over the Group’s results. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated below. 
In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material 
misstatement exist in those components.  
We consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.

The impact of 
climate change 
on our audit 

In planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of climate change on the Group’s business and its financial 
statements. The Group is monitoring Climate Positive targets and Science Based Targets in line with limiting global warming to 
1.5ºC by 2030, and to be climate net zero by 2050. Climate change initiatives impact the Group in a variety of ways including 
opportunities and risks relating to bio-based raw material supply, operational and supply chain decarbonisation and emerging 
regulatory requirements such as carbon taxes. Further information is provided on pages 59 to 67.  
The Group considered the impact of climate change and the Group’s targets in the preparation of the financial statements, 
including an evaluation of critical accounting estimates and judgements. The Group concluded that this did not have a material 
effect on the consolidated financial statements, as described on pages 157 and 158.  
We performed a risk assessment, taking into account climate change risks and commitments made by the Group, considering 
how climate change may impact the financial statements and our audit. This included enquiries of management, consideration  
of the Group’s processes for assessing the potential impact of climate change risk on the consolidated financial statements and 
assessing the TCFD scenario analysis performed by the Group, including their assessment of critical accounting estimates and 
judgements, and the effect on our audit. Our risk assessment considered in particular the potential impact on the recoverable 
amount of goodwill and intangible assets, the estimates made regarding useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment, 
going concern and the valuation of certain unquoted pension assets. 
We held discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment. 
Based on our risk assessment we determined that the climate related risks to the Group’s business, strategy and financial 
planning do not have a significant impact on balances in the consolidated financial statements or on our key audit matters. 
We have read the Group’s disclosure of climate related information in the front half of the Annual Report as set out on pages  
98 and 99, and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.

3.  Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties 
The Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company  
or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group’s and the Parent Company’s financial position means that this is realistic.  
They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern 
for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”).  

Going concern 

We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment 
to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might 
affect the Group’s and Parent Company’s financial resources or ability to continue 
operations over the going concern period (going concern is considered 12 months from 
approval of the financial statements). The Group issued two profit warnings in 2023 to 
announce the reduction in its expected profit before tax at year end. The reduced profits 
were driven by customer destocking activities which were unprecedented as set out in the 
Strategic Report on page 19. The risk that we considered most likely to adversely affect the 
Group’s and Parent Company’s available financial resources and metrics relevant to debt 
covenants over this period was:  
•  Further customer destocking and weaker demand could have an adverse impact on the 

Group’s future cashflows, forecasts and overall profitability, as seen through 2023 

We also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as regulatory 
incidents, site incidents and impact of product quality issues leading to a product recall or 
loss of revenue which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.  
We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity or covenant 
compliance in the going concern period by assessing the degree of downside assumption 
that, individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity issue, taking into account the 
Group’s current and projected cash and facilities (a reverse stress test). We also assessed 
the completeness of the going concern disclosure on page 157.  
Accordingly, based on those procedures, we found the Directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting without any material uncertainty for the Group and Parent Company  
to be acceptable. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as 
subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were 
reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the 
Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation. 

Our conclusions 

•  We consider that the Directors' use of the going 

concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 
financial statements is appropriate; 

•  We have not identified, and concur with the Directors' 
assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty 
related to events or conditions that, individually or 
collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's 
or Parent Company's ability to continue as a going 
concern for the going concern period; 

•  We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to the Directors' statement on page 157 of the 
financial statements on the use of the going concern 
basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt over the Group and Parent 
Company's use of that basis for the going concern 
period, and we found the going concern disclosure on 
page 157 to be acceptable; and 

•  The related statement under the Listing Rules set out 
on page 138 is materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our audit knowledge. 

Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability

Our reporting 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to these disclosures. 
We have concluded that these disclosures are  
materially consistent with the financial statements  
and our audit knowledge. 

Our responsibility  
We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency 
between the Directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the 
viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.  
Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to:  
•  the Directors' confirmation within the long-term viability statement on page 58 that they 
have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity;  

•  the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are 

identified and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and  

•  the Directors' explanation in the long-term viability statement of how they have assessed 

the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.  

We are also required to review the long-term viability statement set out on page 58 under 
the Listing Rules. 
Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge 
acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or 
conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with 
judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to 
report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Parent Company's 
longer-term viability.

4.  Key audit matters 
What we mean 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on:  
•  the overall audit strategy;  
•  the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
•  directing the efforts of the engagement team. 

We include below the Key Audit Matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and 
our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, for the purpose of our audit  
of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

FY22: Acceptable 

Description of the Key Audit Matter 

  Our response to the risk 

•  The estimated recoverable amount of the Flavours 

goodwill (acquired through the Iberchem acquisition  
in FY20) is subjective due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting and discounting estimated future 
cash flows (specifically the key assumptions such as 
revenue and cost of sales). 

•  There is limited headroom in the model and therefore 

the risk of estimation uncertainty remains, however the 
level of risk has reduced compared to FY22 as a result 
of the impairment recognised in the prior year.  
•  The effect of this matter is that, as part of our risk 
assessment, we determined that the impairment 
assessment in respect of the recoverable amount of  
the Flavours goodwill has a high degree of estimation 
uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable 
outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole. The financial statements (note 
12) disclose the sensitivities estimated by the Group. 

Our procedures to address the risk included: 
•  Assessing methodology: we obtained the discounted value in use cash flow model 

and assessed the methodology, principles and integrity of the model. 

•  Our valuation expertise: we involved our own valuation specialists to assist us in 

challenging the appropriateness of the discount rate assumption. 

•  Benchmarking assumptions: we challenged the Group’s forecast assumptions for 
cash flow projections, including the rate of sales growth and gross profit growth in the 
short to medium term, with reference to internally and externally derived sources. 

•  Historical comparisons: we assessed the Group’s historical forecasting accuracy by 

comparing forecasts from prior years with actual results in those years. 

•  Sensitivity analysis: we performed breakeven analysis on the key assumptions 

including revenue and gross margin. We also performed breakeven analysis on other 
assumptions such as discount rate and long-term growth rates. 

•  Assessing transparency: we considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures  
in respect of impairment testing and whether disclosures about the sensitivity of the 
outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions properly reflect 
the risks inherent in the valuations of goodwill. 

We performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group’s controls 
because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence 
primarily through the detailed procedures described. 

Communications with the Croda International Plc Audit Committee 
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included: 
•  Our approach to the audit of the recoverable amount of the Flavours goodwill, including our planned substantive procedures, the involvement of our 

valuation specialists and the extent of our control reliance. 

•  Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the methodology, key assumptions used and conclusion of no impairment to be recorded. 
•  The adequacy of the disclosures, particularly as they relate to the sensitivity of the key assumptions. 
Areas of particular auditor judgement 
We identified the following as the area of particular auditor judgement:  

•  The appropriateness of the model, and in particular key assumptions used in the model including revenue and cost of sales growth rates and other 

assumptions such as discount rates and terminal growth rates. 

Our results 
Based on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we found the Group’s conclusion that there is no impairment of goodwill to be acceptable 
(FY22: We found the goodwill balance, and the related impairment charge, to be acceptable). 

Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Audit Committee Report on page 105 for details on how the Audit Committee 
considered this Key Audit Matter as an area of significant attention, page 159 for the accounting policy, and note 12 for the financial disclosures.

FY22: Acceptable 

Description of the Key Audit Matter 
Subjective valuation 
•  The Group has defined benefit pension scheme liabilities in the UK that 
are material in the context of the overall balance sheet and the results of 
the Group.  

•  Significant estimates, including the discount rate, the inflation rate and 
the mortality assumptions, are made in valuing the Group’s defined 
benefit pension liabilities (before deducting the scheme assets). The UK 
scheme is also open to future accrual and new members, and small 
changes in the assumptions and estimates with respect to the liabilities 
may have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group. The 
Group engages external actuarial specialists to assist them in selecting 
appropriate assumptions and in calculating the liabilities.  

•  The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we 
determined that the valuation of the defined benefit liabilities has a high 
degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable 
outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a 
whole, and possibly many times that amount.  

  Our response to the risk 
  Our procedures to address the risk included: 

•  Benchmarking assumptions: we challenged the key assumptions 
applied in the calculation of the liabilities including the discount rate, 
inflation rate, and mortality with the support of our own actuarial 
specialists to compare the key assumptions against market data. 

•  Actuary’s credentials: we assessed the competence, capabilities and 

objectivity of the Group’s actuarial expert.

Description of the Key Audit Matter 
Low risk, high value 
•  The carrying amount of the Parent Company's amounts owed by 
Group undertakings, held at cost less impairment, represents 45% 
and the carrying value of the Parent Company’s shares in Group 
undertakings represents 54% of the Parent Company's total assets.  
•  We do not consider the recoverable amount of these amounts to be 

at a high risk of significant misstatement, or to be subject to a 
significant level of judgement. However, due to their materiality in  
the context of the Parent Company financial statements as a whole, 
these are considered to be the area which had the greatest effect on 
our overall audit strategy and allocation of resources in planning and 
completing our Company audit.

Our assessment of risk vs FY22 
This area has been reinstated as the key 
audit matter for the Parent Company for 
FY23 as post the divestment of the 
majority of the Performance 
Technologies and Industrial Chemicals 
businesses the main area of audit effort 
has switched from the divestment 
accounting to the recoverability 
assessment. 

Our response to the risk 
Our procedures to address the risk included: 
•  Test of detail: we compared the carrying amount of 100% of the Parent 
Company’s shares in Group undertakings with the relevant subsidiaries’ 
draft balance sheet to identify whether their net assets, being an 
approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of the 
carrying amount of those shares and assessed whether those subsidiaries 
have historically been profit-making. 

•  Assessing subsidiary audits: we assessed the work performed by the 

subsidiary audit team on all of those subsidiaries, and considered the results 
of that work, on those subsidiaries’ profits and net assets, and the likely risk 
of default on the intra-group balance. 

•  Test of detail: For each intra-group debtor counterparty, we evaluated  

the likely risk of default with reference to the Company’s definition of default 
and those subsidiaries’ performance against budgets and forecasts of 
future profitability. 

We performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the  
Parent Company’s controls because the nature of the balance is such that 
we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed 
procedures described. 

Communications with the Croda International Plc Audit Committee 
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included: 
•  Our approach to the audit of the recoverability of the Parent Company’s shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by Group undertakings 

including details of our planned substantive procedures. 

•  Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the carrying value of the Parent Company’s shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by  

Group undertakings. 

Areas of particular auditor judgement 
We do not consider this KAM to have any significant judgement or estimation involved. 
Our results 
We found the Parent Company’s conclusion that there is no impairment of its shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by Group undertakings 
to be acceptable (FY22 result: acceptable). 

Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Audit Committee Report on page 105 for details on how the Audit Committee 
considered the recoverability of Parent Company’s shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by Group undertakings as an area of significant 
attention, pages 162 and 197 for the accounting policy on the recoverability of the Parent Company’s shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed 
by Group undertakings, and notes F and G for the financial disclosures. 

Changes to key audit matters 
Divestment of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses (Group and Parent Company) 
The Group disposed of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses (“PTIC”) in FY22 and this was identified as a 
key audit matter for FY22. However, there are no such events taking place in current year and therefore this is no longer identified as a key audit matter. 
We have instead reinstated the key audit matter over the recoverability of the Parent Company’s shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by 
Group undertakings as post the divestment of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses, the main area of audit 
effort has switched from the divestment accounting to the recoverability assessment.  

Recoverable amount of the Fragrances goodwill 
We continue to perform audit procedures over the recoverable amount of the Fragrances goodwill, however, the risk in this area has reduced such  
that we no longer consider this to be a key audit matter. This is based on the headroom shown within the model and our risk assessment procedures 
which have considered how sensitive the model is to assumptions such as short-term revenue and cost of sales growth, long-term growth rate and 
discount rate.

5.  Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response  
Fraud – Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud 
Fraud risk assessment   To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could 

indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. 
Our risk assessment procedures included: 
•  Enquiring of Directors, the Audit Committee and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's high-level 
policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, as well as whether they 
have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud. 

•  Reading Board, Nomination Committee, Remuneration Committee and Audit Committee minutes, and 

whistleblowing logs. 

•  Considering remuneration incentive schemes (annual Bonus Plan and Performance Share Plan) and performance 
targets for Executive Directors, Executive Committee, senior leaders and senior managers, including the EPS  
growth target. 

•  Using our own forensic specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks. This included holding a fraud risk 

assessment discussion with the audit team and assisting us in designing procedures to identify fraud risks. 

Risk communications  We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud

throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group audit team to full scope and specified risk-focused 
component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and requesting these component audit 
teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at the 
Group level. 
As required by auditing standards, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls,  
in particular the risk that management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries. 
We do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because revenue transactions have low individual 
value with high volume, are routine and process driven and do not involve judgement or estimation. This reduces the 
opportunities for fraudulent activity. 
We did not identify any additional fraud risks. 
We performed procedures including: 
•  Identifying journal entries to test for all full scope and specified risk-focused components based on risk criteria  
by the Group audit team. Component audit teams were instructed to test the identified entries to supporting 
documentation. These included those posted by senior finance management or other high-risk users and those 
posted to unusual account combinations. 

•  Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates and related accounting treatment are 

indicative of a potential bias.

Laws and regulations – Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement relating to compliance 
with laws and regulations 

Laws and regulations 
risk assessment  

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the 
financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the Directors and 
other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s regulatory and legal 
correspondence and discussions with the Directors and other management of the policies and procedures regarding 
compliance with laws and regulations. 

Risk communications  We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-

compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group audit team to all full scope and 
specified risk-focused component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a 
request for these component auditors to report to the Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level. 
The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably. The Group is subject 
to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including 
related companies’ legislation), distributable profits legislation, pensions legislation, and taxation legislation, and we 
assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial 
statement items. 
The Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a 
material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or 
litigation or the loss of the Group’s licence to operate. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have 
such an effect: GDPR compliance, health and safety and product liability, competition, anti-bribery and corruption, 
intellectual property, employment law, tax, trade compliance laws and environmental legislation, Registration, 
Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) and recognising the nature of the Group’s activities. 
Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to 
enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. 
Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence,  
an audit will not detect that breach. 

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some 
material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in 
accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is 
from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures 
required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-
detection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override  
of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for 
preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

6.  Our determination of materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and 
in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.

(FY22: £0.9m) 
Audit misstatement

What we mean 
A quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit. 
Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £16m (FY22: £18m). This was determined with 
reference to a benchmark of normalised Group profit before tax from continuing operations (“PBT”) of which it 
represents 4.7% (FY22: 4.7%). 
Consistent with FY22, we determined that Group normalised PBT remains the main benchmark for the Group 
because it is the metric in the primary statements which best reflects the focus of the financial statements' users. 
Also profit is directly linked to shareholder returns, therefore the users of financial statements are focused on profit 
based measures as this is the primary measure communicated to investors, in both short-term guidance and in 
financial reporting. We have normalised by adding back adjustments that did not represent the normal continuing 
operations of the Group, being goodwill impairment arising on the acquisition of Sipo (£20.8m) discussed in note 
12 and restructuring costs (£5.4m) discussed in note 21 (FY22 were exceptional PTIC gain, goodwill impairment 
and property, plant and equipment impairment), and we have averaged over five years (FY22: three years). We note 
that there has been a positive impact of Covid on the Group in 2021 and 2022 coupled with more usual levels of 
profit in 2020 and 2019, we therefore consider five years to be the more appropriate time period to normalise.  
Our Group materiality of £16m was determined by applying a percentage to the normalised PBT. When using a 
benchmark of normalised PBT to determine overall materiality, KPMG’s approach for listed entities considers a 
guideline range 3% - 5% of the measure. In setting overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.7% 
(FY22: 4.7%) to the benchmark.  
Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at £8.7m (FY22: £8.7m), determined 
with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets, of which it represents 0.3% (FY22: 0.3%). 
What we mean 
Our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance 
materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual 
account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole. 
Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied 
We have considered performance materiality at a level of 75% (FY22: 75%) of materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole to be appropriate.  
The Parent Company performance materiality was set at £6.5m (FY22: £6.5m), which equates to 75% (FY22: 
75%) of materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole.  
We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors 
indicating an elevated level of risk. 
What we mean 
This is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point 
of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and 
scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud.  
This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Croda International Plc’s 
Audit Committee. 
Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and judgements applied 
We set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (FY22: 5%) of our materiality for the Group financial 
statements. We also report to the Audit Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 

The overall materiality for the Group financial statements of £16m (FY22: £18m) compares as follows to the main financial statement caption amounts:

7.  The scope of our audit 
Group scope  

What we mean 
How the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group. 
The Group has 86 reporting components. In order to determine the work performed at the reporting component level, we 
identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, those which were significant due to 
risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be performed to provide us with the evidence we 
required in order to conclude on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
We determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 5% (FY22: 5%) of total assets or 
10% (FY22: 10%) of total revenue or 10% (FY22: 10%) of Group profit before tax. We selected total assets, total revenue, and 
profit before tax because these are the most representative of the relative size of the components. We identified 4 (FY22: 5) 
components as individually financially significant components and performed full scope audits on these components.  
In addition, to enable us to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence for the Group financial statements as a whole, we 
selected 10 (FY22: 10) components on which to perform audit procedures. Of these components, we performed full scope 
audits for 4 components (FY22: 6), performed audits of account balances e.g., revenue and cash, on 5 components (FY22: 4) 
and only cash on 1 component (FY22: nil) and performed analytical procedures on the remaining 72 components (FY22: 73).  
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated in section 2 – Group Scope.

Range of materiality applied 
£2.7m - £8.8m (£1.8m - £9.9m) 
£1.6m - £2.7m (£1.8m - £2.7m) 

During FY23, we scoped out Croda Singapore and Croda Italy and reduced the scope for Croda Japan from full scope audit to 
specified procedures due to the decrease in relative significance of these components to the Group. Further, during FY23, we 
scoped in Croda Denmark for specified audit procedures to ensure appropriate overall coverage of the Group. The remaining 
26% (FY22: 22%) of total Group revenue, 17% (FY22: 13%) of total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax  
and 19% (FY22: 17%) of total Group assets is represented by 72 (FY22: 72) reporting components, none of which individually 
represented more than 3% (FY22: 2%) of any of total Group revenue, total profits and losses that made up Group profit before 
tax or total Group assets. For these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.  
The work on 10 of the 14 components (FY22: 11 of the 15 components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, 
including the audit of the Parent Company, was performed by the Group team.  
The Group team has also performed audit procedures on the following areas on behalf of the components: 
•  Understanding of IT is gained centrally on behalf of components that are on the centralised ERP system and findings are 

shared with relevant component teams.  

•  The Group team adopted a centralised approach to testing completeness and accuracy of the data extracted for revenue, 
purchases and journal entries. Data and analytics routines were performed for 12 components (FY22: 13), and the Group 
team assessed the outputs of these routines before sending outputs to component auditors and instructing them to test 
transactions meeting certain criteria. 

These items were audited by the Group team because the Group has a centralised IT system making this an efficient audit 
approach. The Group team communicated the results of these procedures to the component teams. The Group team 
instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the 
information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component materialities, as detailed in the table above, having 
regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. 
In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material 
misstatement exist in those components. 
The Group team performed procedures on the items excluded from normalised Group profit before tax. 
The scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance upon the Group’s internal 
control over financial reporting. 
What we mean 
The extent of the Group audit team’s involvement in component audits. 

In working with component auditors, we: 
•  Held planning calls with component audit teams to discuss the significant areas of the audit relevant to the components.  
•  Issued Group audit instructions to component auditors on the scope of their work, including specifying the minimum 

procedures to perform in their audit of revenue using data and analytics procedures, cash and journals. 

•  Visited four (FY22: two) components in-person in France and Spain as the audit progressed to understand and challenge the 
audit approach. Organised regular video conferences with the partners and Directors of the Group and component audit 
teams. At these visits and video conferences, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any 
further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component audit teams.  

•  Inspection of component audit teams' key work papers (in person and/or using remote technology capabilities) to evaluate the 
quality of execution of the audits of the components with particular focus on work related to significant risk and assessed the 
appropriateness of conclusion and consistencies between reported findings and work performed.

9.  Respective responsibilities  
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 138, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  

Auditor’s responsibilities  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
the financial statements.  

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  

The Company is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 
(“DTR”) 4.1.17R and 4.1.18R. This auditor’s report provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared in accordance with 
those requirements. 

The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities 

10. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Group Accounting Policies 

The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of 
these financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated. 

Whilst there is currently no material impact expected from climate change, 
the Group is aware of the ever-changing risks related to climate change 
and will continue to developing its assessment of the impact on the 
financial statements. 

Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, in accordance with applicable law and UK-
adopted international accounting standards. A summary of the more 
important Group accounting policies is set out below. 

Going concern 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis which the Directors believe to be appropriate for the 
following reasons: 

At 31 December 2023 the Group had £1,050m of committed debt 
facilities available from its banking group, USPP bondholders and lease 
providers, with principal maturities between 2026 and 2030, of which 
£381.2m (2022: £579.3m) was undrawn, together with cash balances  
of £172.5m (2022: £320.6m). The Group’s debt facilities have funding 
covenant requirements, principally the leverage covenant with a maximum 
level of 3.5x net debt to covenant EBITDA, and interest cover. 

The Directors have reviewed the liquidity and covenant forecasts for the 
Group’s going concern assessment period covering at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements. Given the time 
horizon of these forecasts, the risk of climate change is not expected to 
have a material impact on these forecasts. Based on these forecasts, the 
Group continues to have significant liquidity headroom and strong financial 
covenant headroom under its debt facilities. 

A reverse stress testing scenario has been performed which assesses that 
adjusted operating profit would need to fall by over 74% to trigger an event 
of default as at 30 June 2025. This scenario includes some mitigating 
actions to conserve cash, including reducing dividends and capital 
expenditure. Throughout this scenario, the Group continues to have 
significant liquidity headroom. The Directors do not consider this a 
plausible scenario. This is consistent with the bottom-up risk scenario 
modelling for the long-term viability statement which considered severe  
but plausible, individual, and combined scenarios, none of which trigger  
an event of default. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. 

Climate change 
The Group has long recognised the scale of the climate emergency  
and considers this to offer both opportunities and risks in the future.  
The Group’s current climate change strategy focuses on reducing its 
carbon footprint and increasing its use of bio-based raw materials, whilst 
the benefits in using its ingredients will enable more carbon to be saved 
than were emitted through operations and supply chain. 

The impact of climate change has been considered in the preparation of 
these financial statements, including the risks identified as part of the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) on pages 59 to 67. 
None of these risks had a material effect on the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group. In particular, the Directors have considered the 
impact of climate change in respect of the following areas. 

•  Going concern and viability of the Group over the next three years; 
•  Post-retirement benefit obligations; 
•  Carrying value and useful economic lives of property, plant and 

equipment; and 

•  The discounted cash flows included in the value in use calculation used 

in the annual goodwill impairment testing. 

Significant accounting judgements and estimates 
The Group’s significant accounting policies under UK-adopted 
international accounting standards have been set by management with  
the approval of the Audit Committee. The application of these policies 
requires estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the future 
and judgements to be made on the applicability of policies to particular 
situations. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and 
are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Under UK-adopted international accounting standards an 
estimate or judgement may be considered significant if it has a significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or if the 
estimates have a risk of material adjustment to assets and liabilities  
within the next financial year. 

The significant accounting judgement required when preparing the 
Group’s accounts is as follows:  

(i)   Hedge accounting – On 6 February 2023 the Group agreed to acquire 
Solus Biotech Co Ltd (‘Solus’) for a total consideration of KRW350bn, 
a highly probable future business combination (hedged item). In line 
with the Group’s currency risk management strategy, the currency 
exposure for the Group, which has a Sterling functional and 
presentational currency, was managed through the execution  
of a deal contingent foreign exchange forward contract (hedging 
instrument). This instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge 
and therefore hedge accounting was applied in the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements. 
The application of hedge accounting for a deal contingent instrument 
requires significant judgement to determine whether the underlying 
transaction was highly probable, which is a requirement for the initial 
application of hedge accounting. The Group’s assessment that the 
underlying transaction was highly probable, and therefore hedge 
accounting can be applied, is a key judgement. The primary 
consideration in forming this conclusion was in relation to the required 
regulatory approval, which was considered highly probable to be 
achieved based on an assessment of internal and external evidence. 
This judgement, and the subsequent application of hedge accounting, 
resulted in a £19.3m FX loss being deferred in other comprehensive 
income, and subsequently reclassified to goodwill, rather than being 
recognised in the income statement. During the year, a hedge 
ineffectiveness loss of £4.6m was recognised in the income statement 
within administrative expenses and reported as an exceptional item as 
part of business acquisition costs. The forward contract was settled 
during the year resulting in a cash outflow of £23.9m. 

The significant accounting estimates required when preparing the Group’s 
accounts are as follows: 

(i)  Post-retirement benefits – As disclosed in note 11, the Group’s 

principal retirement benefit schemes are of the defined benefit type. 
Year end recognition of the liabilities under these schemes and the 
valuation of assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of 
significant assumptions to be made, relating to key financial market 
indicators such as inflation and expectations on future salary growth 
and asset returns. These assumptions are made by the Group in 
conjunction with the schemes’ actuaries and the Directors are of the 
view that any estimation should be appropriate and in line with 
consensus opinion.

Group Accounting Policies continued
Group Accounting Policies continued 

The critical accounting estimate specifically relates to the Group’s  
UK scheme, given the size of the liabilities and their sensitivity to 
underlying assumptions, including the impact of climate change on  
life expectancy. Small changes in these assumptions could result  
in a material adjustment to carrying values in the next financial year.  

(ii)  Goodwill impairment – Management are required to undertake an 

annual test for impairment of indefinite lived assets such as goodwill. 
Accordingly, the Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered 
any impairment by comparing the carrying value of the underlying 
Cash Generating Units (‘CGUs’) to their recoverable amount 
calculated by detailed value in use calculations. These value in use 
calculations require the use of estimates to enable the calculation of 
the net present value of cash flow projections of the relevant CGU. 
The critical assumptions are as follows:  

–  Cash flow projections – based on management's most recent risk-
adjusted view of future trading specific to the individual CGU, with 
assumptions on term and EBITDA growth (calculated as operating 
profit before depreciation and amortisation) as a result of fluctuating 
revenue and operating margins through the ability to pass on future 
raw material price increases. 

–  Terminal value growth in EBITDA – set for each CGU with reference 
to the long-term growth rate for the market and territory in which 
the CGU operates but not exceeding the Group's long-term 
average growth rate, estimated at 3%.  

–  Discount rate – set using a weighted average cost of capital 

adjusted for the specific risk profile of each CGU. 

The significant accounting estimate relates to the goodwill impairment 
review of the Flavours and Croda Korea CGUs. Given the impairment 
charge reported in the prior year the Flavours CGU has low 
headroom. The recoverable amount, and therefore level of headroom, 
is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at 
these key assumptions. The assumptions selected and associated 
sensitivity analysis are disclosed in note 12. Although it is not 
management’s current expectation, these sensitivities provide the 
impact on the recoverable amount when applying a reasonably 
possible change in the assumptions. The goodwill impairment  
review of Croda Korea CGU represents a further source of significant 
estimation uncertainty due to the proximity of acquisition and resultant 
low level of headroom. Post-acquisition trading is in line with 
expectations. Given the size of the goodwill balances and the carrying 
values’ sensitivity to the underlying assumptions, small changes could 
result in a material adjustment to the carrying values in the next 
financial year.  

The impact of climate change risks, with a particular focus on the 
impact of carbon pricing, has been considered as part of the 
impairment testing. The discounted cash flows included in the value  
in use calculations reflect the carbon costs of the CGU based on the 
latest scope 1 and 2 emissions data and applying a shadow carbon 
price of £124/tonne in line with the UK Government Green Guide. The 
cost of carbon has an immaterial effect on the recoverable amount of 
each standalone CGU and as such carbon costs are not deemed to 
be a key assumption. The Directors are aware of the ever-changing 
risks attached to climate change and will regularly assess these risks 
against judgements and estimates made in future impairment testing. 

The Group’s accounts include other areas of estimation. While these 
areas do not meet the definition of significant accounting estimates, 
the recognition and measurement of certain material assets and 
liabilities are based on assumptions. The other areas of accounting 
estimates are: 
(i) Valuation of acquired intangible assets (note 28) – On acquisition, 
intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised if they can be 
identified through being separable from the acquired entity or arising 
from specific contractual or legal rights. Once recognised, such 
intangible assets will be initially valued using an appropriate 
methodology. The acquisition date fair value of intangible assets 
acquired are based on a number of assumptions including discount 
rate, royalty rates, growth rates and customer attrition. 

(ii)  Goodwill impairment review of the Avanti and Fragrances CGUs 
(note 12) – the recoverable amount, and therefore level of headroom, 
is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at  
the cash flow projections, terminal value growth rate, and the  
discount rate.  

Changes in accounting policy 
(i)  The Group adopted the following new accounting policies on  

1 January 2023 to comply with amendments to IFRS. The accounting 
pronouncements, none of which had a material impact on the 
Group’s financial reporting on adoption, are: 

–  IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ and Amendments to IFRS 17 

‘Insurance Contracts’; 

–  Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Disclosure of Accounting Policies’; 
–  Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Classification of Liabilities as Current or 

Non-Current’; 

–  Amendment to IAS 8 ‘Definition of Accounting Estimates’; and 
–  Amendment to IAS 12 ‘Deferred Tax related to Assets and 

Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction’ and ‘International Tax 
Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules’. 

IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ 
IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ became effective on 1 January 2023 
and establishes requirements for the recognition, measurement, 
presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope 
of the Standard and is applied retrospectively. An impact assessment 
has been performed and has not resulted in a material impact to the 
Group financial reporting.  

As part of this review it was identified that the Group issues product 
warranties as part of the normal course of business which would meet 
the definition of an insurance contract. As the warranties are issued in 
connection to the sale of goods, the Group is exempt from applying 
the requirements of IFRS 17 and instead applies IFRS 15 ‘Revenue’ 
and IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. 

The Group operates a captive insurance company to self-insure 
certain risks either in full or in part. As this self-insurance operates 
within the Group, IFRS 17 has no impact on the consolidated  
financial statements.  

The Group has also issued Parent Company guarantee arrangements. 
The Group has not previously asserted that these arrangements are 
considered insurance contracts and has therefore taken advantage  
of the accounting policy choice to apply IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Presentation’, IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and IFRS 9 
‘Financial Instruments’ rather than apply IFRS 17.

Group accounts 
General information 
Croda International Plc is a public limited company, which is listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the United 
Kingdom. It is registered in England and Wales and the address of its 
registered office can be found on page 205. 

Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Parent Company has control. 
The Parent controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.  

The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for 
business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of 
a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred 
and the equity interests issued by the Group. Acquisition costs are 
expensed as incurred. 

Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed, in a business combination are measured initially at their 
fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority 
interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of 
identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 

Intra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions 
between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are  
also eliminated.  

Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary 
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 

Transactions with non-controlling interests 
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as 
transactions with the equity owners of the Group. For purchases from 
non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid 
and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the 
subsidiary is recorded as equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-
controlling interests are also recorded in equity.  

Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
On acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets 
acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given  
for a business exceeds such net assets. Goodwill arising on acquisitions  
is capitalised and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there 
are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels  
for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as CGUs. 

Goodwill is allocated to the CGU that is expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the acquisition. For goodwill balances where the relevant 
group of CGUs exceeds the size of the Group’s operating segments, 
impairment testing is performed at the operating segment level. 

If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying value of  
the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised immediately against the 
goodwill value. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. Fair value less costs to sell is 
measured on a market-based approach using prices and other relevant 
information generated by market transactions. Value in use is estimated 
with reference to estimated risk adjusted future post-tax cash flows in real 
terms discounted to net present value using a market participant real post-
tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and size risk 
premium specific to the CGU. Post-tax calculations, rather than pre-tax, 
are used as they are considered more accurate. For disclosure purposes, 
pre-tax discount rates are then back-solved using the equivalent pre-tax 
cash flows, and therefore there is no material difference between the 
calculations on a pre-tax or post-tax basis. Where required, specific risks 
associated with the CGU are adjusted through changes to the future cash 
flow projections. The Group uses growth estimates that track below the 
Group’s historical growth rates unless the profile of a particular CGU 
warrants a different treatment. 

Other intangible assets arising on acquisition 
On acquisition, intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised if they 
can be identified through being separable from the acquired entity or 
arising from specific contractual or legal rights.  

Once recognised, such intangible assets will be initially valued using  
an appropriate methodology. For the acquisition in the year the following 
intangible asset types recognised and valuation methodologies  
applied were: 

•  Technology processes (relief-from-royalty) 
•  Customer relationships (income approach) 

Following initial recognition, the assets will be written down on a straight-
line basis over their useful lives, which range from 7 to 20 years for 
technology processes and from 3 to 20 years for trade names, brands and 
customer relationships. Useful lives are regularly reviewed to ensure their 
continuing relevance. 

Research and development 
Research expenditure, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new 
scientific, technical or commercial knowledge and understanding, is 
charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred. Internal 
development expenditure, whereby research findings are applied to a plan 
for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes, 
is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred 
unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. 
Development uncertainties typically mean that such criteria are not met, 
most commonly because the Group can only demonstrate the existence 
of a market at a late stage in the product development cycle, at which 
point the material element of project spend has already been incurred  
and charged to the income statement. This includes, for example, 
substantiating potential product claims for use by our customers. Until the 
desired outcome of such work can be proven, at an economic production 
cost, the market for a product cannot be said to exist. Furthermore, the 
Group does not have the ability to reliably measure the development 
expenditure attributable to all projects during development. 

Where, however, the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets  
are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives from 
product launch.

Group Accounting Policies continued
Group Accounting Policies continued 

Intangible assets relating to products in development are subject  
to impairment testing at each balance sheet date or earlier upon  
indication of impairment. Any impairment losses are written off to  
the income statement. 

Computer software 
Cloud computing arrangements are assessed and classified as 
either service contracts or intangible assets. Computer software licences 
that meet the definition of an intangible asset, covering a period of greater 
than a year, are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire 
and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over 
their estimated useful lives which range from 3 to 7 years. 

Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract 
with a customer and excludes intra-Group sales. The Group recognises 
revenue on completion of contractual performance obligations, generally 
when it transfers control over a product or service to a customer. 

Sale of goods 
The principal activity from which the Group generates revenue is the 
supply of products to customers from its various manufacturing sites and 
warehouses, and in some limited instances from consignment inventory 
held on customer sites. Products are supplied under a variety of standard 
terms and conditions, and in each case, revenue is recognised when 
contractual performance obligations between the Group and the customer 
are satisfied. This will typically be on dispatch or delivery. When sales 
discount and rebate arrangements result in net variable consideration, 
appropriate adjustments are recognised as a deduction from revenue  
at the point of sale. The Group typically uses the expected value method 
for estimating rebates, reflecting that such contracts have similar 
characteristics and a range of possible outcomes. The Group recognises 
revenue to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in 
the amount of cumulative revenue will not be required. 

Interest and dividend income 
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the 
effective interest method. 

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment  
is established. 

Government grants 
The Group recognises government grant income related to assets when 
the grant becomes receivable and deducts the income from the cost of 
the associated asset. Government grant income is recognised separately 
in the Group statement of cash flows. 

Segmental reporting 
The Group’s sales, marketing and research activities are organised into 
three global market sectors, being Consumer Care, Life Sciences and 
Industrial Specialties. These are the segments for which summary 
management information is presented to the Group’s Executive 
Committee, which is deemed to be the Group’s Chief Operating  
Decision Maker. 

Employee benefits 
Pension obligations 
The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 
‘Employee Benefits’ (revised). In respect of defined benefit plans (pension 
plans that define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will 
receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such  
as age, years of service and compensation), obligations are measured  
at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. 
The assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in respect of 
defined benefit pension plans are the net of plan obligations and assets. 
A scheme surplus is only recognised as an asset in the balance sheet 
when the Group has the unconditional right to future economic benefits  
in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions. For those 
schemes where an accounting surplus is currently recognised, the Group 
expects to recover the value through reduced future contributions. No 
allowance is made in the past service liability in respect of either the future 
expenses of running the schemes or for non-service-related death in 
service benefits which may arise in the future. The operating costs of such 
plans are charged to operating profit and the finance costs are recognised 
as financial income or an expense as appropriate.  

Service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees  
and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. 
Remeasurements are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income. Payments to defined contribution schemes (pension plans under 
which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity) are 
charged as an expense as they fall due.  

Other post-retirement benefits 
Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to 
their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the 
employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of 
a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are 
accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology 
similar to that for defined benefit pension plans. Remeasurements are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. These obligations 
are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries. 

Termination benefits 
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by  
the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group 
recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to 
either (i) terminating the employment of current employees according to  
a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or (ii) providing 
termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary 
redundancy. 

Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of cash and equity settled, share-based 
incentive schemes. These are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 
‘Share-based Payments’, which requires an expense to be recognised in 
the income statement over the vesting period of the options. The expense 
is based on the fair value of each instrument which is calculated using the 
Black Scholes or binomial model as appropriate. Any expense is adjusted 
to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting for non-market-
based performance criteria.

Currency translations and hyperinflation 
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities 
are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment  
in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s 
functional and presentation currency. 

Certain subsidiaries of the Group operate in hyperinflationary economies. 
Where considered significant, the results of those subsidiaries are adjusted 
to reflect the current purchasing power of that currency at the year end,  
as if that rate had applied to the results of the entity for the whole period. 
Any gain or loss on monetary assets and liabilities is recognised within 
operating costs in the Group income statement as a net monetary gain  
or loss. 

Transactions and balances 
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling  
at the end of the financial period. Exchange profits or losses on trading 
transactions are included in the Group income statement except 
when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying  
net investment hedges. 

Group companies 
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency and are not 
considered to be hyperinflationary are translated into the presentation 
currency as follows: 

(i)  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated 

(ii) 

at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; 
income and expenses for each income statement are translated at 
average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated 
at the dates of the transactions); and 

(iii)  all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate 

component of equity. 

For subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies, the results and 
financial position are translated into the Group’s presentation currency 
using the closing rate for all transactions, rather than at an average rate  
for income and expense items.  

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the 
net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency 
instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to 
shareholders’ equity. 

When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are 
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. 

Taxation 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into 
account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between  
the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes. 
Temporary differences arise on differences between the carrying value  
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax base. Full 
provision is made for the tax effects of these differences. No provision 
is made for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries where there is no 
commitment to remit such earnings. 

Similarly, no provision is made for temporary differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries since realisation of such differences can be 
controlled and is not probable in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised, using the balance sheet liability method, to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised. 

The Group has determined that the global minimum top-up tax, which is a 
liability under Pillar Two legislation, is an income tax in the scope of IAS12. 
The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax 
accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a 
current tax when it is incurred. 

Following adoption of amendments to IAS12 the Group has recognised a 
separate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a deferred 
tax liability in relation to its right of use assets. 

All taxation is calculated on the basis of the tax rates and laws enacted  
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 

Income statement presentation 
Adjusted results are stated before exceptional items and amortisation of 
intangible assets arising on acquisition, and tax thereon. The Board 
believes that the adjusted presentation (and the columnar format adopted 
for the Group income statement) assists shareholders by providing a basis 
upon which to analyse business performance and make year-on-year 
comparisons. The same measures are used by management for planning, 
budgeting and reporting purposes and for the internal assessment of 
operating performance across the Group. The adjusted presentation is 
adopted on a consistent basis for each half year and full year results. 

Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those items that in the Directors’ view are required to 
be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance. In the current year 
exceptional items relate to a goodwill impairment to the carrying value of 
the Chinese SIPO cash generating unit in Industrial Specialties, acquisition 
costs and restructuring costs associated with changes to the Group’s 
operating model. Exceptional items in the prior year related to the gain on 
business disposal, discount unwind and fair value adjustment in respect  
of contingent consideration, goodwill impairment and property, plant and 
equipment impairment. Details can be found in note 3 on pages 165  
and 166. 

Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation, 
with the exception of assets acquired as part of a business combination. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs 
attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended 
use. The Group’s policy is to write off the difference between the cost of  
all property, plant and equipment, except freehold land, and their residual 
value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.  

Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual 
values of individual productive assets, taking account of commercial and 
technological obsolescence, the impact of climate change, sites 
decarbonisation road maps, as well as normal wear and tear, and 
adjustments are made where appropriate. Under this policy it becomes 
impractical to calculate average asset lives exactly. However, the total lives 
range from approximately 15 to 40 years for land and buildings, and 3 to 
25 years for plant and equipment. All individual assets are reviewed for 
impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. The Group’s ‘plant and equipment’ asset class predominantly 
relates to the value of plant and equipment at the Group’s manufacturing 
facilities. Consequently, the Group does not seek to analyse out of this 
class other items such as motor vehicles and office equipment.

The TCFD on pages 59 to 67 highlights the riverine flood risk across 
specific sites. The sites with significant risk of flood account for 14.9% of 
Group revenue in 2023 and include 12.2% of the Group’s property, plant 
and equipment net book value. Due to the mitigations detailed in the 
TCFD, climate change does not have a material impact on the net book 
value or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment at the 
balance sheet date.  

Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group assesses at each year end whether an asset may be impaired. 
If any evidence exists of impairment, the estimated recoverable amount is 
compared to the carrying value of the asset and an impairment loss is 
recognised where appropriate. The recoverable amount is the higher of  
an asset’s value in use and fair value less costs to sell. In addition to this, 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Non-financial assets 
other than goodwill which have suffered impairment are reviewed for 
possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.  

Leases 
When entering into a new contract, the Group assesses whether it is, or 
contains, a lease. A lease conveys a right to control the use of an identified 
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 

The Group recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability at the 
 lease commencement date. The right of use asset is initially measured  
at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation  
and impairment losses, adjusted for certain remeasurements of the  
lease liability. 

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease 
payments that are not paid at the commencement date and discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, more typically, the  
Group’s incremental borrowing rate (when the implicit rate cannot  
be readily determined). 

The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on 
the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured 
when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in 
an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be 
payable under a residual value guarantee or changes in the Group’s 
assessment of whether a purchase, extension or termination option is 
reasonably certain to be exercised. 

The Group adopts recognition exemptions for short-term (less than  
12 months) and low value leases and elects not to separate lease 
components from any associated fixed non-lease components. 

The Group classifies payments of lease liabilities (principal and 
interest portions) as part of financing activities. Payments of  
short-term, low value and variable lease components are classified  
within operating activities. 

Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments where deemed 
appropriate to hedge its exposure to interest rates and short-term 
currency rate fluctuations. The Group’s accounting policy is set out below. 

Derivative financial instruments are recorded initially at cost. Subsequent 
measurement depends on the designation of the instrument as either:  
(i) a hedge of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm 
commitment (fair value hedge); or (ii) a hedge of highly probable forecast 
transactions (cash flow hedge). 

(i) Fair value hedge 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives, for example interest rate swaps 
and foreign exchange contracts, that are designated and qualify as fair 
value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any 
changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable 
to the hedged risk. 

(ii) Cash flow hedge 
The Group designates the spot element of forward foreign exchange 
contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. The 
forward elements of the forward exchange contracts are excluded from 
the designation of the hedging instrument and are separately accounted 
for as a cost of hedging, which is recognised in equity in a cost of hedging 
reserve. The Group’s policy is for the critical terms of the forward 
exchange contracts to align with the hedged item. 

The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between 
the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the current amount 
and timing of the respective cash flows. The Group assesses whether the 
derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and 
has been effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged 
item using the hypothetical derivative method. In these hedge relationships, 
the main sources of ineffectiveness are changes in the time or amount of 
the hedged transactions. 

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are 
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.  
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately 
in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in 
the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit 
or loss (for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). 
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset (for example inventory) or a liability, the 
gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity 
and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. 

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the 
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. 

When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
transferred to the income statement. 

Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not  
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the 
income statement. 

Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) 
and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the 
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings 
are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional 
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the 
balance sheet date.

transactions (cash flow hedge). 

Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. With the 
exception of contingent consideration and forward foreign exchange 
contracts, trade and other payables are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Contingent 
consideration is measured at fair value based on the present value of the 
expected future payments, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. 
Contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date 
and subsequent changes in fair value and associated discount unwind are 
recognised in the income statement. Forward foreign exchange contracts 
are initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at fair value on 
a mark-to-market basis. 

Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable amount on  
a first in first out basis. Cost comprises all expenditure, including related 
production overheads, incurred in the normal course of business 
in bringing the inventory to its location and condition at the balance sheet 
date. Net realisable amount is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less any applicable variable selling costs. Provision  
is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective inventory where 
appropriate. Profits arising on intra-group sales are eliminated in so  
far as the product remains in Group inventory at the year end. 

Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
method, less impairment losses. A provision for impairment of trade 
receivables is recognised based on lifetime expected losses, but principally 
comprises balances where objective evidence exists that the amount will 
not be collectible. Such amounts are written down to their estimated 
recoverable amounts, with the charge being made to operating expenses. 

Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term 
deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form 
an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a 
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement 
of cash flows. Cash and bank overdrafts are offset and the net amount 
reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts, there is an intention to settle on a net basis 
and interest is charged on a net basis. 

Environmental, restructuring, site restoration and 
other provisions 
The Group is exposed to certain liabilities relating to its operations. 
Provisions are made immediately where a legal or constructive obligation is 
identified, can be quantified and it is regarded as more likely than not that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. The Group 
does consider the impact of discounting when establishing provisions and 
provisions are discounted when the impact is material and the timing of 
cash flows can be estimated with reasonable certainty. 

Share capital 
Investment in own shares 
(i)  Employee share ownership trusts – shares acquired by the trustees  
of the employee share ownership trust (the Trustees), funded by the 
Company and held for the continuing benefit of the Company are 
shown as a reduction in equity attributable to owners of the parent. 
Movements in the year arising from additional purchases by the 
Trustees of shares or the receipt of funds due to the exercise of 
options by employees are accounted for within reserves and shown 
as a movement in equity attributable to owners of the parent in the 
year. Administration expenses of the trusts are charged to the 
Company’s income statement as incurred. 

(ii)  Treasury shares – where any Group company purchases the 

Company’s equity share capital as treasury shares, the consideration 
paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of 
income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s 
equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. 
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any 
consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included 
in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. 

Dividends 
Dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability when the 
liability is irrevocable. Accordingly, final dividends are recognised when 
approved by shareholders and interim dividends are recognised 
when paid. 

Investments 
Investments in equity securities are measured at fair value, with 
movements in the fair value being recognised in the income statement or 
equity on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Investments in associates are 
initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share 
of results. Investments are subject to impairment testing at each balance 
sheet date or earlier upon indication of impairment.

Notes to the Group Accounts 

1. Segmental analysis 
The Group’s sales, marketing and research activities are organised into three global market sectors, being Consumer Care, Life Sciences and Industrial 
Specialties. These are the segments for which summary management information is presented to the Group’s Executive Committee, which is deemed  
to be the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. A review of each sector can be found within the Strategic Report on pages 38 to 46. 

There is no material trade between segments. Segmental results include items directly attributable to a specific segment as well as those that can be 
allocated on a reasonable basis.

The effective adjusted corporate tax rate before exceptional items of 23.9% (2022: 22.8%) is slightly higher than the UK's standard tax rate of 23.5%. 
The reported corporate tax rate after exceptional items is 27.2% (2022: 16.2%). 

Croda operates in many tax jurisdictions other than the UK, both as a manufacturer and distributor, with the majority of those jurisdictions having rates 
higher than the UK; considerably so in some cases. It is the exposure to these different tax rates that increases the effective tax rate above the UK 
standard rate and also makes it difficult to forecast the Group’s future tax rate with any certainty given the unpredictable nature of exchange rates, 
individual economies and tax legislators. Croda's effective corporate tax rate has also increased as a result of incurring expenditure which is deemed 
capital in nature for tax purposes, including the impairment of goodwill, which is not tax deductible. The factors increasing the effective tax rate are largely 
offset by the prior year release of tax provisions. Otherwise, there are no significant adjustments between the Group’s expected and reported tax charge 
based on its reported accounting profit. Given the global nature of the Group, and the number of associated cross-border transactions between 
connected parties, we are exposed to potential adjustments to the price charged for those transactions by tax authorities. However, the Group carries 
appropriate provisions relating to the level of risk. 

The prior year reported corporate tax rate after exceptional items includes the tax arising on the gain of the PTIC divestment and associated business 
disposal costs. Whilst the gain was subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which business units were sold, a number of local exemptions have resulted in the 
overall gain being taxed at a rate significantly lower than the UK's 2022 standard tax rate of 19%. This has reduced the reported corporate tax rate after 
exceptional items in the prior year. 

Legislation to increase the UK standard rate of corporation tax from 19% to 25% was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021, effective from 1 April 2023, 
which has resulted in a blended UK rate of corporation tax of 23.5% in 2023. The UK deferred tax is calculated at 25%. The overseas tax is calculated at 
the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. 

The UK, like many other jurisdictions, brought into effect its supporting Pillar 2 tax legislation from 31 December 2023. First applicable to the Group’s  
31 December 2024 period end, this legislation will effectively mandate the incurrence of a minimum effective tax rate of 15% (in aggregate) across each 
of its trading jurisdictions. Croda's effective tax rate would not have been materially impacted had Pillar 2 applied in 2023. Initial assessments, supported 
through an appraisal of those preliminary safe harbours communicated by the OECD, validate the Group’s view that no material tax exposures are 
expected to arise under this legislation in 2024.

Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the balance sheet liability method at rates appropriate to each subsidiary. Deferred tax 
expected to reverse in the year to 31 December 2024 and beyond has been measured using the rate due to prevail in the year of reversal. 

Following the amendment to IAS12, requiring the separate recognition of deferred tax in relation to lease liabilities and the corresponding right of use 
assets, deferred tax balances have been recognised separately on these items. 

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in all material cases where such assets arise, as it is probable the assets will be recovered. At 31 December 
2023, the unrecognised deferred tax asset was £9.9m in respect of losses of £40.4m (2022: unrecognised deferred tax asset of £9.6m on losses of 
£39.1m) across the Group, as it is not considered probable that there will be future taxable profits against which these losses can be offset. 

Deferred tax is only recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that remittance is expected in the foreseeable future.  
If all earnings were remitted, an additional £19.1m (2022: £15.8m) of tax would be payable on unremitted earnings of £469m (2022: £462m). 

All movements on deferred tax balances have been recognised in the income statement with the exception of the items shown in note 5(b). 

Of the gross deferred tax assets, £1.0m are expected to reverse within 12 months of the balance sheet date. No material reversal of any of the deferred 
tax liability is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date based on the Group’s current capital expenditure programme.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year, excluding those shares held in treasury or employee share trusts (note 24). Shares held in employee share trusts are 
treated as cancelled because, except for a nominal amount, dividends have been waived. 

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive 
ordinary shares. 

Additional earnings per share calculations are included above to give a better indication of the Group’s underlying performance.

Defined benefit pension schemes 
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, US and several other territories under broadly similar regulatory frameworks.  

The UK scheme, which remains open to new members and future service accrual, is a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) defined benefit 
scheme, with annual pensionable earnings capped and pensions in payment indexed based on CPI. The US Retirement Plan, which is closed to new 
members, operates a cash balance pension scheme that provides a guaranteed rate of return on pension contributions until retirement (other than for  
a small number of ‘grandfathered’ employees). The US plans also do not generally receive inflationary increases once in payment. With the exception  
of this difference in inflationary risk, the Group’s main defined benefit pension schemes continue to face materially similar risks, as described on pages 
174 and 175. 

All of the Group’s final salary type pension schemes (which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life 
based on salary in the final years leading up to retirement) are closed to future service accrual with the exception of a small number of ‘grandfathered’ 
employees in the US scheme. 

The majority of the Group’s retirement benefit asset relates to the Group’s UK pension scheme. The UK pension scheme is open to future service accrual 
and therefore the surplus is recognised on the basis that this could be recovered through a reduction in future service contributions. 

The majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds; however, there are also a number of unfunded plans where the relevant Group 
company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due. 

Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the 
trustees (or equivalent) and their composition. Responsibility for governance of the schemes, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, 
predominantly lies with the particular scheme's board of trustees with appropriate input from the relevant Group company. The board of trustees must be 
composed of representatives in accordance with each scheme’s regulations and any relevant legislation. 

During 2022 the business divestment resulted in a curtailment gain of £3.9m on cessation of defined benefit accrual, primarily within the Group’s UK 
pension scheme, which was recognised in the Group income statement as part of the gain on business disposal.

Mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables and where appropriate allow for future improvements in life expectancy. Where 
credible data exists, actual plan experience is taken into account. The UK mortality improvement scale has been updated to CMI 2022, in order to reflect 
the most recent CMI model with default weight parameters for 2020 (0%), 2021 (0%) and 2022 (25%) to provide for uncertainty around the long-term 
impact of Covid-19 on life expectancy. Applying the mortality tables adopted, the expected future average lifetime of members currently at age 65 and 
members at age 65 in 20 years' time is as follows:

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, 
and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial 
assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the 
reporting year) has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet. The weighted average 
duration of the defined benefit obligation is 13.7 years (2022: 14.3 years).

Derivatives presented above represent the scheme’s net position on Government bond repurchase agreements and other swap contracts (valued on  
a mark-to-market basis) which form part of the scheme’s Liability Driven Investment (LDI) portfolio. The non-derivative assets in the LDI portfolio have 
been presented in the relevant asset category. Hedge funds consists of a fund of multiple investment managers across both traditional markets such as 
equities and credit and also more specialist diversified strategies. Infrastructure funds consists of infrastructure type investments that hold assets linked  
to the value and income from UK and overseas infrastructure. In the prior year, these were disclosed as other unquoted assets totalling £369.5m, the 
presentation has been disaggregated to provide more information on the nature of the scheme's assets. At the year end, the hedge fund asset had been 
redeemed but the cash had not yet been received and reinvested and therefore this has been classified as an other asset.

Pension and medical benefits – risks and volatility 
Through its defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment medical schemes, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant  
of which are detailed below: 

Asset volatility 
The schemes’ liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if scheme assets underperform this yield, a deficit 
will be created. The schemes hold a proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility 
and risk in the short-term. As the schemes mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match 
the liabilities. However, the Group and the pension trustees (Trustees) believe that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities and the strength of 
the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Group’s long-term strategy to manage the schemes 
efficiently. See below for more details on the Group’s asset-liability matching strategy. 

Changes in bond yields 
A decrease in bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes’ bond holdings. 

Inflation risk 
Some of the Group’s pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. However, the level of inflationary increases 
is usually capped to protect the scheme against extreme inflation. The majority of the schemes’ assets are either unaffected by inflation in the case of 
fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated in the case of equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will thus increase the deficit. In the US schemes,  
the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.  

Life expectancy 
The majority of the schemes’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the 
schemes’ liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK scheme, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy. 
In the case of the funded schemes, the Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework that 
has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are cognisant of the obligations under the pension schemes. Within this framework, the 
Group’s ALM objective is to match a portion of assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that 
match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency. The Group and Trustees actively monitor how the duration and the 
expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. The Group has not changed the 
processes used to manage its risks from previous years. 

Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. A significant 
portion of assets in 2023 consists of equities and bonds, although the schemes also invest in property, cash and infrastructure funds. The Group believes 
that equities offer the best returns over the long-term with an acceptable level of risk. The UK scheme makes use of a portfolio of derivative instruments 
to mitigate interest rate and inflation risk. 

The Trustee and Company are working on the 30 September 2023 triennial valuation, and initial results shared with the Company show that the funding 
position has improved and that the cost of providing benefits has fallen. The Trustee and Company are working closely with their advisers to secure the 
long-term security of members' benefits, with changes such as a further reduction in investment risk completed in 2023. The next triennial valuation of the 
UK scheme will be as at 30 September 2026. The funding review of our US scheme is undertaken annually. As at 1 December 2022 the scheme was 
122.4% funded.

Impairment testing for CGUs containing goodwill 
The Group's goodwill balance predominantly relates to the value of commercial and other synergies arising from the combination of acquired businesses 
with Croda's established global sales, marketing and R&D networks. This goodwill is allocated to the Group's Cash Generating Units (CGUs) expected to 
benefit from that combination based on the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate independent cash inflows.  

As discussed in the accounting policies note on page 159, goodwill is tested annually for impairment with reference to the relevant CGU's recoverable 
amount compared to the unit's carrying value including goodwill. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash 
flows relevant to the acquisition generating the goodwill. The recoverable amount is based on the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use 
calculations using discounted cash flow projections with the following key assumptions: 

•  Five year cash flow projections – based on management's most recent risk-adjusted view of future trading specific to the individual CGU, with 

assumptions on EBITDA growth (calculated as operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) as a result of fluctuating revenue and operating 
margins through the ability to pass on future raw material price increases. 

•  Terminal value growth in EBITDA – set for each CGU with reference to the long-term growth rate for the market and territory in which the CGU 

operates but not exceeding the Group's long-term average growth rate, estimated at 3% given the markets and territories the Group operates in.  

•  Discount rate – set using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the specific risk profile of each CGU. 

The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to operating business segments as follows:

The allocated goodwill primarily relates to £63m (2022: £63m) associated with the 2020 acquisition of Iberchem as it relates to revenue synergies  
with Croda’s existing Consumer Care business and £192m (2022: £192m) associated with the 2006 acquisition of Uniqema (with all other balances 
individually less than £10m). Due to the geographical and operational scale of the Uniqema acquisition, this goodwill balance is tested for impairment at 
an operating business segment level. Standalone CGUs operate independently of the Group’s core regional operating assets, are capable of generating 
largely independent cash inflows and therefore goodwill relating to standalone CGUs is tested separately for impairment annually. 

For impairment testing performed at an operating business segment level, cash flow projections are based on the Group's current year results and  
a growth rate of 3% (an appropriate risk-adjusted view based on past experience reflecting the market and territories in which the Group operates), 
discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 11.4% pre-tax (2022: 9.9%).  
No reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the operating segments to be less than their carrying value. 
Based on the testing performed, no impairment has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2023.

For all Standalone CGUs the recoverable amount was based on value in use calculations. Cash flow projections have been based on specific risk 
adjusted estimates taking management's most recent view of medium-term trading prospects. All cashflow projections are over a 5 year period unless 
the Directors believe that steady state growth will not be achieved over this timeframe. Croda Korea Limited's cash flow projections have been extended 
to 10 years to better reflect the early growth phase of the acquired business and when it will reach a steady state. Unless otherwise stated, cash flow 
projections assume an appropriate view of past experience, specifically considering revenue growth in relation to market share, maintaining operating 
margins, maintenance capital expenditure and working capital days. Discount rates have been calculated for standalone CGUs set using specific 
weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the specific risk profile of each CGU. The terminal value growth rates and discount rates applied in these 
CGU level calculations are set out below:

An impairment of £20.8m was recorded in relation to goodwill arising on the acquisition of Sipo. This principally reflected the decline in the profitability of 
the business in the period driven by adverse external market conditions, impacting both demand and pricing, which are expected to continue over the 
medium term. The assumptions underpinning the cash flow projection used in the value in use calculation reflect management’s most recent forecast 
combined with an appropriate view of past experience, specifically EBITDA compound average growth rates (CAGR) as a result of changing revenue, 
cost of sales and operating costs over the period.  

Excluding SIPO, based on the annual impairment testing performed for all standalone CGUs no impairment has been recognised for the year ended  
31 December 2023 and standalone CGUs remain on track to perform to our long-term expectations. In forming this conclusion, the Directors have 
reviewed sensitivity analysis which considered a range of possibilities on key assumptions, both individually and in combination, and considered whether 
these would give rise to an impairment. Excluding Flavours & Croda Korea Limited, this analysis concluded that no reasonably possible changes in key 
assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the Standalone CGUs to be less than the carrying value. 

For Croda Korea Limited, the assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections used in the value in use calculation reflect delivery of the acquisition 
business plan, which the business remains on track to achieve in the medium to long term. The estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded 
their carrying value by approximately £19m and therefore the Directors concluded that no impairment was required; however, the calculation is sensitive 
to achieving the acquisition plan, specifically that operating margins will improve and sales growth targets will be achieved over the 10 year projections.  

The estimated recoverable amount of Avanti, Fragrances and Flavours CGUs exceeded their carrying value therefore the Directors concluded that no 
impairment was required; however, the calculations are sensitive to changes in key assumptions. The range of key assumptions considered by the 
Directors, where a change could give rise to an impairment, were the EBITDA compound annual growth rates as a result of increasing revenue growth 
rates and improving operating margins through cost of sales and operating costs, pre-tax discount rate and long-term growth rate. Sensitivity disclosures 
are set out below.

Sensitivity to changes in assumptions 
The recoverable amount, and therefore level of headroom or impairment charge, is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at the 
cash flow projections, terminal value growth rate, and the discount rate. Although it is not management’s current expectation, and not reasonably 
possible for Avanti and Fragrances, the impact on the recoverable amount when applying a consistent, meaningful change relative to the size and nature 
of these assumptions would be as follows for the year ended 31 December 2023:

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, some of the 
assumptions may be correlated. 

Climate risk and impairment testing 
The impact of climate change risks including the risks identified as part of the TCFD disclosures on page 59 to 67, with a particular focus on the impact 
of carbon pricing, has been considered as part of the impairment testing. The discounted cash flows included in the value in use calculations reflect the 
carbon costs of the CGU based on the latest scope 1 and 2 emissions data and applying a shadow carbon price of £124/tonne in line with the UK 
Government Green Guide. 

The cost of carbon has an immaterial effect on the recoverable amount of each of the standalone CGUs and as such carbon costs are not deemed to be 
a key assumption. The Directors are aware of the ever-changing risks attached to climate change and will regularly assess these risks against 
judgements and estimates made in future impairment testing.

Pharma production capacity expansion project. 

During the year plant and equipment was impaired by £1.2m. This impairment is recorded in the income statement within operating costs. During the 
prior year, plant and equipment was impaired by £7.6m relating to the write-off of unusable manufacturing plant in Japan. This impairment was recorded 
in the income statement as an exceptional item within operating costs and was within the Consumer Care (£5.0m) and Life Sciences (£2.6m) operating 
business segments.

Fair values 
In January 2020 the existing US$100m fixed rate 10 year note matured and was repaid, this was replaced with a new US$100m fixed rate 10 year note 
(27 January 2020). On 27 June 2016, the Group issued £100m (£70m and £30m) and €100m (€70m and €30m) of fixed rate notes. On 6 June 2019, 
the Group issued a further £65m, €50m and US$60m of fixed rate notes. In June 2023, the existing £30m and €30m fixed rate 7 year notes matured 
and were repaid. 

The table below details a comparison of the book and fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. Where there are no readily available market 
values to determine fair values, cash flows relating to the various instruments have been discounted at prevailing interest and exchange rates to give an 
estimate of fair value.

For financial instruments with a remaining life of greater than one year, fair values are based on cash flows discounted at prevailing interest rates. 
Accordingly, the fair value of cash deposits and short-term borrowings approximates to the book value due to the short maturity of these instruments. 
The same applies to trade and other receivables and payables excluded from the above analysis.

Financial instruments 
Financial instruments measured at fair value use the following hierarchy: 

•  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) 
•  Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, 

derived from prices) (level 2) 

•  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). 

All of the Group’s financial instruments are classed as level 2 with the exception of contingent consideration, other investments and lease liabilities, which 
are classed as level 3. 

Preference share capital 

The authorised, issued and fully paid preference share capital comprises: 
615,562 5.9% preference shares of £1 (2022: 615,562)

The preference shares have no redemption rights and carry no voting rights other than in certain circumstances affecting the rights of the preference 
shareholders, details of which are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association. The three classes of preference shares rank pari passu with each 
other but ahead of the ordinary shares on a winding up. Rights on a winding up are limited to repayment of capital and any arrears of dividends. 

Borrowing facilities 
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of £381.2m (2022: £579.3m). In addition, the Group had other undrawn facilities 
of £70.5m (2022: £53.1m) available. All of the Group's total committed facilities of £1,050.0m expire after 2024. New and repaid borrowings disclosed in 
the Group statement of cash flows reflect routine short-term cash management, comprising regular monthly drawdowns and repayments on the Group's 
revolving credit facilities. It also reflects the repayments made to the Group's revolving credit facility and the term loan facility following the business 
disposal in the prior year. 

Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk 
management strategy is approved by the Board and implemented and reviewed by the Risk Management Committee. Detailed financial risk 
management is then delegated to the Group Finance department which has a specific policy manual that sets out guidelines to manage financial risk. 
Regular reports are received from all sectors and regional operating units to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate action may 
be taken. In the management definition of capital the Group includes ordinary and preference share capital and net debt. 

Currency risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and 
the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. 
Entities in the Group use foreign currency bank balances to manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised 
assets and liabilities. The Group’s risk management policy is to manage transactional risk up to three months forward. The Group has certain 
investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the 
Group’s foreign operations is not specifically hedged but is reduced primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies where it 
is efficient to do so. Currency exposure arising from significant one-off transactions (for example acquisitions or disposals) is reviewed and hedged 
through forward contracts if required. 

For 2023, had the Group’s basket of reporting currencies been 10% weaker/stronger than the actual rates experienced, post-tax profit for the year 
would have been £19.0m (2022: £27.6m) lower/higher than reported, primarily as a result of the translation of the profits of the Group’s overseas entities, 
and equity would have been £204.8m (2022: £162.4m) lower/higher.

and equity would have been £204.8m (2022: £162.4m) lower/higher. 

Cash flow hedging 
During the year, the Group held an instrument to hedge an exposure to changes in foreign currency on a highly probable future business combination 
(hedged item). At commencement, the nominal value of the contract was £223.6m and the average forward contract rate was 1480 (KRW:GBP). The 
contract, which was contingent on the successful completion of the business acquisition, was designated as a cash flow hedge and provided certainty 
over approximately 97% of the estimated FX exposure on the forecast future transaction. The forecast future transaction was completed in the year 
ended 31 December 2023 and the associated instrument settled. The cumulative cash flow hedging reserve of £19.3m debit was reclassified to 
goodwill, presented as part of the cash consideration amount in note 27. During the year ended 31 December 2023, the associated hedge 
ineffectiveness of £4.6m has been recognised in the Group income statement within operating costs (administrative expenses) and reported as an 
exceptional item (business acquisition costs). The cash flow in relation to both the effective and ineffective portions of the hedge has been recorded as  
an investing activity in the Group statement of cash flows in accordance with the underlying hedged cash flow. In the prior year, the cumulative cash flow 
hedging reserve of £6.5m credit and cost of hedging reserves of £6.0m debit were reclassified to the income statement and reported within the gain on 
business disposal. 

Interest rate risk 
The Group has both interest bearing assets and liabilities. In 2016, the Group had a policy of maintaining no more than 60% of its gross borrowings at 
fixed interest rates in normal circumstances. During 2016, the Group increased its amount of fixed rate debt following payment of the £136m special 
dividend and consequent increase in core debt requirements. Notes were issued in the amounts of £100m and €100m with an average maturity of 2.5 
years and interest rate of 2.16%. During 2017, the policy formally increased the upper limit for fixed rate debt to 75% of gross borrowings. During 2019, 
the Group increased its amount of fixed rate debt following payment of the £151.5m special dividend. Notes were issued in the amounts of £65m,  
€50m and US$60m with an average maturity of 4.1 years and interest rate of 2.48%. In January 2020 the Group repaid its US$100m 10 year loan note 
carrying a fixed rate of 5.94% and replaced it with a US$100m 10 year loan note carrying a fixed rate of 3.75%. In June 2023, the existing £30m and 
€30m fixed rate 7 year notes matured and were repaid. At 31 December 2023, approximately 51% of Group borrowings were at fixed rates.  

At 31 December 2023, aside from the loan notes referred to above, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months of the balance 
sheet date.  

At 31 December 2023, the Group’s fixed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 2.64% (2022: 2.55%). As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s 
floating rate liabilities are based on SONIA, SOFR or EURIBOR, depending upon the drawdown currency. 

Based on the above, had interest rates moved by 100 basis points in the territories where the Group has substantial borrowings, post-tax profits would 
have moved by £2.7m (2022: £3.6m) due to a change in interest expense on the Group’s floating rate borrowings. 

Liquidity risk 
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available 
for operations and planned investments.  

On a regular basis, management monitors forecasts of the Group’s cash flows against both internal targets and those targets imposed by  
external lenders. The Group has substantial committed, unused facilities and the Directors are confident this situation will remain the case for the 
foreseeable future. 

Credit risk 
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an 
appropriate credit history. Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit quality financial institutions. The Group has policies 
that limit the amount of credit exposure to any individual financial institution. 

Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, as well as maintaining an optimal capital structure to reduce overall cost of capital. 

In order to maintain this optimal structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid, issue new shares, return capital to shareholders or 
dispose of assets to reduce net debt. Given the Group’s strong balance sheet and sustained trading growth, the Group announced a dividend policy  
in 2011 of paying a dividend of between 40% and 50% of sustainable earnings. Further details can be found in the Finance Review on pages 47 to 50. 

Underlying growth coupled to Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is the key perceived driver of shareholder value within the Group. The definition of  
ROIC has been revised in the year to exclude the Group’s net retirement benefit balances from invested capital, given they are not operating in nature. 
Comparative information presented in the Five year record has been restated to reflect the new definition. The Group’s ROIC now stands at 8.3% against 
a post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 8.1%. The Group’s target is to maintain ROIC at two to three times WACC over the long-term. 
In addition, the Group employs two widely used ratios to measure its ability to service its debt. Both net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA interest cover were 
well ahead of target in 2023. Further details can be found in the Finance Review on pages 47 to 50. The Group was in compliance with its covenant 
requirements throughout the year. Additional information on progress against key performance indicators can be found on pages 34 to 37.

Provisions are made where a constructive or legal obligation has arisen from a past event, can be quantified and where the timing of the transfer of 
economic benefits relating to the provisions cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty. 

The environmental provision relates to soil, potential groundwater and other contamination on a number of sites, both currently in use and previously 
occupied, in Europe and the Americas. The provisions are based on most recently available facts and prior experience and are recorded at the estimated 
amount as at the balance sheet date. The Directors expect that the balance will be utilised within 10 years. 

The site restoration provisions relate to certain leased sites with an existing obligation to restore the environment or dismantle assets. The provisions are 
based on most recently available facts and prior experience and are recorded at the estimated amount as at the balance sheet date. The associated 
leased sites have remaining terms of between 17 and 43 years.  

During the year, a restructuring provision has been created associated with changes to the Group’s operating model. This provision is expected to be 
utilised within one year. 

The Group has also considered the impact of discounting on its provisions and has concluded that, as a consequence of the size of the provisions and 
utilisation timescales, the impact is not material.

Croda International Plc Sharesave Scheme (‘Sharesave’) 
The Sharesave Scheme, established in 1983 and renewed in 2013, grants options annually in September to employees of the Group at a fixed exercise 
price, being the market price of the Company’s shares at the grant date discounted by up to 20%. Employees then enter into a savings contract over 
three years and, subject to continued employment, purchase options at the end of the period based on the amount saved. Options are then exercisable 
for a six month period following completion of the savings contract. For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions 
used in the calculation of the value are as follows:

Croda International Plc Performance Share Plan 2014 (‘PSP’) 
The PSP scheme was established in 2014 and replaced the Company’s previous Executive long-term incentive plans. The PSP provides for awards of 
free shares (i.e. either conditional shares or nil-cost options) normally made annually which vest after three years dependent upon an EPS performance 
related sliding scale (non-market condition), an NPP growth measure (non-market condition), sustainability conditions in relation to decarbonisation 
roadmaps and emissions (non-market conditions) and the Group’s total shareholder return (market condition). The PSP is discussed in detail in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report (pages 106 to 134). Shares (on an after-tax basis) are subject to a two-year post vesting holding period. For options 
granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows:

Croda International Plc Free Share Plan (‘FSP’) 
The FSP scheme was established in 2021 and provides for awards of free shares or cash equivalent to eligible employees. The Company has discretion 
to set the number of shares awarded. The awards will vest provided that the employee remains employed by the Group and that a bonus payment is 
paid under the terms of the Company's Group Profit Incentive Bonus Scheme in respect of the financial year concerned. Subject to the two conditions 
being met, on the vesting date, UK employees (and certain other identified jurisdictions) will be awarded free shares and non-UK employees will be paid  
a cash equivalent based on the market price. No options were granted under this plan in 2023.

Croda International Plc Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) 
The SIP scheme has similar objectives to the Sharesave Scheme in terms of increasing employee retention and share ownership. Under the scheme, 
employees enter into an agreement to purchase shares in the Company each month. For each share purchased by an employee, the Company awards 
a matching share which passes to the employee after three years' service. The matching shares are allocated each month at market value with this fair 
value charge being recognised in the income statement in full in the year of allocation. 

24. Shareholders’ equity 
Croda International Plc Qualifying Share Ownership Trust (QUEST), Croda International Plc Employee Benefit Trust (CIPEBT) and Croda International Plc 
AESOP Trust (AESOP) each hold shares purchased on the open market or transferred from treasury shares to satisfy the future issue of shares under the 
Group's share option schemes. As at 31 December 2023 the QUEST had a net amount due from the Company of £20.0m (2022: £19.8m) and held 
51,348 (2022: 57,216) shares transferred at a nil cost (2022: nil cost) with a market value of £2.6m (2022: £3.8m). As at 31 December 2023 there was 
no loan between the CIPEBT and the Company (2022: £37.8m) following the loan being forgiven in 2023. The CIPEBT held 791 (2022: 688) shares 
transferred at a nil cost (2022: nil cost) with a market value of £0.1m (2022: £0.1m). 

As at 31 December 2023 the AESOP had issued all its previously held shares, as financed by the Company, and thus had no residual loan balance with 
the Company. All of the shares held by the QUEST and CIPEBT were under option at 31 December 2023 and, except for a nominal amount, the right to 
receive dividends has been waived. 

As at 31 December 2023 the total number of treasury shares held was 2,901,442 (2022: 2,901,442) with a market value of £146.5m (2022: £199.3m).

2023 Acquisition 
On 4 July 2023 the Group successfully completed the acquisition of 100% share capital of Solus Biotech Co Ltd ‘Solus’, a global leader in premium, 
biotechnology-derived active ingredients for beauty care (Consumer Care sector) and pharmaceuticals (Life Sciences sector) employing 95 people in 
South Korea. The business was acquired for a total cash consideration of £227.4m. The acquisition provides access to Solus’ existing biotech-derived 
ceramide and phospholipid technologies, and its emerging capabilities in natural retinol. This acquisition will significantly strengthen Croda’s Beauty 
Actives portfolio and increases its exposure to targeted prestige segments. Located in South Korea, Solus expands Croda’s Asian manufacturing 
capability and will create a new biotechnology R&D hub in the region. Post-acquisition the entity has changed its name to Croda Korea Ltd. 

Acquisition-related costs of £9.6m have been charged to administrative expenses in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2023  
(2022: £nil). Post-acquisition, Solus contributed revenue of £13.3m and adjusted operating profit of £0.4m. Had the acquisition been made on 1 January 
2023, the Group’s revenue would have been £1,707.9m with adjusted operating profit of £320.9m.

and liabilities assumed.

operations, and formed part of Croda’s integrated operating model prior to disposal. The following table summarises the effect of the disposal

are disclosed in note 24 of the Group financial statements. 

Notes to the Company Financial Statements 

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently 
to all years presented, unless otherwise stated. 

A. Accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (‘FRS 100’) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 101’). In 
preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international 
accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where 
advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention,  
in compliance with the provisions of the Act and the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.  

As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under the standard in relation to share-based 
payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow 
statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are provided in the 
Group financial statements of Croda International Plc. 

Going concern 
The financial statements which appear on pages 195 to 200 have been prepared on a going concern basis as, after making appropriate enquiries, 
including a review of forecasts, budgets and banking facilities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence. 

Principal accounting policies 
The accounting policies which have been applied by the Company when preparing the financial statements are in accordance with FRS 101. FRS 101  
is based on the recognition and measurement requirements of Adopted IFRSs, under which the Group financial statements have been prepared. As a 
result, the accounting policies of the Company are consistent with those used by the Group as presented on pages 157 to 163, except for those relating 
to the recognition and measurement of goodwill and the recognition of revenue, which are not directly relevant to the Company financial statements. 
Other Company specific policies include; 

•  Investments are held at cost less accumulated impairment. Investments are subject to impairment testing upon indication of impairment, at which 

point the carrying value is reviewed against the underlying net assets or forecast cash generation of the entity.  
•  Provisions against amounts owed by Group undertakings, based on lifetime expected losses, are not material. 
•  The Company operates employee share trusts for the purpose of setting share-based payment arrangements. The Croda International Plc Employee 

Benefit Trust is treated as a branch of the Company with assets and liabilities accounted for as assets and liabilities of the Company. 

The Group accounting policy for financial risk factors is also relevant to the preparation of the Company financial statements and is disclosed on pages 
186 and 187. 

B. Profit and loss account 
Of the Group’s profit for the year, £35.9m (2022: £505.9m) is included in the profit and loss account of the Company which was approved by the Board 
on 26 February 2024 but which is not presented as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

L. Share-based payments 
The total charge for the year in respect of share-based remuneration schemes was £1.2m (2022: £5.4m). The grant by the Company of options over  
its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services 
received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary 
undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity. 

The key elements of each scheme along with the assumptions employed to arrive at the charge in the profit and loss account are set out in note 23 to 
the Group financial statements. 

M. Contingent liabilities 
The Company has guaranteed loan capital and bank overdrafts of subsidiary undertakings amounting to £179.4m as at 31 December 2023  
(2022: £153.5m). 

N. Dividends 
Details of dividends are disclosed in note 8 of the Group financial statements. 

O. Related party transactions 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 101 from disclosing transactions with other Group undertakings.  
There were no other related party transactions during the year. Information on the Group can be found in note 26 on page 194 of the Group  
financial statements.

zeros and can be found on your dividend tax 
voucher or your share certificate. Receiving 
corporate communications by email has a 
number of benefits including being more 
environmentally friendly, reducing unnecessary 
waste, faster notification of information to 
shareholders and a reduction in company costs.

have been nominated by the registered holder of

required to direct all communications to the

sure you stop and check the warning signs.

How to avoid scams 
•  Treat all unexpected calls, emails and text 

messages, social media messages or even  
in person visits with caution. Don’t assume 
they’re genuine, even if the person seems to 
know some basic information about you.  
•  Don’t be pressured into acting quickly, hang 
up on calls and ignore messages if you feel 
pressured. A genuine bank or financial services 
firm won’t mind waiting if you want 
time to think.  

•  Never give out your bank account or credit 
card details unless you are certain who you  
are dealing with. 

•  If you’re buying a financial product such as a 
loan, insurance, investment or pension, only 
deal with an FCA-authorised firm - check the 
FS Register to see if the firm is registered. 
Always access the Register from the FCA 
website, rather than through links in emails  
or on a firm’s website (it might be part of  
the scam).  

•  Double-check the URL and contact details of a 
firm in case it’s a ‘clone firm’ pretending to be 
a real firm, such as your bank or a genuine 
investment firm. 

•  Check the list of unauthorised firms and 

individuals the FCA have received complaints 
about. If the firm isn’t on their list, don’t assume 
it’s legitimate - it may not have been reported 
to them yet. 

•  Check your bank account and credit 

card statements regularly. 

•  Don’t give access to your device by 

downloading software or an app from a source 
you don’t trust. Scammers may be able to 
view, take control of your device and access 
your bank account. 

•  Remember: if it sounds too good to be true,  

it probably is! 

Report a scam 
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell  
the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at 
www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you can find out 
more about investment scams. 

You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline 
on 0800 111 6768. 

If you have already paid money to share 
fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 
0300 123 2040.

1.  Before exceptional items, amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition and the tax thereon where applicable. 

2.  Interest excludes net interest on retirement benefit liabilities. 

3.  The Group acquired Avanti Polar Lipids, LLC on 12 August 2020 and Fragrance Spanish Topco, S.L. (‘Iberchem’) on 24 November 2020. Given the value of the acquisitions, 

the Group's measure of average adjusted invested capital for 2020 has been adjusted for the related weighted average impact.  

4.  Covenant EBITDA is EBITDA as defined in the Finance Review but before share-based payment charges and the loss on associates. Covenant EBITDA is also adjusted to 

reflect the annualised impact of acquisitions or disposals in the period. 

5.  The Group has revised the definition of ROIC in the year as set out in the Finance Review and comparative information has been restated. The calculation of economic value 

added has also been updated to align with these changes and comparative information restated. 

The five year record is presented based on the applicable accounting standards at the relevant reporting date.
