Helping people 
secure a life of 
possibilities 

As a purpose-led business we seek to 
address the needs of a broad range of 
stakeholders. Positive engagement and 
successful outcomes are key to ensuring 
a strong and sustainable business. 

Providing certainty 
in retirement
We are delivering new products and solutions  
to provide more support to new and existing 
customers as they journey to and through 
retirement. In September, we launched a new 
individual annuity product, the Standard Life 
Pension Annuity, that pays customers a 
guaranteed income for the rest of their life, 
bought with some or all of the proceeds from 
their pension plan. Available on the open market  
to both new and existing customers, the launch  
of this product has been welcomed by both 
advisers and customers and we have seen  
a strong pipeline of applications building.

With 9 in 10 people saying 
income certainty in retirement  
is important to them1, an annuity 
is likely to be an ideal solution  
for many.

Claire Altman, MD Individual Retirement Solutions

Encouraging a  
national conversation
At Phoenix Group we recognise that we all need to  
think differently about our futures, and the futures  
of those we care about, if we are to lead better longer  
lives. Research from our think tank, Phoenix Insights, 
continues to highlight the scale and severity of under 
saving for retirement in the UK. To encourage a national 
conversation, we launched our ‘Let’s Start Talking’ 
campaign in 2023. It is designed to get people talking 
about the need to think about how we live, work,  
and save for the longer lives we are now leading.  
The campaign features real people sharing their stories 
and perspectives on preparing for the retirement they 
want, and emphasises the need to take steps now to 
make better longer lives a reality for all of us.

Through our Let’s Start Talking 
campaign we reached over  
4 million people, which inspired 
conversations about how we live, 
work, learn and save for the longer 
lives we lead. 

Ben Rhodes, Brand Director

Bridging the digital divide
We believe digital inclusion is a collective 
responsibility and it’s vital we work in partnership 
across the public, private and third sectors to 
achieve it. We have successfully launched Digital 
Skills Hubs across our customer brands, which 
include online training videos and how-to guides. 
This enables our customers to access and learn online 
in their own time and at their own pace. We’re also 
making sure our colleagues are fully informed about 
digital inclusion, so that they can support our customers 
better, and ensure we design and aim to deliver an 
inclusive service for all our customers.

Supporting financial wellbeing
We want to help our customers to be empowered to take 
charge of their finances, so that is why we’ve rolled out 
Our Money Mindset solution to over 1.5 million Standard 
Life Workplace pension scheme members. Money Mindset 
is a digital platform that allows customers to monitor their 
financial position. This better understanding helps put 
them in a position to improve their financial wellbeing, 
and the app provides the information they need to help 
plan for the future.

Investing  
in a better  
future

As the UK’s largest long-term savings and retirement 
business, we recognise our responsibility to tackle climate 
change. By taking the right actions to decarbonise,  
we believe that we can manage the risks and maximise  
the opportunities of climate change on behalf of our  
12 million customers. And with £283 billion of assets  
under administration, our scale means we can make  
a real difference. This year we published our Net Zero 
Transition Plan, which outlined the tangible steps we  
will take to become a net zero business by 2050.

We believe that better career support, at all ages, allows

Phoenix Insights is leading the way with a new campaign, 
‘Careers can change’, to inspire people to see that their  
careers can change successfully, by small incremental shifts  
or total pivots. At the heart of this campaign is a new coalition 
of experts and partners working with us. Together, we will  
raise awareness of good quality, accessible career support  
and make sure people are connected to it.

Chair’s statement

Delivering  
on our purpose 

We want to help people journey  
to and through retirement while 
investing in a better future for us all. 
Our approach focuses on two key 
areas: People and Planet. We are 
looking to address the UK pensions 
savings gap and manage the risk and 
opportunities of climate change.

Sabbatical reflections
1 December 2023 marked my return as Chair  
of Phoenix Group, following a 14-month 
sabbatical where I fulfilled the role of Lord 
Mayor of the City of London. I am delighted 
to be back and look forward to supporting 
the continued evolution of our business.

As Lord Mayor it was my great privilege  
and responsibility to represent and promote 
the UK financial services industry. In doing  
so, my sabbatical confirmed to me that  
this industry is an essential element of the  
UK economy, with a critical role to play in 
supporting both economic growth and the 
trajectory to net zero by 2050 through 
sustainable investment. The clear feedback 
from my international travels is that the UK 
financial services industry is perceived as 
market-leading and there is great optimism 
about its future. 

I would like to thank Alastair Barbour who 
assumed the role of Chair in my absence.  
He has made an enormous contribution  
to Phoenix over his ten-year tenure as a 
Director, and I wish him well for the future 
now that he has stepped down from  
the Board.

At Phoenix our purpose is our North Star and  
it drives all that we do. I am delighted with the 
progress we have made this year to bring about 
better outcomes for all our stakeholders. 

Nicholas Lyons, Chair of the Group Board

Delivering on our purpose
The pensions savings gap in the UK is  
a growing societal problem. As the UK’s  
largest long-term savings and retirement 
business, we are striving to raise awareness  
of this problem and advocate for the  
changes needed to deliver the solutions  
and help people secure a life of possibilities. 

Strong cash generation provides 
opportunity to invest and realise  
our vision 
The team has delivered strong cash 
generation in 2023 with an acceleration  
in the organic growth story clearly evident, 
whilst at the same time maintaining a  
resilient balance sheet. 

We know that people can only save for 
their retirement if they have access to 
good work over their longer lives. That is 
why we are playing a role in promoting 
good work through Phoenix Insights, 
working in collaboration with others 
to influence government policy. 

We are committed to innovating to 
develop the retirement income solutions 
of the future and we are advocating for 
the removal of policy barriers to enable 
us to support customers as they save for, 
journey to, and secure income in, retirement. 
More specifically we have recommended 
a framework to support an increase in 
auto-enrolment contributions from 8% to 
12%, and we believe that guidance and 
advice should be available for everyone, 
not just those who can afford to pay for it.

We can drive good outcomes for our 
customers and manage the risks of climate 
change by delivering on our Net Zero 
Transition Plan commitments, outlined in  
our plan published in May, and by helping  
to unlock the barriers to allow capital  
to flow at scale into productive and 
sustainable investments. 

I was delighted that we were a leading 
signatory and vocal proponent of the  
Mansion House Compact when it was 
unveiled in July. This seeks to address some 
of the issues around investing in unlisted 
equity, and the growth of UK companies  
of the future. I have every confidence the 
Compact will accomplish the dual aim of 
securing a brighter future for retirees and 
helping to channel billions of pounds into  
the UK economy.

We are on a journey to deliver our vision  
of becoming the UK’s leading retirement 
savings and income business. The clear 
strategic success in building the organic 
growth business over the last three years 
means we have reached a key milestone  
on our journey, as we evolve the business.  
The focus is now on investing to grow, optimise 
and enhance the business even further. 

Strategic outcomes support a new 
dividend policy 
I am delighted to announce that the Board is 
recommending a 2.5% increase in the Group’s 
2023 Final dividend to 26.65 pence per 
share. This means the Group’s Total dividend 
for 2023 will be 52.65 pence per share.

The Board is confident in the Group’s ability 
to deliver the next phase of our strategic 
journey, as we transition to our vision of 
becoming the UK’s leading retirement savings 
and income business. This has supported  
our decision to move to a progressive and 
sustainable ordinary dividend policy, which  
is underpinned by the sustainable growth in 
Operating Cash Generation we now expect 
to deliver. 

Thank you
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank the Board, our colleagues, our partners 
and our wider stakeholders for their hard 
work, dedication and support in delivering 
another year of strong progress.

Nicholas Lyons 
Chair of the Group Board

Section 172 
statement
During the year, Directors have applied 
section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 
in a manner consistent with the Group’s 
purpose, values and strategic priorities. 
The Directors have acted in a way which 
they consider, in good faith, is most 
likely to promote the success of the 
Company for the benefit of its members 
as a whole. In doing so the Directors 
have paid due regard to the matters set 
out in section 172(1) (a) to (f), namely:

•

•

•

•

•

•

 the likely consequences of 
decisions in the long-term;
the interests of any of the 
Company’s employees;
 the need to foster the Company’s 
business relationships with 
suppliers, customers and others;
 the impact of the Company’s 
operations on the community 
and the environment;
 the desirability of maintaining the 
Company’s reputation for high 
standards of business conduct; and
 the need to act fairly between 
members of the Company.

 Examples of how Directors  
have considered these matters 
in connection with key decisions 
linked to our strategic priorities are 
detailed on pages 74 to 77 of  
the Corporate governance report.

Successfully 
delivering 
our strategy

2023 has seen Phoenix Group 
deliver significant strategic  
progress and strong results,  
further supporting our track  
record of dividend growth. 

I am delighted that 2023 was another year of strong  
new business growth for Phoenix Group. Having now 
built the component parts of a sustainably growing 
business, the next stage on our journey will see us  
grow, optimise and enhance our business so we can  
meet more of our customers’ retirement needs and  
deliver more value for our stakeholders.

Andy Briggs, Group Chief Executive Officer

Investing in the 
Standard Life brand
A key part of our growth strategy is 
leveraging the power of the Standard 
Life brand that we acquired in 2021.  
We now utilise the brand across our 
Retirement Solutions, Pensions and 
Savings and European businesses. 

The Standard Life brand has a deep 
history and heritage, and is well known 
and trusted by advisers and customers. 
It has been a key factor in supporting 
our strong organic growth over the  
past few years and will support us in  
our future growth ambitions. As part  
of our drive to deliver our growth 
targets, we are committed to investing 
in the brand through initiatives like our 
Race for Life partnership and recent 
advertising campaigns.

From a capital perspective, we saw  
a reduction in our Solvency II surplus 
to £3.9 billion (2022: £4.4 billion) and 
our Shareholder Capital Coverage 
Ratio (‘SCCR’) to 176% (2022: 189%) 
after allocating capital into growth 
opportunities. However, we continue to 
operate towards the upper-end of our 
140–180% SCCR operating range. 

In terms of our earnings, our IFRS adjusted 
operating profit increased by 13% to £617 
million (2022: £544 million) supported 
by growth in our Pensions and Savings 
business. However, we reported an IFRS 
loss after tax of £(88) million, reflecting 
our investment into growth opportunities, 
as well as integration and transformation 
expenses in the period. However, this 
was significantly lower than the 2022 loss 
of £(2,657) million, benefiting from less 
accounting volatility from market movements. 

As a result of this strong strategic and 
financial performance, the Board has 
recommended a 2.5% increase in the  
Final dividend of 26.65 pence per share, 
bringing the Total 2023 dividend to  
52.65 pence per share, extending our 
strong track record of dividend growth. 

A strategy supported by existing large  
and growing markets 
Phoenix Group is the UK’s largest long-term 
savings and retirement business, managing 
c.£283 billion of assets for c.12 million 
customers. Our purpose of ‘helping people 
secure a life of possibilities’ is embedded in 
everything that we do and informs our single 
strategic focus, which is to help customers 
journey to and through retirement. 

We have a diversified and balanced  
business mix, across the long-term savings 
and retirement market, which can be largely 
categorised as ‘Pensions and Savings’ and 
‘Retirement Solutions’. Around two-thirds  
of our business is Pensions and Savings, 
which principally consists of capital-light 
fee-based products. 

Delivering strong results 
2023 has been another year of clear 
strategic delivery for Phoenix. 

We’re a highly cash generative business,  
as demonstrated by the delivery of £2.0 billion  
of total cash generation in 2023 (2022:  
£1.5 billion), exceeding our upgraded target 
of c.£1.8 billion target for the year. This was 
supported by the completion of one of the 
largest ever UK insurance Part VII transfers. 

Executing against our strategic priorities 
enabled us to deliver another record year  
of new business long-term cash generation 
(‘NB LTCG’) of £1.5 billion (2022: £1.2 billion). 
This was supported by a c.70% increase  
in new business net fund flows in 2023 to  
£6.7 billion (2022: £3.9 billion). Performance in 
our Pensions and Savings business included 
the transfer of the Siemens workplace 
scheme, one of the largest workplace 
scheme transfers to have been tendered  
in the UK market in recent years. This clearly 
demonstrates the success we have had in 
re-establishing the Standard Life brand  
as a major workplace player. Growth in  
our Retirement Solutions business was also 
strong, driven by our Bulk Purchase Annuities 
(‘BPA’) business, which saw the Group write 
£6.2 billion of premiums during the year 
(FY22: £4.8 billion) at a reduced capital strain. 

• We are on a journey from being a closed-
book life consolidator to a purpose-led 
retirement savings and income business 

• Strong 2023 results delivered through 

strategic execution 

• We are balancing our investment to grow,

The UK long-term savings and retirement 
market is already large, with c.£3 trillion  
of total stock, but it is also growing fast,  
with annual flows of c.£150–200 billion.  
The breadth of our product portfolio  
means we are able to take advantage of  
a number of growing market opportunities. 
See pages 18 to 19 for ‘Our growth drivers’. 

Embarking on the next stage of our journey 
Back in 2020, we had a single core  
capability, which was executing M&A 
and integrating those businesses. 
However, over the past three years 
we have built a number of sustainably 
growing organic businesses too.

This has seen us acquire and invest into the 
trusted Standard Life brand, and re-establish 
it amongst customers, corporates and advisers.

We have used that brand to help turbo-
charge our growth as we built a competitive 
and capital efficient annuities business, 
followed by our now large and rapidly 
growing capital-light Workplace business.
In addition, we have built a highly-skilled 
in-house asset management capability, 
enabling us to efficiently manage our 
third-party asset managers, and to create 

long-term value through optimising our 
c.£38 billion shareholder credit portfolio.

We have an ongoing programme of initiatives 
to review our products and services and 
over the past seven years, we have invested 
significantly in focusing on good customer 
treatments and outcomes across our 
businesses. During that time, we have set 
aside over £200m on reducing charges and 
we are making planned investment to migrate 
customers to more modern technology.  
We are actively working to ensure we are well 
positioned to comply fully with the upcoming 
Consumer Duty requirements which come 
into effect on 31 July 2024, for which we 
set aside £70 million of Solvency II capital. 

Our successful execution has enabled 
us to prove “the wedge” hypothesis, 
with the new business cash from our 
Open businesses more than offsetting 
the Heritage run-off. That means we are 
today a sustainably growing business, 
and no longer reliant on M&A. 

The next phase of our strategy is therefore 
about building on the strong foundations 
we have developed, and completing 
our full-service customer offering.

Sustainable cash generation

We will do this by building an innovative 
range of retirement income solutions and 
a compelling set of retail propositions, 
supported by a digital customer interface 
with personalised data, guidance and advice.
We are also now at the stage where we 
can further simplify our organisational 
structure, through integrating our Heritage 
and Open businesses onto a single 
Group-wide operating model. This will 
enable us to grow faster, by offering all 
of our customers, whether in an Open or 
Heritage product, a seamless journey across 
their savings life cycle. It will also further 
enhance our existing cost efficiency. 

The successful execution of our strategy  
will enable us to win market share and grow 
our business sustainably over time as we 
journey towards our vision of becoming  
the UK’s leading retirement savings and 
income business.

Balancing investment across our  
strategic priorities 
To support us on our journey we have a 
clear set of strategic priorities to 1) Grow 
2) Optimise and 3) Enhance, which are 
informed by – and in support – of our 
ESG themes of Planet and People and 
are underpinned by robust investment 
programmes within our new capital 
allocation framework. See pages 24 to 29 
for more detail on our strategic priorities. 

Firstly, we will Grow through building an 
innovative range of retirement income 
solutions, and a compelling set of Retail 
propositions, supported by a digital customer 
interface, with personalised data, guidance 
and advice. We will also further strengthen 
our Workplace proposition and optimise  
our annuities business. This will require 
 c.£100 million of investment into our growth 
propositions, alongside c.£200 million of 
capital per annum into annuities, the outcome 
of which is to support mid-single digit growth 
in Operating Cash Generation over the  
long term. 

Our second priority is to Optimise. As part  
of this we plan to continue our approach  
of repaying M&A-related debt with surplus 
cash. We expect to repay at least £500 million 
of debt by the end of 2026, on top of the 
c.£800 million we have repaid since 2020. 
This will support us in getting to a c.30% 
Solvency II leverage ratio by the end of 2026, 
which we believe is an appropriate steady-
state level for our business, absent M&A. 

We will also invest c.£100 million to enhance 
our asset and liability optimisation capabilities. 
This, alongside strong business growth, will 
support us in delivering increased recurring 
management actions of c.£400 million by 2026. 

Our Enhance priority is designed to 
support us in transforming our operating 
model and culture, to create a leading, 
cost efficient and modern organisation.

We continue to invest to complete our 
remaining customer migrations onto TCS 
Diligenta. In addition, we intend to invest to 
improve the support we give our customers 
throughout their lives and to drive scale cost 
efficiencies by integrating our business  
onto a single Group-wide operating model. 
Together, these migration, transformation 
and cost efficiency programmes will  
require c.£500 million of investment. 

Our focus on driving cost efficiency will 
enable us to deliver c.£250 million of annual 
cost savings by the end of 2026, which will 
enhance all of our key reporting metrics. 

We also continue to strive to make Phoenix 
Group ‘the best place any of us have ever 
worked’; through providing a great colleague 
experience. We passionately believe that by 
being diverse and inclusive we’ll be a better 
organisation, we’ll make better decisions, 
and we’ll do a better job of representing 
our customers and communities. 

Our new simplified, diverse and inclusive 
organisational structure will better empower 
our colleagues to make the right decisions  
for our customers. 

Demonstrating the long-term 
sustainability of our business
Our strategy will support the delivery  
of sustainable, growing cash generation,  
a resilient capital position and  
improved earnings. 

As part of our evolved financial 
framework we are introducing Operating 
Cash Generation (‘OCG’) as a new 
metric, to demonstrate the long-term 
sustainability of our business. 

OCG is the sustainable level of surplus 
generation in our Life Companies, each and 
every year, that is also then remitted as cash 
to our Group Holding Company. See page 
33 in our Business Review for more detail. 

Executing against our strategic priorities  
will help us to grow OCG by c.25% over  
the next three years, from £1.1bn in 2023  
to £1.4bn in 2026. After this time, we expect  
it to grow at a sustainable, mid-single digit 
growth rate over the long term. 

Importantly, this OCG more than covers 
our recurring uses, and a growing 
dividend. Which generates excess 
cash that can support additional 
investment back into the business and/
or additional shareholder returns.

M&A can add further scale to our business 
Our existing scale and the success of our 
organic growth strategy mean that we  
are no longer reliant on M&A to grow our 
business and dividend, in the way we were 
when I joined.

We continue to believe that M&A can 
generate significant shareholder value,  
as demonstrated by our strong track  
record, and we see it as a potential lever  
to add further scale to our business.

However, we now have a range of organic 
growth opportunities available, in which to 
deploy our excess cash at very attractive 
returns, and so the bar for acquisitions is  
now higher than it has ever been.

Outlook 
The economic backdrop in the UK 
means our societal purpose of helping 
people secure a life of possibilities 
has never been more important. 

As we continue to strive to meet the needs 
of our customers, colleagues and other key 
stakeholders, this will support us in achieving 
our vision of becoming the UK’s leading 
retirement savings and income business. 

We are investing to grow, optimise and 
enhance our business to deliver this vision, 
which will enable us to win market share and 
grow our business sustainably over time. 

As a result, the Board believes it is 
now appropriate for us to move to a 
progressive and sustainable ordinary 
dividend policy, which is underpinned 
by the sustainable, growing OCG we 
expect to deliver over the long term.

We see this as a pivotal step in the 
evolution of Phoenix Group’s investment 
case, and it is a reflection of the Board’s 
confidence in our future strategy.

Thank you
The fantastic progress Phoenix Group 
has made this year could not have 
been achieved without our exceptional 
people. I would therefore like to thank my 
colleagues throughout the Group for their 
continued contribution and dedication. 

I look forward to our team delivering another 
year of significant progress in 2024. 

Andy Briggs
Group Chief Executive Officer

Strategic reportStrategic reportOur growth drivers

There is a huge societal need for what we do, as only c.10%  
of individuals take advice on their journey to and through retirement, 
and only 1-in-7 defined contribution (‘DC’) pension savers are on 
track for a retirement income that maintains their current living 
standards. Significant growth opportunities are available through 
the provision of retirement income and savings solutions. 

Organic growth

Opportunistic M&A

We have clear structural growth opportunities in the market…

Workplace

Retail

Bulk Purchase Annuities

Heritage M&A

The Workplace pension scheme market is growing  
rapidly, driven by auto-enrolment, an ageing population, 
the shift to Master Trust schemes, and the move from 
defined benefit pension schemes to defined contribution 
pension schemes. 

People are increasingly seeking advice and guidance  
on their journey to and through retirement, as responsibility 
for retirement planning has now shifted towards individuals 
away from corporates. 

Corporates are de-risking their defined benefit pension 
scheme liabilities through Bulk Purchase Annuities (‘BPA’) 
transactions in order to focus on their core businesses.  
This is fuelling increased demand for BPAs. 

Pressure on insurance companies to focus their  
strategies, free-up capital trapped in Heritage books,  
and to deal with cost inefficient legacy products and 
platforms, makes further consolidation in the UK market 
likely over time.

market opportunity 

…which are accelerated by the current economic environment

Salary inflation and 
full employment 

Higher salary inflation and high levels  
of employment have accelerated growth 
from our existing Workplace pension 
schemes. Despite cost-of-living pressures 
the vast majority of consumers are not 
opting out of making contributions into 
their workplace schemes. 

Lower market flows 

The Retail market has slowed down in  
this economic environment, with less 
switching of flows between providers.  
For Phoenix Group this is helpful,  
given our scale in-force book, as it  
helps us retain customers and extends  
their savings life cycle with us.

Higher interest rates

Higher interest rates mean BPAs,  
both buy-ins and buy-outs, are more 
affordable for trustees, driving record 
levels of demand. 

M&A can add further 
scale to our business

We can undertake M&A to:

• Acquire new customers
• Acquire capabilities

Our business model continued

Helping customers 
journey to and 
through retirement

We focus on meeting the long-term savings 
and retirement needs of our customers by 
providing the products they need through  
our family of brands, as they accumulate wealth 
through the savings phase, then transition  
to securing income in retirement. 

Saving for retirement 
Retail savings  
for retirement
We help retail customers both directly  
and indirectly via financial advisers  
by providing a range of pension and 
investment solutions to support their 
retirement ambitions, with a number  
of innovative new products and  
services in development that will  
be launched shortly. 

Saving for retirement 
Defined contribution 
workplace pensions
With a Defined Contribution (‘DC’) 
workplace scheme individuals and typically 
their employer pay into their pension on a 
regular basis as they work. Standard Life is 
one of the leading UK providers that help 
employers and trustees set up high-quality, 
easy-to-run workplace pension schemes for 
their employees, and offer a leading digital 
interface for their employees to track and 
engage with their pension. 

Customer engagement is at the heart of our 
proposition and its why we’ve invested heavily  
in our app which is consistently highlighted by 
clients as a strength. Similarly, our dedicated 
Vulnerable Customer team means we’re set up  
to support the customers who need us most.

Gail Izat, Managing Director of Workplace

Saving for retirement 
Legacy pensions and 
savings products
Over the years, Phoenix Group has grown 
through the acquisition of closed books of 
legacy pension and insurance policies from  
a number of companies. We are the market 
leader in the safe and efficient management  
of legacy pensions and savings policies, with  
a strong track record of delivering better 
outcomes for customers of longstanding 
policies that are no longer sold in the  
wider market.

Transitioning to retirement
Pension 
consolidation
For people who have worked multiple  
jobs over the years, they may have been 
auto-enrolled into a number of pension 
plans by past employers, alongside any 
pension plans that they may have  
opened directly. With Standard Life’s 
pension transfer and consolidation 
expertise, customers can combine their 
pension plans into a single plan, making 
things easier to track and manage.  
Standard Life has plans to launch  
direct advisory capability in the near  
future and continues to develop  
close relationships with third party  
financial advisers. 

We are delighted to have 
partnered with Standard 
Life, to provide long-term 
security and financial 
certainty for all members.

Brian McGowan, Chairman of Chubb 
Pension Plan and Chubb Security  
Pension Fund Trustee Boards

Securing income in retirement 
Defined benefit 
pension income
Also known as a ‘final salary’ pension,  
a Defined Benefit (‘DB’) pension pays out  
a guaranteed income to members for life 
through retirement, but they are generally no 
longer offered to employees. The remaining 
DB pension schemes are exposed to a range 
of market and demographic risks that the 
sponsoring employer is responsible for.  
To remove these risks and enhance benefit 
security for scheme members, sponsors and 
trustees look to insure some or all of their 
pension scheme obligations with a specialist 
insurance company like Standard Life.

Securing income in retirement 
Home equity release
Our Mortgage Solutions business seeks  
to enable homeowners to access their 
property wealth in later life to financially 
support their retirement aspirations, by 
partnering with established lenders to fund 
innovative mortgage solutions in the market.

Securing income in retirement 
Income drawdown 
and individual 
annuities
Income drawdown provides a flexible way  
for our customers to take income from their 
pension pot as they can take out money 
whenever they like, while our individual 
annuity product offers pension savers secure 
guaranteed regular income certainty in 
retirement. Many customers have the need 
for a blend of both and Standard Life is 
working on a range of innovative products  
to address this.

A key part of our growth strategy  
is leveraging the power of the 
Standard Life brand which we utilise 
across our products to support 
customers as they save for, transition 
to and secure income in retirement.

Phoenix Group has significant growth 
opportunities available, both through meeting 
more of our existing customers’ needs, on their 
journey to and through retirement, and by 
acquiring new customers as well. Given the 
significant market opportunities available to 
us (see our growth drivers on pages 18 and 19) 
we have consciously chosen to invest heavily 
in order to accelerate our organic growth. 

We also continue to engage people in their 
financial futures, and to advocate for broader 
societal action to tackle under saving and 
encourage financial inclusion, which is a 
critical part of our commitment to our purpose. 

Delivering strong growth in our  
capital-light fee-based businesses 
Strong performance in Workplace has 
underpinned the growth in our capital-light 
fee-based business. 

Workplace has a unique attractive characteristic 
whereby the growth is principally driven  
by high retention of existing customers.  
This enables us to benefit from the natural 
compounding effect of this business model, 
which comes from new joiners and salary 
inflation increases within existing schemes. 
Given this characteristic it is extremely 
encouraging that we have not seen any 
material scheme losses in 2023 and do  
not anticipate any in 2024 either. 

In parallel our new scheme wins continue  
to accelerate, as we focus on the fast  
growing Master Trust segment of the  
market. Importantly we continue to win  
larger schemes, in addition to the smaller 
ones. For example, in 2023 our c.£2 billion  
of new Workplace scheme assets transferred 
included the transfer of the Siemens 
workplace scheme, one of largest scheme 
transfers to have been tendered in the UK 
market in recent years.

We also expect to see further new scheme 
assets transfer to Phoenix Group in 2024 
and 2025 based on secured scheme 
wins, but this will grow as we win more 
schemes over the course of 2024, providing 
further momentum in both fund inflows 
and cash generation. We are confident 
of winning further schemes over time 
and are currently quoting on a significant 
pipeline of new workplace schemes. 

Disciplined participation in a busy 
annuity market 
Within our Retirement Solutions business,  
the majority of the growth came from  
BPA, supported by a busy annuity market. 
We have been an active participant, writing 
£6.2 billion of premiums (2022: £4.8 billion), 
but remain disciplined in our approach.  
We will continue to grow our annuities 
business, to take advantage of the strong 
demand from corporates and consumers  
in this market. 

Supporting 
vulnerable customers
The needs of our customers are always 
changing and so it is important our  
services can adapt to meet these changing 
needs. Our vulnerability strategy provides 
support for those most at risk of harm, and 
aims to continually raise standards across 
our industry. 

Our annual Vulnerable Customer Summits 
share best practice on how the industry 
can tackle the increasing issue of financial 
vulnerability in the UK. Our most recent 
one, in February 2024, was attended by 
over 80 institutions. 

Read the whitepaper here

Priorities for 2024

•  Build a range of attractive Retail 

market propositions and innovative
retirement income solutions
 Invest c.£200m p.a. into annuities

• 
• Increase awareness of the 
pensions savings gap and 
motivate at least one million 
people to action through our 
brand campaign 

However, due to the success we have had  
in building our scale and driving capital 
efficiency, we can now invest less capital 
going forward, while broadly maintaining  
our current volumes. We therefore expect  
to invest c.£200 million of capital annually 
from 2024. This also reflects our strategy  
of driving balanced growth and reflects the 
confidence we have in our future capital-
light Pensions and Savings growth. 

We also successfully launched our Standard 
Life annuity product in September, for which 
initial feedback has been encouraging, 
demonstrating our ability to supplement 
our existing customer solutions. 

Investing in new and innovative products 
We have been investing to establish  
strong foundations and develop attractive 
propositions in the Retail market to become  
a leading consolidator for our customers.  

Our Retail business remains in net fund  
outflow at present, but through better 
supporting the 1-in-5 UK adults who are 
already Phoenix Group customers, we will  
be able to make significant inroads into 
stemming the annual outflows from our 
legacy products. Our commitment to invest  
a further c.£100 million into our growth 
propositions across 2024–2026 will enable  
us to turn these outflows into inflows, as we 
leverage the changing market dynamics.

For instance, we are optimistic that the FCA’s 
recent Advice Guidance Boundary Review 
represents a step forward in addressing  
the persistent advice and guidance gap.  

The proposals outlined create the potential 
for financial services providers like us to  
offer a greater level of customer support  
and we will continue to engage with the 
regulator on this subject and review the 
services we are able to provide as a result  
of the ongoing consultation. 

In March 2024 we started piloting the 
Standard Life Smoothed Return Pension 
Fund exclusively through the Fidelity 
Adviser Solutions platform, ahead of a full 
market launch later this year. We are also 
in the process of developing a number of 
new retirement income solutions which we 
hope to bring to market this year which will 
address customers’ needs for a combination 
of income certainty and flexibility. 

Engaging people in better 
financial futures
We set ourselves a 2023 target to deliver 
an awareness campaign reaching four 
million people on longer lives and under 
saving for retirement. We surpassed 
this target with our ‘Let’s Start Talking’ 
campaign reaching over 4 million people.

Promoting financial wellness
Standard Life partnered with Moneyhub, 
to enhance our Money Mindset digital app 
and dashboard, providing access to over 
1.5 million Workplace pension scheme 
members. By providing members with the 
relevant tools, content and information, 
Money Mindset allows customers to link, 
track and monitor their finances with the 
aim of improving their financial wellbeing.

Phoenix Group is a market leader in

and ensuring a resilient capital position. 

The Group’s cash generation stems from  
the emergence of surplus from our in-force 
business, which we enhance through the 
delivery of value accretive management 
actions, underpinned by the diversification 
of our portfolio and increasingly supported 
by the investments we’re making to enhance 
our asset management capabilities. 

In parallel, we deploy a comprehensive 
approach to risk management across our 
in-force business and we hedge the majority 
of our market risks including equity, interest 
rates and inflation. This brings resilience  
to our Solvency II capital position.

We are embedding sustainability throughout 
our business and across our strategic priorities. 
As a result, investing in a better future is a  
key part of optimising our in-force business, 
as we look to protect our customers from  
the risk of and maximise the opportunities 
presented by climate change. 

Delivering recurring management actions 
In 2023 we delivered £663 million (2022: 
£739 million) of total management actions. 
Importantly though, £303 million of these 
were recurring management actions. 

These are the day-to-day actions that we, 
and every other life insurance company 
take, to optimise our in-force balance 
sheets. They “add value” which means 
they increase cash, capital and earnings.

Over the last three years, we have invested 
in developing a highly-skilled in-house 
asset management team, whose day job 
is to optimise our assets and liabilities, 
and improve shareholder returns. 

The continuous portfolio optimisation actions 
we undertake to optimise our assets, and the 
balance sheet efficiency actions to optimise 
our liabilities, mean that a significant, and 
growing proportion of our management 
actions, will be recurring over the long term.

This includes the optimisation of our  
£38 billion shareholder credit portfolio 
(2022: £31 billion), where we can capture 
pricing dislocations across geographies, 
ratings and sectors. This is a sustainable 
source of recurring management actions, 
due to the dynamic nature of markets  
which will always create opportunities  
for us to enhance our risk adjusted returns.  
For instance, in 2023, our asset management 
team completed c.$1 billion of bond rotations 
to and from sterling and dollar bonds,  
to enhance our risk adjusted returns and 
generate management actions. 

Our annuity asset allocation approach is 
another key area and this includes the rapid 

Taking action to reach 
net zero by 2050
In 2023 we published our first Net Zero 
Transition Plan. This recognises the impact 
we can have as the UK’s largest long-term 
savings and retirement business and puts 
the needs of our customers at its centre. 
We are focused on managing the risks 
whilst maximising the opportunities of 
climate change for customers. One of the 
key actions that we can take towards net 
zero is to invest in climate solutions, but 
there are currently a number of barriers 
limiting both supply and demand of 
finance. That is why we partnered with 
campaign group Make My Money Matter 
to publish a report which outlined seven 
strategies for policymakers and regulators 
to unlock greater investment by the UK 
pensions industry.

Solutions report

Priorities for 2024

• Enhance our asset and liability 
optimisation capabilities to 
support recurring management 
actions of c.£400m per annum 
by 2026

• Continued diversification of 

our asset portfolio and build-out 
of our directly sourced illiquid 
asset capability 

• Begin deleveraging our balance 

sheet towards our c.30% 
Solvency II leverage ratio target 
by the end of 2026

• Ensuring that we remain on 
track to meet our 2025 and 
2030 interim targets on our 
way to net zero by 2050

deployment of new business BPA transition 
asset portfolios, that are received from 
corporates. Here we can reinvest these 
individual portfolios, which are typically cash 
and gilts, into higher yielding liquid credit, 
and deliver enhanced risk adjusted returns. 
We also have a significant medium-term 
opportunity for recurring actions as  
we trade-up to our long-term illiquid asset 
allocation. Over the long-term we will also  
be able to source a wider range of illiquid 
assets through both our expanding strategic 
partnerships and the in-house direct 
origination capability we have now built.

There is also a range of ongoing balance 
sheet efficiency actions available to us over 
time, including the regular ongoing capital 
model efficiencies we can deliver, as our  
risk profile changes and regulations evolve.

Looking forward, we are very confident that 
we can deliver a growing level of recurring 
management actions to c.£400million  
per annum by 2026. This is supported by  
the further c.£100 million investment we  
are making to enhance our asset and liability 
optimisation capabilities and the strong 
growth we expect across our business.

Using our scale to help create  
a better future 
Our certification as a signatory to the UK 
Stewardship Code in 2023 is a clear statement 
of our intent to manage the Environmental, 
Social and Governance (‘ESG’) risks to which 
our business is exposed through active 
stewardship. We continue to be committed 
to integrating decarbonisation strategies into 
our portfolios. 

We see this commitment as essential to 
managing the risk that climate change poses 
to our customers and a key step in meeting 
our interim 2025 and 2030 decarbonisation 
targets on our journey to being net zero  
by 2050. We have worked with leading index 
providers to design customised equity 
benchmarks which will apply a decarbonisation 
tilt to our policyholder listed equity portfolio, 
with implementation commencing in 2024 
and continuing in 2025. 

Building on the progress with decarbonising 
our policyholder assets, in 2023 we developed 
a decarbonisation strategy for our £12.5 billion 
shareholder corporate credit portfolio1.  
We intend to increase investments in net 
zero-aligned assets to 40–50% of this 
portfolio by 2025, and 50–70% by 2030. 

Finally, we exceeded our 50–70% target 
with 87% of our illiquid asset origination 
in the shareholder portfolio that are 
sustainable or transition assets in 20232 

Maintaining a resilient balance sheet 
The high levels of cash generated in our 
business not only gives us the ability and 
flexibility to invest but also to maintain  
a resilient balance sheet. 

In line with recent years, we plan to continue 
our approach of repaying M&A-related debt 
with surplus cash, and intend to repay at least 
£500 million of debt by the end of 2026. 
This will support us in targeting a Solvency II 
leverage ratio of c.30%3 by the end of 2026.

Enhancing our operating model and  
culture are key to our success. 

We do this by completing our planned 
integrations and migrations, and through 
driving simplification to a single, Group-wide 
operating model that benefits both our 
customers and our colleagues. This supports  
us in delivering a seamless customer 
experience and enables us to further  
enhance our cost efficiency. 

Alongside this, we are also committed to 
being a leading responsible business, which 
attracts and retains the best talent, through a 
diverse and inclusive, high-performance culture. 

Progressing our integrations and migrations 
M&A activity and any subsequent integrations 
have historically created the most significant 
opportunities to enhance our operating 
model, above and beyond the management 
actions we take on a recurring basis  
to optimise the business. 

In November we reached a significant 
milestone by completing the Part VII transfer 
of Standard Life1 and Phoenix Life Assurance 
Limited businesses into Phoenix Life Limited. 
This was one of the largest UK insurance 
Part VII transfers ever completed, bringing 
together the businesses of four legal 
entities, comprising c.8 million policies and 
c.£200 billion2 of assets into a single entity. 

We have a number of Part VII transfers 
in our plans as a result of other previous 
acquisitions, including ReAssure and Sun 
Life of Canada UK. However, we are not 
expecting a similar scale of benefit for those 
Part VII transfers, as the business mixes are 
relatively similar to Phoenix Life Limited. 

During the year we successfully completed 
the migration of another c.700,000 
Phoenix Life customers from Capita to TCS 
Diligenta’s BaNCS platform. We’re now 
well over half way through this project with 
a total of over 1.2 million policies moved to 
BaNCS from the nearly 2 million in scope.

We also delivered another significant 
milestone on our journey towards 
harmonised investment administration 
processes, as we migrated £12.3 billion of 
Phoenix Wealth Funds (c.700 funds) from 
our Investment Operations centre to HSBC 
Security Services. The objective was to 
harmonise our internal oversight model 
whilst ensuring the accurate and timely 
delivery of unit pricing, a key component 
in the end-to-end servicing of all our 
Pension and Savings unit linked products. 
This allows us to deliver better value to our 
customers and shareholders by simplifying 
complex processes and systems. 

Creating a way of 
working that works 
for our colleagues
We know that people are generally  
looking for flexibility in the way they  
work as they navigate different stages  
of their life. We also recognise the 
importance of having a diverse 
intergenerational workforce. 

Phoenix Flex, our new approach to  
flexible working, is a key enabler by 
encouraging and celebrating flexibility  
at work, embracing our differences and 
helping each of us to thrive. It can help 
those people raising families, those with 
caring responsibilities and those who  
are phasing up or down in their career. 

Priorities for 2024

•  Progress our ongoing migrations 
to Diligenta’s BaNCS platform
• Deliver initial cost savings as we 
simplify our operating model

 Standard Life refers to Standard Life Assurance Limited 
and Standard Life Pension Funds Limited.

2  Year end 2022 values.

Continued migrations and driving  
scale efficiencies 
Looking forward, we will continue to progress 
our remaining migrations across Standard 
Life, ReAssure and Sun Life of Canada UK. 

In addition, as we progress on our strategic 
journey we are very focused on being more 
effective and more efficient across our 
organisation, from both a customer and 
colleague perspective. This next phase is 
about building off the success of what we’ve 
had, taking the best from both ‘Heritage’  
and ‘Open’ to create something new  
and improved. 

We will therefore invest c.£500 million in our 
migration, transformation and cost efficiency 
programmes across 2024–2026, with around 
c.£300m having been guided to previously. 

Importantly, these programmes will deliver 
cost efficiencies at scale as we bring together 
all of our businesses onto a single Group-wide 
operating model. Integral to this will be 
delivering further Group cost efficiency 
activities, such as a range of organisational 
and governance simplification actions,  
and product and supplier rationalisation.

Our focus on driving cost efficiencies will 
support c.£250 million of annual cost savings 
by the end of 2026. Importantly, these cost 
savings will flow through to all of our key 
metrics, across our financial framework  
of cash, capital and earnings.

Creating the best place any  
of us have ever worked
At Phoenix Group we want to be the best 
place any of us have ever worked, which 
means we need to provide a great colleague 
experience. To support this ambition we 
implemented Phoenix Flex earlier this 
year. This is our new approach to flexible 
working, empowering all of our colleagues 
to agree the flexible working arrangements 
that work for them and their teams.

We also want Phoenix Group to reflect the 
customers we serve and the communities  
we operate in, and so we are striving to make 
sure our workplace is diverse. Building a 
diverse workforce allows us to attract the best 
talent, broaden our skill sets and widen our 
thinking. We made strong progress against 
our end-of-2023 Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion targets although we did fall short  
on our gender diversity in senior leaders 
target; see pages of 32 and 33 of our 
Sustainability report for more detail. 

We report on our colleague engagement 
through an employee Net Promoter Score 
(‘eNPS’), a broadly used and holistic metric 
that indicates how colleagues feel about 
working for Phoenix. We ended 2023 with  
an eNPS score of +32, our highest ever eNPS 
score and +2 higher than our end-of-year 
2022 score.

Delivering 
sustainable cash 
generation

In 2023 we have once 
again delivered a year  
of strong performance, 
as we execute on our 
strategy and fulfil  
our purpose. 

We have delivered another year of resilient 
cash generation, with £2.0 billion of total cash 
generated in 2023, exceeding our upgraded 
target of c.£1.8 billion. With £5.2 billion 
delivered across 2021 to 2023, we have  
also therefore over-delivered our three-year 
cash generation target of £4.4 billion,  
by c.£0.8 billion. 

We saw a strong performance in our  
growth businesses, which increased our 
incremental new business long-term cash 
generation (‘NB LTCG’) by 23% year-on-year 
to £1,514 million, and therefore have achieved 
our 2025 target two years early. This was 
supported by new business net fund flows that 
grew 72% to £6.7 billion (2022: £3.9 billion). 

Our Shareholder Capital Coverage Ratio 
(‘SCCR’) of 176% remains towards the 
upper-end of our operating range of 
140–180%, but reduced given our investment 
into growth, as well as our integration  
and transformation expenses. Similarly,  
our Solvency II (‘SII’) surplus reduced  
to £3.9 billion, but remains resilient.

 Incorporates changes to the Group’s methodology for determining adjusted operating profit since Half Year 2023  
(see Note B.1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details).

Our strong overall performance this year has 
therefore enabled the Board to recommend 
a dividend increase of 2.5% for the year. 

In terms of our IFRS earnings, the Group’s 
adjusted operating profit grew 13% to  
£617 million, supported by 27% growth  
in our Pensions and Savings business and  
an 8% increase in our Retirement Solutions 
business. While we reported an IFRS loss 
after tax of £88 million, this was a £2,569 
million improvement on 2022. The loss in 
2023 was primarily driven by £(781) million  
of non-operating items, as outlined on page 36.

The segmental information given reflects  
the Group’s new operating segments,  
further information is provided in note B.1  
on page 180.

Clear strategic progress
We have made significant strategic progress 
in delivering sustainable organic growth.
In Pensions and Savings, our Workplace 
business continues to see an attractive retention 
rate with existing clients but is also now 
winning new larger schemes. Our Retail 
business remains in net outflow, but we have 
a clear strategy to address this over the coming 
years, by investing to deliver compelling 
customer propositions. 

The progress we have  
made in executing our 
strategic priorities has 
enabled us to deliver  
a strong set of results  
in 2023, and supported 
the Board’s decision  
to recommend a 2.5% 
increase in the Final 
2023 dividend. 

Rakesh Thakrar,  
Group Chief Financial Officer

Our key performance indicators
With our financial framework designed  
to deliver cash, capital and earnings,  
we recognise the need to use a broad 
range of metrics to measure and  
report the performance of the Group,  
some of which are not defined or specified 
in accordance with Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (‘GAAP’) or the 
statutory reporting framework. The IFRS 
results are discussed on pages 36 to 37 
and the IFRS financial statements are  
set out from page 164 onwards.

Incremental new business long-term 
cash generation
Incremental new business long-term cash 
generation is a key metric for measuring 
growth. It represents the operating 
companies’ cash generation that is 
expected to arise in future years as a result  
of new business transacted in the period. 

New business net fund flows 
Represents the aggregate net position  
of assets under administration inflows  
less outflows for new business.

Alternative performance measures
In prioritising the generation of sustainable 
cash flows from our operating companies, 
performance metrics are monitored  
where they support this strategic purpose, 
which includes ensuring that the Solvency II 
capital strength of the Group is maintained. 
We use a range of Alternative Performance 
Measures (‘APMs’) to evaluate our business, 
including the below. Please see the APM 
section on page 312 for further details. 

Adjusted operating profit
The Group uses adjusted operating  
profit as a measure of IFRS performance 
based on long-term assumptions.  
Adjusted operating profit is less affected  
by the short-term market volatility driven 
by Solvency II hedging (as illustrated on 
page 36) and non-recurring items than 
IFRS profit. A more detailed definition  
of adjusted operating profit is set out  
on page 312.

Solvency II
Solvency II is a key metric by which the 
Group makes business decisions and 
measures capital resilience. It is a 
regulatory measure that prescribes the 
measurement of value on a Solvency II 
basis and the calculation of the solvency 
capital requirement (‘SCR’). The excess 
value above the SCR is reported as both  
a financial amount, ‘Solvency II surplus’, 
and as a ratio ‘Solvency II Shareholder 
Capital Coverage Ratio (‘SCCR’)’.

Solvency II leverage
The Group seeks to manage the level of 
debt on its balance sheet by monitoring  
its financial leverage ratio. Solvency II 
leverage is calculated as the Solvency II 
value of debt divided by the value of 
Solvency II Regulatory Own Funds.  
Values for debt are adjusted to allow for 
the impact of currency hedges in place 
over foreign currency denominated debt.

In Retirement Solutions, we continue to adopt  
a disciplined approach to Bulk Purchase 
Annuities (‘BPA’) and have been successful  
in reducing our capital strain. In September, 
we also launched a new individual annuity 
product, our first that is available in the 
open market. 

From an M&A perspective, we successfully 
completed the acquisition of Sun Life  
of Canada UK (‘SLOC’) in April with the 
integration progressing well. 

In summary, 2023 has been another year of 
clear strategic progress, that has supported 
the delivery of a strong set of results. 

We continue to deliver sustainable and 
resilient cash generation, which underpins 
our new progressive and sustainable ordinary 
dividend policy. Our Solvency capital position 
also remains highly resilient, and can support 
the investment to grow, optimise and enhance 
our business going forward.

An evolved financial framework for the 
next phase of our journey 
We are introducing our evolved financial 
framework that focuses on the three financial 
outcomes we deliver for our shareholders: 
cash, capital and earnings. 

Phoenix has always managed its business  
for cash and capital, but our evolved key 
metrics provide clearer line of sight to the 
underlying business performance and  
more comparability with peers. We are also 
elevating the importance of IFRS earnings  
in our framework, following the transition  
to IFRS 17.

The key metrics we use can be seen here 

Total cash generation
Cash generation represents the total  
cash remitted from the operating entities 
to the Group, supported by the Operating 
Cash Generation (see below) and the 
release of free surplus above capital 
requirements in the Life companies, which  
is generated through margins earned on life 
and pension products and the release of 
capital requirements, and Group tax relief.  
This cash generation is used by the Group  
to fund expenses, interest costs and 
shareholder dividends, with any surplus 
then available to reinvest into organic  
and inorganic growth opportunities.

Operating Cash Generation 
Operating Cash Generation (’OCG’)  
is a new reporting metric. It represents  
the sustainable level of cash generation  
in our life companies each and every  
year, that is remitted from our underlying 
business operations. It comprises the 
emergence of cash as in-force business 
runs off over time and capital unwinds,  
plus day one surplus from writing new 
business (net of day one strain for 
fee-based business), group tax relief and 
recurring management actions. In addition,  
it includes a small cash contribution from 
the release of the Capital Management 
Policy that we hold in our Life Companies. 
The measure provides the sources of 
recurring organic cash generated which 
can be used to support sustainable cash 
remittances from the Life Companies, 
which in turn supports the Group’s 
dividend, group costs and debt interest  
as well as funding investment to generate 
sustainable growth.

Total cash generation
Cash generation represents cash remitted  
by the Group’s operating companies to the 
holding companies. Please see the APM 
section on page 312 for further details  
of this measure. 

Cash generation is principally used to fund 
the Group’s operating costs, debt interest 
and repayments, investment into growth  
and shareholder dividends. Excess cash is 
available for investment into the business 
and/or additional shareholder returns. 

The cash flow analysis that follows reflects 
the cash paid by the operating companies  
to the Group’s holding companies, as well  
as the uses of those cash receipts. 

Cash receipts 
Total cash generated by the operating 
companies during 2023 was £2,024 million 
(2022: £1,504 million). This exceeded the 
Group’s upgraded target of c.£1.8 billion  
for the year, due to additional management 
actions being delivered.

Uses of cash
Operating expenses of £97 million  
(2022: £78 million) represent corporate 
office costs, net of income earned on  
holding company cash and investment 
balances. The increase compared to 2022 
reflects the investment we have made in  
our Group capabilities to support our  
growth strategy,

Debt interest of £229 million (2022:  
£244 million) reflects interest paid in the 
period on the Group’s debt instruments.  
The decrease year-on-year is due to the 
repayment of debt in July 2022.

 Total cash receipts include £219 million received by the holding companies in respect of tax losses surrendered (2022: £55 million).

Non-operating cash outflows were £111 million 
(2022: £395 million). This primarily comprises 
centrally funded projects and investments 
totalling £307 million. Of this, £129 million 
relates to Group project expenses for the 
transition activity in relation to legacy platform 
migrations, £18 million for other ongoing 
integration programmes including ReAssure 
and SLOC, £56 million of investment related 
to our growth propositions, and £12 million 
for our Finance Transformation. These costs 
were partially offset by a £196 million  
inflow in respect of net collateral cash  
and hedge close-outs.

Debt repayments and issuance in 2023 
reflect the debt re-terming exercise we 
undertook in the fourth quarter. 

The shareholder dividend of £520 million 
represents the payment of £260 million  
in May for the 2022 Final dividend and  
the payment of the 2023 Interim dividend  
of £260 million in September. 

Funding of £288 million (2022: £285 million) 
has been provided to the Life companies  
to support another strong year in BPA with 
£6.2 billion of premiums written (2022:  
£4.8 billion). The Group’s success in further 
optimising its capital efficiency is reflected  
in the reduction of the Group’s capital strain 
on BPA to 2.7% (2022: 3.2%) on a pre-Capital 
Management Policy (‘CMP’) basis, including 
the benefit of the Solvency II reform risk 
margin reduction. This enabled the Group  
to write increased NB LTCG but with a similar 
level of capital invested. 

Incremental new business long-term  
cash generation
NB LTCG reflects the impact on the Group’s 
future cash generation arising as a result  
of new business transacted in the year.  
It is stated on an undiscounted basis. 

In 2023 we delivered another record year  
of organic new business growth including  
NB LTCG of £1,514 million (2022: £1,233 
million), enabling us to achieve our 2025 
target two years early. 

Strong growth in our capital-light fee-based 
business, Pensions and Savings, led to a 
contribution of £395 million (2022: £249 
million). Our disciplined approach in a 
buoyant BPA market drove an increase  
in NB LTCG in our Retirement Solutions 
business to £1,066 million (2022: £934 
million). Europe and Other contributed  
£53 million (2022: £50 million).

metric to demonstrate the long-term 
sustainability of our cash generation.

OCG is the combination of the operating 
surplus emerging and recurring management 
actions. It represents the sustainable surplus 
generation remitted from our Life Companies 
to the Group Holding Company. OCG can 
be easily reconciled to operating surplus 
generation (‘OSG’), with the bridge being  
the small release of the Capital Management 
Policy (‘CMP’) held in our Life companies.

OCG totalled £1.1 billion in 2023, comprising 
£0.8 billion of surplus emergence and  
£0.3 billion of recurring management actions.

Outlook 
We will grow OCG sustainably over the  
long term through investing our surplus cash 
across our three strategic priorities of Grow, 
Optimise and Enhance. 

We will Grow by investing c.£100 million  
into our growth propositions and by 
continuing to grow our annuities business 
with c.£200 million of capital invested 
annually. This will support strong growth 
across our Pensions and Savings and 
Retirement Solutions businesses.

As we Optimise, we will deliver  
recurring management actions of  
c.£400 million per annum by 2026, 
supported by c.£100 million investment  
in our asset and liability optimisation 
capabilities and as our business grows.

As we Enhance our business, we will continue 
to migrate customers and drive through cost 
efficiencies that will deliver c.£250 million  
of annual cost savings by the end of 2026.

Together these will increase OCG by c.25% 
from £1.1 billion in 2023 to £1.4 billion in 
2026. After which we expect it to grow at  
a sustainable mid-single digit growth rate 
over the long term.

Future sources and uses of total  
cash generation
While OCG is our new primary metric,  
total cash generation remains very important, 
as we invest across our strategic priorities. 

We have set a new total cash generation target 
of £4.4 billion across 2024–2026, that will 
enable us to cover our recurring uses, pay our 
growing dividend and invest in our business. 

We expect to generate c.£3.7 billion of OCG 
over this period, which will more than cover 
our recurring uses and our planned investment 
of capital into annuities each year. 

In addition we expect to generate a  
further c.£0.7 billion of non-operating cash 
generation across 2024–2026 comprising 
other management actions and the release  
of historic excess capital that has built up in 
our Life Companies. That provides us with  
a significant amount of surplus cash that we 
can invest across our strategic priorities.

Our HoldCo cash position is a healthy 
£1 billion today, which we expect to remain 
broadly consistent over 2024 to 2026.

Group Solvency II surplus (estimated)

176% 

Group Solvency II shareholder capital  
Coverage Ratio (estimated) APM

Capital management 
A Solvency II capital assessment involves a 
valuation in line with Solvency II principles  
of the Group’s Own Funds and a risk-based 
assessment of the Group’s Solvency Capital 
Requirement (‘SCR’). 

The Group’s Own Funds differ materially  
from the Group’s IFRS equity for a number  
of reasons, including the recognition of future 
shareholder transfers from the With-Profits 
funds and future management charges on 
investment contracts, the treatment of certain 
subordinated debt instruments as capital 
items, and a number of valuation differences, 
most notably in respect of insurance contract 
liabilities, taxation and intangible assets. 

Group Solvency II capital position 
Our Solvency II capital position remains strong 
and resilient, with a surplus of £3.9 billion 
(2022: £4.4 billion), after the accrual for the 
deduction of our 2023 Final dividend of  
£267 million. Our SCCR reduced marginally 
to 176% (2022: 189%) but remains towards the 
upper-end of our 140–180% operating range, 
providing the capacity to continue investing 
to grow, optimise and enhance our business. 

Change in Group Solvency II surplus  
and SCCR 
Operating surplus generation increased  
the SII surplus by £1.1 billion, contributing  
to an increase in the SCCR of 27%pts.  
This was comprised of our ongoing surplus 
emergence which increased the SII surplus 
by £0.8 billion during the year and recurring 
management actions of £0.3 billion. 

Other management actions increased the  
SII surplus further by £0.4 billion and added 
16%pts to the SCCR. 

Operating costs, debt interest and dividend 
totalled £0.9 billion, reducing the SCCR  
by 19%pts. 

We have also chosen to invest £0.4 billion  
of surplus capital into growth. This includes 
£0.3 billion of capital investment to fund  
£6.2 billion of BPA premiums written in  
the year, reducing the SCCR by 10%pts,  
and £0.1bn of investment into our organic  
growth propositions, reducing the SCCR  
by a further 3%pts.

Our comprehensive hedging strategy is 
designed to protect our capital position.  
In 2023 this led to a small adverse impact 
from economic variances of £(0.3) billion  
on our Solvency II surplus. This included a 
£(0.1) billion adverse impact from unhedged 
gilt-swap spread movements, as well as 
adverse currency movements and some  
other smaller adverse impacts.

We are on track for the effective date for 
Consumer Duty on back-book products in 
July. Our ongoing focus on ensuring good 
outcomes for Heritage customers means  
we have identified only a small number of 
products that we believe need addressing  
in advance of the compliance date. We have 
set aside a prudent c.£70 million of Solvency II 
capital to reflect the impact of the possibility of 
introducing further charging caps on certain 
products, reducing the SCCR by 2%pts. 

Other movements include the benefit of the 
Solvency II risk margin reform and favourable 
longevity assumption changes. These were 
offset by the strengthening of expense provisions 
associated with our transformation projects, 
in addition to a net adverse impact arising  
on the completion of the SLOC acquisition. 
Overall, these movements decreased Solvency II 
surplus by £0.3 billion and the SCCR by 13%.

Sensitivity and scenario analysis
As part of the Group’s internal risk 
management processes, the Own Funds and 
regulatory SCR are regularly tested against  
a number of financial scenarios. The table 
provides illustrative impacts of changing one 
assumption while keeping others unchanged 
and reflects the business mix at the balance 
sheet date. Extreme market movements 
outside of these sensitivities may not be linear. 
While there is no value captured in the Group 
stress scenarios for recovery management 
actions, the Group does proactively manage 
its risk exposure. Therefore in the event of a 
stress, we would expect to recover some of  
the loss reflected in the stress impacts shown. 

Unrewarded market risk sensitivities 
We have a low appetite to equity, interest 
rate, inflation and currency risks, which we 
see as unrewarded, i.e. the return on capital 
for retaining the risk is lower than for hedging 
it. In order to stabilise our Solvency II surplus, 
we regularly monitor risk exposures and use  
a range of hedging instruments to remain 
within a Board-approved target range.  
Equity risk primarily arises from our exposure 
to a variation in future management fees  
on policyholder assets exposed to equities, 
while our currency exposure primarily arises 
from our foreign currency denominated 
debt. Our interest rate exposure principally 
relates to our shareholder credit portfolio, 
while our inflation exposures arises from  
both cost inflation expectations and 
inflation-linked policies.

Rewarded market risk sensitivities 
We do however retain the credit risk  
in our c.£38 billion shareholder credit  
portfolio, and property risk in equity  
release mortgages, where we see these  
risks as rewarded. The shareholder credit 
assets are primarily used to back the Group’s 
annuity portfolio. Exposure to these risks is 
needed to back growth in the Group’s 
annuity portfolio. Stress testing is used to 
inform the level of risk to accept and to 
monitor exposures against risk appetite.  
We actively manage our portfolio to ensure  
it remains high quality and diversified,  
and to maintain our sensitivities within risk 
appetite. Our portfolio is c.99% investment 
grade and we have suffered no defaults, 
testament to the proactive approach taken 
by our in-house asset management team. 

We also remain conservative in our property 
exposure. We have c.£4.5 billion of our  
credit portfolio exposed to equity release 
mortgages, which are all UK-based with an 
average rating of AA and average loan-to-
value (‘LTV’) of 33%, and c.£1.1 billion in 
commercial real estate which is high quality 
and all UK-based with an average LTV of 47%. 
The full sensitivity we focus on for credit is  
a full letter downgrade of 20% of our credit 
portfolio, which is £(0.3) billion and is 
therefore small relative to the Group’s  
£3.9 billion Solvency II surplus.

 Illustrative impacts assume changing one assumption on 1 January 2024, while keeping others unchanged, and that there is no  
market recovery. They should not be used to predict the impact of future events as this will not fully capture the impact of economic  
or business changes. Given recent volatile markets, we caution against extrapolating results as exposures are not all linear.
 Assumes the impact of a dynamic recalculation of transitionals and an element of dynamic hedging which is performed  
on a continuous basis to minimise exposure to the interaction of rates with other correlated risks including longevity.
 Rise in inflation: 15yr inflation +50bps.
 Property stress represents an overall average fall in property values of 12%.
 Credit stress varies by rating and term and is equivalent to an average 135bps spread widening. It assumes the impact  
of a dynamic recalculation of transitionals and makes no allowance for the cost of defaults/downgrades.
 Impact of an immediate full letter downgrade across 20% of the shareholder exposure to the bond portfolio (e.g. from AAA  
to AA, AA to A, etc.). This sensitivity assumes management actions are taken to rebalance the annuity portfolio back to the 
original average credit rating and makes no allowance for the spread widening which would be associated with a downgrade.
 Assumes most onerous impact of a 10% increase/decrease in lapse rates across different product groups.
 Only applied to the annuity portfolio.

Managing demographic risks
We have three key demographic risks  
– lapse risk from early surrenders, longevity 
risk on our annuity portfolio and mortality risk 
on our protection book. We manage lapse 
risk through our strong customer proposition. 
Our longevity risk principally arises from our 
annuity book, but this is managed through 
reinsurance. We retain around half of this 
risk across our current in-force book, and 
reinsure most of this risk on new business. 
Mortality risk arises from our protection 
business and we seek to manage this as 
part of a well-diversified portfolio.

Life Company Free Surplus
Life Company Free Surplus represents the 
Solvency II surplus for the Life Companies 
that is in excess of their Board-approved 
CMPs. It is this Free Surplus from which  
the Life Companies remit cash to Group.  
We retain a significant Life Company  
Free Surplus of £2.2 billion which provides 
resilience to the Group’s long-term  
cash generation. 

Solvency II capital outlook 
We maintain a 140–180% SCCR  
operating range, which reflects our low 
sensitivity to economic volatility due to  
our comprehensive hedging. 

We have been at the top-end of our range  
for the past three years, but will invest some 
of this surplus as we transform our business, 
with the investment more front-end weighted 
across 2024–2026. In addition, our intention 
to repay at least c.£500 million of debt by the 
end of 2026 will also reduce our SCCR over 
the coming years.

Leverage 
We manage our leverage position by 
considering a range of factors including  
our cash interest cover, the interplay of our 
balance sheet hedging, and our capital 
tiering headroom. It also includes a number 
of output metrics that we monitor, such as  
the Fitch leverage ratio and Solvency II 
leverage ratio. 

Our approach to leverage has always  
been to increase leverage to support M&A 
and then pay down that debt with surplus 
cash as it emerges. Since 2020 the Group 
has repaid c.£800 million of debt through  
this approach. 

As at 31 December 2023, our Solvency  
II leverage ratio was 36% (2022: 34%).  
This increased in 2023, largely due to  
our investment in growth, integration  
and transformation. The Group’s Fitch 
leverage ratio was 23% compared to  
full year 2022 on a restated basis of 23%,  
and is favourably below Fitch’s stated  
range of 25–30% for an investment  
grade credit rating.

We plan to continue our approach of  
repaying M&A-related debt with surplus  
cash, and subject to regulatory approval,  
we intend to repay at least £500 million  
of debt by the end of 2026, including the 
£250 million Tier 2 bond that is callable in 
June 2024. This will support us in achieving  
a c.30%1 Solvency II leverage ratio by the 
end of 2026. This is a steady-state level  
of leverage that we will believe is the 
appropriate for our business, absent M&A.

 Incorporates changes to the Group’s methodology for determining adjusted operating profit since Half Year 2023  
(see note B1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details).

IFRS results 
IFRS (loss)/profit is a GAAP measure of 
financial performance and is reported in our 
statutory financial statements on page 164 
onwards. Adjusted operating profit before 
tax is a non-GAAP financial performance 
measure based on expected long-term 
investment returns. It is stated before 
amortisation and impairment of intangibles, 
other non-operating items, finance costs  
and tax. Please see the APM section on  
page 312 for further details of this measure. 
On 1 January 2023, the Group adopted the 
new accounting standard, IFRS 17: ‘Insurance 
Contracts’, with comparatives restated from 
1 January 2022. IFRS 17 requires a company  
to recognise profits as it delivers insurance 
services (rather than when it receives 
premiums) and to provide information  
about insurance contract profits the 
company expects to recognise in the  
future. The impact of the transition to  
IFRS 17 is set out in note A2.1. 

IFRS loss after tax attributable to owners
The Group generated an IFRS loss after  
tax attributable to owners of £88 million 
(2022: loss of £2,657 million). The improvement 
versus 2022, primarily reflects a £3,456 million 
improvement in economic variances due to  
a much lower level of market volatility in the 
period, particularly interest rates. This has 
been partially offset by an increase in 
non-operating items as a result of our 
investment into growth in the period and 
ongoing migrations and transformation.

Basis of adjusted operating profit
Adjusted operating profit is based on 
expected investment returns on financial 
investments backing business where asset 
returns accrue to the shareholder and  
surplus assets over the reporting period,  
with allowance for the corresponding 
expected movements in liabilities (being  
the interest cost of unwinding the discount 
on the liabilities). Adjusted operating profit 
includes the unwind of the Contractual 

Service Margin (‘CSM’) and risk adjustment 
attributable to the shareholder. The principal 
assumptions underlying the calculation  
of the long-term investment return are set  
out in note B 2.1 to the IFRS consolidated 
financial statements. 

Adjusted operating profit includes the  
effect of variances in experience relating  
to the current period for non-economic 
items, such as mortality and expenses.  
It also incorporates the impacts of asset 
trading optimisation and portfolio 
rebalancing where not reflected in the 
discount rate used in calculating expected 
return. Any difference between expected 
and actual investment return, along with 
other economic variances described further 
in note B1.1 are shown outside of adjusted 
operating profit. Adjusted operating profit  
is net of policyholder finance charges and 
policyholder tax.

Adjusted operating profit
The Group increased adjusted operating profit 
by 13% to £617 million (2022: £544 million).  
This primarily reflects strong growth in  
our Pensions and Savings business, which 
delivered adjusted operating profit of  
£190 million, an increase of 27% year-on-year 
(2022: £150 million). This was largely driven 
by higher AUA resulting in increased 
charges, and an improved margin through 
operating leverage.

Our Retirement Solutions business delivered 
an adjusted operating profit of £378 million 
(2022: £349 million). The 8% increase 
year-on-year primarily reflects a higher 
expected investment margin as a result of 
higher risk-free rates. The positive impact of 
BPA new business on CSM amortisation has 
offset the run-off of the remaining annuity 
book despite the phasing of a significant 
proportion of new business in late 2023. 

With-Profits adjusted operating profit 
declined to £10 million (2022: £54 million) 

principally as a result of the run-off of  
this business and the adverse impacts  
of modelling refinements in the period. 

Europe and Other adjusted operating  
profit increased to £132 million (2022:  
£60 million). This segment includes the 
expected investment margin from surplus 
assets within shareholder funds, which has 
increased due to the significant increases  
in interest rates over 2022. This has been 
partially offset by a reduction in CSM 
amortisation following the strengthening  
of the mortality assumptions on our 
Protection business. 

The Group’s Corporate Centre includes net 
operating costs in the period of £93 million 
(2022: £69 million), which increased due to 
investment in central functions to support 
our growth ambitions in the first phase of  
our journey, partially offset by increased 
interest income on Holding Company cash.

Investment return variances and economic 
assumption changes
The net positive economic variances of 
£147 million (2022: £3,309 million loss) results 
from a more stable market environment 
compared with the significant volatility 
experienced during 2022. The impact of 
positive changes to discount rates, primarily 
on annuities and including the impact of 
methodology refinements, more than offsets 
the losses arising from the impact of positive 
equity market movements on the hedges  
the Group holds to protect the Solvency II 
position. As the full value of future profits 
impacted by equity markets is not held  
on the IFRS balance sheet, this results in  
an ‘over-hedged’ position on an IFRS basis. 

Amortisation and impairment  
of intangibles
The previously acquired in-force business, 
relating to IFRS 9 accounted capital-light 
fee-based products, is being amortised  

in line with the expected run-off profile of the 
investment contract profits to which it relates. 
The amortisation and impairment of acquired 
in-force business during the period of £316 
million (2022: £347 million) has decreased 
year-on-year reflecting the impact of  
the business run-off. Amortisation and 
impairment of other intangible assets totalled 
£6 million in the period (2022: £6 million).

Other non-operating items
Other non-operating items in the period 
totalled a £439 million loss (2022: £262 
million loss), inclusive of a £66 million gain 
recognised on the Sun Life of Canada UK 
acquisition. This includes £169 million 
expenditure to support our growth strategy 
and £36 million impact from setting up a  
new European subsidiary that was required 
post-Brexit to continue serving some  
of our overseas Heritage customers. 

Other items include £217 million of costs 
relating to finance transformation activities, 
£111 million in respect of ongoing integration, 
transition and transformation projects,  
£12 million of other corporate project  
costs, and net other one-off items totalling  
£74 million, including costs associated  
with the Part VII transfer of three of the 
Group’s Life insurance entities. 

Lastly, finance costs of £195 million  
reflect interest borne on the Group debt 
instruments and were broadly stable 
year-on-year (2022: £199 million).

Tax charge attributable to owners
The Group’s approach to the management  
of its tax affairs is set out in its Tax Strategy 
document which is available in the corporate 
responsibility section of the Group’s website. 
The Group tax credit for the period attributable 
to owners is £76 million (2022: £855 million tax 
credit) based on a loss (after policyholder tax) 
of £(164) million (2022: loss of £(3,512) million).  

A reconciliation of the tax charge is set out in 
note C8 to the Group financial statements.

Contractual Service Margin (‘CSM’)
The CSM represents a stock of future profits 
that will unwind into the P&L in future years. 

The Group had a CSM (gross of tax) of  
£2.9 billion as at 31 December 2023, which 
grew by 10% in 2023 (2022: £2.6 billion) 
primarily due to new BPA business written, 
the acquisition of the SLOC in 2023, interest 
accretion and assumption changes, which 
was partly offset by the CSM release into  
the income statement. 

The CSM release in the period represents 
c.8% of the closing CSM (gross of tax) pre 
release of £3.1 billion. We expect the release 
of the CSM (gross of tax) to be c.5–7% over 
time, primarily driven by annuities.

Assets under administration 
AUA provides an indication of the potential 
earnings capability of the Group arising from 
its insurance and investment business, whilst 
AUA flows provide a measure of the Group’s 
success in achieving growth from new business. 

Group AUA as at 31 December 2023 was 
£282.5 billion (2022: £259.0 billion), an 
increase of 9% year-on-year. This increase 
was primarily driven by an £18.7 billion 
benefit from positive market and other 
movements and £8.0 billion relating to the 
SLOC acquisition. Net inflows in Workplace, 
Retirement Solutions, Europe and Other 
were £4.7 billion, £3.3 billion and £0.3 billion 
respectively, but these were offset by £1.6 
billion of outflows in Retail and £9.9 billion  
of legacy outflows.

Outlook 
The investments we are making across our 
strategic priorities will support strong growth 
in our IFRS adjusted operating profit before 
tax over the next few years.

Movement of IFRS adjusted shareholders’ equity over 2023

We are targeting £900 million of IFRS 
adjusted operating profit in 2026, up from 
£617 million in 2023, reflecting a c.50% 
increase. This includes the majority of the 
£250 million cost savings as well as the 
impact of our organic growth and 
management actions. 

We have an elevated level of non-operating 
costs at present, but we expect these to 
normalise after we are through our three-
year investment programme. We have also 
suffered significant headwinds to shareholders 
equity from adverse economics over the past 
two years, primarily related to the significant 
rise in long-term interest rates and rise in 
equities. While future economic impacts are 
hard to forecast, we would expect to see 
some unwind of this adverse impact if interest 
rates return to normalised levels. We would 
also earn higher revenue from higher asset 
values in our Pensions and Savings business. 

The other below the line items are more 
predictable and while we expect our 
shareholders’ equity to decline over the 
coming years, we expect it to remain  
positive over the long term. 

Our adjusted shareholders’ equity,  
inclusive of the CSM, will remain broadly 
stable near-term and then begin to grow. 
Supported by strong CSM growth from  
our annuities business and other 
management actions.

As a reminder, our Group consolidated 
shareholders’ equity is not a constraint to  
the payment of our dividends. This is because 
our dividends are paid from the Phoenix 
Group Holding Company, which is not 
impacted by IFRS 17 and has c.£4.6 billion  
of distributable reserves.

2023 dividend increase
Phoenix has demonstrated a strong dividend 
track record over the past 13 years, with a 
c.4% compound annual growth rate (‘CAGR’) 
since 2011. Our strong strategic and financial 
performance in 2023 has supported a 2.5% 
recommended increase in the Final 2023 
dividend to 26.65p per share, taking the 
Total dividend to 52.65p per share. 

New capital allocation framework for  
the next phase of our journey 
As we embark on the next stage of our 
journey, we are outlining a new capital 
allocation framework. 

There are two key underpins to our 
framework. The first is that we will operate  
a progressive and sustainable ordinary 
dividend policy. The second is that we will 
maintain our strong and resilient balance 
sheet, by operating within a 140–180% 
Shareholder Capital Coverage Ratio range.

We will seek to balance the investment of our 
2024–2026 surplus capital across our strategic 
priorities of grow, optimise and enhance.

In our Grow strategic priority, we will invest 
c.£100 million into developing our growth 
propositions and c.£200 million of capital 
per annum to grow our annuities. 

In our Optimise strategic priority, we will 
continue our approach of repaying 
M&A-related debt using surplus cash, with  
an intention to repay at least £500 million  
of debt by the end of 2026. This will support 
a Solvency II leverage ratio of c.30%1 by the 
end of 2026. 

We will also invest c.£100 million into our 
asset and liability optimisation capabilities  
to support recurring managements over  
the long term.

In our Enhance strategic priority, we will invest 
c.£500 million on migration, transformation 
and cost efficiency programmes bringing 
our businesses onto a single Group-wide 
operating model that will further enhance 
our cost efficiency. 

Additional surplus capital, over and above 
these committed investments, will be 
allocated to the highest return opportunities. 
This could include additional investment into 
growth, further deleveraging, M&A, and/or 
additional capital return to shareholders. 

New progressive dividend policy 
The Board has evolved Phoenix’s dividend 
policy to reflect the confidence it has in the 
Group’s strategy. The Group will now operate 
a progressive and sustainable ordinary 
dividend policy. 

The Board will continue to announce any 
potential annual dividend increase alongside 
the Group’s Full Year results and expects the 
Interim dividend to be in-line with the previous 
year’s Final dividend. The Board will continue 
to prioritise the sustainability of our dividend 
over the very long term. Future dividends and 
annual increases will continue to be subject 
to the discretion of the Board, following 
assessment of longer-term affordability. 

Capital allocation framework:

• Operate a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy
• Strong and resilient balance sheet: 140–180% Shareholder Capital Coverage Ratio operating range

2024–2026 investment priorities:

•  c.£100m into growth propositions
•  c.£200m of capital per annum into annuities

•  Debt repayment of at least £500m by the 

•  c.£500m of migration, transformation 

end of 2026

•  c.£100m to enhance our asset and liability 

optimisation capabilities

and cost efﬁciency investment

Surplus capital allocation approach:

Allocate surplus capital to the highest return opportunities

•  Investment into growth
•  Further deleveraging
•  M&A
•  Return capital to shareholders

Outlook

Growing Operating 
Cash Generation  
that more than covers 
our recurring uses  
and supports our  
new progressive and 
sustainable ordinary 
dividend policy. 

Looking ahead 
Our purpose is to help people secure a life  
of possibilities. The continued execution 
against our three strategic priorities of Grow, 
Optimise and Enhance, will support us in 
delivering strong financial outcomes for  
our shareholders. 

Clear financial outcomes for shareholders 
We have a new set of ambitious 2026 targets, 
across our evolved financial framework of 
cash, capital and earnings.

Starting with cash, Phoenix has set three new 
cash generation targets. The first is that we 
expect Operating Cash Generation to grow 
to £1.4 billion in 2026, a c.25% increase from 
2023. This growth underpins our Total cash 
generation target, with a one-year target  
for 2024 of £1.4–1.5 billion, and a three-year 
target of £4.4 billion across 2024–2026. 

Our cash targets demonstrate our confidence 
in our ability to deliver sustainable, growing 
cash generation over time.

In terms of capital, we will continue to maintain 
a strong Solvency II balance sheet through 
our comprehensive hedging approach.  
This will see us continue to operate within  
our Solvency II SCCR operating range of 
140–180% and continue to manage our key 
individual risk sensitivities on a Solvency II 
surplus basis. 

Our intention to repay at least £500 million  
of debt by the end of 2026. This will support  
us on our path towards a c.30% Solvency II 
leverage ratio by the end of 2026, which is an 
appropriate steady-state level for our business 
absent M&A.

Turning to earnings, we are targeting IFRS 
adjusted operating profit to grow c.50% to 
£900 million in 2026, as we grow, optimise 
and enhance our business. This will include 
the majority of the c.£250 million of annual 
cost savings we aim to deliver by the end  
of 2026. 

We expect the improving macroeconomic 
outlook, with interest rates and inflation 
normalising, to support our future growth 
ambitions and targets.

Delivering against the targets across  
our evolved financial framework of cash, 
capital and earnings, in turn supports our 
new progressive and sustainable ordinary 
dividend policy. 

2024 will be another exciting year for 
Phoenix Group on our journey and as we 
continue to deliver on our purpose and  
our strategy.

Our policies

Phoenix Group is committed to protecting the 
environment; the health and wellbeing of our 
colleagues and the customers and communities  
in which we operate. We aim to reduce the impact  
on the environment from our operations, and our 
Environmental Management System certified  
to ISO 14001 will help us achieve this. We aim to 
demonstrate leadership in minimising emissions  
that contribute to climate change, including our 
direct emissions and working collaboratively with  
our suppliers. We are taking steps to decarbonise  
our investment portfolio, undertaking effective 
stewardship of our assets, and investing in climate 
solutions. We are working with decision makers and 
peers to driver wider system change, and engaging 
customers and colleagues on climate action.

Our environmental strategy focuses on four key areas:

Our Net Zero Commitment – We are committed  
to addressing climate change and limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C. Our objective is for our 
operations to be net zero by 2025.

Waste and Recycling – We will implement  
sustainable waste management practices  
including the removal of all single use plastics  
from our operations by 2030.

Conservation – We are committed to supporting 
conservation in our communities.

Employee Engagement – We will support colleague 
understanding of environmental issues and promote 
engagement in environmental action.

We have a range of policies including our Group 
Environmental policy, Environment Risk policy,  
Our Approach to Integrating Environmental,  
Social and Governance Considerations and 
Sustainability Risk policy.

In addition, an exercise is ongoing to update all 
Group risk policies to consider sustainability matters. 

Due diligence

The Group’s Human Resources (‘HR’) policy defines  
people risk, which, if unmanaged, could result in a 
reduction in earnings or value, through financial or 
reputational loss. Our Group approach to support  
the health and wellbeing of colleagues is a key enabler to 
build an inclusive, attractive, and safe working environment 
that can adapt and respond quickly to change. 

We create a sense of belonging, so colleagues feel 
connected to our purpose and values, empowered  
to make a difference, and motivated and proud to be  
part of our story.

A key priority for our business is to create a workplace  
that is diverse, inclusive and reflective of our customers 
and communities, where colleagues can bring their whole 
selves to work.

Andy Briggs, Group CEO, is responsible for 
embedding sustainability within the Group,  
in line with the strategy set by the Group Board.  
The Group CEO reports directly to the Board on all 
sustainability activity across the business including 
the Environmental policy. We will monitor and  
review our environmental performance against  
our environmental commitments set out in our 
policy and the net zero requirements.

We report on our environmental performance 
annually and review the policy to ensure it remains 
relevant and appropriate. We work with our key 
suppliers to develop best practice carbon 
management, including science-based net  
zero targets.

Adherence to the HR policy is managed by Group  
HR via quarterly control assessments. Furthermore,  
during 2023, control testing was integrated as part  
of the Risk Management Framework and HR controls  
will now additionally be tested on a cyclical basis.  
There were no material issues raised during the year. 

All colleagues are required to complete annual 
computer-based health and safety training.  
Arrangements are in place to manage on-site  
facilities across all sites, ensuring the working  
environment is compliant and fit for purpose.

We have a range of tools and resources available  
to support our colleagues, their dependents, family 
members and loved ones to help look after their  
personal health and wellbeing. 

Customers 
Phoenix Group’s Customer Outcomes Risk policy covers the Customer Lifecycle  
which includes customer experience and vulnerable customer support, to ensure good 
outcomes are being achieved in line with regulatory requirements. The Group continually 
improves communications with customers to prevent any potential barriers during  
their interactions with us in relation to their policy, empowering them to make informed 
decisions should they wish to take any actions. Processes and controls are in place, 
facilitating ongoing customer monitoring and oversight, to support the delivery of good 
customer outcomes.

Suppliers  
Our ESG Supply Chain Standards reinforce our commitment to embedding sustainable  
best practice into our supply chain operations, so that our partners are aligned with  
Phoenix Group’s values and commitments. We are looking to all our partners and suppliers  
to implement requirements and targets which reflect our own standards as a minimum.  
By working with partners that share our values and ambitions around sustainability,  
we can establish long-term relationships that are both mutually beneficial and which help  
to protect the interconnected interests of people and planet. We have focused on the 
environmental, social and governance commitments which are connected to the most 
material issues in our supply chain, represent best practice, and will have a significant 
positive impact in terms of long-term behaviour change. 

The Supplier Code of Conduct (‘Code of Conduct’) applies to all suppliers which  
provide goods or services to us and/or any of our subsidiaries. The terms of the Code  
of Conduct are in addition to any other commercial or contractual terms or obligations 
agreed and outline the minimum conduct standards to which suppliers must adhere  
when doing business with us, as well as supporting operational resilience and supporting 
strategic growth.

Communities  
We aim to make a positive and lasting difference to the communities in which we are 
based, addressing social issues identified. Through our commitment to being a responsible 
business our colleagues can participate in a range of community-based activities, utilising 
their collective time, skills and resources. All colleagues across the UK and Ireland are 
entitled to three days’ volunteering during business hours for individual activities or team 
volunteering. We match fundraising donations colleagues make to approved registered 
charities of their choosing across the year, in line with our community approach. We also 
give our colleagues the opportunity to donate to registered charities across the UK and 
Europe through the payroll giving scheme Give as You Earn where they can support their 
chosen charities.

At Phoenix Group, we recognise our 
responsibility to respect human rights  
and do this in accordance with:

• the International Bill of Human Rights; and

• the International Labour Organization’s 

(‘ILO’) Core Conventions.

As an asset owner, we also align with the 
Organisation for Economic Co-Operation  
and Development (‘OECD’) Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises, a set of responsible 
business conduct standards for multinational 
enterprises, as well as the OECD guidance  
on responsible business conduct for 
institutional investors.

We are committed to fully aligning with the 
United Nations Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights (‘UNGPs’), the authoritative 
global framework on business and human 
rights, and our ambition is to encourage other 
organisations to do the same.

During 2023 we published our Human Rights 
policy, which is Group-wide, and applies to all 
entities, business units and operations and we 
expect all employees to adhere to the policy  
in their work. We are committed to working  
with our partners to multiply our impact and  
we expect our suppliers, contractors, asset 
managers and investee companies to be 
aware of our policy and respect human rights 
in their business operations.

We are committed to updating our Human 
Rights policy at least every three years.

Our Data Protection Officer monitors compliance with the GDPR and DPA 2018 and  
owns the Group Privacy policy and Data Protection Risk policy. Our Chief Information 
Security Officer oversees the delivery of and compliance to our Information Security 
policy, utilising capabilities such as Threat Intelligence, Penetration Testing and 
Vulnerability Management to identify and control cyber risks. We manage a 
comprehensive programme of continuous improvement to our Information Security 
Framework collaborating with industry experts and the UK authorities to embed best 
practices throughout. The Group is well positioned to resist cyber-attacks with no 
significant cyber-related incidents in 2023, and there was no compromise to our data  
as a result of any cyber events within our supply chain.

Complaint activity including those referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service and  
the Pensions Ombudsman is monitored, and we also resolve a significant proportion  
of complaints across the Group in fewer than three days.

During 2022 we appointed a human rights 
consultant to review our alignment to the 
UNGPs by conducting an assessment and 
identifying opportunities for improvement.  
As a result, we developed a three-year  
roadmap to address gaps, which we have  
been progressing over 2023.

We continue to identify and assess the salient 
human rights issues that we intend to prioritise 
for further action across our operations and 
value chain as part of our due diligence 
processes. This two-year process includes  
a portfolio-level human rights assessment  
and an assessment of human rights risks in 
countries of operations and high-risk business 
relationships on an ongoing basis.

Anti-bribery  
and corruption

Phoenix Group has a 
zero-tolerance policy to bribery 
and corruption in all its forms.

Phoenix Group is committed  
to countering bribery and 
corruption with suitable policies 
and procedures. This includes, 
for example:

• a Group Financial Crime 
Prevention Policy that 
covers Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption risk;

• a Code of Ethics for 

ethical behaviour and 
general standards;

• a Group Stewardship 

policy which details our 
stewardship approach; and

• mandatory training for 

our employees covering 
compliance with the 
Bribery Act.

The Group’s Financial Crime 
Prevention policy addresses 
risks such as money laundering, 
terrorist financing, fraud, 
bribery and corruption risks and 
the facilitation of tax evasion.

The Group also operates  
a Whistleblowing policy, 
prompting colleagues to disclose 
information where they believe 
wrongdoing, malpractice  
or risk exists across any of 
Phoenix Group’s operations.

Colleagues are required to 
complete annual computer-
based training in all aspects of 
financial crime prevention and 
are also required to complete  
a Gifts and Hospitality Register 
which is overseen and managed 
by the Financial Crime Team.

Strategic reportStrategic reportStreamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (‘SECR’) statement
Greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions and energy consumption disclosure

This is Phoenix Group’s Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (‘SECR’) 
statement on the Group’s UK and global energy consumption and GHG 
emissions for the financial year 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023,  
and the 2022 comparative year. Emissions disclosed here relate to energy 
consumption, facilities and activities where the Group has operational control1.

Methodology
The Group has used the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Standard (revised edition) and 
emissions factors from the International 
Energy Agency (‘IEA’), DEFRA UK 
Government Conversion Factors, and 
Association of Issuing Bodies (‘AIB’) 
European Residual Mix as the basis to report 
on any GHG emissions in tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (‘tCO2e’). This expresses 
multiple greenhouse gases in terms of 
carbon dioxide based on their global 
warming potential (including methane, 
nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, 
perfluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride).

Emissions considered relate to activities both 
in the UK and globally for which the Group  
is responsible and include as applicable: 
combustion of any fuel and operation of its 
facilities; fugitive emissions released from 
refrigerants purchased (based on refrigerant 
top-ups); and annual emissions from the 
purchase of electricity, heat, steam or cooling 
by the Group for its own use. In addition,  
the Group estimates Scope 3 emissions 
associated with employee homeworking 
(using the EcoAct Homeworking Emissions 
Whitepaper 2020) and employee 
commuting, as well as business travel  
from other third-party owned/operated 
sources, including air, taxi, and rail travel. 

Reported data relates to occupied  
premises in UK, Ireland, Germany,  
Austria, and Bermuda, where the  
Group procures energy. Where energy 
consumption is sub-metered to tenants  
and in occupied assets that the Group  
does not directly own or operate  
(i.e., serviced offices), GHG emissions  
fall into Scope 3 reporting, whereas all  
other landlord-obtained consumption 
remains as Scope 1 or 2 emissions.

The Group reports Scope 2 emissions  
using the GHG Protocol dual-reporting 
methodology, stating two figures:

• a location-based method that reflects the 
average emissions intensity of the national 
electricity grids from which energy is drawn.

• a market-based method that reflects 

emissions from electricity specific to each 
supply/contract. Where electricity 
supplies are known to be from a certified 
renewable source, a zero emissions factor 
is used. Otherwise, residual mix factors 
are used, or location-based factors where 
residual mixes are unavailable.

 EY has provided limited assurance over a selection of our 2023 ESG metrics, including operational Greenhouse gas emissions. 
For the full scope of assured ESG metrics please refer to our Sustainability Report on page 47 for EY’s Assurance Statement.
 GHG emissions and energy consumption statement pursuant to the Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability 
Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018 (the SECR Regulations).
 Business travel (GWh) does not include air, taxi or rail due to lack of applicable conversion factors for this data,  
however GHG emissions from these sources are still included in Table 2.

This year, market-based emissions have 
shifted above location-based as the  
primary measure of GHG emissions to  
focus on the actual carbon impact of  
energy consumption. This recognises  
the organisation’s actions to procure 
renewable electricity through robust 
contractual agreements.

An exclusion has been made under  
business travel for the Group’s owned fleet, 
whereby no data was recorded in 2023 for 
two electric vans that were transferred out  
of the Group’s control in August 2023. It is 
estimated that this would account for less 
than 0.1% of Scope 1 GHG emissions.

 Emissions factors – IEA (for location-based Scope 2 and Scope 3 T&D losses), AIB (for market-based residual mix factors for non-renewable electricity), and DEFRA (fuels, refrigerants and travel). 
There is a significant time-lag in the availability of IEA factors – 2023 factors will not be published until late 2024. Therefore all 2023 consumption data are converted using the factors actually arising 
in 2019 (except business travel which uses DEFRA factors as published in 2023).
 Carbon Offsets Purchased relate to Phoenix Group’s natural gas procured for and consumed within its directly managed sites, which is certified as ‘carbon neutral’ by the supplier.

Commentary on Phoenix 
Group’s performance
Overall, in 2023 there was 38.9 GWh of 
Phoenix Group global energy consumption 
(building energy and business travel in 
employees or company owned vehicles) as 
shown in Table 1, 95% of which was from UK 
operations. This is a slight decrease on the 
43.2 GWh of global energy consumption 
reported in 2022 and is primarily due to the 
impacts of ongoing energy efficiency actions 
being recognised. The de-occupation and 
closure of multiple sites in 2022 has also 
contributed to this decrease. Furthermore, 
25.9 GWh of energy consumption from 
employee homeworking has been estimated 
in 2023, of which 92% occurred within the 
UK. This is a slight increase compared to 
2022, which has been primarily driven by  
a small reduction in office attendance for 
Group employees in 2023.

The Group’s GHG emissions (location-based 
Scope 1 and 2, per Table 2) have decreased  
12% in 2023. In contrast, business travel has 
seen a significant increase of 139% over the 
same period, which is a result of the return  
to in-person activities, as business continues 
to return to normal following the COVID-19 
pandemic and virtual ways of working.  
A refreshed travel carbon reduction plan  
is in progress to address this increase. 

The Group continues to procure 
approximately 100% of its electricity from 
certified renewable sources, which is why 

market-based Scope 2 emissions are 
significantly less than the location-based 
emissions as shown in Table 2. To recognise 
the importance of addressing remaining 
carbon emissions which cannot yet be 
eliminated, the Group has continued to 
purchase gold standard certified carbon 
avoidance offsets for natural gas consumed 
in its owned and occupied assets. Whilst 
exact data is unavailable, this has been 
estimated as 1,870 tCO2e in 2023.

Energy intensity metrics
The Group’s chosen operational intensity 
metrics detail GHG emissions per occupied 
floor area (m2) and per full-time employee 
(‘FTE’) in occupied premises (Table 3).  
The methodology to establish whether 
buildings should be included in the intensity 
metric only covers occupied buildings where 
emissions are considered Scope 1 and 2 and 
where 12 months of data is available in the 
current reporting year, meaning some  
sites were excluded from this calculation.  
To calculate the intensity for both per occupied 
floor area and per FTE per occupied premises, 
the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions for these 
buildings were divided by the applicable 
occupied floor area and FTEs respectively.

The m2 intensity has continued to decrease  
in 2023, which is the result of the Group’s 
ongoing efforts to improve energy efficiency 
and reduce its impact on the environment 
through its operations, as described below  
in the Energy Efficiency Action section. 

The FTE intensity metric has also continued 
to decrease, with a 13% reduction in the 
location-based intensity metric and a 15% 
decrease in the market-based intensity 
metric. As of 2023, market-based emissions 
are the Group’s primary intensity metric,  
as this recognises the impact of renewable 
energy on the Company’s transition to  
net zero.

In February 2023, approximately 1,222  
colleagues in Standard Life House were 
TUPE transferred to TCS/Diligenta. To 
reflect this change more accurately, these 
staff have been retained within the FTE 
number as they are undertaking work 
exclusively for Phoenix Group, which is 
contractually obliged to provide them with 
space. Using the previous methodology, 
which does not include these additional 
FTEs, the Group’s market and location-based  
FTE intensity metrics in 2023 were 0.35 
tCO2/FTE and 0.75 tCO2/FTE, respectively. 
However, using the new methodology,  
the Group’s market and location-based  
FTE intensity metric in 2023 is 0.29 tCO2/
FTE and 0.63 tCO2/FTE, respectively.  
These figures represent a significant 
reduction compared to 2022, highlighting 
the progress made by the Group to improve 
its efficiency and reduce GHG emissions.

Energy efficiency action  
(climate change actions)
To maximise the environmental impact of 
capital expenditure, spending has been 
prioritised based on the potential carbon 
impact of projects across the operational 
estate. As in previous years, projects were 
often undertaken in offices that need to stay 
operational throughout the year; thus, the 
work has been phased over a number of 
years. This means that energy and carbon 
savings may fluctuate depending on the 
extent of works conducted in a particular year.

The following is a selection of key projects 
and actions undertaken by the Group  
in 2023:
• Completed the final stage of the 

Wythall PV integrated glass roof project, 
which is now generating at full capacity.

• Consolidated facilities management 
service providers, allowing for a more 
optimised and efficient workstream 
to target energy and carbon saving 
projects with dedicated contract 
energy professionals.

• Began the process for collecting more 
frequent energy data across the estate 
to measure, monitor and identify energy 
saving measures more accurately.

• Achieved ISO 14001 certification, 

Previous year actions:
• Continued to roll out higher efficiency 

LED lighting across applicable buildings, 
ensuring that any new installations are the 
most energy efficient available by default. 

providing an effective structure to allow 
for continual improvement in relation to 
our premises’ environmental performance.

• Upgraded building control systems 
to allow for greater flexibility and 
operational efficiency.

In line with the Group’s Eliminate-Reduce-
Substitute-Compensate carbon reduction 
model, applicable opportunities will  
continue to be reviewed. Additionally,  
further technological solutions are being 
investigated to continue to facilitate and 
improve remote collaborations between 
colleagues, enabling the Group to reduce 
business travel.

Building improvement works will continue as 
needed to include efficiency measures such 
as improved controls (to switch unnecessary 
equipment and lighting off), more efficient 
equipment, and improved building fabric 
where necessary.  

• Upgraded fans and retrofitted inverter 
controls within ventilation systems.

• Replaced inefficient gas boilers in 

two buildings. This has resulted in gas 
consumption savings of 1,950 MWh 
per year over the applicable buildings. 

• Feasibility studies and design work 
continue to assess options for heat 
pumps, electric boilers or hybrid 
combinations to replace gas boilers 
in two applicable properties.

The Group fully supports the recommendations of the TCFD and has published 
a Climate Report – prepared in line with the recommended disclosures of the TCFD 
– to allow all stakeholders to better understand the impact of climate-related risks
and opportunities on the Group and how these are measured and managed.

TCFD compliance summary
We continue to disclose in line with the 
recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(‘TCFD’), in compliance with the Financial 
Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(8). The Group has obtained limited 
assurance on certain figures presented  
in the Climate Report – further information  
on page 63. 

Given the progress we have made  
with embedding the recommendations  
of the TCFD across the business and the 
increasing need for transparent reporting, 
we have opted to publish a standalone 
Climate Report which is available on our 
Group website. 

The table below provides a summary of  
how we have complied with each of the 
recommendations of the TCFD framework. 
We have included references to other 
sections of the Annual Report or the Climate 

Report, where further information relating 
to our compliance with the each of the  
TCFD recommendations can be found. 

In response to FCA guidance 9.8.6FG,  
we have also published a standalone  
Net Zero Transition Plan which sets out  
our approach to achieving net zero across 
our business by 2050.

Summary of progress

a. describe the 
climate-related 
risks and opportunities 
the organisation has 
identified over the short, 
medium and long-term.

• The Group undertakes qualitative analysis to identify and assess the climate-related risks and opportunities, 

both physical and transition, which could materially impact different areas of the business over short-, medium-, 
and long-term time horizons. 

• Short-term: 0–1 year – this is consistent with the liquidity monitoring time horizon for setting capital requirements 
under Solvency II; Medium-term: 1–5 years – this is consistent with the Group financial planning process which 
considers the medium-term plans and strategy for the business; and Long-term: over 5 years – this captures 
the long-term nature of the business and the risks that may emerge beyond the financial planning process.
• The material risks and opportunities indentified as likely to crystallise over the short-, medium- and long-term 

are: climate risk exposure in the investment portfolio; emerging government policy, regulatory and legal changes; 
reputational damage if climate risks are not appropriately managed; disruptions to business operations from 
climate impacts; and changing demand for products, funds and solutions.

b. describe the impact 
of climate-related risks 
and opportunities on 
the organisation’s 
businesses strategy, 
and financial planning.

• The Group has assessed the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the business, strategy and 

financial planning.

• The management of material climate-related risks and opportunities has been embedded into the businesses 
strategy and financial planning process, recognising that this is an important process in delivering the Group’s 
strategic ambition to meet more of the long-term savings and retirement needs of existing and new customers.
• The Group’s medium- to long-term strategic planning incorporates the consideration of the financial impacts 
of climate-related risks and opportunities. This includes: the increased operational costs associated with 
regulatory compliance; the impact of physical risk on Group assets; and shifts in consumer behaviours driven 
by environmental concerns.

c. describe the 
resilience of the 
organisation’s strategy, 
taking into consideration
different climate-related 
scenarios including a 2C 
or lower scenario.

• Both quantitative and qualitative scenario analysis are used to model the impact of different temperature 

pathways on the business to gain insight into how climate-related risks may materialise over time.

• The two quantitative scenarios are from the Network for Greening the Financial System (‘NGFS’) Phase III: 

an orderly transition to net zero by 2050 which starts immediately (1.5°C or below); and a delayed transition 
to net zero (2°C or below). Physical risk exposure is also assessed in sub-sections of the investment portfolio 
and qualitative scenarios used to assess the impact of potential extreme events on the business that are not 
easily quantifiable through financial modelling.

• The analysis indicated no significant threat to the Group’s business strategy or processes in the near-term. 
However, they do indicate a potential reduction in investment returns and disruption to the operations and 
strategy of the business if action does not continue to be taken to manage and mitigate the risk.

• There are a number of limitations/assumptions to the Group’s scenario analysis approach, including the changing 
asset mix of the Group and the quality/coverage of data. Only a subset of climate outcomes have been assessed 
and there remain infinite possible pathways that could emerge and pose new possible threats to the Group.

• A number of tools are used to understand our climate risk exposures, including: annual stress testing; carbon 

footprinting exercises for our assets and operations; horizon scanning; and monitoring and reporting progress 
against climate risk metrics and targets.

• The materiality of climate risks are assessed qualitatively on an ongoing basis, building on the processes noted 
above. Individual business areas ensure strategies are in place to manage climate risk given the materiality.

• Climate-related risks continue to be monitored via the Group’s established emerging risk processes.

•  Examples of how key components of our strategy and wider business processes are considering and actively 

reducing material climate risks include: decarbonising our investment portfolio; investing in climate solutions; 
stewardship; engaging with our customers; engaging with policymakers and regulators; decarbonising our
operations and supply chain; scenario analysis; and the monitoring and measurement of climate metrics.

• The Group Risk Management Framework (‘RMF’) sets out how we identify, assess, control, monitor, manage 

and report on the risks to which the Group is, or could be, exposed. This includes climate-related risks.
• The RMF supports the identification of risks both quantitatively and qualitatively, and from a top-down and 

bottom-up perspective at the Group-level.

• The Group continually reviews the forward-looking landscape to ensure it sufficiently identifies, assesses, 

controls, monitors, manages, and reports on emerging risks. 

• The Group continues to develop its internal climate risk reporting to reflect market best practice and enable 
effective measurement of climate risk and tracking of progress made against the Group’s net zero targets.

Further information

a. disclose the 
metrics used by the 
organisation to assess 
climate-related risks 
and opportunities 
in line with its 
strategy and risk 
management process.

• A number of metrics are used across the Group’s investment portfolio and operations to help measure and manage 

exposure to climate risk. 

•  The following metrics are used to understand how aligned the Group’s investment portfolio is to a net zero economy 
and how resilient it is to transition risk: absolute portfolio emissions; economic and revenue intensity; percentage 
of listed asset portfolio exposed to high transition risk industries; proportion of investee companies that have set 
science-based targets.

• Physical risk metrics are being determined to understand which sectors and geographies are susceptible to 

physical risk. 

• Operational emissions are tracked through intensity metrics per full time employee (‘FTE’) and the Group reports 

both market-based performance as well as location-based performance. In addition, a location-based per floor area 
metric is used track the impact of efficiency initiatives undertaken within Group buildings.

•  Our Scope 3 (purchased goods and services and capital goods) have been indicatively modelled using spend data 

alongside average industry emissions factors and enhanced with supplier data. 

b. disclose Scope 1, 2, 3 
GHG emissions and the 
related risks.

• The Group’s absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions calculated at year-end 2023 are as follows:
Investment portfolio (financed) emissions: 18.1 MtCO2e^ (for assets footprinted at year-end 2023).
•
• Operations emissions: 11,357 tCO2e (Scopes 1, 2 and 3, voluntary carbon footprint, market-based).
• Supply chain emissions: 124,943 tCO2e (indicatively modelled emissions based on supplier spend data).
• A phased approach has been taken to measuring the baseline of the Group’s investment portfolio. 
The baseline will continue to be expanded to cover the assets in scope of our 2030 interim target.

c. describe the 
targets used by 
the organisation to 
manage climate-related 
risks and opportunities 
and performance 
against targets.

• Ambitious targets have been set across the Group’s investment portfolio, operations and supply chain to help 

navigate progress towards meeting the Group’s net zero by 2050 ambition.

• Targets include: net zero business by 2050; net zero investment portfolio and supply chain by 2050; net zero 
operations by 2025; a 25% reduction in investment portfolio emissions by 2025; and at least a 50% reduction 
by 2030. 

• Scenario analysis indicates that the Group is on track to achieve its 2025 targets under most scenarios, 

if the actions committed to are implemented. 

• Achieving set targets beyond 2025 is less certain as the Group will become increasingly dependent on 
decarbonisation in the wider economy and actions by others, in particular government, regulators and 
high transition risk sectors.

Our Risk Management Framework
The Group’s Risk Management Framework (‘RMF’) seeks to ensure that  
all material risks are identified, assessed, controlled, monitored and 
managed within approved risk appetites and reported through agreed 
governance routes in line with delegated authorities. The RMF is an 
enabler to delivering the Group’s risk strategy; to take rewarded risks 
that are understood, managed effectively and consistent with its 
purpose and strategy.

The RMF is aligned to the principles 
of the International Organization 
for Standardizations’ (’ISO’) risk 
management guidelines, ISO 31000. 

The nine components of the RMF are 
outlined in the diagram below, with further 
information in the sections below. 

Risk Management Framework

Risk environment
The Group continues to operate in a volatile 
risk environment with multiple external 
factors requiring navigation to enable the 
Group to deliver on its strategic priorities. 

testing programme continues to consider 
a range of adverse circumstances to 
help the Group and its Life Companies 
determine any actions needed to 
respond to economic pressures. 

Geopolitical risk remains most prominent. 
Tensions in the Middle East have escalated, 
and whilst the Group has low exposure 
to assets heavily influenced by the price 
of gas and oil, it is closely monitoring 
impacts to inflation or interest rates which 
may occur from disruption to Red Sea 
shipping. The Group’s Stress and Scenario 

The regulatory change agenda continues  
to have potentially significant implications for 
the Group achieving its strategic priorities. 
The Group is supportive of the Solvency II 
reforms and continues to engage in industry 
consultations as the draft regulations  
are refined. Progressing key tasks on  
the implementation plan for the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s (‘FCA’) new Consumer 
Duty is another key area of focus, which 
is well aligned to the Group’s purpose 
of helping customers achieve a life of 
possibilities. The Group supports the FCA’s 
Sustainability Disclosure Requirements 
(‘SDR’) and investment labelling 
requirements and has mobilised a project 
to ensure its practices align with the new 
regulations. Additionally, work is underway 
to provide a response to the FCA following 
the Advice Guidance Boundary Review 
consultation paper. The Group recognises 
the importance of this review, which aligns 
well to the Group’s purpose and strategy.

The Group monitors developments across 
the political environment and engages with 
political parties, regulators and industry 
bodies on reforms which could help 
people live better, longer lives. In order 
to support customers on their journey 
to and through retirement, the Group 
places significant focus on monitoring and 
managing sustainability risks, including 
climate change, to ensure ongoing 
resilience over the long term to such risks. 

The Group remains alert to the risk of cyber-
attacks which could impact the Group or 
its strategic partners directly, or indirectly 
via impact to customers and colleagues 
should state infrastructure be targeted.

Own Risk and Solvency  
Assessment (‘ORSA’)
The ORSA plays an important role in 
supporting strategic decision-making 
and strategy development at the Group’s 
Boards and Risk Committees. It provides:

• a linkage between strategy, risk, 

capital and stress testing, as well as the 
effectiveness of management actions 
required to meet strategic objectives; 

• processes to identify, assess, control 

and monitor risks that the Group faces; 

• an understanding of current and potential 
risks to the business, including financial 
and non-financial risks under base and 
stressed scenarios; 

•

the Group’s agreed appetite to accept 
these risks and how it manages them; and 

• a forward-looking internal assessment 
of the Group’s solvency position in 
respect of its current risk profile and how 
it is likely to change with the proposed 
business plans, strategy, or changes 
in the external environment.

ORSA processes are run regularly 
throughout the year and operate within 
the Group’s ORSA cycle outlined to the 
right. The Group’s ORSA cycle brings 
together interlinked risk management, 
capital and strategic processes.

Risk strategy and culture
Risk strategy
The Group’s risk strategy is to take 
rewarded risks that are understood, 
managed effectively and consistent 
with its purpose and strategy. 

The Group’s risk strategy supports a 
more stable, well-managed business 
with improved customer, shareholder, 
colleague and societal outcomes in 
line with Phoenix Group’ strategy. 

The Group achieves its overall purpose 
and strategy goals not by avoiding 
risks, but through the identification and 
management of an acceptable level of risk 
(the Group’s ‘risk appetite’) which ensures 
that it is appropriately rewarded for the 
risks that are taken. To help bring focus 
to the risks that it seeks to mitigate, the 
Group has categorised its Risk Universe 
into ‘Fundamental’, ‘Consequential – 
Active’ or ‘Consequential – Passive’. 

Risk culture
The Group defines its vision for risk culture  
as an environment that supports informed 
decision-making and controlled risk-taking. 
Through nurturing a good risk culture, the 
business can foster innovation, embrace 
change, and strategically differentiate itself 
from its competitors.

This vision is supported by the Group’s  
Risk Culture Framework, which articulates  
an ambition to support colleagues to 
demonstrate attitudes and behaviours 
that are in line with this vision through 
comprehensive measurement 
and proactive management.

A Risk Culture Report is provided to Phoenix 
Group’s Board Risk Committee twice a year, 
capturing qualitative observations from 
across the business and a dashboard of 
quantitative data to measure the Group’s risk 
culture and identify areas for improvement. 

Risk appetite
Risk appetite is used to define the 
amount of risk that the Group is willing 
to accept in the pursuit of enhancing 
customer and shareholder value and the 
attainment of strategic objectives.

The Group’s risk appetite statements 
establish the amount and type of risk 
that the Group is willing to take in order 
to meet our strategic objectives, and 
are a key tool in balancing the interests 
of different stakeholders. The Group’s 
Risk Appetite Framework operates using 
a three tiers approach to cascade the 
Board’s risk appetites through to lower 
level risk policies. The Risk Appetite 
Framework is reviewed on an annual basis.

The following Board-approved risk appetite 
statements are adopted by the Group:

Capital – The Group and each Life Company 
will hold sufficient capital to meet business 
requirements, including those of key 
stakeholders in a number of Board-approved 
asset and liability stress scenarios.

Liquidity – The Group and each Life Company 
will seek to ensure that it has sufficient 
liquidity to meet its financial obligations 
under a range of Board-approved scenarios.

Shareholder Value – The Group only 
has appetite for risks that are rewarded, 
adequately understood and managed;  
and deliver added value. The Group will take 
action to deliver shareholder value in line with 
the Group’s strategy and financial targets.

Control – The Group, including all legal 
entities, will protect the interests of our 
customers, employees, shareholders 
and other stakeholders by operating a 
robust control environment that meets 
the requirements of the approved 
controls objectives for all risks within 
the Group’s Risk Universe.

Conduct – The Group acts to deliver good 
outcomes for customers and maintains high 
conduct standards in line with regulatory, 
customer and market expectations. If good 
outcomes and/or high conduct standards  
are not being delivered, the Group will  
put it right in a fair and prompt manner.  
The standards all colleagues are expected 
to achieve are detailed in our Group Code 
of Conduct. The Group takes breaches of 
our code seriously and they may result in 
disciplinary action being taken. The Group 
has no tolerance for deliberate misconduct.

Sustainability – The Group seeks to be  
a leader in informing system change on  
the key sustainability issues linked to our 
purpose and strategy. We want to use  
our position in the market to drive positive 
change for customers and wider society 
over the long term. Our Sustainability 
Strategy is designed to take advantage of 
sustainability opportunities and manage 
sustainability risks in a way that is transparent, 
affordable, and aligned with good customer 
outcomes and regulatory requirements.

Risk Universe
A key element of effective risk management 
is ensuring the business understands the risks 
it faces. The Group’s Risk Universe summarises 
the comprehensive set of risks to which the 
Group is exposed. The Risk Universe allows 
the Group to deploy a common risk taxonomy 
and language, allowing for meaningful 
comparison to be made across the business. 
The risk profile of each is an assessment of 
the impact and likelihood of those risks 
crystallising and the Group failing to achieve 
its strategic objectives. Changes in the risk 
profile are influenced by the commercial, 
economic and non-economic environment 
and are identified, assessed, managed, 
monitored and reported through the Group’s 
RMF processes. The Risk Universe presents 
the complete set of risks across the Group  
in increasing levels of granularity, i.e. Level 1 
risks are the high level risk categories, Level 2 
risks are the components of these categories 
and, in some instances, Level 3 risks are 
included, where considered necessary,  
as sub-components. The Group treats its 
Conduct Strategy and sustainability risk 
management as cross-cutting risks that 
impact all aspects of the Risk Universe.

Risk policies
The Group Risk Policy Framework supports 
the delivery of the Group’s purpose and 
strategy by establishing the operating 
principles and expectations for managing 
the key risks to the Group’s business  
day-to-day. Each of the risk policies defines:

•

•

•

 the individual risks the policy is intended
to manage;

 the degree of risk the Group is willing 
to accept, which is set out in the policy 
risk appetite statements; and

 the Control Objectives that determine 
the Key Controls required to manage 
each risk to an acceptable level.

Risk policies are mapped to either Level 1  
or Level 2 Risk Universe categories to ensure 
complete coverage of all material risks.

The Group Risk Policy Framework further 
supports the Group in operating within the 
boundaries of its risk appetite statements 
by seeking to limit volatility under a range 
of Board-approved adverse scenarios.

Quantitative and qualitative appetite limits 
are chosen which specify the acceptable 
likelihood for breaching the agreed risk 
appetite statements (for example, less than 
x% chance of a breach in regulatory capital) 
and assessment against appetite targets 
is undertaken through scenario testing.

Breaches of appetite are corrected through 
management actions where appropriate.  
The effective use of risk mitigation 
techniques, such as reinsurance, hedging 
and outsourcing, are key to ensuring the 
Group remains within risk appetite, and are 
described in the relevant Group risk policies.

A Group Conduct Strategy and Sustainability 
Risk Management Framework overarch all 
risk policies to provide a holistic view of 
conduct and sustainability risks. This provides 
a consistent and comprehensive approach in 
the application of the RMF to manage these 
risks across the Group.

Governance and organisation
The RMF delivers a consistent three lines  
of defence model with clearly defined roles 
and responsibilities for all components. 
Risk accountability and ownership are 
embedded in the first line, with first line 
assurance teams established to support 
the business by providing substantiated 
evidence that controls are fit for purpose. 

Overall responsibility for approving 
the RMF rests with the Board, with 
maintenance and review of the effective 
operation of the RMF delegated to the 
Board Risk Committee. This delegation 
also includes approval of the overall risk 
management strategy and the review and 
recommendation to the Board of the relevant 
risk policies, risk appetite statements, risk 
profile and any relevant emerging risks. 

Group Risk conducts an annual assessment 
of the effectiveness of each function in the 
business in adhering to the requirements 
of the RMF. This provides assurance to 
Management and the Boards that the 
RMF has been implemented consistently 
and is operating effectively across the 
Group. Measures are in place during each 
Framework refresh to allow for continuous 
improvement in risk management 
throughout the business by seeking input 
from colleagues and industry bodies.

First line: Management
Management of risk is delegated from the 
Board to the Group Chief Executive Officer, 
the Executive Committee (‘ExCo’) members 
and through to business managers. The first 
line is responsible for implementation of 
the RMF, ensuring risks to the Group and its 
customers, shareholders, colleagues and 
society are identified, assessed, controlled, 
monitored, managed and reported. 

Second line: Risk oversight
Independent oversight of risk management 
is provided by the Group Risk function 
through advice, guidance, review, challenge, 
opinion and assurance; its views are 
reported to the Board Risk Committee. 

Group Risk’s purpose and responsibilities 
are set out in the Risk Mission, Mandate 
and Plan, which is presented to the Board 
Risk Committee for approval annually.

Third line: Independent assurance
Independent verification of the adequacy 
and effectiveness of internal controls and  
risk management is provided by the Group 
Internal Audit function. Each annual audit 
plan includes focus on different components 
of the RMF, and each individual audit provides 
an opinion on the Control Environment  
and RMF Operation for the area in focus. 
Following each audit, ratings and output  
are reported to the Board Audit Committee. 

The Governance framework in  operation 
throughout the Group can be found in the 
chart overleaf.

Emerging risk
The Group defines an emerging risk (or 
opportunity) as an event that is perceived 
to be potentially material but is not yet fully 
understood. Emerging risks could either 
be novel or connected with existing risks 
but where the context, conditions and/or 
constraints are subject to material changes.

The distinction between a current risk and  
an emerging risk predominantly relates to the 
amount of available information, with fewer 
details available for emerging risks meaning 
that likelihood and severity impacts are more 
uncertain. Emerging risks or opportunities 
do typically take longer to crystallise, but in 
many cases immediate actions are needed 
so that risks can be pre-emptively mitigated, 
or opportunities can be fully maximised.

Regular conversations at Board level 
help to drive out potential new risks and 
opportunities, pulling on the collective 
expertise and experiences of senior 
individuals. It is a requirement under 
the Strategic Risk policy for business 
unit or function management Boards 
and ExCo to receive an emerging risks 
and opportunities dashboard at regular 
intervals and be asked to consider 
whether any item should be considered 
within existing strategic ambitions.

Strategic risk management
Strategic risks threaten the achievement of 
the Group’s purpose and strategy. The Group 
recognises that core strategic activity brings 
with it exposure to strategic risk, however it 
seeks to proactively identify, manage and 
monitor these exposures. A Strategic Risk 
policy is maintained and reported against 
regularly, with a particular focus on risk 
management, stakeholder management 
and corporate activity and against the Life 
Companies’ and Group’s strategic ambitions.

Risk and capital models
The Group uses a partial Internal Model  
for calculation of its solvency capital 
requirement. A continuous process is 
followed for identification and assessment  
of risk types and the corresponding resilience 
of the Group’s capital position. The Group 
continually strives to enhance its internal risk 
and capital models and the related modelling 
must be sufficiently accurate to enable 
appropriate ranking and management of 
risks. It is a requirement that all material risks, 
and the interactions between them, are in 
scope of the Group’s risk and capital models.

Under Solvency II, the development  
and production of any Internal Model  
output contributing to regulatory capital 
requirements must comply with validation 
standards, supported with documentation 
standards. This is supported by a  
Model Governance policy, which sets  
out the standards that must be satisfied  
to demonstrate meeting Solvency II 
requirements. The Internal Model output  
is used within the ORSA process to provide 
insight into risks associated with the  
Group’s objectives.

The Group’s Stress and Scenario testing 
programme uses the Internal Model to assess 
the capital impact of a range of plausible and 
extreme stresses.

Risk control processes and reporting 
Identification, assessment, measurement, 
management and reporting of risks,  
including learning lessons from incidents,  
is undertaken across the three lines of 
defence, and is reported through business 
and management governance to the relevant 
Boards and Committees. 

The Group uses the Governance and 
Compliance Manager (‘GCM’) system, 
allowing colleagues across the three lines of 
defence to identify and report any potential 
emerging or material risks formally, enabling 
suitable owners to be assigned to manage 
these risks and facilitates tracking to closure.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties are detailed in this 
section, together with their potential impact, mitigating actions 
in place and any change in risk exposure since the Group’s 
2022 Annual Report and Accounts, published in March 2023.

A principal risk is a risk or combination  
of risks that can seriously affect the 
performance, future prospects or reputation 
of the Group, including risks that would 
threaten its business model, solvency or 
liquidity. The Board Risk Committee has 
carried out a robust assessment of principal 
risks and emerging risks. As a result of this 
review, the 13 risks noted in the Group’s 2022 
Annual Report and Accounts have been 
retained. The articulation of the principal 
risks related to transitioning acquired 
businesses and Environmental, Social and 
Governance (‘ESG’) has been refined to 
reflect the evolution of how these risks could 
impact the Group. The overall level of risk 

exposure for ESG risks is now reported  
as ‘Heightened’ for the first time since 
introduction in 2019, in recognition of the 
external headwinds which could impact  
the Group’s ability to effectively manage 
sustainability risks.

Both strategic and operational risk categories 
contain multiple principal risks; risks in these 
categories are broadly ordered for their 
relevance to enabling the Group to achieve 
its strategic priorities.

Further details of the Group’s exposure to 
financial and insurance risks and how these 
are managed are provided in note E6 and F11 
to the IFRS consolidated financial statements.

The Group fails to deliver long-term organic cash generation in line with its Annual Operating Plan 

Confidence in the Group might be 
diminished if it fails to deliver organic  
cash generation in line with targets  
shared, particularly as the Group seeks  
to support people by offering a wide 
range of solutions to help customers 
journey to and through retirement.

The Group’s business unit structure  
brings focus and accountability.  
The key areas of growth are Pensions  
and Savings and Retirement Solutions.
Each business unit holds an annual 
strategy setting exercise to consider  
the needs of potential and existing 
customers, the interests of shareholders, 
the competitive landscape and the 
Group’s overall purpose and objectives.
The Group’s Annual Operating Plan 
commits it to making significant 
investment in its growth businesses, 
including propositional enhancements 
driven by customer insight. 
The Group is established in the  
Bulk Purchase Annuity (‘BPA’) market  
and continues to invest in its operating 
model to further strengthen its  
capability to support its growth plans. 
For new BPA business, the Group 
continues to be selective and 
proportionate, focusing on value  
not volume, by applying its rigorous 
Capital Allocation Framework.

Unchanged
The Group viewed this risk as ‘Improving’ in the 2022 Annual Report and 
Accounts, reflecting the demonstrated success of the strategy to pursue 
organic cash generation; this view of the level of risk exposure is unchanged.
The Group has delivered strong organic growth in 2023, with new 
business net fund flows of c. £7bn, compared to £3.9bn in 2022.  
This is in line with the Group’s strategy to deliver a balanced business 
mix through leveraging its scale in the capital-light fee-based 
businesses and maintaining a disciplined level of growth in annuities.
As a result of this strong performance, the Group has delivered  
c. £1.5bn of total new business long-term cash generation in 2023, 
achieving its 2025 target two years early.
During 2023, the Group completed BPA transactions with a combined 
premium of c. £6bn, compared to £4.8bn in 2022. This continues to 
demonstrate that the Group has the ability to compete and win in the 
BPA market.
In September, the Group launched the Standard Life Pension Annuity 
to the open market in the UK, becoming the first new provider to enter 
the annuity market since the introduction of Pension Freedoms 
legislation in 2015.
The Pensions and Savings business, operating under the Standard Life 
brand, has developed its operating model to centre around three 
trading channels: Workplace, Retail Intermediated and Retail direct. 
The Workplace business continues to attract good flows in, delivering  
net fund flows of c. £4.5bn in 2023, nearly double the £2.4bn delivered  
in 2022. This is supported by c. £2bn of new scheme assets transferred  
in 2023, including the Siemens workplace scheme, which represents one 
of the largest scheme transfers to have been tendered in the UK market  
in recent years, demonstrating the strength of the Group’s proposition. 
The operating model and organisational design are being developed 
and implemented for the Retail businesses, with the aim of maximising 
opportunities for growth, both directly and through advisers, from new 
and existing customers. During 2023, £1.079bn of assets were internally 
transferred to Retail direct to enable existing customers to access 
modern pension offerings to support them to and through retirement. 
The Group is looking to expand the current offering of financial guidance 
and advice to support customers in better preparing for their retirement.

The Group’s strategic partnerships fail to deliver the expected benefits 

The Group has in place established 
engagement processes and a rigorous 
governance structure to manage 
relationships with its strategic partners, 
in line with the Group’s Supplier 
Management Model. 
The Group takes steps to monitor its 
supplier concentration risks and has 
business continuity plans to deploy  
should there be a significant failure  
of a strategic partner.

Unchanged
The Group assessed this risk as ‘Heightened’ in the 2019 Annual Report 
and Accounts due to the increased dependency it placed on its strategic 
partnerships, and then ‘Improved’ in 2020 due to strengthening controls 
around the operation of those partnerships. Whilst the Group has 
further strengthened and simplified its strategic partnerships since that 
time, its assessment of the level of risk exposure is unchanged from the 
2020 position, reflecting the Group’s ongoing reliance on its strategic 
partners to deliver the volume of change needed to advance the 
Group’s strategic objectives.
The Group continues to develop its partnership with TCS Diligenta to 
support its strategic deliverables. The successful migration of another 
700,000 Phoenix Life customer policies to TCS Diligenta’s BaNCS 
platform was completed in November 2023. Planning for further 
migrations in 2024 and beyond is underway.
During 2023 the Group successfully transferred the custody and fund 
accounting services for £12.3bn of assets to HSBC plc. This is a key 
milestone in the Group’s journey towards implementing harmonised 
investment administration processes, and boosts its strategic 
partnership with HSBC plc.

Strategic partnerships are a core  
enabler for delivery of the Group’s 
strategy; they allow it to meet the needs  
of its customers and clients and deliver 
value for its shareholders. The Group’s  
end state operating model will leverage 
the strengths of its strategic partners 
whilst retaining in-house key skills which 
differentiate it from the market.
However, there is a risk that the Group’s 
strategic partnerships do not deliver the 
expected benefits leading to adverse 
impacts to customer outcomes, strategic 
objectives, regulatory obligations  
and the Group’s reputation and brand. 
Some of the Group’s key strategic 
partnerships include: 
abrdn plc: Provides investment 
management services to the Group 
including the development of investment 
solutions for customers. abrdn plc 
manages c. £154bn of the Group’s assets 
under administration, at December 2023.
HSBC plc: Provides custody and  
fund accounting services to the  
Group to manage c. £165bn of its  
unit linked operations.
TCS Diligenta: The Group’s partnership 
covers a range of services including 
customer administration and digital and 
technology capabilities to support 
customer outcomes. 

Strategic risk continued 
The Group fails to effectively transition acquired businesses  

The Group is exposed to the risk of  
failing to transform, simplify and better 
integrate the component parts of our 
acquired businesses to deliver leading 
customer experiences and realise scale 
efficiencies successfully and efficiently.
The transition of acquired businesses  
into the Group, including customer 
migrations, could introduce structural  
or operational challenges that, without 
sufficient controls, could result in the 
Group failing to deliver the expected 
outcomes for customers or achieve the 
efficiencies of its target operating model.

Integration plans are developed and 
resourced with appropriately skilled  
staff to ensure target operating models  
are delivered in line with expectations.  
The Group’s priority at all times is on 
delivering for its customers. Customer 
migrations are planned thoroughly  
with robust execution controls in place. 
Lessons learned from previous migrations 
are applied to future activity to continuously 
strengthen the Group’s processes.
The Group views future M&A activity as  
an optional strategy accelerant and will 
assess new inorganic growth opportunities 
against a clear set of criteria and seeks  
to execute those opportunities which 
score positively against these criteria. 
The Group’s acquisition strategy is 
supported by the Group’s financial 
strength and flexibility, strong regulatory 
relationships and its track record of 
generating shareholder value and 
delivering good customer outcomes.
The financial and operational risks of 
target businesses are assessed in the 
acquisition phase and potential mitigants 
are identified which may include 
temporary capital or liquidity buffers.

Unchanged
This risk was assessed as ‘Heightened’ in the Group’s 2018 Annual 
Report and Accounts due to the transformational nature of the 
Standard Life acquisition. The assessment of the level of exposure  
to this risk is unchanged from the 2018 position due to the volume  
of ongoing transition and integration activity.
The Group has worked to transform from a financial engineering 
business to a purpose-led, organically growing business. Focus is  
now on pivoting to transform and simplify the business in the next 
phase of our journey.
The Group continues to develop its partnership with TCS Diligenta  
to support its target operating model. Further customer migrations  
to TCS Diligenta’s BaNCS platform are planned in upcoming years, 
which will support delivery of the Group’s target operating model  
and enable all Phoenix policies to benefit from a more advanced 
administration platform. The key risk in respect of migration activity  
is that the time, and associated cost, to deliver these whilst protecting 
customer outcomes is greater than expected and the Group regularly 
assesses its reserving basis as a result.
In April 2023 the Group completed the acquisition of Sun Life of 
Canada UK, a closed book UK life insurance company, from Sun Life 
Assurance Company of Canada. The integration is progressing well, 
with the majority of functions due to complete activity in April 2024. 
The Group has now delivered c. 20% of the targeted c. £500m 
incremental long-term cash generation target from this acquisition,  
with the remainder due to emerge in 2025 and 2026.

Strategic risk continued 
The Group does not have sufficient capacity and capability to fully deliver its significant change agenda  
which is required to execute the Group’s strategic objectives

Customer risk 
The Group fails to deliver good outcomes for its customers or fails to deliver propositions that continue 
 to meet the evolving needs of customers

The Group’s ability to deliver change on 
time and within budget could be adversely 
impacted by insufficient resource and 
capabilities as well as inefficient 
prioritisation, scheduling and oversight of 
projects. The risk could materialise within 
both the Group and its strategic partners. 
This could result in the benefits of change 
not being realised by the Group in the 
time frame assumed in its business plans 
and may result in the Group being unable 
to deliver its strategic objectives. Poor 
change delivery could affect the Group’s 
ability to operate its core processes  
in a controlled and timely manner.

The Group’s Change Management 
Framework defines a clear set of 
prioritisation criteria and scheduling 
principles for new projects. This is  
to support the safe and controlled 
mobilisation of change in line with 
capacity and risk appetite and to strengthen 
business readiness processes to deliver 
change safely into the operational 
environment. These prioritisation 
principles are a core part of the Annual 
Operating Plan process, alongside a 
significant focus on the deliverability  
of the change portfolio in 2024.
Information setting out the current and 
forecast levels of resource supply and 
demand continues to be provided  
to accountable Senior Management  
to enable informed decision-making.  
This aims to ensure that all material risks  
to project delivery are appropriately 
identified, assessed, managed,  
monitored and reported.

Unchanged
Whilst significant progress has been made on developing the change 
capability and capacity, there has been no change to the assessment  
of exposure to this risk since its introduction in the 2020 Annual Report 
and Accounts, which reflects the potential impact of failing to deliver 
the Group’s significant strategic and regulatory change agenda.
The Group has continued to strengthen its Change Management 
Framework during 2023 and expects to see an improving trend in this 
risk as those enhancements are seen in project delivery, noting that the 
Group has a number of multi-year change programmes so benefits will 
emerge in 2024 and beyond. The Group’s Chief Operating Officer  
is driving further enhancements to evolve and mature the Group’s 
change operating model. In 2023 this included significant effort being 
put into the recruitment of senior change professionals, alongside the 
assessment and further development of all internal change resources.

Strategic risk continued 
The Group fails to appropriately prepare for and manage the effects of climate change and wider ESG risks

The Group is exposed to the risk of failing 
to respond adequately to ESG risks and 
delivering on its purpose; for example, 
failing to meet and make its sustainability 
commitments. 
A failure to manage ESG risk could  
result in adverse customer outcomes, 
reduced colleague engagement,  
reduced proposition attractiveness, 
reputational risks and litigation.
The Group is exposed to risks arising  
from the transition to a lower-carbon 
economy, which could result in a loss  
in the value of policyholder and 
shareholder assets. 
In addition, physical risk can give rise  
to financial implications, such as direct 
damage to assets, operational impacts 
either direct or due to supply chain 
disruption, and impacts on policyholder 
health and wellbeing, impacting 
demographic experience.

Heightened
This risk is considered ‘Heightened’ for the first time since its introduction 
as a principal risk in the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts. 
The key driver for this change is the rapidly evolving external ESG 
environment. In particular, the increasing politicalisation and weakening 
of government policies in relation to ESG risk (such as that of the UK 
Government) as this could delay the necessary actions to transition  
to a low carbon economy, making the potential future crystallisation  
of physical climate events increasingly likely.
Anti-climate change and ESG sentiment, particularly in high 
carbon-emitting countries, could have far-reaching consequences  
for the pace and effectiveness of climate action and continue to  
slow down policy changes. This could limit future ESG-aligned 
investment opportunities and make it more difficult for the Group  
to manage ESG risk and meet its climate commitments.
Recent reports from bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel  
on Climate Change and the United Nations Environment Programme 
highlight the slow progress and significant scale of the challenge in 
restricting global warming below 1.5°C. Real world events are occurring 
at a high rate, with 2023 setting the record for the hottest year ever  
on record.
The Group is cognisant of this changing environment and undertakes 
thought leadership and wide engagement with policymakers  
and market participants to actively raise the debate around key 
sustainability themes. 
Analysis indicates the Group is on track to achieve its 2025 targets if 
planned actions are implemented. However, further internal actions will 
likely be needed to achieve the 2030 targets, which are also increasingly 
dependent on external factors such as the decarbonisation of the wider 
economy and actions by others – in particular government, regulators, 
and the high transition risk sector.

The Group has a clear sustainability 
strategy in place which is updated annually 
to reflect the Group’s latest plans and risk 
exposures, with key metrics on progress 
monitored throughout the year. 
Sustainability risk and climate risk are both 
embedded into the Group’s RMF.
Sustainability risk ‘cross-cuts’ the  
Group’s Risk Universe. This means the 
consideration of material sustainability-
related risks is embedded in the Group’s 
risk policies, with regular reporting 
undertaken to ensure ongoing visibility  
of its exposure to these risks. Several 
sustainability-related risk policies are  
also in place to cover the main sources  
of sustainability risk.
The Group is making good progress on 
integrating the management of climate 
change and wider ESG risks across the 
business, including in investment 
portfolios, with further work underway  
to embed its consideration fully across  
the business. 
The Group continues to engage with 
suppliers and asset managers on their 
progress and approach to managing 
climate change and wider ESG risks.
The Group undertakes annual climate-
related stress and scenario testing and 
continues to build its climate scenario 
modelling capabilities. 
The Group undertakes deep dives  
on emerging ESG risk areas (such as 
greenwashing and ESG litigation risk)  
to increase understanding and awareness 
for Boards and Management, and facilitate 
control improvements where required.

The Group is exposed to the risk that  
it fails to deliver good outcomes for its 
customers, leading to adverse customer 
experience and potential customer harm. 
This could also lead to reputational damage 
for the Group and/or financial losses.
In addition, a failure to deliver propositions 
that meet the evolving needs of customers 
may result in the Group’s failure to deliver 
its purpose of helping people secure a life 
of possibilities.

The Group’s Conduct Risk Appetite sets 
the boundaries within which the Group 
expects customer outcomes to be managed. 
The Group’s Conduct Strategy, which 
overarches the Risk Universe and all risk 
policies, is designed to detect where 
customers are at risk of poor outcomes, 
minimise conduct risks, and respond with 
timely and appropriate mitigating actions. 
The Group has a suite of customer policies 
that set out key customer risks and the 
Control Objectives that determine the  
Key Controls required to mitigate them. 
The Group maintains a strong and open 
relationship with the FCA and other 
regulators, particularly on matters 
involving customer outcomes.
The Group’s Proposition Development 
Process ensures consideration of 
customer needs and conduct risk  
when developing propositions.

Operational risk 
The Group or its outsource partners are not sufficiently operationally resilient

The Group is exposed to the risk of 
causing intolerable levels of disruption  
to its customers and stakeholders if it 
cannot maintain the provision of important 
business services when faced with a major 
operational disruption. This could occur 
either in-house or within the Group’s 
primary and downstream outsource 
partners, and be triggered by a range  
of environmental and climatic factors  
such as the cost-of-living crisis and 
adverse weather phenomena.
The Group regularly conducts customer 
migrations as part of transition activities  
in delivering against its strategic 
objectives. In doing so, it faces the risk  
of interruption to its customer services, 
which may result in the failure to deliver 
expected customer outcomes.
Regulatory requirements for operational 
resilience, and a timetable to achieve  
full compliance, were published in  
March 2021. Whilst the specific 
requirement to work within set impact 
tolerances takes effect in March 2025,  
the Group is already exposed to 
regulatory censure in the event of 
operational disruption should the 
regulator determine that the cause  
was a breach of existing regulation.

The Group’s Operational Resilience 
Framework enhances the protection  
of customers and stakeholders. It is 
designed to prevent intolerable harm and 
supports compliance with the regulations. 
The Group continues to work closely with 
its outsource partners to ensure that the 
level of resilience delivered is aligned  
to the Group’s impact tolerances. 
The Group has already taken some action, 
through previous strategic transformation 
activity, to reduce exposure to technological 
redundancy and key person dependency 
risk, increasing the resilience of its customer 
service. It continues to do so where further 
exposure is identified.
The Group regularly reviews important 
business service MI to ensure appropriate 
action is taken to rectify and prevent 
customer harm. The Group is working  
to further strengthen and enhance the 
overall resilience of the Group and  
its outsource partners by March 2025 
through its Operational Resilience 
Remediation Project. 
The Group and its outsource partners 
have well-established business continuity 
management and disaster recovery 
frameworks that are annually refreshed 
and regularly tested. Disruption events are 
used to assess lessons learned to identify 
any continual improvements to be made. 

Unchanged
There has been no change to the overall level of exposure to this risk 
since it was introduced in the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts.
The FCA’s Consumer Duty represents a step change in approach  
for the industry, re-enforcing a shift away from a rules-based regime  
to principles-based regulation. The Duty introduces an overarching 
requirement that firms, and their employees, must act to deliver good 
outcomes for retail customers. In response, the Group mobilised  
a programme of work to implement the changes required to achieve  
its interpretation of compliance in line with the key regulatory  
deadlines of end-April 2023, end-July 2023 and end-July 2024. 
Despite having met the first two deadlines, the Group’s view is that  
the risk exposure around the Duty is elevated whilst the supervisory 
approach matures, and closed products are reviewed against the 
Duty’s principles, most notably fair value, ahead of the end-July 2024 
deadline. The Group has built on its strong foundations, enhancing 
existing and creating new Group frameworks, processes and strategies 
to meet Duty requirements. This includes a Fair Value Framework 
designed to assess value in its broadest definition and refreshing the 
Conduct Strategy to embed and maintain the culture of the Group, 
informed by monitoring behaviours and customer outcomes. 
The FCA is raising the bar in terms of expectations on firms to ensure 
and evidence good outcomes are being achieved for their customers. 
The FCA continues to provide guidance to the industry to support 
firms’ plans to embed the Duty within their businesses. It also recognises 
that its own understanding and development of guidance and its 
supervisory approach will continue to evolve. 
The Group continues to monitor the impacts of the cost-of-living crisis 
on its customers. Proactive action to support customers, including 
those most vulnerable, is a priority. The Group is using customer 
behaviour research and analysis to provide customers with the support 
and help that they need. This has included improving all brand websites 
to provide general cost-of-living support, encouraging customers to 
get in touch for help and including links to external support websites. 

Unchanged
This strategic risk has been assessed as ‘Heightened’ in the Group’s 
Annual Report and Accounts since 2020. 
Key drivers of this assessment are the increasing threat of cyber-attacks 
and the Group’s dependency on its outsource partners to have 
appropriate resilience to operational disruption.
The Group has a significant change and customer migration agenda 
over the next three to five years, effective completion of which is 
required to deliver planned strengthening of its operational resilience 
both internally and with some material outsourced service providers. 
This exposes the Group to increased risk. However, this is mitigated 
through strengthened Operational Resilience and Change 
Management Frameworks, where the risk of late delivery is actively 
managed by both the relevant change programme and separate 
operational resilience remediation governance and reporting.
The quantum of strategic customer transformation activity requires 
subject matter expertise to execute successfully. The Group’s 
operational resilience, internally and with material third parties,  
would be impacted by a large-scale loss of colleagues, for example  
due to illness or incapacity such as influenza, in the UK or globally.  
Such impacts are difficult to mitigate in the short-term; however,  
the Group and material suppliers made substantial investments  
in remote working capability to manage the impacts of COVID-19, 
which would be expected to help mitigate the impacts of a further 
pandemic to service continuity.

Operational risk continued 
The Group is impacted by significant changes in the regulatory, legislative or political environment

Operational risk continued 
The Group or its supply chain are not sufficiently cyber resilient

Changes in regulation could lead to 
non-compliance with new requirements 
that could impact the quality of customer 
outcomes, lead to regulatory sanction, 
impact financial performance or cause 
reputational damage. These could require 
changes to working practices and have  
an adverse impact on resources and 
financial performance.
Political uncertainty or changes in the 
government could see changes in policy 
that could impact the industry in which the 
Group operates.

The Group undertakes proactive  
horizon scanning to understand potential 
changes to the regulatory and legislative 
landscape. This allows the Group to 
understand the potential impact of these 
changes to amend working practices  
to meet the new requirements by  
the deadline. 
The Group engages with many political 
parties and industry bodies to foster 
collaboration and inspire change which 
supports the Group’s purpose of helping 
customers secure a life of possibilities. 

Unchanged
This risk was assessed as ‘Heightened’ in the Group’s 2021 Annual 
Report and Accounts due to the uncertainty around Solvency II reforms 
and the FCA’s proposed Consumer Duty. These, and the significant 
undertaking to achieve compliance with IFRS 17 in 2023, were the key 
drivers of the assessment of risk as further ‘Heightened’ in the 2022 
Annual Report and Accounts and the current assessment is unchanged 
from that position.
The volatile political environment remains ‘Heightened’ ahead  
of worldwide elections in 2024, including an expected UK General 
Election. The current administration continues to face economic 
headwinds, management of which has implications for the Group’s 
customer base, including the cost-of-living crisis, increased borrowing 
costs and the potential increase in vulnerability.
In June 2023, HMT published draft legislation related to the  
Solvency II reforms, indicating the reform implementation would be 
staged with some reforms coming into force on 31 December 2023  
and the remainder on 30 June 2024. The Prudential Regulation 
Authority (‘PRA’) has since issued two of three anticipated consultations 
on the rules to implement those reforms in H2 2023, and its near  
final policy to go live at year-end 2024, relating to Internal Models, 
Transitional measures on Technical Provisions and Group supervision. 
Internal teams are reviewing the detail to assess what actions are 
needed to ensure the Group is compliant with the new rules.
The Group supports the PRA and HMT’s objectives to reform the 
regulations to better suit the UK market whilst maintaining appropriate 
safeguards for policyholders. The financial impact of the reforms  
will depend on the exact detail of the final legislation. The relatively 
short time period between the PRA’s final Policy Statement and the 
implementation date of the new rules contributes to the status of  
this risk. The Group will therefore remain actively involved in industry 
lobbying on Solvency II and is preparing as much as possible ahead of 
time to ensure compliance with new rules at the point of implementation.
The Group views the FCA’s Consumer Duty as well aligned to its 
strategic priority of helping people secure a life of possibilities  
and, from 31 July 2023, the Group is materially compliant with the  
Duty for its open products. Focus remains on reviewing customer 
journeys and fair value assessments for closed products to achieve 
compliance with the Duty’s principles for these products ahead  
of the 31 July 2024 deadline.
In November 2023 the FCA issued Sustainability Disclosure 
Requirements and investment labelling requirements which aim  
to inform and protect consumers and improve trust in the market  
for sustainable investments. The Group supports the FCA’s aims noting 
that terminology used and a lack of consistency between providers 
makes it difficult for consumers to navigate. The Group has mobilised  
a project to ensure its practices align with the new regulation.
In December 2023, the FCA issued the Advice Guidance Boundary 
Review consultation paper. The consultation could lead to a significant 
change in the way that people who cannot access advice are supported 
in the industry and the Group is actively engaging with the FCA  
on this topic.
IFRS 17 aims to standardise insurance accounting across the industry 
and achieving compliance has been a significant undertaking.  
The Group will continue its finance transformation programme  
in 2024 to further streamline and automate IFRS 17 processes  
to support efficient financial reporting in the future.

The Group is continually strengthening its 
cyber security controls, attack detection 
and response processes, identifying 
weaknesses through ongoing assessment 
and review.
The Enterprise Information Security 
Strategy includes a continuous Information 
Security and Cyber Improvement 
Programme, which is driven by input  
from the Annual Cyber Risk Assessment 
and Annual Cyber Threat Assessment  
that utilises internal and external threat 
intelligence sources. 
The Group continues to consolidate  
its cyber security tools and capabilities 
and the Enterprise Information Security 
Strategy 2023–2025 includes delivery  
of a Group Identity Platform and Zero 
Trust model, Supplier Assurance Platform, 
Secure Cloud Adoption and proactive 
Data Loss Prevention.
The specialist second line Information 
Security and Cyber Risk team provides 
independent oversight and challenge  
of information security controls, 
identifying trends, internal and external 
threats and advising on appropriate 
mitigation solutions.
The Group continues to enhance and 
strengthen its outsourced service provider 
and third-party oversight and assurance 
processes. Regular Board, Executive,  
Risk and Audit Committee engagement 
occurs within the Group.
The Group holds ISO 27001 Information 
Security Management Certification for its 
Workplace Pension and Benefits schemes, 
which provides confidence to both  
clients and internal stakeholders that  
it is committed to managing security.

Phoenix Group is the UK’s largest 
long-term savings and retirement business, 
with a significant profile, which leads to 
greater interest from cyber criminals.  
The world continues to become increasingly 
digitally connected and cyber-attacks 
remain a major threat to the Group.  
Over the past five years the Group has 
grown from 5m to 12m customers, while 
the number of colleagues in the Group  
has grown from 900 to over 7,500,  
not including contractors. In addition,  
the Group’s footprint includes engagement 
with c. 1,800 suppliers which increases the 
attack surface significantly. This continual 
growth poses a greater risk of cyber-attack 
which could have a significant impact on 
customer outcomes, strategic objectives, 
regulatory obligations and the Group’s 
reputation and brand.
Based on external events and trends, the 
threat posed by a cyber security breach 
remains high and the complexity of the 
Group’s increasingly interconnected 
digital ecosystem exposes it to multiple 
attack vectors. These include phishing  
and business email compromise, hacking, 
data breach and supply chain compromise.
Increased use of online functionality to  
meet customer preferences and flexible 
ways of working, including remote access to 
business systems, adds additional challenges 
to cyber resilience and could impact service 
provision and customer security. 
The pace of change is accelerating due to 
the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (‘AI’), 
which in turn is compounding the threats 
and as a result, the cyber world is a more 
dangerous place than ever before. AI also 
has the potential to improve cyber security 
by dramatically increasing the timeliness 
and accuracy of threat detection and 
response. Cyber security is an essential 
pre-condition for the safety of AI systems 
and is required to ensure resilience, privacy, 
fairness, reliability and predictability. 

Unchanged
This risk was assessed as ‘Heightened’ in the Group’s 2022  
Annual Report and Accounts and this remains unchanged. 
The UK cyber threat level remains elevated, due to the sustained 
Russia/Ukraine war, China/Taiwan tensions, and the addition of the 
Israel/Palestine armed conflict. Cyber threat levels remain high with 
increased likelihood of a cyber-attack from a State actor; however it  
is highly unlikely that a Nation State actor would directly target the 
Group and any impact would be as a result of indirect cyber-attacks 
against the UK’s critical national infrastructure, IT or information 
security service providers or global financial services companies. 
Cyber criminals continue to be the Group’s most likely threat, primarily 
due to the type of data held by financial sector organisations being 
attractive to criminal actors.
On 19 April 2023, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre issued  
an alert warning of a heightened risk from attacks by state-aligned 
Russian hacktivists, urging all organisations in the country to apply 
recommended security measures.
The Group’s cyber controls are designed and maintained to repel  
the full range of cyber-attack scenarios; whilst the Group’s main threat 
is considered to be cyber crime, from individuals or organised crime 
groups, the same controls are utilised to defend against a Nation 
State-level cyber-attack. 
The single consolidated Group Supplier Information Security Framework, 
which is improving the Security Oversight and Assurance of the Group’s 
large portfolio of Outsourced Service Providers (‘OSP’), third- and 
fourth-party suppliers, continues to mature. Further embedding and 
maturing over the next 12 months will help mitigate the risks associated 
with supply chain cyber security, which is considered the Group’s top 
cyber security threat. 
Vulnerability management continued to mature throughout 2023  
with the Enterprise Cyber Exposure Score (‘CES’) remaining steady. 
The Group received formal approval from the FCA and PRA in July 
2023 for closure of the Cybersecurity Best Practice Evaluation and 
Testing (‘CBEST’) remediation programme.

Operational risk continued 
The Group fails to retain or attract a diverse and engaged workforce with the skills needed to deliver its strategy

Delivery of the Group’s strategy is 
dependent on a talented, diverse and 
engaged workforce. 
This risk is inherent in the Group’s business 
model given the nature of acquisition 
activity and specialist skill sets. 
Potential areas of uncertainty include the 
ongoing transition of ReAssure businesses 
into the Group, the expanded strategic 
partnership with TCS Diligenta and the 
introduction of the flexible working model. 
Potential periods of uncertainty could 
result in a loss of critical corporate 
knowledge, unplanned departures of key 
individuals, or the failure to attract and 
retain individuals with the appropriate 
skills to help deliver the Group’s strategy.
This could ultimately impact the Group’s 
operational capability, its customer 
relationships and financial performance.

The Group aims to attract and retain 
colleagues from all backgrounds by 
creating a shared sense of purpose and 
commitment to our strategy, supported by 
offering competitive terms and conditions, 
benefits, and flexibility. Monthly colleague 
surveys promote continuous listening, 
allow rapid identification of concerns and 
actions that help improve engagement. 
The Group looks to respond proactively to 
external social, economic and marketplace 
events that impact colleagues.
The increased scale and presence of  
the Group, and success in multi-site and 
remote working, gives greater access to  
a larger talent pool to attract and retain  
in the future. In addition, the Group’s 
graduate and early career programmes 
helps to support the talent pipeline.

Unchanged
There has been no change to the overall level of exposure to this  
risk since it was introduced in the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts.  
This is driven by acknowledgement of the significant amount of 
integration activity within the Group and uncertainty regarding  
the longer-term social and marketplace impacts of the pandemic  
and cost-of-living crisis on colleague attrition, sickness, motivation  
and engagement. Skills essential to the Group continue to be in  
high-demand in the wider marketplace. The Group monitors this 
closely and continues to remain confident in the attractiveness of  
its colleague proposition.
The Group launched Midlife MOT assessments to help colleagues take 
stock in the key areas of wealth, work and wellbeing.
The Group continues to leverage apprenticeships to support workforce 
diversity and to fill key skills, creating bespoke graduate and early 
careers programmes for specialist technical areas. 
The Group continues to successfully operate a flexible working  
model, with strategic investments in technology and other resources 
maximising its effectiveness. The Group introduced Phoenix Flex as a 
core part of its employee offering in 2023, to help support colleagues 
in balancing their personal and professional lives, by encouraging and 
celebrating flexibility at work, embracing differences, and helping 
colleagues to thrive.

Market risk 
Adverse investment market movements or broader economic forces can impact the Group’s ability to meet  
its cash flow targets, along with the potential to negatively impact customer investments or sentiment

Credit risk 
The Group is exposed to the risk of downgrade or failure of a significant counterparty

The Group and its customers are exposed 
to the implications of adverse market 
movements. This can impact the Group’s 
capital, solvency, profitability and liquidity 
position, fees earned on assets held, the 
certainty and timing of future cash flows 
and long-term investment performance 
for shareholders and customers. 
There are a number of drivers for market 
movements including government and 
central bank policies, geopolitical events, 
market sentiment, sector-specific 
sentiment, global pandemics and 
financial risks of climate change, 
including risks from the transition  
to a low carbon economy.

The Group undertakes regular monitoring 
activities in relation to market risk 
exposure, including limits in each asset 
class, cash flow forecasting and stress and 
scenario testing. In particular, the Group’s 
increase in exposure to residential 
property and private investments,  
as a result of its BPA investment strategy,  
is actively monitored.
The Group continues to implement 
de-risking strategies and control 
enhancements to mitigate unwanted 
customer and shareholder outcomes  
from certain market movements,  
such as equities, interest rates,  
inflation and foreign currencies. 
The Group maintains cash buffers in  
its holding companies and has access  
to a credit facility to reduce reliance  
on emerging cash flows.
The Group closely monitors and  
manages its excess capital position  
and it regularly discusses market  
outlook with its asset managers.

Unchanged
This risk was assessed as ‘Heightened’ in the Group’s 2019 Annual 
Report and Accounts, and then again in 2020 due to ongoing 
economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, the impacts of COVID-19 
and uncertainty around interest rates. Whilst some of these have 
lessened, they remain the key drivers for the current assessment of 
exposure to this risk.
The global macro-economic environment remains highly uncertain; 
although prices continue to rise, the rate of inflation is lower. The UK 
Consumer Price Index is down to 4.0% in January 2024 from a peak  
of 11.1% in October 2022. There is an increased expectation that the 
Bank of England will achieve its target of 2% by the end of 2025.
The Bank of England base rate has increased from 0.1% in December 
2021 to 5.25% in August 2023, and remains at this level, with the 
outlook for this to remain stable until summer 2024 before reductions 
can be expected. Higher interest rates, coupled with cost-of-living 
rises, have suppressed residential property prices. These are expected 
to bottom out in summer 2024 and see a return to growth after interest 
rates start to come down. UK gilt yields remain high, rivalling the levels 
seen during the 2022 mini-budget market event. The Group continues 
to monitor and manage its market risk exposures, including to interest 
rates and inflation, and to markets affected by the increasing number of 
geopolitical conflicts and concerns. For example, continued attacks on 
shipping in the Red Sea pose a risk of worsening inflationary pressures 
and the downstream effects on interest rates. The Group’s strategy 
continues to involve hedging the major market risks and, in 2023, the 
Group’s Stress and Scenario testing programme continued to demonstrate 
the resilience of its balance sheet to market stresses. Contingency 
actions remain available to help manage the Group’s capital and 
liquidity position in the event of unanticipated market movements.

Insurance risk 
The Group may be exposed to adverse demographic experience which is out of line with expectations

The Group has guaranteed liabilities, 
annuities and other policies that are 
sensitive to future longevity, persistency 
and mortality rates. For example,  
if annuity policyholders live for longer 
than expected, then the Group will  
need to pay their benefits for longer. 
The amount of additional capital required 
to meet additional liabilities could have  
a material adverse impact on the Group’s 
ability to meet its cash flow targets.

The Group undertakes regular reviews  
of demographic experience and monitors 
exposure relative to quantitative risk 
appetite limits. 
Monitoring includes identifying any trends 
or variances in experience, in order to 
appropriately reflect these in assumptions. 
The Group continues to manage its 
longevity risk exposures, which includes  
the use of longevity swaps and 
reinsurance contracts to maintain  
this risk within appetite. 
Where required, the Group continues to 
take capital management actions to mitigate 
adverse demographic experience.

Unchanged
This risk was assessed as ‘Heightened’ in the 2020 Annual Report  
and remains ‘Heightened’. The assessment is driven by continued 
uncertainty around future demographic experience driven primarily by 
the long-term effects of COVID-19 on life expectancy; potential health 
risks from rising NHS waiting times; the rise in long-term sickness rates 
observed across the UK workforce; and health and customer behaviour 
implications from the cost-of-living crisis. 
Demographic experience and the latest assessment of future trends 
continue to be considered in regular assumption reviews, including 
making appropriate allowance for the impacts of COVID-19 on both 
longevity and mortality as part of the 2023 assumption reviews.
The Group continues to monitor customer behaviour as a result of the 
cost-of-living crisis to ensure its impact on demographic assumptions  
is appropriately reflected in regular assumption reviews. Proactive 
action is being taken to ensure support is provided to customers as  
the impacts from the cost-of-living crisis continue to materialise.
The Group completed BPA transactions with a combined premium  
of c. £6bn in 2023. Furthermore, the launch of the new Standard  
Life Pension Annuity (‘SLPA’) product in the second half of 2023  
is a significant milestone for the Group. Consistent with previous 
transactions, the Group continues to reinsure the vast majority of  
the longevity risk using longevity swaps and reinsurance contracts  
that are reviewed regularly.

The Group seeks rewarded credit risk  
in order to drive value for shareholders 
and invests in a wide range of credit risky 
assets in accordance with its strategic 
asset allocation.
The Group is exposed to the risk of 
downgrades and deterioration in the 
creditworthiness or default of investments, 
derivatives or banking counterparties. 
This could cause immediate financial  
loss or a reduction in future profits.
The Group is also exposed to trading 
counterparties, such as reinsurers or 
service providers, failing to meet all or  
part of their obligations. This would 
negatively impact the Group’s operations 
that may in turn have adverse effects on 
customer relationships and may lead to 
financial loss.

The Group seeks to take credit risk by 
maintaining a high quality and diversified 
credit investment portfolio and ensuring 
relationships are with highly rated 
counterparties.
The Credit Risk Policy and Counterparty 
Limit Framework sets out a system of 
controls to manage this risk within appetite 
with early warning indicators to manage the 
most material exposures within acceptable 
tolerances. This includes the management 
of risks linked to climate change, including 
the impact on assets from transitioning to  
a low carbon economy.
The Group regularly monitors its 
counterparty exposures and has specific 
limits in place relating to individual 
counterparties (with sub-limits for each 
credit risk exposure), sector concentration, 
geographies and asset class. Limits also 
restrict exposure to BBB+ and below  
rated assets. 
The Group undertakes regular stress and 
scenario testing of the credit portfolio. 
Where possible, exposures are diversified 
using a range of counterparty providers. 
All material reinsurance and derivative 
positions are appropriately collateralised.
The Group regularly discusses market 
outlook with its asset managers in addition 
to the second line Risk oversight provided. 
For mitigation of risks associated with 
stock-lending, additional protection  
is provided through collateral and 
indemnity insurance.

Unchanged
In the Group’s 2020 Annual Report and Accounts, this risk was assessed 
as ‘Heightened’ as a result of the market volatility and wider economic 
and social impacts arising from COVID-19. While the residual risks  
from COVID-19 have receded, the current assessment of the level of 
exposure to this risk is unchanged from the 2020 position, driven by  
the ongoing geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty and persistent 
high inflation.
Over 2023 the Group continued to undertake actions to increase  
the overall credit quality of its portfolio and mitigate the impact on  
risk capital of future downgrades. This positive progress is balanced  
by risks arising from geopolitical conflicts such as those in Ukraine  
and the Middle East, and supply chain disruptions arising from the  
risk of deterioration in the relationship between the USA and China. 
Uncertainties over the global economic outlook, persistent high 
inflation and higher for longer interest rates present an increased risk  
of defaults and downgrades. However, a UK sovereign downgrade is 
less probable than at the end of 2022, following both Moody’s and 
S&P’s revision of the UK credit rating’s outlook from ‘negative’ to ‘stable’ 
during 2023. This has a positive impact on UK-related assets including 
Gilts, Housing Associations and Local Authority Loans.
Despite the failure of a number of US regional banks and a regulator-
facilitated merger of Credit Suisse with UBS in early 2023, the Group’s 
view is that a full-blown banking crisis will not follow. In addition,  
the Group has limited exposure to banks with idiosyncratic risks. 
The Group has no direct shareholder credit exposure to Russia  
or Ukraine and no exposure to sanctioned entities.
The Group continues to increase investment in illiquid credit assets  
as a result of BPA transactions. This is within appetite and in line with  
the Group’s strategic asset allocation plans. The growth in illiquid assets 
will be met by growth in the overall Group credit portfolio.

Emerging risks and opportunities
The Group’s Senior Management and Board take emerging risks and opportunities into account when considering potential outcomes.  
This determines if appropriate management actions are in place to manage the risk or take advantage of the opportunity. Two examples  
of key risks and opportunities discussed by Senior Management and the Board during 2023 are:

Description

Quantum computing

Quantum computing has the potential to deliver improved actuarial analysis, portfolio optimisation, risk modelling and 
management, forecasting and enhanced fraud prevention. It has the ability to arrive at feasible solutions for optimisation 
problems, or find better accuracies for machine learning problems, or run simulations exponentially faster. However,  
there are significant risks to consider, such as the potential for quantum computing to be used with malicious intent against 
the Group. The Group will seek to get ‘quantum-safe’ as soon as possible, to minimise the magnitude of emerging threats, 
including the potential of breaking current encryption systems, which would leave personal data of the Group’s customers 
vulnerable to hackers. Switching from one encryption regime to another will take years to implement with the payoff timeline 
for incorporating quantum resources currently perceived as being in excess of three years. It is crucial for the Group to 
develop quantum-resistant encryption algorithms and implement robust security measures to protect sensitive information. 
There is a potential opportunity to maximise capital preservation and commercial differentiation, by leveraging the 
exponential growth in data available to the market.

Pensions innovation

Risk Universe category

Operational

Changing customer expectations around simplicity of products, personalisation and increasing technology-based 
interaction presents greater risk from market disruptions. Customers are increasingly looking for frictionless services,  
which will heighten competition in offering a complete experience and solutions to customer needs. Aside from these  
risks, this does represent a significant opportunity for the Group to meet ever-evolving customer needs to become a  
trusted partner to and through retirement.
The Group continues to partner with innovative start-ups, providing user experience and technical delivery support  
for priority proposition initiatives. Digital and Workplace successfully launched Phoenix Group’s Innovation Forum,  
inviting new partners from TCS COIN and FinTech Scotland networks to apply to work with the Group on defined 
challenges. The Group tracks industry change including on the use of analytics; ensuring compliance with cookies 
regulation; simplifying the process to gather permissions to market; and changes via Consumer Duty. The Group has  
an opportunity around future ways of working and innovation, leading to improved and enhanced customer experiences 
whilst ensuring that regulatory work fully supports good customer outcomes within the next one to three years.

Strategic reportStrategic reportViability statement

Viability statement 
In accordance with provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board is required to conduct an 
assessment of the viability of the Group over a specified 
time horizon.

Assessment Process
In assessing the future viability of the  
Phoenix Group, the Board has defined 
‘viability’ as maintaining the capability 
to satisfy mandatory liabilities and meet 
external targets for cash generation. 

In doing so, the Board considered whether 
the definition of viability should reflect the 
success of the Group in delivering against  
its strategic priority to invest in the growth  
of the business on an organic and inorganic 
basis. It concluded that any such investment 
needs to comply with the Group’s capital 
allocation framework and risk appetite,  
and that the Board retains flexibility to 
manage the level of investment to support 
the Group’s strategic priorities. In the absence 
of new business growth, the Group maintains 
a significant cash generation capacity from 
its in-force business which remains resilient 
under stress, supporting longer-term viability.

The Board has determined that the  
three-year time horizon to December 2026  
is an appropriate period for the assessment 
which aligns to the period covered by the 
Group’s latest Board-approved Annual 
Operating Plan (“AOP”), and to the period  
for which the Group establishes its internal 
and external targets. 

In making its assessment and assessing  
the prospects of the Group over the short, 
medium and longer-term, the Board considered 
a large range of information including:

• The Group’s strategic and operational 

plans as set out in the AOP, approved by 
the Board in February 2024; 

• The latest financial results for the Group;

• Financial projections of the Group’s 

capital, liquidity and funding positions 
over the viability assessment period. 
These projections have considered both 
base assumptions and severe but plausible 
stress scenarios, reflecting the major risks 
to which the Group is exposed;

• The results of wider stress and scenario 
testing activity, including reverse stress 
testing, capturing non-financial risks as 
well as more onerous scenarios with 
a low likelihood of occurrence;

• The operation of the Group’s Risk 

3. Longevity stress –longevity and yield 

Management Framework, including any 
breaches of risk appetite;

• The principal risks and uncertainties 

impacting the Group, together with an 
assessment of emerging risks that may 
impact on the Group’s future performance;

• The Own Risk and Solvency Assessment 

process which provides a forward-looking 
assessment of the Group’s risk and capital 
profile as a result of its business strategy, 
AOP and the overall risk environment; and

• An assessment of the wider operating 
environment for the Group, including 
legal, regulatory, political, climate and 
competitive factors.

Assessment of Viability
The Phoenix Group AOP is reviewed and 
approved by the Board on an at least annual 
basis and results in a set of strategic priorities, 
detailed financial forecasts across multi-year 
periods, risk assessments and associated 
resilience, and available contingent actions. 
Those strategic priorities are outlined in 
the Strategic Report of the Group’s Annual 
Report and Accounts, and progress against 
the AOP is reviewed monthly by the Board. 
The Board reviewed the results of stress 
testing to assess viability under severe but 
plausible scenarios, including three adverse 
stresses as follows, which are deemed to  
be representative of the key financial risks  
to the Group:

1. Market stress – a combined market stress 
broadly equivalent to a 1 in 10-year event, 
calibrated to the Phoenix Internal Model, 
incorporating a fall in equity, property 
values and yields, with a widening of 
credit spreads;

2. Plausible downside stress – a more 
onerous combined market stress 
reflecting tighter credit conditions 
and a deep recession driven by a 
further short-term increase in inflation 
and cost of living crisis, falls in equities, 
properties, increased credit spreads, 
a UK sovereign downgrade and credit 
asset downgrades; and 

stress broadly equivalent to a 1 in 10-year 
event, which implies a 1.27 year increase in 
life expectancy for a 65 year old male and 
1.3 year increase for a 65 year old female, 
alongside a fall in yields.

The calibration and assessment of the 
stresses is informed by the Group’s Solvency 
II Internal Model. The projections take into 
account the impact of any appropriate 
Solvency II recalculation of transitional 
benefits and allow for refinancing of 
certain of the Group’s debt obligations. 
In considering the projections, the 
Board has assessed the availability of 
contingent actions to increase resilience. 

The scenarios were applied to the Solvency 
II capital, liquidity and funding positions 
of the Group, and demonstrated that the 
Group could continue to meet its mandatory 
obligations without any breach to regulatory 
capital requirements, whilst continuing  
to track towards meeting external targets. 

Additional stress testing 
In addition, through the ORSA and wider 
financial resilience processes, the Board  
has reviewed a wide range of stress and 
scenario testing which has provided additional 
insight with regard to the defined viability 
assessment period. The scope of this testing 
covers the Group’s risk universe and includes 
scenarios such as:

• Additional severe downside economic 

scenarios with a low likelihood 
of occurrence;

• Operational disruption or failure 

of key third party service providers; 

• Cyber-attack, and resultant denial of 
service to key systems or applications;

• Failure to execute and deliver key change 

activities within the Group; and 

• Climate related risks, including those 

related to a disorderly climate transition. 

In so doing, the Board has considered the 
results of reverse stress testing that has 
been performed to analyse scenarios that 
have a low probability but where, if they 
occurred, have the potential to render the 
business model unviable. Reverse stress 
testing validates and improves, where 
necessary, mitigating actions in place to 
deal with threats to the Group’s viability by 
starting at the point of business failure and 
working backwards to identify the sequence 
of events that would lead to that outcome. 
It supports the development of actions that 
can be implemented now to avoid the failure. 

During 2023, the Stress and Scenario Testing 
Programme included separate consideration 
of the impact of a severe market stress and a 
severe longevity and yields stress. The market 
stress was designed to replicate a severe 
recession (downgrade across 21% of the  
total shareholder liquid/illiquid credit asset 
portfolio, House Prices falling 15%, Equities 
c.30% and GBP depreciating c.10% vs 
USD), while the longevity stress combined 
a significant longevity risk event emerging 
over 3 years (e.g. medical advancement) 
with a 100bps fall in yields. The analysis 
concluded that the severity of these stresses 
was not sufficient to reduce Phoenix Group’s 
capital coverage to close to SCR. 

A severe scenario testing a combination  
of all risks within the internal model was  
also considered and showed the severity  
of stress required to reduce the Group’s 
capital coverage to the Recovery Zone  
and also the severity of event needed  
to reduce capital coverage to close to  
SCR. This informed the Group Recovery  
Plan which also included an extreme  
liquidity event and a range of contingency 
actions that could be used to recover.  
These scenarios are deemed extreme  
and the Recovery Plan demonstrated  
the ability to restore coverage above  
risk appetites. 

Over 2023, we have continued to embed 
climate scenario analysis within the Group’s 
stress and scenario testing programme  
and carried out a range of quantitative  
and qualitative scenario analysis. The results 
show that although how and when climate 
risk could crystallise continues to be highly 
uncertain, it could have a significant impact 
on the value of our assets, the assets of  
our customers, our reputation and our 
operations. Phoenix is actively managing  
this risk using a range of actions, including 
gradual decarbonisation of the investment 
portfolio and engagement with key emitters 
within the portfolio, key suppliers, customers 
and policymakers. 

Risk Assessment
The Board reviewed the Group’s  
principal risks and uncertainties as set out  
on pages 50 to 57 of the 2023 Annual Report 
and Accounts, and considered the impacts  
of changes in the related impact assessments 
and the mitigating actions implemented.  
This included an assessment of the potential 
impacts of emerging risks on the Group’s 
business during the viability assessment period. 

As noted in the Risk Management section of 
the Annual Report and Accounts, the Group 
identifies, assesses and manages risk through 
the operation of its Risk Management 
Framework (‘RMF’). The Board approves  
the RMF and monitors its operation against 
established risk appetites through regular 
reporting that comes from across the three 
lines of defence. 

Whilst noting continued macroeconomic 
uncertainty and an evolving political 
and regulatory landscape, the Board will 
continue to monitor risk exposures relative 
to risk appetites to ensure the risks are 
proactively managed and do not present 
a material threat to the Group’s viability. 

2023 Financial Results
The latest financial results for the Group  
as included within the 2023 Annual Report  
and Accounts have been considered as part 
of the assessment. Key factors included:
• The Group’s strong capital position 

with a Solvency II surplus of £3.9 billion 
and a Shareholder Capital Coverage 
Ratio of 176%, providing significant 
headroom above regulatory minimum 
capital requirements and the Group’s 
risk appetite;

• The resilience of the Group’s capital 

position and cash generation to movements
in market factors, as indicated in the 
sensitivity analysis included on page 35, 
which is reflective of the Group’s 
hedging approach;

• Holding company cash of £1.012 million 

at the end of 2023, as well as access to the 
Group’s undrawn £1.25 billion unsecured 
revolving credit facility, provides assurance 
over the Group’s ability to meet mandatory 
obligations as they fall due; 

• The impact of losses on an IFRS basis, 

were considered as part of the assessment. 
It was noted that the Group’s hedging 
approach prioritises the protection of the 
Solvency II capital position and therefore 
the dependable delivery of future cash 
generation. It is accepted that this results 
in volatility in the IFRS metrics, but this was 
not considered to represent a material 
threat to the Group’s viability. 

Statement of Viability
Based on the factors outlined above, the 
output of the Group’s financial projections 
and its resilience under severe but plausible 
stressed conditions, and the management 
the Group’s principal risks and associated 
mitigating actions, the Board has a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three-year period of assessment.

Our values of passion, 
responsibility, growth, 
courage and difference 
are demonstrated 
daily by our colleagues, 
and importantly 
through the leadership 
of the Board.

I am delighted to return as Chair of the 
Group Board (‘Chair’) on 1 December 2023. 
During my sabbatical as Lord Mayor of the 
City of London, Alastair Barbour fulfilled the 
role of Chair with effect from 1 September 
2022 until 30 November 2023. Following  
ten years on the Board, Alastair stepped 
down from the position as Chair of the Group 
Board and Chair of the Nomination Committee 
with effect from 30 November 2023, and 
remained on the Board until 31 December 
2023 to ensure a comprehensive handover.  
I would like to thank Alastair for his 
commitment as Chair during my sabbatical, 
as well as for his enormous contribution and 
support to Phoenix Group throughout his 
tenure. He will be missed as a colleague and 
trusted adviser. His historical knowledge was 
invaluable to the Group Board and the wider 
organisation during my sabbatical, hence his 
tenure beyond the usual nine-year period.

Board activities during 2023
Our strategy is set to ensure we continually 
progress towards the achievement of our 
purpose and aim to provide customers with 
the best possible outcomes. The Board is 
responsible for establishing the strategy 
for the Group, ensuring that this is aligned 
with not only our purpose but also with the 
values and culture of the business. As a 
result of a strong performance, the Board 
has recommended a Final dividend of 
26.65 pence per share, bringing the total 
2023 dividend to 52.65 pence per share. 

There were a number of focus areas for the 
Board again this year, such as the integration 
and completion of SLF of Canada UK Limited 
(‘Sun Life of Canada UK’) from Sun Life 
Financial Inc. acquired in 2022. The Phoenix 
Life Companies Board has worked hard  
to integrate this new acquisition into its 

Before reviewing and approving  
strategic items, the Board must always 
come back to Phoenix Group’s core 
purpose and values.

2024 priorities

During 2024, the Board intends  
to focus on:

• Risk management items.
• Relationship with the regulators.
• Financial framework.

governance framework and current board 
schedule during the year, which has been 
monitored by the Phoenix Group Board.  
The IFRS 17 accounting change has been  
a key focus for Management and in turn the 
Board, in particular its Audit Committee and  
I must thank both the Audit Committee Chair 
and its members for the robust challenge. 

The relationship with our regulators,  
not just in the UK, but also in Ireland and 
Bermuda, is of importance to the Board 
and we receive regular updates from 
our Regulatory Relationships Director to 
understand their views and the impact this 
can have on strategy, a focus at our Strategy 
Day in June. Our Chief Risk Officer plays 
an important part in the delivery of our 
strategy and the Board receives regular 
updates from him. Both Line 1 and 2 opinions 
are provided on all strategic initiatives. 

In addition, Phoenix Group published its  
Net Zero Transition Plan on 24 May 2023. 
The Board wants the execution of our 
strategy to have a positive impact upon  
our Net Zero Transition Plan and climate 
change as a whole. This is just one way  
we can help to provide our customers  
with the best possible outcomes. You can 
find our Net Zero Transition Plan at 
www.thephoenixgroup.com. 

Phoenix Group Holdings plc’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018 (the ‘2018 
Code’) can be found on page 68.

Purpose, values and culture 
Phoenix Group’s purpose is to help  
people secure a life of possibilities. As the 
pensions landscape and societal needs 
evolve, Phoenix Group has an important  

role to play in society through its long-term 
savings and retirement business. Robust  
and purpose-led decision-making from the  
Board and throughout the Group drives 
responsible and sustainable investment,  
a strong sustainability strategy and enables 
long-lasting impact for our customers.  
The Board monitors that purpose and the 
Company’s values regularly throughout the 
execution of its strategy. A proportion of  
the agenda is always dedicated to strategy 
and before reviewing and approving such 
strategic items, the Board must always come 
back to Phoenix Group’s core purpose  
and values. 

The Board’s role is to set the cultural tone 
from the top and act as the guardian of our 
values and culture, which together supports 
our strategy and drives our purpose. We as  
a Board must reinforce our culture and  
values through our conduct, decision-making 
process and the outcomes upon us as a 
Board and the Group’s strategy, which the 
Executive Committee (‘ExCo’) implements. 
The Sustainability Committee monitors 
culture on behalf of the Board and this is 
discussed further on page 107. 

Board review 
This year, the Board effectiveness review  
was undertaken externally by Bvalco Ltd  
(the ‘Board Reviewer’). It conducted a 
number of independent interviews with 
Board members and key stakeholders.  
This review found the Board to be capable, 
reflective and supportive of Phoenix Group’s 
culture. The culture of the Board was  
found to be constructive, challenging  
and respectful. Further information on  
the outcomes of the review can be found  
on pages 78 and 79.

Wider workforce
The Board has particularly enjoyed the 
colleague engagement sessions that have 
taken place during 2023. Meeting both 
members of our graduate programme and 
female colleagues in their 50s, with a focus 
on the working environment, has been 
insightful, especially for our new Board 
members. This is discussed further by 
Maggie Semple, our Designated Non-
Executive Director (‘NED’) for Workforce 
Engagement on pages 108 to 110. Choosing 
two diverse groups of colleagues has helped 
us to understand the opportunities and 
challenges the wider workforce faces at 
Phoenix Group. Through Maggie’s work as 
Designated NED for Workforce Engagement, 
the Board has been able to implement some 
outcomes which we hope will enhance the 
working environment for our colleagues and 
reach Phoenix Group’s strategic ambition  
to be the “best place any of us have ever 
worked”. The process of feedback between 
Maggie Semple and the Board following 
sessions with the Phoenix Colleague 
Representation Forum (‘PCRF’) has also  
been enhanced to ensure outcomes are 
discussed at Board level and appropriate 
actions are taken. 

Our colleagues are not our only 
stakeholders and the Board is mindful of 
all our stakeholders when making decisions. 
This is further explained on pages 74 to 77 
by demonstrating any impact on Board 
decisions as a result of engagement 
of our stakeholders. You will see that, 
as a regulated business, our customer 
outcomes and Consumer Duty have 
received greater focus during 2023. 

Board changes
During the year, there were a number of 
changes to the Board. Mark Gregory joined 
the Phoenix Group Board on 1 April 2023.  
He possesses a wealth of experience in  
the insurance, financial services and retail 
sectors, having worked as Group CFO at 
Legal & General Group plc and through 
non-executive roles, including at Direct Line 
Insurance Group plc. He has made a strong 
contribution to date, not only as a member  
of the Risk Committee, but also an attendee 
and now member of the Audit Committee 
with effect from 1 January 2024. David  
Scott was nominated as the shareholder 
representative of abrdn plc (‘abrdn’) on 
11 May 2023 in accordance with the terms  
of the relationship agreement between 
Phoenix Group and abrdn. The previous 
Shareholder Nominated Director 
representing abrdn was Stephanie Bruce 
whose contribution to the Board since  
joining on 1 July 2022 was excellent and also  
helped to enhance diversity on the Board. 
Finally, Eleanor Bucks joined the Phoenix 
Group Board on 1 December 2023. Eleanor 
is an actuary with strong asset management 
and financial services experience and brings 
a fresh skillset and capability to the Board  
as well as broader diversity. You can find  
the Board’s skills matrix on page 89 and 
Directors’ biographies on pages 64 to 67. 

Kory Sorenson reached her nine-year 
tenure on the Phoenix Group Board on 
30 June 2023. She had been Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee for the 
past five years and was succeeded in that 
appointment by Nicholas Shott on 4 May 
2023 following the 2023 Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’). Nicholas has been a 
member of the Remuneration Committee 
since 2016. Kory provided a diligent 
handover to Nicholas and the Board is 
grateful for her robust challenge, knowledge 
and tenacity over the years, in particular 
during challenging times such as COVID-19. 

Diversity and inclusion 
The Phoenix Group Board had 36% female 
Board representation, three ethnic minority 
Board members and a female Senior 
Independent Director at 31 December 2023. 
The Nomination Committee report explains 
further the reason for these results and its 
aim to comply with the Listing Rules. As ever, 
there is always more to do and we are mindful 
of diversity when succession planning 
for those appointments we can control. 
Succession planning remains a focus for 
some of our longer serving Board members, 
but also for our Executive Directors and 
ExCo members. The Talent and Succession 
Plan was reviewed during 2023 for Executive 
Directors and the ExCo members and will 
continue to be a key matter for 2024. 

Board schedule
I work closely with our Group Company 
Secretary to plan the Board schedule well  
in advance of the year. Each meeting is 
balanced with governance, strategy 
including Environmental, Social and 
Governance (‘ESG’), financial performance 
and emerging matters as regular items.  
The Board as a whole places great 
importance on promoting the success  
of the Company. Each member must have 
sufficient time to devote to the Board  
in order to contribute fully to meetings  
and the operation of its Committees as 
discussed further on page 87. During the 
year, additional meeting time may be  
needed and I am pleased that each Director 
endeavours to be available as and when 
required. Alastair Barbour was particularly 
grateful to those Directors who found 
additional meeting time for the 
implementation of the IFRS 17 standard  
and related education sessions. 

Keeping the Board abreast of key areas of 
focus for the Company is important and the 
Board as a whole takes comfort from the 
education sessions Phoenix Group provides. 

Each member must have sufficient  
time to devote to the Board in order 
to contribute fully to meetings.

Education sessions are a significant part of 
our Board calendar and are often facilitated 
by external providers or Management 
outside of the Board meeting schedule to 
ensure the required focus and attention is 
given to the sessions. During 2023, education 
sessions were held on topics such as the 
Annual Operating Plan (‘AOP’) 2023, key 
projects, IFRS 17, the customer view (of 
particular importance for Phoenix Group 
with the implementation of Consumer Duty 
by the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’)) 
and the Net Zero Transition Plan that was 
published in May 2023. The Remuneration 
Committee introduced its first focused 
education session facilitated by its external 
adviser, PwC, and supported by the 
Executive Reward Director which was well 
received by all members. Please see pages 
80 and 81 for education sessions delivered  
in 2023 and any outcomes. 

Annual General Meeting 
In 2023, Phoenix Group was pleased to 
return to an ‘in person’ AGM. This allowed  
the Board to meet and greet our shareholders 
face-to-face and to answer any questions. 
During 2023, the Board and Committee 
Chairs met with our largest shareholders, 
representing approximately 43% of our 
share register. In his capacity as Chair of the 
Group Board, Alastair Barbour met with nine 
shareholders, representing approximately 
41% of our share register in January 2023  
to discuss the 2023 annual institutional 
roadshow. The Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee engaged with a broader group  
of shareholders representing approximately 
70% of our share register to discuss the  
2023 Remuneration policy that was then 
approved with a 98% vote in favour by our 
shareholders at the AGM on 4 May 2023. 

As Chair of the Group Board, I undertook  
the Group’s annual institutional roadshow 
during February 2024, which is intended  
to reinforce the dialogue with our major 
shareholders, particularly concerning 
corporate governance issues. I met with  
12 of Phoenix Group’s largest shareholders 
who in aggregate own approximately  
45% of the Company’s issued share capital.  
The meetings covered a range of topics, 
including the strategic progress and  
outlook of the Company, the Board’s 
effectiveness review and the recent  
share price performance. 

The Board was pleased with the support 
from Phoenix Group’s shareholders 
throughout 2023 and we hope to receive 
similar support in 2024. As ever, the Board is 
here to engage and respond to any questions 
our shareholders or stakeholders may have.

Corporate governanceCorporate governanceBoard leadership and Company purpose continued
Compliance during 2023 with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 
(the ‘2018 Code’).

The Board continues to robustly assess its compliance with the 2018 Code. The Group Company Secretary has supported a full review  
of compliance since her appointment in 2022 and has identified areas for enhancement against the provisions.

Areas for enhancement

Provision or principle

Action currently undertaken 

Enhancement for 2024

L. Annual evaluation of the Board should consider 
its composition, diversity and how effectively 
members work together to achieve objectives. 
Individual evaluation should demonstrate whether
each director continues to contribute effectively. 

41. There should be a description of the work of 
the Remuneration Committee in the Annual Report, 
including: what engagement with the workforce has 
taken place to explain how executive remuneration 
aligns with wider company pay policy.

Individual formal evaluation was included as part  
of the 2023 effectiveness review, but this was less 
formal in previous years.

Individual evaluation will continue to form part of the  
formal internal effectiveness reviews from 2024 onwards.

The Company provided an intranet announcement  
to the wider workforce on how executive 
remuneration aligns with the wider workforce  
pay policy following the approval of the 2023 
Directors’ Remuneration policy at the AGM on  
4 May 2023. It outlined the changes to the policy 
and how Directors’ remuneration as a whole  
aligned with the wider workforce. 

Following a Board education session on 2 October 2023,  
it was decided that Maggie Semple would become a member 
of the Remuneration Committee on 1 January 2024. This 
would allow her to discuss the alignment of Directors’ pay 
with the wider workforce and when appropriate get input 
from the wider workforce on any changes to the Directors’ 
Remuneration policy or remuneration outcomes in her role 
as Designated NED for Workforce Engagement and her 
work with the PCRF.

Division of responsibilities

Clear roles and responsibilities to drive 
forward our purpose and strategy

The Directors understand their role as 
individuals, and as a collective, to ensure 
the long-term success of the Company and 
achievement of Phoenix Group’s purpose.
The Board ensures the appropriate 
division of responsibilities on the Board. 

The Board ensures that there is no existence 
of unfettered power nor over-reliance 
on any one person. The independence 
of Directors not only supports good 
governance, but also facilitates diversity 
of thought and inclusion on the Board. 

The Board considers all NEDs to 
be independent, except for the

and the Chair of the Group Board.

The Board considers the following NEDs  
to be independent:

Maggie Semple is the Designated NED for 
Workforce Engagement.

• Eleanor Bucks
• Karen Green
• Mark Gregory
• Katie Murray
• John Pollock
• Belinda Richards
• Maggie Semple
• Nicholas Shott

As at 21 March 2024, 62% of the Board are 
considered to be independent. The Board uses  
the independence criteria as set out in the 2018 
Code to assess and confirm independence.

The Designated NED for Workforce Engagement  
is responsible for:

•  acting as the primary Board contact in facilitating 

and developing communication between 
colleagues across the Group and the Board;
• providing the Employee Voice to the Board 

by raising relevant matters, or issues of 
concern, highlighted by engagement with 
the workforce; and

• challenging the Executive Directors, as needed, 
as to the way in which workforce engagement 
is undertaken and steps taken to address 
workforce concerns.

Hiroyuki Iioka and David Scott are Shareholder 
Nominated Directors. Hiroyuki Iioka is appointed  
to the Board on behalf of MS&AD and David Scott  
is appointed to the Board on behalf of abrdn.

In accordance with the Phoenix Group acquisition 
of ReAssure from Swiss Re in July 2020, MS&AD 
was entitled to appoint a representative NED to the 
Phoenix Group Board. A relationship agreement 
between Phoenix Group and abrdn includes the 
right for abrdn to appoint a representative NED, 
provided abrdn continues to hold 10% or more  
of Phoenix Group’s shares.

of the Chair, CEO, SID and Designated NED for 
Workforce Engagement are available on the

Independence
During the year, the Nomination Committee 
assessed the independence of the NEDs to 
ensure that they are able to properly fulfil their 
roles on the Board and provide constructive 
challenge to the Executive Directors. 

The independence criteria set out in the 
2018 Code was taken into account as part  
of the selection process for Mark Gregory 
and Eleanor Bucks who joined Phoenix 
Group during 2023, both of whom were 
considered to be independent.

During 2023, the Committee determined 
that all NEDs were free from any relationship 
or circumstances that could affect, or appear 
to affect, their independent judgement.  
In line with the 2018 Code, over half of  
our Board members, excluding the Chair,  
are independent NEDs. The Shareholder 
Nominated Directors, Hiroyuki Iioka and 
David Scott, do not meet the independence 
criteria under the 2018 Code. The Chair  
of the Group Board, Nicholas Lyons,  
is not considered to be independent on  
his re-appointment, having previously  
held the role from 2018 to 2022 before  
his sabbatical but was independent on  
his original appointment. 

Conflicts of interest
A register of conflicts of interest is 
maintained by the Group Company 
Secretary. Each Director has a duty under 
the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a situation 
in which they have or may have a direct 
or indirect interest that conflicts or might 
conflict with the interests of the Company. 

If any Director becomes aware of any 
situation which might give rise to a conflict  
of interest, they must, and do, inform the  
rest of the Board immediately and the Board  
is then permitted under the Company’s 
Articles of Association to authorise such 
conflict. This information is then recorded  
in the Company’s Register of Conflicts, 
together with the date on which authorisation 
was given. In addition, each Director certifies 
on an annual basis that the information 
contained in the Register of Conflicts  
is correct and completes an annual 
questionnaire to ensure any conflict  
of interest has been disclosed.

When the Board decides whether or not to 
authorise a conflict, only the Directors who 
have no interest in the matter are permitted 
to participate in the discussion and a conflict 
is only authorised if the Board believes 
that it would not have an impact on the 
Board’s ability to promote the success of 
the Company in the long-term. Additionally, 
the Board may determine that certain 
limits or conditions must be imposed when 
giving authorisation. At 31 December 2023, 
no actual conflicts have been identified 
which have required approval by the Board. 
However, the situations that could potentially 
give rise to a conflict of interest have been 
identified and duly authorised by the Board 
and are reviewed at least on an annual basis. 
Due care and process is, of course, applied in 
respect of the two Shareholder Nominated 
Directors for abrdn and MS&AD and when 
the Group CEO and Group CFO declare 
any conflict relating to their appointments 
on subsidiary boards of the Phoenix Group.

Outside directorships
Executive Directors are encouraged to  
serve as NEDs of external companies, 
dependent upon time commitment in 
accordance with the 2018 Code. Andy 
Briggs is a board member of the Association 
of British Insurers and is the UK Government’s 
Business Champion for Older Workers. 
Rakesh Thakrar is a NED, Chair of the 
Audit Committee and member of the Risk 
Committee of Bupa Insurance Services 
Limited and Bupa Insurance Limited. 

Re-appointment of Directors
In accordance with the 2018 Code,  
all Directors offer themselves individually  
to shareholders for initial election or 
re-election annually, unless retiring 
immediately following the AGM. 

Independent advice
All Directors have access to the advice  
and services of the Group Company

2023 Board and Committee meeting attendance

The Board met formally seven times during 
2023, including a two-day strategy setting 
meeting. The Board met additionally for 
regular briefing meetings to continue 
to monitor the volatile macro-economic 
environment and oversight of the Group’s 
strategic objectives. The Board continued 
with the briefing calls that were set up 
during the pandemic as they serve as a 
valuable bridge outside of formal Board 
meetings and often facilitate education 

sessions. Additional meetings have also 
been held in respect of M&A activity.
The NEDs met with the Chair of the  
Group Board on at least seven occasions 
without Executive Directors present, which 
normally take place at each Board meeting. 

The following Board and Board 
Committee attendance table below 
details all formal Board and Board 
Committee meetings held during 2023. 

Board members are expected to  
attend all formal Board meetings  
with the aim of 100% attendance.

Corporate governanceCorporate governanceStakeholder engagement 
Stakeholder engagement from the top

Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) 
requires each director of a company to act in  
the way they consider, in good faith, would most 
likely promote the success of the company for  
the benefit of its members as a whole.

The Directors have applied Section 172 
of the Act in a manner consistent with the 
Group’s purpose, values and strategic 
priorities, having due regard to the Group’s 
ongoing regulatory responsibilities as a 
financial services operation. To support 
the fulfilment of the Directors’ duties 
outlined above, each paper prepared for 
consideration by the Board contains an 
analysis of the potential impact of proposals 
to be considered by the Board considering 
the factors contained in Section 172.

Page 77 contains examples of key decisions 
of the Board, their alignment to the Group’s 
strategy, how the Board reached its decision 
(including consideration of matters set out 
in Section 172; the interests of stakeholders; 
related risks and opportunities; and 
challenges it faced) and the outcome of 
those considerations. The examples shown 
are provided to demonstrate how the 
Directors of the Company have carried out 
their duties under Section 172 of the Act.

Board discussion and decision-making
During their discussions, the Board provides 
rigorous risk management, assessment and 
challenges Senior Management to ensure 
a decision promotes long-term, sustainable 
success for the Group and that all relevant 
stakeholders have been appropriately 
considered. See page 77 for examples. 

Monitoring
The Board receives regular updates on 
 key actions taken from outcomes. This is 
done through regular reports from Senior 
Management at each Board meeting, and if 
necessary, verbal updates are also provided. 

S.172 Key to decision criteria
A. Likely consequences of any decisions 

in the long-term. 
Interests of the Company’s employees.
B.
C. Need to foster the Company’s business 
relationships with suppliers, customers, 
and others.
Impact of the Company’s operations 
on the community and the environment.
E. Desirability of the Company maintaining 

D.

a reputation for high standards of 
business conduct.

F. Need to act fairly between members 

of the Company.

Setting our culture, values and strategy
The Board sets the strategic direction, 
culture and values for Phoenix Group; 
these are key to how we do business 
and how we achieve our purpose.

Diverse set of skills, knowledge 
and experience
The Phoenix Group Directors collectively 
have a diverse set of skills, knowledge, 
experience and stakeholder expertise  
which assists the Board in making decisions. 
This contributes to their ability to make 
well-informed decisions which, in turn, 
promotes long-term, sustainable success  
for all stakeholders. As part of their induction 
when joining the Group, all Directors  
receive a detailed briefing on their duties  
as a Director.

Board information
At each Board meeting, detailed papers 
from Management are submitted. These 
provide information on the likely long-term 
impacts of decisions on stakeholders and 
how they have been considered during 
the discussion process, including any 
engagement with relevant groups. See 
pages 74 to 77 for further information. 
The Board also has an annual schedule 
of ‘Board education’ topics where the 
Board, in collaboration with Senior 
Management, establish key activities that 
will be undertaken during the coming 
year and arrange for Heads of Functions 
to deliver education sessions which feed 
into the decision-making process.

risks related to suppliers, including the potential for poor 
customer service and risks connected with the migration 
of acquired books of business. Such monitoring included
discussions with regulators to ensure clarity of 
Phoenix Group’s focus on positive customer outcomes.
• The Board Risk Committee received updates from the 
Group Chief Risk Officer (‘CRO’) on service levels 
provided by suppliers and considered fulfilment 
of Service Level Agreement terms in the year, 
with detailed oversight of customer service being 
undertaken by the subsidiary board for the Life 
Companies and its committees.

The Board’s role in promoting positive stakeholder relationships

The Board held Management to account throughout  
the year, ensuring due care and attention was given  
to customer outcomes and needs, especially in the 
context of implementing the new regulations required 
for Consumer Duty.

The reward of the Executive Directors include customer 
metrics which they measure against as part of the 
Annual Incentive Plan (‘AIP’).Please see page 120  
of the Directors’ Remuneration report.

The Board, via regular reports from the Board Risk 
Committee, scrutinises the performance of key suppliers 
to ensure Phoenix Group can provide the best customer 
outcomes to deliver its operational and financial targets. 
Ensuring that relationships with suppliers are mutually 
beneficial and progressive is essential to the success  
of both Phoenix Group and our suppliers.

Colleagues

A, B, D, E, F

Phoenix Group takes great pride in being a  
people business and engagement with our 
stakeholders is through its people. Our colleagues 
are, therefore, vital for the Group and to the 
achievement of our strategic priorities and 
long-term success. Their dedication, commitment 
and capabilities are integral to the Group’s success. 

Oversight of our culture, purpose, values and 
colleague initiatives is a core focus for the Board. 
The Board considers colleagues in the widest sense, 
including the Group’s relationships with its pension 
schemes and members who are former colleagues 
as well as members of the Group’s workforce  
who are not employed directly by the Group.

• Members held regular colleague engagement
sessions and met with a range of colleagues, 
listening to their views, ideas and experiences. 
This input was then used to assist the Board 
decision-making process.

• Received updates on colleague wellbeing and 
engagement levels from the regular employee 
surveys completed by colleagues throughout 
the year. 

• Monitored the impact of projects and the Group’s 
change agenda on colleagues, including potential 
areas of stretch on resource. 

• Together with the Board Sustainability Committee 
received updates from the Designated NED for 
Workforce Engagement following engagement 
sessions with colleagues, including meetings with 
the PCRF. 

• Additional information on colleague engagement

can be found on pages 108 to 110.

The Board strongly believes in leading by example 
and sets the cultural tone from the top, engaging 
with colleagues (both directly and indirectly) which 
is key to ensuring positive relationships. Two-way 
engagement, via the Designated NED for Workforce 
Engagement and the PCRF, gives colleagues  
a direct link to the Group Board to keep them 
informed on how the Board is driving Group strategy 
while enabling the Board to stay connected to what’s 
important to colleagues and how the decisions it 
makes impact their working lives.

The Board takes its responsibilities seriously in 
promoting positive stakeholder relationships  
and has included People metrics in the reward 
framework for Executive Directors; further details 
on the outcomes against these metrics can be  
found in the Directors’ Remuneration report on 
page 111 to 140.

We are working collaboratively to drive a stable investment 
policy that enables us to invest at scale in productive assets 
to support economic growth, levelling up and the climate 
change agenda. This benefits customers and their 
communities in the short and longer term.

Our investors continue to be crucial to the growth and 
achievements of the Group. Phoenix Group is dedicated 
to delivering long-term value to our shareholders and 
intends to provide a dividend that is sustainable and 
grows over time.

Building trust and inspiring confidence through 
community engagement and partnerships is important 
to the Board for the continued good reputation of the 
Group. To achieve this, we are expanding our work on 
nature, by setting out priority areas of focus to drive on 
nature investment opportunities.

The Board is cognisant of the value our investors  
add to safeguarding the Group’s governance through 
monitoring of performance and engagement with  
the Board throughout the year.

Phoenix Group is the UK’s largest long-term savings 
and retirement business and is subject to both 
financial services regulations and to listed entity 
regulation. The way we operate and interact with  
our regulators provides the trust and reassurance 
needed by stakeholders to enable Phoenix Group  
to deliver its purpose. 

The Board recognises the importance of maintaining 
positive relationships with the UK Government, 
trade bodies and regulators to enable the Group  
to communicate the views and concerns of our 
customers and society generally, while providing 
reassurance to customers that Phoenix Group is 
transparent and compliant with all its transactions.

Link to strategic priorities

How the Board reached its decision

Consideration of Section 172 matters 

During the year, the Board considered the steps necessary for the implementation of the new Consumer Duty regulations, which came/will 
come into force in July 2023 for open book products and July 2024 for closed book ones. 

The Board identified customers, colleagues, investors, regulators and community as key stakeholders in the decision-making process. 
Discussions of the potential risks and opportunities for each category of stakeholders were considered throughout the process. 

The Consumer Duty programme had been established within the Life Companies, with the Life Companies Board acting as the key decision-making 
forum for material decisions, as well as overseeing progress to the regulatory deadline in July 2024. As a result, the Life Companies Board and 
Group Board Risk Committee received regular updates on progress, with Rosie Harris, NED on the Life Companies Board, appointed as the 
Group’s NED sponsor for this work. Consumer Duty, however, is a significant programme of work for the Group and the changes introduced  
by the programme had the potential to have a material impact on the Group, and as a flagship initiative by the FCA to enhance standards  
across the industry and increase levels of consumer protection, it was therefore important that the Group Board was appropriately engaged  
in the programme.

While the Life Companies, as the regulated entities, are accountable for the successful delivery of the Consumer Duty programme, there are  
a number of sections where it is appropriate for the Group Board to have oversight to ensure the best outcome for all stakeholders. 

These sections are that the Group Board:
•  approves the overall strategy in pursuit of good customer outcomes, and should be kept informed of key developments;
•

is provided with regular updates to ensure it is satisfied that the Life Companies Board have reviewed and fulfilled their Directors’ duties 
and are meeting the compliance requirements of Consumer Duty;
is made aware of, and provided with all relevant information regarding any matters relating to the Consumer Duty programme which trigger 
the Matters Reserved for the Board; and

• Formally met with the FCA and Prudential 

Regulation Authority (‘PRA’) during the year

each regulators’ strategic objectives and routine 
regulatory matters.

• Both the FCA and PRA requested more formal 
meetings with certain Board Directors and 
Senior Managers as part of their respective 
supervisory strategies.

• Continually challenged Management on ensuring 
that Phoenix Group maintains open and honest 
dialogue with the FCA, PRA, Central Bank 
of Ireland, The Pensions Regulator and other 
jurisdictional regulators. 

The Board’s role in promoting positive stakeholder relationships

The Board monitors investor sentiment and feedback 
throughout the year to ensure the Group can respond 
to investor concerns, which is key to the success of 
the Group. 

The Board also ensures that the Group’s strategy and 
purpose are set to ensure the long-term success of the 
business and generation of value for shareholders.

As the Group’s custodian, ensuring robust 
governance, controls and risk management, 
the Board is responsible for holding Management 
to account for the day-to-day compliance with 
regulation and legislation; ensuring transparent 
communication of such compliance to maintain 
trust in Phoenix Group. The SID is also available  
to meet shareholders as she did in 2023.

The Board, through the Board Sustainability Committee, 
has monitored Management’s engagement activities 
with our communities and the environment, ensuring 
that the Group is able to fulfil its purpose and colleagues 
have the opportunity to participate in charitable giving 
and volunteering both within their communities and also 
with environmental projects. It is the Board’s role to hold 
Management to account in maintaining sufficient 
resources needed to support our communities.

Reaching our Net Zero Transition Plan ambitions 
features highly on the Board’s agenda through the 
Sustainability Committee and metrics are included in 
the reward framework. For further details see page 117  
of the Directors’ Remuneration report.

• as Consumer Duty is a material programme for the Group, the Group Board should have oversight of the overall progress of the work and 

assurance that the Group is adhering to the spirit of the rules.

To ensure that it was fully aware of its responsibilities to the Group regarding the Consumer Duty programme, the Group Board undertook  
a formal training sessions arranged by the Group Company Secretary and delivered by the Chief Risk Officer for the Life Companies.

Outcome

Following due consideration of all the matters set out in Section 172 of the Act, the Group Board agreed that it would receive regular updates  
via the Group CEO report, and regular training sessions would be scheduled on material matters as they arose.

During the year, the Board was required to monitor the implementation of the new accounting standard IFRS 17 for insurance contracts issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Boards (‘IASB’). This supports efficient risk management and allows stakeholders to gain important 
insights into the entity’s business model, exposures, and performance. As this was a new accounting standard, the Board dedicated significant 
time to the matter to ensure that regulatory deadlines were met for the successful announcement of the Half Year 2023 results, which would 
have a positive outcome for customers, investors, regulators and colleagues. 

This required the following steps to be taken at meetings held during 2023:
• Consideration of the impact of work required for this project on others within the Group, due to the significant internal resources required 

to ensure delivery. The Board was required to consider other projects in the pipeline and the impact on colleagues to ensure a balanced and 
manageable workload for all.

• Successful execution of the plan would be based on careful management of a number of key operational risks. The risks relating to 

judgements or technical assumptions were considered and Management regularly reported the results of testing through the Transition 
Balance Sheet and Comparatives process.

• Regular updates were received from both the Board Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee to ensure that all steps and risks were 

being carefully monitored and progress was appropriately reported to the Group Board to enable its decision-making process.

• Updates were provided at every meeting throughout the year from Management.

To ensure that it was fully aware of its responsibilities to the Group regarding the implementation of the IFRS 17 standard, the Group Board 
undertook several formal training sessions delivered by the Group CFO and Heritage CEO.

Outcome

Following due consideration of all the matters set out in Section 172 of the Act, the Board announced the Half Year 2023 results in September 
2023. In addition, significant time was spent during Board meetings discussing the project’s progress, receiving frank reports from Management. 
As a result, consideration was given to customers, investors, colleagues, government bodies and regulators, together with the wider market,  
to ensure that suitable triggers were in place to take action based on investor sentiment.

Board review

Following internal Board effectiveness reviews in 2021 and 2022, an external 
Board effectiveness review was facilitated by the Board Reviewer in 2023.  
The Board confirms the external Board Reviewer has no other connection  
with Phoenix Group or individual Directors. Its work is guided by a Code of 
Practice published by the Board Effectiveness Guild of which it is a member.

External Board review process:

1. The format and scope of the review 

were discussed by the Board Reviewer, 
the Chair of the Group Board and the 
Group Company Secretary, the Senior 
Independent Director and the 
Committee Chairs. 

2. The Board Reviewer sent a questionnaire, 
firstly reviewed and approved by the 
Chair of the Group Board and Group 
Company Secretary, to every member 
of the ExCo, Board and the Group 
Company Secretary. 

3. Each member of the ExCo, the NEDs, 
the Chair of the Group Board and 
the Group Company Secretary had 
a confidential interview with the Board 
Reviewer to thoroughly discuss their 
answers to the questionnaire and any 
other topics individuals felt were pertinent.

4. The external Board Reviewer observed 
the meetings held on 2 and 3 October 
2023, which included reviewing the 
Board and Committee papers for 
those meetings. 

5.  Draft reports were circulated to the 
Chair of the Group Board and each 
Committee Chair, noting that the 
October Remuneration Committee 
meeting was an education session. 
These were then individually discussed 
with each Chair. 

6. Observations were presented at 

the November Board and Committee 
meetings by the Board Reviewer. 
Results and potential actions were 
discussed at each Committee meeting. 

7. The Group Company Secretary, or her 
designate, worked with each individual 
Chair of the Committees to finalise 
actions and any potential 2024 education 
sessions. These were then added to 
the 2024 education session calendar. 
Actions were approved at the early 
February 2024 meeting and will be 
monitored by the Board and Committees 
throughout the year. 

Board review
The 2023 Board effectiveness review concluded that the Board is capable, hard-working with a large workload, is reflective and has strong 
360-degree challenge between both Non-Executive Directors and Management. It scored itself as effective, whilst acknowledging there 
was always room for improvement to maintain high performance. The 2023 review by the Board Reviewer concluded that the Board and its 
Committees operated and were chaired effectively. However, the Board Reviewer did identify a few areas for enhancement for the Board 
and these are highlighted below:

Action 1

Action 2

Action 3

Action 4

Management to continue  
to consult with the NED’s in 
preparation of the annual 
strategy session to ensure 
that extensive experience  
of strategy development  
on the Board is leveraged 
appropriately.

The Chair of the Group 
Board, Group Chief 
Executive Officer, Group 
Company Secretary and 
Committee Chairs to ensure 
adequate time is given to 
debate strategic objectives.

The Chair of the Group 
Board to continue to  
provide regular individual 
performance feedback to 
each Director as appropriate 
and at least annually. 

Continued Board focus on  
key material and relevant  
issues with support from the 
Chair of the Group Board. 
To enhance the timeliness 
and succinctness of papers.

Committees’ effectiveness
The Committees’ effectiveness review was 
undertaken as part of the Board review 
process and concluded that they operate 
effectively and Chairs performed strongly. 
All duties set out in the Committees’ Terms of 
References were addressed during the year. 
The areas of enhancement for Committees 
for 2024 are set out in each committee report 
in a similar format to the previous page for ease. 

Individual effectiveness
Executive Directors are evaluated annually  
to ensure they have performed against  
their strategic targets (see page 114 of the 
Directors’ Remuneration report ). The Group 
Company Secretary was appointed on  
1 April 2022 to ensure Phoenix Group’s 
governance is in line with its FTSE 100 peers. 
It has become apparent that compliance with 

Principle L of the 2018 Code could be 
enhanced. Therefore, NEDs will be subject  
to a formal and rigorous individual evaluation 
as part of both internal and external evaluations 
going forward. As part of this process, the 
Board Reviewer appraised each Director’s 
performance, this was reviewed by the  
Chair and then discussed with each Director. 
The Board Reviewer found the Board to be 
effective and individuals specifically provided 
strong support, belief and optimism in the  
Phoenix Group strategy. 

Assessment of the Chair’s performance
Feedback was provided by the Board,  
ExCo and Group Company Secretary on the 
effectiveness of the Chair, who was found to 
be thorough, competent and unhindered by 
the interim nature of his role. He was found  
to be capable of both challenging 

Management whilst also being a critical 
friend when required. Alastair Barbour made 
a seamless transition from Non-Executive 
Director to Chair of the Group Board during 
2023 and back again to provide Nicholas 
Lyons with a diligent handover, providing the 
Board with much confidence. The Board  
has valued Alastair’s challenge, leadership, 
inclusivity and support for all Directors,  
and of course, his historical knowledge. 

The 2022 Board review 
The 2022 Board review was internally facilitated by the then Chair of the Group Board, Alastair Barbour, who was supported by the Group 
Company Secretary. The following progress against actions identified during that review has taken place during 2023:

Action identified

Action taken

Strategic Topics – further deep dives into the Open Business,  
including the existing European business strategy.

Education/Training – determination of the topics to be included  
in 2023 and ensure compliance/regulatory required matters are  
covered in the most efficient manner. 

Colleague Engagement – to enhance colleague engagement for 
Directors working with the Designated NED for Workforce Engagement.

This was an agenda item at the Strategy Day in June. 

An annual education/training plan was agreed on regular training 
sessions for the Board during 2023 and included the Annual Operating 
Plan 2023, various projects, IFRS 17, the customer view, Internal Model, 
Net Zero Transition Plan, as well as mandatory training. 

The Board met colleagues in May and November 2023. The first 
session was with graduates and the second was with female 
colleagues over 50. See pages 108 to 110 for more details. 

Talent and Succession Planning – closer focus as the Group continues  
to build its capabilities and strengthens the succession pipeline. 

A review of talent and succession planning was undertaken twice  
in 2023. A talent grid has been developed for consideration.

Board Information – ongoing improvement in the quality and content  
of information to the Board, building on the progress made in 2022.

The paper template was further enhanced, and the Company 
Secretariat Team provided education sessions to colleagues on  
how to draft good quality papers.

Scoring by NEDs when interviewing candidates had  
to be consistent.

Focusing on continuous improvement through HR reviewing the scoring process, incorporating feedback from 
the last recruitment campaign to ensure it was relevant for the skills and experience being sought, whilst ensuring 
consistent assessment for all candidates. The scoring methodology was being updated to encompass learnings 
from the recruitment campaigns undertaken in 2023 and would ensure appropriateness for the next campaign. 

The Committee also received education sessions as shown on pages 80 to 81.

Board succession
During 2023, the Committee has remained 
active in its consideration of NED succession, 
which, following further consideration by the 
Board, has led to:
•

the appointment of Nicholas Lyons on 
1 December 2023 following his return from 
sabbatical between 1 September 2022 
and 30 November 2023 to take on the 
prestigious role of Lord Mayor of the City 
of London. Alastair Barbour was interim 
Chair of the Group Board for that duration. 
During this period, Alastair reached his 
ten-year tenure and therefore retired 
from the Board on 31 December 2023;
the appointment of Mark Gregory to the 
Board and member of the Risk Committee 
on 1 April 2023. Mark was appointed as 
a member of the Audit Committee on 
1 January 2024, in place of Karen Green 
who stepped down on 31 December 2023;
the appointment of Katie Murray as a 
member of the Nomination Committee 
on 29 June 2023;

•

•

•  the appointment of Nicholas Shott as 

Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
on 4 May 2023, following the conclusion 
of the 2023 AGM;

•  support for the appointment of David Scott 
as the Shareholder Nominated Director 
of abrdn on 11 May 2023, adding valuable 
and relevant skills through his role as 
Chief Enterprise Technology Officer, 
having worked in financial services for 
over 35 years;
the appointment of Maggie Semple 
as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee on 1 January 2024; and
the appointment of Eleanor Bucks 
to the Board on 1 December 2023. 

•

•

from the Board and Leadership Team. 
Interviews are also held with the Group 
CEO and Group HR Director as part of  
the process and other members of the 
ExCo as appropriate. 

References are then obtained prior  
to the Committee recommending the 
appointment to the Board. Once the 
Board has approved the recommendation 
a market announcement is made 
immediately, and the onboarding process 
begins. Please see pages 90 to 91 for more 
information on the induction programme.

A similar process is followed for executive 
succession planning, which is undertaken 
by the Committee for Executive Directors 
and for ‘ExCo’ roles to ensure appropriate 
succession in an emergency situation with 
at least one internal successor, who is 
ready now or expected to be ready in one 
to two years. External candidates are also 
included in the process. ExCo succession 
planning remains a focus for 2024, 
considering talent, capabilities and the 
broader diversity agenda. Much work  
has been undertaken to strengthen the 
capabilities and skillset at ExCo level,  
with focus now on successors for  
all ExCo members to ensure there  
is a strong pipeline of talent.

Appointment process
The standard process used by the 
Committee for Board appointments 
involves the use of an external search 
consultancy to source external candidates 
and, in the case of executive appointments, 
also considers internal candidates. A role 
profile is drafted by the Group Company 
Secretary and reviewed for approval by 
the Nomination Committee and other 
members of the ExCo as appropriate.

The Nomination Committee appointed 
Hedley May for the appointment of  
Mark Gregory and Korn Ferry for the 
appointment of Eleanor Bucks.  
Both search firms are signatories to  
the Executive Search Firms’ Voluntary 
Code of Conduct and neither firm had  
any other connections with the Company 
or its Directors during the year.

Detailed assessments of short-listed 
candidates are undertaken by the  
search consultancy and the Committee. 
The Committee requires search firms to 
ensure that both long-lists and short-lists 
are balanced from a diversity and inclusion 
perspective. If not, the Committee will 
insist on a refresh.

Each member of the Nomination 
Committee interviews short-listed 
candidates individually or jointly with  
other members of the Committee.  
A pre-prepared list of questions are  
used to ensure continuity. Interviewers  
are mindful of the skills matrix, diversity  
of thought and how Phoenix Group  
values are demonstrated openly for 
culture fit, which must always come  

Board skills
A Board skills review was undertaken by the 
external Board Reviewer as part of its 2023 
effectiveness review. It concluded that skills 
could be expanded further as well as 
experience in the banking sector, where 
complex transformational experience could  
be advantageous along with a focus on 
digitisation. Eleanor Bucks’ recent appointment 
has brought the wider actuarial and asset 
management financial services experience 
identified by the Board Reviewer. Future 
succession planning will take this criterion 
into account as well as proven experience in 
AI, which will be an imminent requirement. 
Board skills are separated into core and 
secondary skills and can be found on page 89. 

Board diversity
The Board supports and aims to fully comply 
with the FTSE Women Leaders Review 
guidance for FTSE 350 companies,  
which is aligned with the FCA’s Listing Rules  
(LR 9.8.6(9)) on diversity, being: 

• at least 40% of the board are women;
• at least one of the senior board positions 
(chair, chief executive officer, senior 
independent director or chief financial 
officer is a woman); and 

• at least one member of the board is from 

a minority ethnic background.

Gender diversity

As at 21 March 2024, the Board is comprised  
of 38% female Directors. The Board has two 
Shareholder Nominated Directors. The 
Board is unable to choose these candidates 
as these are nominated and therefore is 
unable to influence its composition entirely. 
David Scott from abrdn replaced Stephanie 
Bruce, which has impacted the female 
representation of the Board. The Board  
is comprised of 45% female Directors when 
considering appointments, the Board has 
independently made. 

Senior Management1 ethnic minority 
representation is 13% by 2027 as submitted 
to the Parker Review in December 2023.  
As at 21 March 2024, the Board has three 
members of an ethnic minority background, 
representing 23% of the total Board 
composition. If the Shareholder Nominated 
Directors are excluded, the Board has two 
members of an ethnic minority background 
representing 18% of the total Board 
composition. Further information can be 
found below. 

The Board is mindful that when female 
representation is reported as a whole and 
includes the Shareholder Nominated 
Directors, it falls short of the Listing Rules. 
This will be taken into account when planning 
the succession of retiring Directors over the 
next two years for the appointments that the 
Board can influence from a diversity perspective. 
In relation to the second part of the Listing Rule, 
Karen Green is the Senior Independent 
Director of the Board. Again the Board will 
be mindful of gender diversity when making 
future senior board appointments.

In addition, the Board met the recommendation 
of the Parker Review for FTSE 100 companies 
in relation to there being at least one director 
from an ethnic minority background on the 
Board by 2021. Phoenix Group’s target for 

The Committee has been active in promoting 
gender and ethnic diversity on the Board 
and continues to take an active role in 
oversight and guidance of the executive 
diversity and inclusion process including  
a focus on the development of a diverse 
succession pipeline. Details of the diversity 
and inclusion initiatives for Phoenix Group 
colleagues (including the Executives) are 
contained in the Group’s Sustainability 
Report. The Group’s Senior Management 
gender diversity data (including statutory 
requirements) is contained in the Strategic 
report on page 40.

 In January 2024, Phoenix Group moved from an annual diversity data survey collected via an app to data collection through our internal HR platform.  
This will provide an up-to-date view of the diversity of our colleagues and allow us data analysis on an intersectional basis, providing better data insights than an annual survey.  
Currently the participation rate is 42%. When it is at 50%, high level results can be shared and at 65% detailed data analysis can be provided.  
It is not known when these targets will be hit. A full programme of employment engagement is in place to help colleagues increase its participation.

Nomination Committee report

Board Diversity policy

Board policy

Progress

The Board’s overriding aim is to appoint  
the right Directors to the Board to drive  
forward the Group’s strategy within  
a compliant framework.

During the year, Mark Gregory and Eleanor Bucks joined the Group Board.  
Their experience, background and skills are aligned with the Group’s strategy.  
The Board will endeavour to appoint the right candidate for each Board role  
and consistently seeks to enhance diversity in the broadest sense.

Board policy

Progress

The Board promotes the enhancement of  
diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity,  
as a consideration when recruiting new Directors.

In line with our succession planning processes, we undertake a formal, rigorous and 
transparent search process for each appointment, considering the current balance  
of skills, experience and diversity amongst our Directors. Each appointment is made 
subject to receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals (where required).

The Committee strives to achieve balanced recruitment long-lists demonstrating 
diversity in the broader sense, including gender, ethnicity and other diversity  
attributes and will challenge search firms to ensure this aim is achieved.

Board policy

Progress

The Board intends to comply or explain  
why on a continual basis whether the FTSE  
Women Leaders Review, Listing Rule 9.8.6(9)  
and Parker Review targets have been met:

•

•

that the board should be comprised 
of at least 40% female directors; 
that at least one of the chair, the chief 
executive officer, the senior independent 
director, or the chief finance officer is 
a woman; and

• at least one member of the board is from 
a minority ethnic background as per 
the Parker Review.

As at 21 March 2024:

• Five female Directors representing 38% of Board composition. 
When excluding Shareholder Nominated Directors this is 45%.

• The Senior Independent Director is female.
• Three minority ethnic Directors representing 23% of Board composition. 

When excluding Shareholder Nominated Directors this is 18%. 

• Phoenix Group’s target for ethnic minority representation at Senior Management 

level is 13% by 2027.

Board policy

Progress

The Board will undertake regular skills  
audits to ensure the Board’s skills remain 
appropriate for its strategy and provide  
diversity where possible.

The Board skills review was carried out during 2023 and concluded that enhancing  
the skills in the areas of digitisation and banking transformation would be valuable 
going forward. Other skills such as actuarial and asset management have been 
provided by the recent appointment of Eleanor Bucks. The skills required on the  
Board will be reviewed when considering the replacement of the two Directors due  
to retire in 2025 and the retirement of Alastair Barbour. 

I am pleased to be back in my role  
as Chair of the Group Board and its  
Nomination Committee and look  
forward to a year of continually  
enhancing governance during 2024. 

Nicholas Lyons
Chair

Board independence
With the exception of the Chair of the  
Group Board and Shareholder Nominated 
Directors, all NEDs are considered 
independent in character and judgement. 
The independence criteria set out in the 
2018 Code was taken into account as part  
of the selection process for the NEDs  
who joined Phoenix Group during the year. 
Mark Gregory and Eleanor Bucks were 
considered to be independent. David Scott  
was not considered to be independent  
due to his capacity as a Shareholder 
Nominated Director. Over half of our  
Board members, excluding the Chair of  
the Group Board, are Independent NEDs. 
The independence of NEDs is reviewed  
and confirmed annually by the Committee. 

Additional appointments
If any Director wishes to take on an additional 
external appointment, they are required to 
seek permission from the Board. The Board 
will take into consideration the additional 
time commitments, independence and any 
potential conflicts of interest in relation to the 
Directors’ current roles and responsibilities 
before any permission is given. 

Time commitment
All Directors are expected to commit 
sufficient time to the Board, and the 
Company. Time commitments for Directors 
are reviewed by the Committee on a regular 
basis including prior to recommendation for 
appointment to the Board, on changes in role 
(joining additional Committees or taking on 
further responsibility) and prior to approving 
external appointments. It is expected that  
on average, each of the seven scheduled 
Board meetings is likely to require two days  
of participation (including Committee 
meetings, education sessions, travel and 

Board dinners) and at least a further day  
of preparation time. It is further estimated 
that each Director is required to spend at 
least an additional day each month reviewing 
information supplied by the Company.  
In addition, a two-day strategy session is  
held and there are also regular briefing 
sessions for the Board Committees. On this 
basis, the basic time commitment required  
of each Board member is estimated to be at 
least 40 days each year (unless agreed as  
24 days for a full-time executive undertaking 
a NED role and chairing one Committee). 

The basic time commitment can be significantly 
increased on account of transactional or 
other activity. The Nomination Committee 
confirms that all NEDs have demonstrated 
they have sufficient time to devote to their 
present roles and this has been an area of 
focus during 2023. 

The Group Company Secretary maintains  
a register of Directors’ commitments which  
is regularly reviewed by the Committee.  
As part of the Board review process,  
the Board, supported by the Committee, 
considered each individual Director’s 
attendance, contribution and external 
appointments, and has concluded that the 
time given by individual Directors during 
2023 exceeded the level expected in their 
appointment terms.

The Group Company Secretary completed  
a full review of Directors’ non-listed 
appointments. The following table outlines 
the number of appointments held by Directors.

Board induction
A strong induction programme, including the 
interview process, is integral to a Director’s 
ability to quickly thrive in their role.

The Chair is responsible for leading the 
development of, and monitoring the 
effective implementation of training 
policies and procedures for the Directors. 
On appointment, each Director receives 
a formal and tailored induction. In 
addition, there is a programme of ongoing 
education and deep dives for Directors.

The Directors are committed to their own 
ongoing professional development and  
the Chair of the Group Board discusses 
training with each NED at least annually.  
The Group Company Secretary supports  
the Chair of the Group Board in the oversight 
of the induction and development plans 
for the NEDs following either an internal 
or external Board effectiveness review. 

All NEDs are encouraged to suggest 
training topics of interest and all Directors 
are able to access a Board portal where 
additional resources are available.

Typical induction  
programme features

I’ve had meetings with 
relevant stakeholders,  
who have been transparent 
and given me comfort in 
Phoenix Group, its strategy 
and people.

I felt encouraged by 
Management’s preparation 
and candid response to my 
questions when meeting 
individuals during my 
induction process.

The induction programme at Phoenix Group 
has been well structured and given me a 
strong grounding to confidently commence 
my NED role here. I’ve had meetings  
with relevant stakeholders, who have  
been transparent and given me comfort  
in the Group, its strategy and people. 
Management was open and well-prepared 
for each session and I was provided with 
useful reading material and a detailed 
overview of the key matters for which 
Executives were accountable. For me, joining 
in April and attending the Board Strategy 
Days in June 2023 was extremely helpful.  
I learnt a lot within the two days as I had an 
informal environment to ask lots of questions. 
I tend to join some Committee meetings as  
an attendee to gain as much information to 
help me understand the wider Board matters,  
risks and opportunities, key areas of focus 
and to meet other presenters. I find the 
Phoenix Group offices welcoming when  
I visit outside of the Board schedule,  

which gives me the opportunity to observe 
Phoenix Group’s culture independently  
and to build relationships. 

The schedule of meetings with Senior 
Management and other key internal 
stakeholders was well managed. In addition, 
during my first year of joining the Board,  
I’ve enjoyed the two colleague engagement 
sessions. At the first, I was able to meet some 
Phoenix Group graduates and understand 
their training programme and roles better.  
At the second, our female colleagues who 
were over 50 provided insight into their 
working life at Phoenix Group. The Board 
found both sessions insightful and at the 
same time comforting. It was great to meet 
such different demographics and learn 
about their roles and how the Group was 
providing a clear career path for those  
that wanted it.

I recently joined the Board and both the 
appointment and induction processes were 
seamless. Meeting so many of the Board at 
interview stage helped me form an opinion 
quickly on the culture at Phoenix Group and 
whether this was a company where I felt  
I could add value. 

My induction programme has been well 
structured and the reading material in 
advance comprehensive. There were 
detailed overviews of the key matters  
for which Executives were accountable 
which was useful. I felt encouraged by 
Management’s preparation and candid 
response to my questions when meeting 
individuals during my induction process.  
This is my first listed NED role and it’s 
important to feel supported by the Group 
Company Secretary and other Board 
members, who have all been exemplary.  
I am particularly excited by the two-day 
strategy away day in June 2024. Feedback 
from the external Board review was that this 
provides the time to get to know the Board 
members and Management in a more 

informal environment, being a combination  
of business and relationship immersion.  
This will provide an opportunity to help 
Board members appreciate individual 
strengths and the collective capability  
of the Board which can only ever enhance 
Board performance. It’s encouraging that the 
Board and Phoenix Group are so focused  
on such strategy meetings. I am personally 
excited by the NED mentoring programme  
to those Phoenix Group employees 
identified by Management. 

In addition, meeting the wider workforce  
and supporting the implementation of 
Phoenix Group’s strategic journey will be  
a focus for me in 2024. How sustainability  
is embedded not only into the strategy  
but every day has been a focus for me and  
I enjoyed meeting the Sustainability Team 
soon into my induction. The impact of these 
meetings has enabled me to accelerate my 
understanding of the business, its values  
and culture, key stakeholders, risks and 
opportunities. I look forward to continuing 
my induction during 2024.

Outcomes from Audit Committee discussions 
On an annual basis, a review of the Committee’s activities is undertaken. In 2023, it was concluded that all elements of responsibility detailed  
in the Committee’s Terms of Reference had been addressed. An overview of some of the key activities undertaken during the year and the way  
in which they contributed to important outcomes are detailed in the following table: 

Key activities

Financial reporting

Group CFO update.

Receiving and reviewing the Group’s external Full Year and Half Year  
financial reports.

Outcome 

Implementation of private sessions between the Group CFO and the Committee.

Half Year reporting was impacted by IFRS 17 and this was a major focus for the  
Committee in 2023. Usual Phoenix Group practice is to complete a lessons learnt  
for 2023 following the implementation of such a large project.

Ensuring accounts are fair, balanced and understandable as a whole and 
recommending their approval to the Board, taking into account shareholders’ 
ability to assess the Group’s position, performance, business model and strategy.

Strong challenge from the Committee to ensure the news was balanced with both positive 
and negative news reported. Cash generation was countered by the highlight of total 
funds flow target to provide appropriate balance. 

IFRS 17 accounting standard.

Strong challenge at Half Year 2023 ensuring the process, methodology and assumptions 
were appropriate, ready for Full Year 2023. Three additional ad hoc meetings were held. 

External audit

Outcome

terms of engagement including approval of their fees and non-audit services and for 
reviewing the performance, objectivity and independence of the External Auditor.

Particularly strong challenge from the Committee on the External Auditor’s fees.

Internal control, risk management & compliance 

Outcome

Monitoring the overall integrity of financial reporting by the Company and its 
subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls.

Further enhancement and focus in 2023 and 2024 on internal controls and  
end-to-end processes. Robust challenge to ensure risk management and internal  
controls effectiveness review is appropriate for Provision 29 of the 2024 Code. 

Decided to implement a joint Audit/Risk/Sustainability Committee bi-annually  
to review disclosures and monitor changes in climate risk.

Sustainability Reporting

Outcome

Received and reviewed the Group’s Sustainability and Climate Reports and Net 
Zero Transition Plan published in May 2023.

Education session on the financial impact of new sustainability and climate  
change regulations.

and regulatory review. 

The Committee also received education 
sessions as shown on pages 80 and 81.

Connectivity with other relevant 
Committees 
The following joint Committees promoted 
the sharing of information and best practices. 
The Committees were able to review, 
approve and recommend for Board approval 
the following items: 

Audit and Risk Committees 
• Solvency & Financial Condition Report 

(‘SFCR’) approval (including Risk 
Disclosures in Solvency II Pillar III 
Reporting) – April 2023.

• Own Risk & Solvency Assessment (‘ORSA’)

approval – June 2023. 

Audit, Risk and Sustainability Committees
• Review of Year End 2023 Climate and 
Sustainability Reports – March 2024.

External Auditor
A key part of the role of the Audit Committee 
is the review and oversight of the work of 
the Group’s External Auditor, EY LLP (‘EY’). 
The External Audit partner attended all 
Committee meetings during 2023 and to 
the date of this report, presenting reports 
on the external audit process, IT controls, 
internal controls, audit differences, fraud risk 
areas, audit improvements, planning report, 
any pre-approval for non-audit services 
and the assessments on methodology 
and actuarial assumptions. The External 
Auditor provided details on benchmarking 
with regard to assumptions setting as well 
as challenging and providing guidance 
on reporting matters and disclosure 
requirements. Where necessary, the External 
Auditor challenged Management’s view 
on certain assumptions and reporting 
requirements which were reported to 
and discussed with the Committee.

The Committee reviewed and discussed 
various reports from the External Auditor 
throughout 2023, including the 2023 Audit 
Plan, progress reports against that plan, 
a report on their audit procedures on the 
2022 annual IFRS and Solvency II results, 

their interim review of the Half Year 2023 
IFRS results. EY have provided exceptional 
support and challenge to the Group during 
its transition to IFRS 17 and the collaborative, 
yet robust approach should be commended. 
The Committee considered throughout 
2023 and for the 2023 audit, the effectiveness, 
engagement and remuneration of the current 
External Auditor. The Committee did not 
request the External Auditor to specifically 
audit a certain area of concern during 2023. 

Assessment of the effectiveness of the 
external audit process
Part of the Committee’s role is to oversee 
the Group’s relationship with the External 
Auditor to ensure independence, quality, 
rigour, objectivity and robust challenge of 
the external audit process. The Committee 
does this throughout the year by: 

• Reviewing EY’s UK Audit Quality Reports 
including the FRC’s audit quality review, 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of England and Wales (‘ICAEW’) Quality 
Assurance Department (‘QAD’) review and 
Internal reviews, outlining its response to 
those reviews and actions to be taken. 
Within those reports there is a key focus 

on EY’s people around understanding 
their role, asking for help and resources,  
a review of the detailed Audit Plan and 
consideration of its coverage and approach 
to identified risks.

• Assessing the quality of interactions 
between the Audit Team and the 
Committee, including the provision 
of technical and industry knowledge.

• Considering the level of insight provided 
by the audit findings in the key areas 
of judgement, including quality of 
benchmarking with regard to valuation 
assumptions and supporting analysis, 
and the ability of the Audit Team to 
demonstrate that they had applied 
professional scepticism in their dealings 
with Management.

• Comprehensive assessment and review 
of the External Auditor where feedback 
was received from Life Companies’ 
Directors as well as members of the 
Committee, Management and teams that 
supported the audit such as Group and 
Service company teams, FRC, IT, Internal 
Audit, Tax, Actuarial and Operations.

• Meeting privately with EY to discuss in 

depth its approach to quality assurance 
and internal assurance processes across 
the audit firm that ensure the quality of 
the audit service. These meetings provide 
an opportunity to discuss freely without 
Management present on the most 
significant areas of challenge by EY. 

• Considering the findings of external 

evaluations of EY, notably the findings 
from the FRC’s Audit Quality 
Inspection Report.

• Reviewing the findings from EY’s UK 

2023 Transparency Report which outlines 
the key policies and processes in place 
within EY for maintaining objectivity 
and independence for EY’s year ended 
30 June 2023.

• Reviewing EY’s impact of ISOM1 ensuring 
firms implement an agreed process to 
design, implement and operate a system 
of quality management. Aligning with EY’s 
commitment to deliver high-quality audits 
to serve the public. 

• 

In addition, from 2023 EY have included 
Engagement Level Audit Quality Indicators 
(‘AQIs’). A measure of audit quality, AQIs 
cover topics such as most recent firmwide 
inspection results, hours an audit takes and 
timeliness of reporting. The Committee has 
found this information useful during the 
year to monitor audit quality.

Overall, the Audit Committee concluded  
that EY had carried out its 2022 audit 
effectively. Stakeholders do not review  
the effectiveness of the audit until June  
the following year. The additional criteria 
included in the Minimum Standards for  
Audit Committees published in May 2023 
will be included in the audit review for year 
ended 31 December 2023 which will be 
completed in June 2024.

Independence and objectivity of the 
External Auditor
The External Auditor’s independence  
was reviewed and monitored against the 
Group’s External Auditor policy, including its 
provision of non-audit services. This included 
an assessment of its independence and a 
review of services provided by EY during the 
2022 and 2023 financial years. The Committee 
is satisfied with EY’s objectivity and that EY  
is fully independent from Management and 
free from conflicts of interest. EY continually 
monitors its own independence throughout 
the year and voluntarily brings any potential 
matter to the Committee. EY has confirmed 
that between 1 January 2023 to 21 March 
2024 there were no relationships that would 
be thought to bear on EY’s independence 
and objectivity. It outlines to the Committee 
its independent approach, including threats 
and safeguards when the audit plan for that 
year is approved by the Committee. 

Re-appointment of External Auditor
As previously announced, the Committee 
concluded an audit tender process in 2021 
resulting in KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’) being 
appointed as the Group’s External Auditor 
commencing from the financial period 
starting 1 January 2024. A transition process 
was undertaken from 30 June 2023, including 
regular review meetings with Management, 
EY, Internal Audit and Committee members, 

prior to their formal appointment at the 2024 
AGM on 14 May 2024, subject to shareholder 
approval. KPMG has attended all Audit 
Committee meetings from 30 June 2023 and 
had access to papers presented to the 
Committee at each meeting. The Committee 
has received updates on the transition from 
EY to KPMG as External Auditor and provided 
challenge to ensure KPMG is receiving an 
appropriate handover with sufficient input 
from Management and EY itself. The Committee 
confirms that it complied with the provision  
of The Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Use Of Competitive Tender Processes and 
Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 
2014 (‘CMA Order 2014’) for that tender. 

However, the Committee is mindful of the 
Minimum Standards for Audit Committees 
published by the FRC in May 2023 and that 
this particular tender had been completed 
before that publication. Within the previous 
tender process, challenger firms were 
included. Those challenger firms with 
adequate insurance capability will again  
be included and the Committee may 
consider a price-blind tender in 2031. 

The Group’s External Auditor policy includes 
audit partner rotation with the expectation 
that the audit partner will rotate at least every 
five years. EY has served as External Auditor 
to the Company since December 2018. 
Under the Audit Ethical Standards, signing 
audit partners for public interest entities 
should retain the role for up to five years.  
In order to safeguard the quality of the audit 
and in light of the Group’s extensive change 
programme, particularly the implementation 
of IFRS 17 and the acquisition of SunLife of 
Canada UK, the Committee requested a 
further tenure extension for Stuart Wilson 
as a result of reaching his sixth year of 
tenure associated with the Group following 
completion of the 2022 audit. In total,  
Stuart Wilson acted as audit partner for 
Phoenix Life Limited for two years, and then 
lead audit partner for Phoenix Group for five 
years. Such an extension is permissible under 
the Audit Ethical Standards for a maximum 
of two additional years until 2023, when EY 
will retire as External Auditor of the Group. 

External Auditor review
Actions to be undertaken 
during the year following the 
effectiveness review, which  
will provide KPMG with further 
insight during its transition  
as External Auditor are 
highlighted to the right. 

Action 1

Action 2

Action 3

Enhance the process for 
recognition and escalation  
of any significant issue.

and consider including the 
service companies within 
the same Audit Team.

Audit Committee report

Appointment of External Auditor  
at Annual General Meeting
Resolutions will be put to the AGM to 
be held on 14 May 2024 proposing the 
appointment of KPMG as the Company’s 
External Auditor and authorising the Board 
to determine its remuneration, on the 
recommendation of the Audit Committee 
in accordance with the CMA Order 2014. 

External Auditor policy
The Company has an External Auditor 
policy which requires the Company and 
the External Auditor to take measures to 
safeguard the integrity, objectivity and 
independence of the External Auditor and 
cap the level of any non-audit fee paid to its 
External Auditor at 70% of the average audit 
fees paid in the previous three consecutive 
financial years. The External Auditor policy 
can be found on the website at  
www.thephoenixgroup.com. 

The External Auditor policy covers  
matters such as the rotation of audit partner, 
employment of external auditor employees, 
permitted non-audit services and  
audit-related services. 

Permitted non-audit services are those 
contained in the Revised Ethical Standard 
2019 of the FRC. For 2023 these related  
to Phoenix Re and Standard Life 
International Dac. 

Audit-related services are a subset of 
permitted non-audit services that are largely 
carried out by the Audit Engagement Team 
and where the work involved is closely 
related to the work performed in the  
audit. For 2023 this included work on the 
Sustainability Report and the collateral  
audit for Standard Life International Dac.

The Committee is satisfied that there are 
no circumstances that could affect the 
independence or objectivity of the Auditor. 
The External Auditor policy is refreshed 
annually and in May 2023 was updated 
to note that audit services provided to 
investment funds, where wholly managed 
by third parties, and which the Group 
consolidates in its IFRS financial statements 
would be exempt from the requirements 
for fees to be approved by the Audit 
Committee, and are instead considered 
a pre-approved service. Related fees 
continue to be reported to the Audit 
Committee on at least an annual basis. 

External Auditor’s fees
The engagement of EY to perform any 
non-audit service is subject to a process of 
pre-approval by the Committee to safeguard 
the External Auditor’s objectivity and 
independence and the prescribed limit set 
out above in line with statutory requirements.

In 2023, total fees of £28.4 million were paid 
to EY. Of this amount £25.6million related  
to statutory audit fees of the parent and its 
subsidiaries, with a further £2.2 million 
incurred in relation to services provided 
pursuant to legal or regulatory requirements. 
The remaining fees of £0.6 million relate  
to other services including review of the 
Group’s Interim Report and Sustainability 
Report. This gives rise to a non-audit to  
audit fee ratio under the EU Directive  
and Regulations of 3% for the 2023 year,  
and 6% based on a three-year average audit 
fee. This lies well within the limits prescribed 
in the Group’s policy. The increase in the 
audit fee principally reflects the additional 
work undertaken in connection with the 
transition to IFRS 17. 

In light of the above, the Committee  
is satisfied that the non-audit services 
performed during 2023 have not impaired 
the independence of EY in its role as 
External Auditor.

Internal Audit
During 2023, the Committee continued to receive regular updates from the Group Head of Internal Audit on all Internal Audit related matters. 
This included

Item 

Outcome 

Regular updates on the progress of the 2023 Internal Audit Plan 
approved in late 2022. 

Group Internal Audit provided regular progress reports on plan delivery. 
At the end of the year plan finalisation was at an advanced stage. 

Budget and resource.

Robustly challenged by the Committee to ensure appropriate  
and adequate.

Annual update of the Group Internal Audit Charter  
and independence.

The Internal Audit Charter was approved by the Committee  
in November 2023. 

Control environment opinion which included Internal Audit’s  
view of the Risk Management Framework, Governance and  
Control Frameworks across the Group at both the Half Year  
and Full Year end.

Performance evaluation: the next externally facilitated EQA  
is due not later than 2025. 

Control opinions were provided by Internal Audit in March and August 
which provided Internal Audit’s view of the Risk Management Framework, 
Governance and Control Frameworks. 

Internal Audits were assessed as effective. The process included  
self-assessment against CIIA standards, with consideration of the  
Internal Audit Quality and Improvement Programme. QA results were 
independently completed by Grant Thornton UK LLP, and the results  
of a stakeholder survey were also reviewed by the Committee. 

All areas of Internal Audit’s plan were aligned with Phoenix Group’s strategic priorities. For 2024, the use of data analytics by Internal Audit is 
expected to be a key development area. 

significant judgements involved in the 
preparation of the Half Year 2023 results 
and comparative information. These 
processes underpinned the Committee’s 
recommendation that the Board approve 
the Interim report in September 2023. 

Following publication of the Half Year 2023 
results, the Committee’s focus on IFRS 17 
shifted to the transfer of processes and 
controls from a programme-led environment 
to BAU activity. It will continue to be a 
focus for 2024, whilst IFRS 17 is further 
embedded into the Group’s financial 
reporting framework. Work will continue 
to streamline and automate reporting 
under the new standard and enhance 
the related internal control environment. 
The Committee has been supportive of 
Management during the transition, whilst 
executing its professional scepticism through 
deep dives and robustly challenging both 
Management and the External Auditor.

Department for Business & Trade
A focus for Management during much 
of 2023 was the ongoing Government 
proposals regarding the Department for 
Business & Trade reforms on Corporate 
Governance and Audit. Management 
provided regular updates to the 
Committee and has continued to do so 
following the Government’s withdrawal 
on primary and secondary legislation, 
now focusing on how Phoenix Group will 
implement the 2024 Code principles and 
provisions by 1 January 2025 and 2026.

Finally, I’d like to thank the Finance Team 
for what has been a busy year with the 
implementation of the new IFRS 17 standard. 

Katie Murray
Chair of the Audit Committee

Internal control
The Committee, alongside the Risk 
Committee, supports the Board in ensuring 
a robust system of internal control and risk 
management is in place across the Group. 
The Committee receives reports from the 
Group Head of Internal Audit on the status 
of the control environment and management 
of the Group’s principal risks and controls 
across the Group’s Risk Universe.

The Committee also considers bi-annual 
Internal Control Self-Assessment reports 
in which Line 1 risk owners self-assess 
the design and operation of their control 
environments. These assessments are 
independently validated by Line 2 
(Risk) and supplemented by an Annual 
Internal Control Environment Opinion 
Report from Line 3 (Internal Audit).

During 2023, the Committee regularly 
challenged Management to ensure, where 
any control weaknesses were identified, that 
there are robust and timely action plans to 
address these. In performing this review and 
challenge of the control environment, the 
Committee has assessed and confirms that  
in 2023 it has complied with Principle O  
and Provisions 25 and 29 of the 2018 Code. 

Looking ahead to 2024, the Committee 
will maintain its scrutiny of the Group’s 
control environment, including overseeing 
necessary modifications to the Internal 
Control Framework to meet the new 
requirements of the 2024 Code.

Climate change risk
Sustainability is a significant area of focus 
for the Group. The Committee has a key 
oversight role of climate-related reporting 
including TCFD and other sustainability 
disclosures. The Sustainability Committee 
works closely with both the Audit Committee 
and Risk Committee to review climate 
change risk, target setting and disclosure 
requirements to ensure that our reporting 
is aligned with strategy and regulatory 
requirements. The Committee received 
confirmation from Management of the 
KPIs and metrics the External Auditor had 
provided assurance over when reviewing, 
approving and recommending both the 
Net Zero Transition Plan published on 
24 May 2023 and the Sustainability and 
Climate Reports. An outcome following an 
education session on climate change risk 
was to continually assess the assurance 
level of TCFD reporting. Risk of incorrectly 
disclosing the financial impact of climate 
change is at the forefront for the Committee 
and will continue to be a focus for 2024. 
Both greenwashing and greenhushing 
that could lead to climate litigation is a 
focus for the Audit, Risk and Sustainability 
Committees. See pages 103 and 107 
where climate risk is discussed in the Risk 
and Sustainability Committee reports. 

Whistleblowing
Bi-annually, the Committee receives formal 
updates from the Group’s General Counsel 
on: whistleblowing activities and the 
operation of our processes to enable 
confidential reporting; involvement in the 
assessment and resolution of individual 
matters raised in accordance with our 
established policy; whistleblowing 
arrangements within the Group; and any 
whistleblowing activity where an employee 
raised concerns in confidence about any 
possible improprieties.

During 2023, there were a total of seven 
notifications reported to the Speak Up 
Office, of which two were triaged as 
‘whistleblows’ and five notifications related to 
people policy matters. Of the two Speak Up 
matters, both are closed and no material 
wrongdoing or control failures were  
found. Employee survey scores indicated 
colleagues generally felt that Phoenix Group 
was a psychologically safe environment 
where they can speak up freely and had  
a strong belief that serious misconduct  
would be dealt with appropriately.

Fair, balanced and understandable 
assurance framework. 
The Committee has satisfied itself that the 
Phoenix Group Holdings plc 2023 Annual 
Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and 
understandable. It has done so by taking 
relevant FRC guidance into consideration 
and feedback from various sources, then 
robust challenge by the Committee.

The External Auditor also considered 
the fair, balanced and understandable 
statement as part of the year end processes 
and concurred with its approval by the 
Committee. The Committee can therefore 
concur with the statement made by the 
Board of Directors on page 147 in line 
with Principle N of the 2018 Code.

Going concern
Please see page 143 for Phoenix 
Group’s Going concern statement. 

IFRS 17 implementation
During 2023, Management provided 
the Committee with regular updates 
and education sessions regarding the 
implementation of IFRS 17, the new 
accounting standard for insurance contracts 
that came into effect from 1 January 2023 
and its impact on the Group’s financial 
reporting and internal control framework. 
In dedicated sessions, the Committee has 
discussed in detail the financial impacts 
of IFRS 17, together with the operational 
considerations of the implementation 
programme including timetable, resourcing 
and internal control matters. The Committee 
reviewed and approved Phoenix Group’s 
revised accounting policies to reflect the 
new standard together with the underlying

Significant matters in relation to  
the 2023 IFRS financial statements

Implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9

Review of the IFRS and Solvency II actuarial 
valuation process, to include the setting of 
actuarial assumptions and methodologies,  
and the robustness of actuarial data

How these issues were addressed

The Committee devoted a significant amount of time to the oversight of the final  
aspects of the implementation of the new accounting standard for insurance contracts,  
IFRS 17. Having commenced its oversight of technical implementation matters in 2021,  
the Committee finalised its review and approval of the Group’s revised accounting policies  
to reflect adoption of the new standard, and evaluated the key judgements utilised in the 
application of those policies. 

The Committee received regular updates as to the impact of the implementation  
of the standard on the Group’s systems, processes and control environment, and  
provided oversight on the achievement of key milestones in the delivery of the IFRS 17 
implementation programme.

Working closely with the Phoenix Life Companies Board Audit Committee, and having 
considered findings from the Group’s External Auditor and specific assurance provided  
by Group Risk and Group Internal Audit, the Committee approved restatements of  
the Group’s transition balance sheet as at 1 January 2022 and its results for the year  
ended 31 December 2022 in accordance with the new standard. 

Although significantly less material to the Group’s results, the Committee also provided 
oversight on the implementation of IFRS 9, the new accounting standard for financial 
instruments which has been adopted for the first time alongside IFRS 17. 

The Committee concluded that the disclosures included in Note A as to the impact  
of new accounting standards adopted in the period were appropriate. 

Management presented papers to the Phoenix Life Companies Board Audit Committee 
detailing recommendations for the actuarial assumptions and methodologies to be used  
for the interim and year end reporting periods, with justification and benchmarking as 
appropriate. This included assumptions related to longevity, mortality, expenses, persistency 
and policyholder behaviour, as well as economic assumptions. These assumptions and 
methodologies were debated and challenged by the Phoenix Life Companies Board  
Audit Committee, prior to their approval, including consideration of the impacts of  
continued economic volatility, expense inflation and data quality. 

A summary of these papers was presented for oversight review by the Committee,  
and the Phoenix Life Companies Board Audit Committee’s conclusions were  
reported to the Committee through minutes of its meeting and a discussion between  
the Chairs of the committees. The Committee discussed and questioned Management  
and EY on the content of the summary papers and the Phoenix Life Companies Board  
Audit Committee’s conclusions. 

The Committee considered and debated the basis of the valuation for adjustments to  
actuarial provisions that arise at a consolidated Group level, including the methodology  
and derivation of certain IFRS 17 assumptions where calibrated on a Group basis.  
This included consideration of the results of a detailed review of the Group’s maintenance 
expense assumptions in light of the continuing investment in the Group’s growth strategy  
and the re-planning of strategic transformation initiatives. The Committee also evaluated the 
determination of the IFRS 17 discount rate, including the appropriateness of the allowances  
for illiquidity and credit risk, together with the calibration of the risk adjustment assumption. 

Pension assumptions for use in the IAS 19 Employee Benefits valuations were reviewed  
and approved by the Committee. 

The Committee received and considered detailed written and verbal reporting from the 
External Auditor setting out their observations and conclusions in respect of the assumptions, 
methodologies and actuarial models, including benchmarking analysis.

Significant matters in relation to  
the 2023 IFRS financial statements

Valuation of complex and  
illiquid financial assets

Valuation and recoverability  
of intangible assets

Provisions

Alternative performance measures (‘APMs’)

Assessment of whether the  
Annual Report and Accounts are  
fair, balanced and understandable

Going concern and viability analysis

How these issues were addressed

Management presented papers setting out the basis of the valuation of financial assets, 
including changes in methodology and assumptions, for the interim and year end reporting 
periods to the Phoenix Life Companies Board Audit Committee. The assumptions, valuations 
and processes, particularly for financial assets determined by valuation techniques using 
significant non-observable inputs (Level 3), were debated and challenged by the Phoenix  
Life Companies Board Audit Committee prior to being approved. This included a review  
of judgements made in respect of data and inputs driving the valuation of equity release 
mortgages, assumptions utilised in the valuation of modelled debt securities such as bond 
spreads, and the impacts of continued economic uncertainty.

The valuation information was then presented for oversight review by the Committee which 
considered and further challenged the information prior to confirmation of the 
appropriateness of the basis of valuation.

Management presented papers detailing the results of annual impairment testing carried  
out in respect of goodwill balances and reviews for indicators of impairment performed  
in respect of finite life intangibles. This included assessing the potential impact of the risk  
of climate change.

The Committee considered the results of the work performed and confirmed the 
appropriateness of the conclusions reached.

Management presented papers detailing the basis of recognition and measurement of 
accounting provisions recognised by the Group. The Committee considered the results  
of the analysis performed, the uncertainties surrounding the measurements adopted and 
confirmed the appropriateness of the conclusions reached.

The Committee reviewed the use of APMs in the Group’s financial reporting, understanding 
the basis for determining the metrics and considering the clarity and explanation of their 
usage within the Group’s Annual and Interim Reports. 

Specifically, the Committee considered the usage of new APMs such as Adjusted Shareholder 
Equity and amendments to existing APMs such as Adjusted Operating Profit, where necessary 
to reflect the implementation of IFRS 17. On reviewing the results, the Committee provided 
challenge as to the allocation of amounts to either Adjusted Operating Profit or to non-operating 
items for consistency with the Group’s Adjusted Operating Profit framework. 

The Committee concluded that the usage, disclosure and prominence of APMs within the 
Group’s Annual Report and Accounts was appropriate. 

The Committee considered and confirmed agreement with the analysis in support of 
Management’s conclusions that the Annual Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable. As part of the year end procedures, the Committee discussed with 
Management and EY the review processes that operated over the production of the  
Annual Report and Accounts.

The Committee reviewed information on the capital and liquidity position of the Group, 
together with a review of the associated risks and supporting stress and scenario testing.  
This was part of a comprehensive assessment undertaken prior to the Committee 
recommending to the Board that the Group financial statements should be prepared  
on a Going concern basis and that the disclosures, with regard to the long-term viability  
of the Group, were sufficient and appropriate.

Outcomes from Risk Committee discussions: 
On an annual basis, a review of the Committee’s activities is undertaken. In 2023, it was concluded that all elements of responsibility detailed  
in the Committee’s Terms of Reference had been addressed. An overview of some of the key activities undertaken during the year and the way  
in which they contributed to important outcomes are detailed in the following table:  

Key activities

Key Committee activity

Outcome 

Regular reporting. 

Operational and conduct risk 

Change delivery, project update and 
operational capacity. 

Following changes to the membership of the Model Governance Committee, it was decided 
that the Chair of that Committee should attend each meeting to provide an update and answer 
any questions from members. 

Following the set-up of the Transformation Advisory Group (‘TAG’), the Committee requested 
that a summary of the TAG meetings be presented at the next possible Committee meeting. 
The first TAG update was provided in November 2023. 

Cyber risk, data protection and AI.

Following the rise of AI and its usage across the industry, the Committee requested a deep 
dive on AI, its opportunities and risks. 

Customer and conduct risk. 

Financial and strategic risk

Liquidity risk.

Climate and sustainability risk. 

Risk Management Framework 

Risk appetite review and oversight.

The Committee requested a deep dive on Consumer Duty and the preparation that had been 
undertaken to ensure that Phoenix Group will meet the requirements. This presentation was 
delivered to the Board in October 2023. 

Following industry liquidity stress tests in September/October 2022, the Company 
commissioned an external review of the liquidity management framework across the  
Group. These recommendations were presented to the Committee in June 2023 and  
the Committee requested a standing agenda item until such time that the recommendations 
were implemented. 

Noting the rise in climate litigation and the introduction of anti-greenwashing regulations,  
the Committee requested that a deep dive on reputational risk be provided to better 
understand the potential impact on the Company. This was delivered in May 2023.

The Committee requested to receive regular updates as the proposed improvements were 
implemented to ensure continued focus on risk appetite. This will be actioned in 2024. 

Group CRO report
At each meeting, the Committee receives 
a formal report from the Group CRO 
which highlights key factors impacting the 
Group’s operating environment as well 
as an assessment of emerging risks. The 
review includes analysis of risks arising 
from the macro-economic outlook and 
conditions in financial markets, together 
with geopolitical, legislative and regulatory 
change risks that may impact the Group 
and its customers as well as risks associated 
with the implementation of the Group’s 
business strategy. A summary of the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group can be found on pages 50 to 57. 

Cyber risk
The Committee has remained conscious of 
high-profile cyber security incidents that 
continue to impact corporates globally, 
driven by the use of destructive malware 
and ransomware. The Group is continually 
improving its controls, attack detection 
and response processes, identifying 
weaknesses through ongoing assessment 
and review. Supplier-related cyber attacks 
were detailed to the Committee through 
the Group CRO report along with the 
oversight and assurance processes in place 
to mitigate the impact on the Group. 

In 2023, the Committee received two cyber 
security updates which covered the threat 
landscape; cyber awareness and defence; 
and actions being undertaken to support 
and continually improve Phoenix Group’s 
security culture. The Committee found this 
session extremely informative and, as such, 
another session will be presented to the 
Board as part of its continued education 
in 2024. For more information on the 
classification of cyber risk and the controls 
in place to monitor and mitigate the impact 
on the business, please see page 55. 

Climate risk
The Committee remained cognisant of the 
continued prevalence of climate risk and the 
need to ensure collaboration across Board 
Committees. The Terms of Reference of the 
Audit, Risk and Sustainability Committees 
divide accountability for oversight and 
monitoring of work undertaken. During 2023, 
the Risk Committee received climate risk 
updates as well as reviewing disclosures in 
the Sustainability Report and Climate Report, 
which can be found on the Company’s website. 
The Committee worked in close collaboration 
with the Sustainability Committee on the 
Group’s first Net Zero Transition Plan.  
The Committee also remained vigilant in 
relation to anti-greenwashing and ensured 
that the Group’s labelling of investment funds 
was appropriate for future compliance. 

Individual responsibility for ensuring 
appropriate identification, assessment, 
management and reporting of 
climate-related financial risks and 
opportunities that could impact the Group  
sits with the Group’s CFO and CRO,  
both appointed as joint Senior Managers 
responsible for climate-related financial risk 
under the PRA and FCA’s Senior Managers 
and Certification Regime. 

Consumer Duty 
The Committee received regular updates in 
the delivery phase of the Group’s Consumer 
Duty plans, assessments of fair value and 
improvements to the customer journey. 
Updates were also provided by the Chair of 
the Life Companies Board Risk Committee as 
to the work being undertaken by subsidiaries 
to ensure that the customers’ best interests 
remain at the heart of decision-making at 
every level of the organisation. This focus 
and vigilance will continue into 2024. 

John Pollock 
Chair of the Risk Committee

Connectivity with principal subsidiaries 
and relevant Committees 
During 2023, the Committee continued to 
actively engage with principal subsidiaries 
and relevant Committees to keep abreast 
of key workstreams and to monitor the 
principal risks relevant to the Group. 
Examples of this engagement include: 

•

•

the Chair of the Life Companies Board 
Risk Committee attending all meetings 
to provide update on discussions such as 
Consumer Duty and the Internal Model; 

the Chair of the Risk Committee of 
Standard Life International Dac attending 
two meetings to provide formal updates 
to the Committee; 

• a member of the Model Governance 
Committee attending all meetings to 
provide updates on discussions to the 
Committee; and

•

the Chair of the Board Investment 
Committee attending on two occasions 
to provide an update on investment 
decision-making and oversight. 

This participation and connectivity 
promoted the sharing of information and 
best practices between the Group and its 
subsidiaries and allows the Committee to 
appropriately assess a broad range of risks 
and their impact across all stakeholders. 
All interactions between the Group, its 
subsidiaries and other committees continue 
to further the Committee’s understanding 
of the risk profile of the Group’s principal 
subsidiaries, leading to more comprehensive 
review and challenge by members. 

A set of Operating Principles are in  
place to define the responsibilities and 
accountabilities of all relevant subsidiary 
Committees and Boards to mitigate  
the overlap of focus or assurance  
activity and are reviewed annually  
to ensure they remain appropriate. 

See pages 94 and 107 of the Audit 
Committee report and Sustainability 
Committee report, respectively, for examples 
of collaborative governance between the 
Audit, Sustainability and Risk Committees.

Sustainability Committee report

Outcomes from Sustainability Committee discussions: 
On an annual basis, a review of the Committee’s activities is undertaken. In 2023, it was concluded that all elements of responsibility detailed in 
the Committee’s Terms of Reference had been addressed. In addition, all elements of the Group’s sustainability strategy are covered throughout 
the year. The sustainability strategy in 2023 was divided into ‘Planet’ and ‘People’ with key themes falling below each pillar. These themes were 
‘Investing in a sustainable future’, ‘Engaging people in better financial futures’ and ‘Building a leading responsible business’. An overview of some 
key activities undertaken during the year and the way in which they contributed to the sustainability strategy are detailed in the following table:

Key activities

Key Committee activity

Outcome 

Investing in a sustainable future

Multiple discussions on all aspects  
of stewardship and the Stewardship  
Code including: the Stewardship  
Report, proxy voting guidelines and 
asset management commitments. 

Review and consideration of the  
Group’s Net Zero Transition Plan.

Monitored progress against proposals  
for TNFD regulation.

Following rigorous challenge, the organisation was formally accepted as a signatory to the 
Stewardship Code in August 2023. 

Improved clarity following Committee challenge on managerial decisions for the pathway  
to decarbonising investments. The Committee requested further oversight of this aspect  
of the plan and its development, and this has become a standing agenda item in 2024. 

Following a presentation from the Co-Chair of The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial 
Disclosures (‘TNFD’), the Committee decided that close engagement with that organisation  
should continue to allow the Company to disclose against the regulations once finalised.  
The Committee will continue to oversee engagement throughout 2024. 

Engaging people in better financial futures 

Review and oversight of the Money  
Mindset digital platform, which provides  
a holistic financial wellness solution to 
Standard Life Workplace customers. 

Monitoring the ongoing work  
of Phoenix Insights.

As a result of several updates throughout the year, the Committee developed a deeper 
understanding of the technological products being developed within the Group  
to support consumers. 

In-depth understanding of areas of investigation for the Company and how these might be 
disclosed to better provide a future of possibilities for consumers. The Committee requested  
an annual update on the proposition of collaborating with other think tanks to progress research 
and initiatives. 

Oversight of the launch of the Midlife  
MOT, a colleague initiative to help  
members of the Group workforce plan  
for the future.

Following discussion and challenge, the Committee requested an investigation into the ways in 
which the product could be extended for those interested, and how engagement with the initiative 
would be sustained to make a long-term, meaningful difference. The 2024 Committee agenda will 
include an update on engagement and statistics around uptake, alongside a view on how this 
product could be extended to customers. 

Building a leading responsible business 

Oversight of the research phases of a  
proposed five-year Race and Ethnicity 
Action Plan which sets out the roadmap for 
how the Company will increase ethnicity 
representation at all levels of Phoenix Group 
and more broadly within financial services. 

Oversight of collaboration with a third-party 
consultancy to determine actions required  
to align to international best practice in  
human rights. 

The Committee discussed research into views on diversity and the introduction of a  
framework on cultural intelligence and fluency training. The Committee requested oversight  
of the development of the framework to ensure the intended cultural development was 
embedded and sustained. 

The Committee reviewed and recommended to the Board for approval the first Human Rights 
policy for the Group, which sets out commitments to respect human rights in alignment with the 
international framework of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 

More information about how the Company delivered against the specific pillars of the sustainability strategy can be found the Group’s 
Sustainability Report. This is available on the Company’s website at www.thephoenixgroup.com. 

The Committee also received education sessions as shown on pages 80 and 81. 

Connectivity with other 
relevant Committees 
The following joint Committees promoted 
the sharing of information and best 
practices. The Committees were able 
to review, approve and recommend for 
Board approval the following items:

Sustainability and Risk Committees 

• Net Zero Transition Plan – May 2023.

• Annual Report disclosures relating 
to climate and sustainability – 
February 2023.

Audit, Risk and Sustainability Committees

• Review of Year End 2023 Climate and 
Sustainability Reports – March 2024.

The Committee ensures that collaboration 
with other Board Committees (Audit 
and Risk) takes place to provide holistic 
challenge on publicly communicated 
targets and statistics and to monitor 
changes in climate risk. 

The Group’s CEO, Andy Briggs, regularly 
attends meetings to provide insight 
into executive decision making and 
assurance. The Group’s External Auditor, 
EY, provides external limited assurance 
on both TCFD data and the disclosures 
made in the Sustainability Report, which 
can be found on the Company’s website.

Net Zero Transition Plan 
The Committee is delighted that the 
first edition of Phoenix Group’s Net Zero 
Transition Plan was published in May 2023. 
The plan sets out the actions the Company 
will take on its journey to becoming net zero 
by 2050 and to support achievement of its 
stretching interim targets in 2025 and 2030 
across its investment portfolio, operations 
and supply chain. The plan helps to ensure 
that our decarbonisation strategy is aligned 
with our wider business objectives and to 
deliver the right outcomes for our customers. 

The Net Zero Transition Plan is in line  
with the latest industry guidance from the 
Transition Plan Taskforce and Glasgow 
Financial Alliance for Net Zero. However, 
it is important to acknowledge that related 
policy setting and global decarbonisation 
are still evolving and that the Group is in the 
early stages of its net zero transition. As such, 
our Net Zero Transition Plan will continue 
to be developed and refined with customer 
outcomes at the heart of all decision-making. 

Monitoring culture and the 
Employee Voice 
In accordance with Provision 5 of the  
2018 Code, the Board is required to  
maintain an effective mechanism to engage 
with the workforce. Committee member 
Maggie Semple is the Designated NED 
for Workforce Engagement and provides 
regular updates to the Committee and the 
Board on the outcomes of her interactions 
with the Phoenix Colleague Representation 

Forum (‘PCRF’) and the actions being 
undertaken as a result. This mechanism 
provides the Committee and the Board with 
an in-depth understanding of colleagues’ 
perspectives in relation to topics such as 
mental wellbeing, flexible working, diversity 
and inclusion and insights into the tone 
of the Group’s culture from the ground 
up. In 2023, the Committee noted that 
there should be more interaction with the 
workforce following Board discussions 
to communicate outcomes and to ensure 
that colleagues are aware that the Board 
takes concerns seriously. This is something 
that will be improved and made standard 
practice in 2024. More information on 
how Maggie Semple and other Board 
members engage with the workforce 
can be found on pages 108 to 110. 

The Committee also receives updates  
from the Group HR Director on people  
and culture metrics, which allows members 
to review the Group’s people strategy and 
to monitor culture. This dashboard includes 
information on turnover and absenteeism 
rates, employee surveys, whistleblowing and 
‘Speak Up’ data, and diversity and inclusion 
statistics. The Committee will continue 
to follow best practice guidance and to 
identify both qualitative and quantitative 
data that should be reviewed to assess the 
development of culture in the organisation.

Designated Non-Executive Director 
for Workforce Engagement

Engagement in  
action – listening to 
the colleague voice

Our growth and success at Phoenix  
Group are down to our amazing 
colleagues. They drive our business 
performance and help us to achieve  
our purpose. Having regular engagement 
with colleagues is integral to our strategy  
and vision to be the best company  
that colleagues have ever worked for. 
Through regular two-way dialogue,  
the Board seeks to understand the issues 
that matter most to our colleagues.

Board engagement with colleagues
The Board sets the cultural tone for the 
organisation and seeks to engage with 
colleagues, both directly and indirectly, 
throughout the year. The Board recognises 
that colleagues are central to the achievement 
of our strategic priorities and the Group’s 
ability to provide customers and wider 
stakeholders with the best outcomes possible. 

Across 2023, the Phoenix Group Board 
members, including the Chair of the  
Group Board, myself and our Executive 
Directors, held two dedicated sessions  
as part of our Board agenda to meet with 
colleagues. We held these in May and 
November, and we invited targeted groups 
of individuals to join us in an open and 
transparent conversation so that we could 
hear first-hand their experiences of  
working at Phoenix Group. 

At our session in May, we met with  
17 members of the Group’s graduate 
programme, and the primary focus of  
our conversations were around career  
and leadership. We thoroughly enjoyed  
the dynamic attitudes of the graduates,  
and how comfortable they were in  
speaking up and sharing their thoughts.  
Our discussions showcased that our 
graduates have come from varied 
backgrounds with a wide plethora of 
degrees, and they valued the approach  
to the Phoenix Group graduate programme 
as it provided them with an opportunity  
to rotate into many different business areas, 
giving them lots of exciting opportunities  
and experiences. 

It’s insightful to have Maggie’s experience 
and fresh perspective on our people  
agenda items. Maggie’s input and challenge 
ensures we discuss items from a 360-degree 
perspective which results in in-depth 
discussions and tangible outcomes we  
can work towards together to benefit  
both colleagues and the business.

David Berry, PCRF Lead Rep, Operations.

A key learning on the day was the approach  
for managing ‘home’ seats, which is the  
first seat the graduate rotates into and,  
at the end of the programme, if they’ve  
not secured an alternative role they will  
be guaranteed a role in their home seat.  
On the surface of it, this sounded positive 
and gave job security to the graduates; 
however, they shared that they have limited 
choice in where they start their graduate 
career with us, and so often their home seat 
was not an area they wanted to return to.  
This learning from our engagement with the 
graduate programme was discussed at  
the Board. 

Outcome: was a management action  
set by the Board to review the approach  
to rotations and home seats, which is 
currently being considered by the Group. 
This would facilitate greater choice for  
the graduates when they come to the end  
of their two-year programme. 

Our Board session in November focused 
on the experiences of females in their 50s, 
with a focus on the working environment. 
This session was attended by 12 women 
from across the Group, covering many of 
our locations and our corporate grades. 
We had a very engaging conversation 
covering their experiences at Phoenix Group 
and previous roles. What was incredibly 
pleasing to hear was that many of the women 
in the room said that, at Phoenix Group, 
they didn’t feel like they were treated 
as a ‘stereotype’. They spoke positively 
and favourably about the support and 
importance that the Group has placed on 
critical areas such as menopause and carers. 

They were also supportive of the focus 
Phoenix Group and Phoenix Insights has 
been placing on later working life, through 
their research and reporting and through 
initiatives such as the Over 50s jobs fair 
and the colleague Midlife MOT, which 
has helped them to feel comfortable and 
confident of their futures with the Group.

Hearing the wider colleague voice
In addition to the two sessions held  
with the wider Board members this year,  
I have spent time with colleagues across 
our sites to hear more from them about 
their experiences at Phoenix Group. 

One of my key points of connection with 
colleagues has been meeting with the PCRF 
on a quarterly basis. This is an autonomous 
forum made up of colleague representatives 
from each of our functions. Our partnership 
with the PCRF enables us to have direct, 
honest and open discussions about strategic 
topics and how they impact colleagues. 

One topic of note which came up frequently  
in our discussions was the colleague 
understanding of the Phoenix Group reward 
framework. With the backdrop of the 
economic situation, this was a particularly 
important topic which colleagues wanted  
to speak about. Through my discussions with 
the PCRF, it was agreed with Sara Thompson, 
Group HR Director, that a more proactive 
approach to communicating updates on  
the reward framework would be shared  
with colleagues. 

Outcome: was a common theme when  
the Remuneration Committee completed  
its education session on the 2018 Code  
in October. Particular attention was given  
to Provision 41 relating to the impact of 
engaging with the wider workforce on 
Executive Directors’ Remuneration policy 
and outcome. From that education session 
and my feedback on the PCRF to the Board, 
the outcome was that I should join the 
Remuneration Committee as a member  
with effect from 1 January 2024. This would 
allow me to provide a better link between  
the PCRF on wider workforce remuneration 
matters and the Remuneration Committee. 
Changes to the Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration policy or discretion applied  
to their remuneration outcomes would also 
be better understood and communicated  
to the wider workforce through the PCRF. 

In addition to regularly meetings with  
the PCRF, I hear from the colleague-led 
networks and I have taken the opportunity  
to invite wider colleagues to informal 
meetings to enable them to share what  
is on their mind in the moment, including  
a trip to visit colleagues in Dublin to hear  
more from them. At this visit, I also informally 
met with the representatives from Unite. 
Through this discussion, I took away that  
they were looking for greater clarity and 
communication when strategic decisions 
were made affecting their work.  
This comment related to a decision on 
Phoenix Group’s strategic partnership  
with TCS Diligenta that had been taken  
in a previous year. I provided this feedback  
to the Board. 

Outcome: was for the Group to ensure that 
communication relating to strategic decisions 
is clear and well understood by colleagues 
and their relevant representative bodies.

Directors’ Remuneration report

Reflecting on 2023
In my role as the Designated NED for 
Workforce Engagement I get to witness 
the power of two-way conversation. I share 
regular feedback from my sessions with 
colleagues to the Board, which provides 
additional perspective and insights on 
colleagues and can lead to outcomes 
that improve the experience of our wider 
workforce at Phoenix Group. I share key 
aspects of our Board discussions with 
colleagues when I meet with them and ask 
for their opinions, again relaying these back 
to the Board for potential outcomes. I have 
also this year created a blog which I share 
with colleagues, focusing on topics that 
they have told me are important to them.

Continuing to develop two-way 
communication enables colleagues  
to be kept informed of how the Board is 
engaged in overseeing the development 
and execution of the Group’s strategy 
and enables the Board to stay connected 
to what is important to our colleagues 
and the impact of Board decisions. 

Maggie Semple
Designated NED for Workforce Engagement

Each quarter, our colleague-led forum, made  
up of the PCRF central team and colleague 
representatives from each UK business function, 
meet with Maggie Semple to discuss key themes 
we’re hearing from colleagues. Partnering together 
has resulted in enabling direct honest and open 
conversations, more frequent feedback, and 
continuous listening through a variety of channels. 
We’re also able to hear first-hand about the Board’s 
priorities and provide representation and insights 
from colleagues.

After the quarterly meetings, the PCRF shares  
the key themes and discussions from the meeting 
with colleagues. Maggie also shares feedback from 
these sessions with the Board, which has allowed  
it to gain additional perspective and insights on 
colleagues’ working lives and the colleague voice on 
Phoenix Group’s strategic priorities and initiatives.

Continuing to develop this two-way communication 
enables colleagues to be kept informed of how the 
Board is driving the Group, and connects the Board 
to what’s important to colleagues and how their 
decisions impact their working lives.

In my first year  
as Remuneration 
Committee chair, the 
Committee’s focus has 
been on implementing  
our new Policy to ensure 
that remuneration aligns 
with our purpose and 
strategic priorities and  
has regard to the wider 
stakeholder experience.

Role of the Committee 
The Committee is responsible for 
establishing, implementing, overseeing  
and reviewing the Group-wide Remuneration 
policy in the context of business strategy  
and changing risk conditions. This is 
consistent with Solvency II requirements.  
The Group-wide Remuneration policy 
focuses on ensuring sound and effective  
risk management so as not to encourage 
risk-taking outside of the Group’s risk 
appetite. The Committee ensures the 
remuneration of our Executive Officers 
is aligned to the Group’s purpose and 
values and that our wider workforce are 
also engaged and an overview is provided 
of executive remuneration. None of the 
Committee’s members has any personal 
financial interest (other than as shareholders), 
conflicts of interest arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement 
with running the business. The Committee’s 
Terms of Reference can be found at 
www.thephoenixgroup.com. No Director  
is involved with any discussion about their  
own remuneration. The Committee makes 
recommendations to the Group Board on  
the Remuneration policy and Shareholder 
Consultation every three years and on  
the Committee’s Terms of Reference.

Committee effectiveness
The 2023 effectiveness review was facilitated by an external Board 
Reviewer. The review concluded that the Committee is functioning 
effectively, though the Board Reviewer did not observe a regular 
meeting, as the October one was an education session. Nevertheless, 
the external Board Reviewer did suggest that the effectiveness could 
be enhanced by building on some of the practices that had already 
been put in place and these are highlighted to the right. 

Action 1

Action 2

The Chair had instigated a 
process of agreeing with the 
Committee what the priority 
items of focus would be  
for each meeting. This had 
worked well and would be 
maintained going forward.

to be best practice and  
to be commended in 
supporting the Committee’s 
consideration of variable

Outcomes from Remuneration Committee discussions: 
On an annual basis, a review of the Committee’s activities is undertaken. In 2023, it was concluded that all elements of responsibility detailed  
in the Committee’s Terms of Reference had been addressed. An overview of some of the key activities undertaken during the year and the way  
in which they contributed to important outcomes is detailed in the following table:

the views of the wider workforce on pay and its alignment with Executive Directors’ 
remuneration to the Committee, as well as her deep ESG and sustainability knowledge. 

Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present my first  
Directors’ Remuneration Report as  
Chair of the Remuneration Committee  
(the ‘Committee’), having taken over the  
role from Kory Sorenson on 4 May 2023.  
On behalf of the Committee I should like  
to take this opportunity to thank Kory on 
behalf of the Committee for her work as 
Chair and, in particular, her work last year 
engaging with our shareholders over  
our new Directors’ Remuneration policy 
(‘Policy’), which received 98.8% support  
at the 2023 AGM.

Summary of the year
Phoenix has again performed well in 2023,  
as we continued to execute against our 
strategy priorities, and which has supported 
strong financial results across our financial 
framework of cash, capital and earnings.

We have delivered over £2 billion of cash 
generation in 2023, supported by strong 
business performance and the impact of the 
Part VII transfer of Standard Life and Phoenix 
Life. Our organic growth continues at pace, 
with new business net fund flows increasing 
72% year-on-year, which helped to support 
us in delivering £1.5bn of new business 
long-term cash generation. This means  
we have achieved our 2025 new business 
long-term cash target two years early, 
reflecting the focus and investment we have 
put into our growth strategy. Our balance 
sheet also remains resilient with a Solvency II 
(‘SII’) surplus of £3.9 billion and Shareholder 
Capital Coverage Ratio of 176%. Our IFRS 
earnings have also improved during the year, 
with adjusted operating profit before tax 
increasing 13% year-on-year to £617m.

Executive remuneration outcomes for 2023
Based on its assessment of the corporate 
metrics, the Committee determined that  
the Annual Incentive Plan (‘AIP’) outcome 
should be 78.2% of the maximum opportunity.  
This outcome was driven by exceptional  
cash generation performance in the year, 
which benefited from particularly strong 
management actions delivery including  
the completion of one of the largest UK 
insurance Part VII transfers ever completed, 
with the funds merger of the Standard Life 
and Phoenix Life businesses into Phoenix Life 
Limited. With regard to the achievements 
under the Strategic Scorecard which 
represents 20% of the Executive Directors’ 
AIP, the Committee determined outcomes 
should be 69.0% for Andy Briggs and 69.8% 
for Rakesh Thakrar. This results in a formulaic 
outcome of 76.4% and 76.5% respectively  
of the maximum AIP opportunity. 

Each year the Committee reviews the  
AIP outcomes in the context of the Group’s 
management of risk, overall business 
performance and the broader stakeholder 
experience. In reviewing the 2023 AIP 
outcome, the Committee considered the 
delays faced during the year relating to  
the IFRS 17 project. As Group CFO, Rakesh 
Thakrar had the principal responsibility for 
delivering the project in a timely manner,  
so the Committee decided it was appropriate 
to use its discretion to reduce his AIP 
outcome by £75k (10%).

Andy Briggs recognises that, as Group CEO, 
he has ultimate accountability for all projects, 
including IFRS 17. Accordingly, in discussion 
with the Committee, he suggested – and the 
Committee agreed – that he should forgo 
£50k (4%) of his AIP outcome.

As a result of these discretionary adjustments, 
overall outcomes under the AIP were 73.4% 
of maximum for the Group CEO, and 69.0% 
of maximum for the Group CFO.

The 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
award covering the years 2021–2023 was 
based on Net Operating Cash Receipts, 
Return on Shareholder Value, Persistency, 
and Relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’). 
The overall vesting outcome is 41.1% of the 
maximum opportunity. Further details are  
set out on page 122.

The resulting single total figure of remuneration 
for Andy Briggs is £2,901k and for Rakesh 
Thakrar is £1,543k. Full details are set out  
on page 121.

Updated metrics to align remuneration 
with our evolving strategy
The Committee approved a number of 
changes to the metrics for the AIP and LTIP  
in 2024 to ensure continued alignment  
to business priorities.

For the 2024 AIP, the Committee has 
decided to replace the Incremental  
New Business Long-Term Cash Generation 
(less strain) plus Own Funds impacting 
management actions metric with a New 
Business Contribution (‘NBC’) metric.  
NBC is a measure of the day one value  
of writing new business on a discounted 
basis. The metric is more aligned to peer 
disclosures and reflects feedback from  
the market over a preference for the use  
of a discounted metric within the business.  
A new Cost Savings metric will also be 
included which reflects the criticality of 
reducing our cost base in order to improve 
performance across our financial metrics. 
The targets are aligned to those defined as 
part of our strategic cost review. The Open 
Net Flows metric that was used in 2023  
to incentivise growth in our Pensions and 
Savings business will now be a Group  
Net Flows metric, which aligns with our 
external reporting and supports our focus  
on improving overall Group net funds flows.  
No changes are proposed to the definitions 
or weightings of our Customer metrics in  
the AIP assessment. 

For the 2024 LTIP, the Group In-force  
Long Term Free Cash metric will be  
replaced by a Return on Capital metric to 
provide a measure of the efficiency of the 
Company’s use of capital. The Persistency 
metric in the previous year’s LTIP will be 
replaced by a Cumulative Net Flows metric, 
which demonstrates our commitment to 
incentivising growth in new business and 
retention of existing business. Following  
a significant reduction in emissions from 
operations, the Decarbonisation from 
Operations metric (10% weighting) will be 
replaced by a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
metric measuring ethnicity representation 
amongst our senior leadership population. 

Consistent with previous years, targets have 
been set with reference to the Group Annual 
Operating Plan and maximum payouts will 
only be delivered in the event of exceptional 
performance. The LTIP targets are disclosed 
prospectively on page 127.

Corporate governanceCorporate governanceDirectors’ Remuneration report continued

Implementation of pay in 2024
The Committee decided that there will  
be no increase to the base salary of either 
Andy Briggs and Rakesh Thakrar in 2024. 
The Company continues to target increases 
to more junior and lower paid colleagues  
this year with a pay award budget of 4.4%. 
Further details on how we implement pay for 
the wider workforce is set out on page 133.

Looking forward
I hope that the implementation of pay as set 
out in this report will meet our shareholders’ 
expectations and will receive a favourable 
voting outcome in the resolution proposed  
at the 2024 AGM. I would welcome any 
comments you may have on this report  
as I begin my first full year as Chair of  
the Committee. 

Nicholas Shott
Remuneration Committee Chair
21 March 2024

Consistent with the approach for executive 
directors, there will be no increases to 
Non-Executive Director base fees in 2024. 
The Chair’s fee was last reviewed in August 
2021 with the next review due to take place  
in August 2024. For simplicity, it has been 
decided not to proceed with the review in 
2024 and instead to consider the Chair’s  
fee at the same time as the annual review  
of Non-Executive Director fees from 2025, 
which is normally in quarter one.

Pay for performance
A material portion of total remuneration is based on variable  
pay (c.80% of total maximum remuneration for the Group CEO  
and Group CFO). Performance targets are set with reference to 
Annual Operating Plan (‘AOP’) and consensus such that maximum 
payouts can only be achieved for exceptional performance.  
Under the maximum scenario, over 63% of the Group’s CEO 
maximum remuneration is delivered in shares, deferred for three 
years under the DBSS and subject to a combined vesting and  
holding period of 5 years for LTIP. This ensures strong alignment 
between Executive Directors and shareholders.

Share ownership guidelines (‘SOGs’)

A significant proportion of Executive 
remuneration is delivered in shares which  
are released over a period of five years.  
In combination with our shareholding  
guidelines, this aligns Executive Directors  
with shareholders over the long-term.  
As at 31 December 2023, shareholdings  
for Andy Briggs and Rakesh Thakrar are  
shown to the right.

Further details on SOGs, including

Consists of base salary, benefits and pension:
• Base salary is the salary to be paid in 2024. 
• Benefits measured as benefits to be paid in 2024.
• Pension measured as the full entitlement of approximately 10.6% of base salary receivable (after the reduction to payments made 

in cash for employers’ National Insurance Contributions).

On-target

Based on what the Executive Director would receive if performance was on-target:
• AIP: consists of the on-target annual incentive (100% of base salary).
• LTIP: consists of the threshold level of vesting (50% of base salary for Group CEO and Group CFO). 

In addition, the potential value of ShareSave and Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) participation is also recognised.

Maximum Based on the maximum remuneration receivable:

• AIP: consists of the maximum annual incentive (200% of base salary).
• LTIP: assumes maximum vesting of awards and valued as on the date of grant (award of 275% of base salary for Group CEO and 200% 

of base salary for Group CFO). ShareSave and SIP valued on the same basis as in the on-target row.

Maximum 
with  
Growth

Based on the maximum remuneration receivable assuming share price growth of 50%:
• AIP: consists of the maximum annual incentive (200% of base salary).
• LTIP: assumes maximum vesting of awards and valued as on the date of grant (award of 275% of base salary for Group CEO and 200% 

of base salary for Group CFO) and assumes 50% share price growth. ShareSave and SIP valued on the same basis as in the on-target row.

 The Executive Directors are entitled to adjust their salary/benefit combination under flexible benefits arrangements and the figures shown are before individual elections.
 Benefits for Executive Directors include car allowance, private medical insurance, other taxable allowances, ShareSave and matching shares awarded under the Share Incentive Plan.  
No individual benefit provided has a value which is significant enough to warrant separate disclosure. 
 Executive Directors are entitled to each receive a Company pension contribution of 12% which may be paid as a cash supplement, reduced for the effect of employers’ National Insurance 
Contributions. Andy Briggs received his whole contribution as a cash supplement (10.6%) and Rakesh Thakrar received a combination of cash supplement and contribution (10.8%).  
No Director participated in a defined benefit pension arrangement in the year and none have any prospective entitlement to a defined benefit pension arrangement.
 Annual incentive amounts are presented inclusive of any amounts which must be deferred into shares for three years and which are subject to continued employment (i.e. 50% of the AIP award  
for 2023). In 2023 £613,644 of Andy Briggs’s incentive payment is subject to three-year deferral delivered in shares (2022: deferral of £526,416), and £344,706 of Rakesh Thakrar’s incentive payment 
is subject to a similar deferral (2022: deferral of £300,280). 
 The 2023 value for long-term incentives is an estimate of the vesting outcomes for LTIP awards granted in 2021 which are due to vest once the Full Year results are announced. This vesting level  
is at 41.1% reflecting outcomes against the Net Operating Cash Receipts, Return on Shareholder Value, Persistency and Relative TSR performance measures to 31 December 2023 (see page 122). 
This vesting outcome is then applied to the average share price between 2 October 2023 and 29 December 2023 (478.621 pence) to produce the estimated long-term incentives figures shown  
for 2023 in the above table. The assumptions will be trued up for actual share price at the day of vesting in the Directors’ Remuneration report for 2024. For Andy Briggs, the disclosed LTIP figure  
of £739k comprises the disclosed LTIP figure of £587,837 for the value of the proportion of the original LTIP award which ultimately vested, plus the value of dividend roll-up on those shares  
of £150,679. All values are calculated using the three-month average share price to 29 December 2023 (478.621 pence). For Rakesh Thakrar, the disclosed LTIP figure of £289k comprises the 
disclosed LTIP figure of £229,791 for the value of the proportion of the original LTIP award which ultimately vested, plus the value of dividend roll-up on those shares of £58,899. No portion  
of the awards for Andy or Rakesh related to share price appreciation.
 For 2020’s LTIP awards which are reflected in the 2022 long-term incentives column above, the performance conditions were met as to 44.3% of maximum. The 2022 long-term incentives values in 
the above table reflect the value of the Company’s shares on the date of vesting which was 13 March 2023 (598.4 pence per share) multiplied by the number of shares vesting whereas the equivalent 
figure within the published 2022 Single Figure Table was an estimate which reflected the average share price between 1 October 2022 and 31 December 2022 (570.5 pence per share) and certain 
assumptions regarding the cumulative value of dividends on the number of shares vesting.

AIP outcomes for 2023 – Audited information
The overall weightings between Corporate measures and Strategic Scorecard for AIP in 2023 were:

• 80% – Corporate (financial and customer) performance measures.

• 20% – Strategic Scorecard (strategic company priorities).

As described in the Remuneration policy, 50% of 2023 AIP outcomes will be delivered as an award of deferred shares under the DBSS which  
will vest after a three-year deferral period subject to continued employment or good leaver status.

Corporate (financial and customer) performance measures
The Corporate (financial and customer) measures represent 80% of the overall incentive opportunity. The table below details the outcome 
against the measures and targets that were agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the year.

 Customer Feedback scores as reported through a survey following telephony service, where customers can rate us between 1–5. The approach is now consistent across each platform/entity for 2023. 
The target was reduced from 91% in 2022 to 88% in 2023 in light of implementing this consistent survey approach across Phoenix Group; the Committee was satisfied the targets remained 
equivalently stretching to prior years.
 Customer Satisfaction scores as gathered immediately following Customer Digital journeys, where customers can rate their experience between 1–5. For Standard Life, all transactional journeys for 
which feedback is live on our secure site including all transactional journeys for which feedback is live on our mobile app. For Phoenix Life, encashment journey for which survey is live on MyPhoenix.
 Percentage of all back-office manual workflow completed within service level (services levels vary across entities). Across entities this includes Claims & Servicing, with Standard Life also including 
new business acquisition and straight through processing. The target was reduced from 92% in 2022 to 90% in 2023 to align with our in-house manpower model and contractual agreements with 
OSPs which have a 90% target; the Committee was satisfied the targets remained equivalently stretching to prior years.

Total Cash generation in 2023 benefitted from particularly strong management actions delivery including the completion of one of the largest 
UK insurance Part VII transfers ever completed, with the funds merger of the Standard Life and Phoenix Life businesses into Phoenix Life Limited. 
The Part VII transfer created additional free surplus within our life companies through the realisation of the diversification benefit, which enabled 
the Group to significantly increase total cash generation in 2023.

Incremental New Business Long-Term Cash Generation (less strain) plus Own Funds impacting Management Actions benefitted from a  
strong year of organic growth and management actions delivery. Our organic growth was supported by targeted participation in a growing  
BPA market, and strong growth in our Workplace business, as we retain our existing schemes and win new schemes in the market.

As described in the Committee Chair’s covering letter (page 113), Phoenix has achieved strong financial and non-financial performance and 
progress on key strategic objectives during the year. The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration outcomes for 2023 are an appropriate 
reflection of the year’s business performance and its trajectory providing strong alignment between pay and performance and with appropriate 
regard to both the management of risk within our incentives and the broader stakeholder experience. Prior to confirming the outcomes for  
the 2023 AIP, the Committee reviewed in detail the extent to which the Group had operated within its stated risk appetite during the year and 
determined that no moderation of the 2023 formulaic outcome was necessary. Separately, the Committee made individual adjustments to the 
AIP outcomes which are set out on page 121.

Whilst the performance measures for the 2024 AIP have been disclosed (see Implementation of Remuneration policy for 2024 on page 126),  
the actual performance targets for these measures are regarded as commercially sensitive at the current time and accordingly are not disclosed. 
However, as in previous years, the Group intends to disclose the performance targets for 2024’s AIP retrospectively in next year’s Remuneration 
report on a similar basis to the disclosures made above in respect of 2023’s AIP. 

Strategic Scorecard
The Strategic Scorecard represents 20% of the overall incentive opportunity. Metrics and targets relating to this scorecard were agreed by the 
Remuneration Committee at the start of the year. The table below details the outcome against targets of the Strategic Scorecard together with 
respective weightings and outturns for the Group CEO and Group CFO.

 The SLOC integration target was reduced from £19m to £16m following a review of the definition of activity in scope. The Committee was satisfied that the revised base was equally stretching  
as originally intended.

Each year the Committee reviews the AIP outcomes in the context of the Group’s management of risk, overall business performance and the 
broader stakeholder experience. In reviewing the 2023 AIP outcome, the Committee considered the delays faced during the year relating  
to the IFRS 17 project. As Group CFO, Rakesh Thakrar had the principal responsibility for delivering the project in a timely manner, so the 
Committee decided it was appropriate to use its discretion to reduce his AIP outcome by £75,000 (10%). Andy Briggs recognises that,  
as Group CEO, he has ultimate accountability for all projects, including IFRS 17. Accordingly, in discussion with the Committee, he suggested  
– and the Committee agreed – that he should forgo £50,000 (4%) of his AIP outcome.

As a result of these reductions, the Committee determined it was appropriate to pay the following outcomes under the AIP:

Underpin and discretion
In addition to the above targets, the Committee confirmed that the underpin performance condition relating to risk management within the 
Group, customer satisfaction and, in exceptional cases, personal performance had been achieved in the performance period.

Windfall gains 
The Committee reviewed the grant price of the 2021 LTIP (736.2 pence) compared to the grant price of the 2020 LTIP (620.54 pence) and was 
satisfied that no adjustments were required to the awards on grant for windfall gains. The Committee has again reviewed the position ahead of 
the vesting, taking into account Phoenix Group’s share price as at 29 February 2024 (496.35 pence) and is satisfied that no windfall gains have 
occurred and that no adjustment is required on vesting.

 The Committee must also consider whether the TSR performance is reflective of the underlying performance of the Company measured over three financial years commencing with the year of award. 

A consistent approach to target setting for the LTIP metrics has been taken each year with reference to the Group’s long range plan so that 
delivery of target performance is considered to be comparably stretching for each award. As a result, the cash targets have not always increased 
and did indeed reduce in 2022 and 2023 reflecting our business model shifting from being a closed life consolidator to an organic growth 
business. The 2024 LTIP cash targets disclosed on page 127 have again been set with reference to the Group’s business plan and are higher than 
in 2023.

LTIP underpin
Awards are subject to an underpin relating to risk management within the Group, consideration of customer satisfaction and, to meet Solvency II 
requirements, in exceptional cases, personal performance.

 In addition to the share options awarded under the LTIP shown above, dividends are awarded as additional options at vest. Dividends calculated are based on the final vesting figure  
(post-performance) to reflect dividends paid from the date of award to the date of vest. Once the additional holding period of two years has been reached, further dividends are awarded  
to reflect dividends paid from the date of vest to the end of the holding period. 
 Whilst both Andy Briggs and Rakesh Thakrar had LTIP awards which have vested, they cannot be exercised due to the additional two-year holding requirement resulting in an overall gain  
of £nil in 2023 (2022: £645,224).
 The 2020 LTIP award vested at 44.3% of maximum. The 2019 LTIP award vested at 78.4% of maximum.
 LTIP awards granted on 12 March 2021 will vest after the 2023 Full year results are announced. LTIP awards made to all members of the Executive Committee are subject to a three-year  
performance period and a two-year holding period.

DBSS 
The DBSS is the share scheme used for the deferral of the AIP. Whilst no performance conditions are applicable, awards are subject to continued 
employment or a good leaver status.

  In addition to the share options awarded under the DBSS shown above, dividends are awarded as additional options at vest. Dividends calculated are based the final vesting figure to reflect 
dividends paid from the date of award to the date of vest.

2   Gains of Directors (Rakesh Thakrar only) from share options exercised and vesting shares under the DBSS in 2023 was £102,537.03 (2022: £91,800.33) arising from an award exercised  

on 27 March 2023 at a share price of 547.2 pence.

The face value represents the maximum vesting of awards granted (but before any credit for dividends over the period to vesting) and  
is calculated using a share price of the average of the closing middle market prices of Phoenix shares for the three dealing days preceding  
the award date (2023 LTIP and DBSS award share price was 576.6 pence).

1  Share interests values have reduced due to SIP matching shares being included previously.

The Directors’ share interests of the following Directors have increased between 31 December 2023 and 21 March 2024 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to the release of this Annual Report). Andy Briggs and Rakesh Thakrar acquired an additional 89 shares each following 
purchases under the Group’s Share Incentive Plan. There were no other changes between these dates.

Shareholding requirements – Audited information

enter into any hedging contract in respect of their participation in the AIP, LTIP, ShareSave, Share Incentive Plan or any other incentive plan of  
the Company, or pledge awards in such plans as collateral, and additionally that they will neither enter into a hedging contract in respect of,  
nor pledge as collateral, any shares which are required to be held for the purposes of the Company’s shareholding requirements or any vested LTIP 
award shares subject to a LTIP holding period.

The Committee regularly reviews the performance measures of the incentive plans to ensure they remain aligned with 
our strategy, are appropriately challenging, support the Company’s culture and values, and create value for stakeholders. 
As detailed in the Committee Chair’s covering letter on page 114 the metrics for the 2024 AIP are shown below. 

The Strategic Scorecard reflects 20% of the Executive Directors’ AIP. This will include a number of the strategic priorities 
for the year (but avoiding duplication with any outcomes under the Corporate element) and which can be clearly 
articulated and measured. Sustainability remains at the heart of our purpose and ESG metrics continue to form part  
of the Strategic Scorecard elements of the Executive Directors.

The overall weightings between Corporate measures and Strategic Scorecard for AIP in 2024 are:
• Corporate (financial and customer) performance measures – 80%; no change from 2023.
• Strategic Scorecard (strategic Company priorities ) – 20%; no change from 2023.

The weightings of the AIP performance measures for 2024 are summarised below:
Performance measure

Total Cash Generation
New Business Contribution 
Cost Savings

Customer Experience

Whilst the performance measures for the 2024 AIP are disclosed above, the actual performance targets for  
these measures are regarded as commercially sensitive at the current time and accordingly are not disclosed.  
However, as in previous years, the Group intends to disclose the performance targets for 2024’s AIP retrospectively  
in next year’s Remuneration report on a similar basis to the disclosures made above in respect of 2023’s AIP.

Outcomes from performance measures for 2024’s AIP may be moderated by the Remuneration Committee in line  
with the approved Remuneration policy. This will include a review by the Remuneration Committee of the extent to  
which the Group has operated within its stated risk appetite and that there are no other risk-related concerns that would 
necessitate moderation before any 2024 AIP outcomes are confirmed. The targets for the specific performance 
measures for the AIP in 2024 are regarded as commercially sensitive by the Group but will be disclosed retrospectively 
in the Remuneration report for 2024. 

Deferred Bonus Share  
Scheme (‘DBSS’)

50% of AIP outcomes for 2024 will be delivered as an award of deferred shares under the DBSS which will vest after  
a three-year deferral period.
DBSS awards made in 2024 (in respect of 2023’s AIP outcome) will be made automatically on the fourth dealing day 
following the announcement of the Group’s 2023 annual results in accordance with the Remuneration policy.

The number of shares for DBSS awards will be calculated using the average share price for the three dealing days before 
the grant of the DBSS awards. The three-year deferral period will run to the three-year anniversary of the making of the 
DBSS awards. Dividend entitlements for the shares subject to DBSS awards will accrue over the three-year deferral period.

Long Term Incentive  
Plan (‘LTIP’)

Awards under the LTIP will be made automatically on the fourth dealing day following the announcement of the Group’s 
Full or Half year results under a procedure similar to that described above for awards under the DBSS. 

The number of shares for LTIP awards will be calculated using the average share price for the three dealing days before 
the grant of the LTIP awards. The initial three-year vesting period will run to the three-year anniversary of the granting  
of the LTIP awards. At this time, the performance conditions will be determined.

All annual LTIP awards made to Executive Directors are subject to a holding period so that any LTIP awards for which the 
performance conditions are satisfied will not be released for a further two-years from the third anniversary of the original 
award date. Dividend accrual for LTIP awards will continue until the end of the holding period.

The Committee reviews the performance measures and targets of the LTIP each year to ensure these are aligned  
to Phoenix Group’s strategic priorities, are appropriately challenging, support the Company’s culture and values,  
and create value for stakeholders. For the 2024 LTIP, the Long-Term Free Cash metric will be replaced by a Return  
on Capital metric to provide a measure of the efficiency of the Company’s use of capital. The Persistency metric in  
the previous year’s LTIP will be replaced by a Cumulative Net Flows metric, which demonstrates our commitment to 
incentivising growth in new business and retention of existing business. Following a significant reduction in emissions 
from operations, the Decarbonisation from Operations metric (10% weighting) will be replaced by a Diversity,  
Equity & Inclusion metric measuring ethnicity representation amongst our senior leadership population. 

The targets are measured over a period of three financial years, commencing with financial year 2024.  
As detailed in the Committee Chair’s covering letter on page 114 the 2024 LTIP measures have changed.  
Measures, weightings and targets are shown below:

Net Operating Cash Receipts (20%)
Return on Capital (20%)

Decarbonisation – Investment Portfolio1 (10%)

Includes where the approved strategy can be to take no further action.
 The current Race and Ethnicity % senior leadership figure is based on c. 68% workforce coverage/respondents at the time the targets were set.  
A new data capture exercise is underway and as part of this the starting point will be assessed in H2 and any impact on target considered.

As described on page 123, the 2024 LTIP cash targets are higher than in 2023. A consistent approach to target setting  
is taken each year with reference to the Group’s business plan so that delivery of target performance is considered to  
be comparably stretching for each award.

All 2024 LTIP awards are subject to an underpin relating to risk management within the Group, consideration of customer 
satisfaction and, to meet Solvency II requirements, in exceptional cases, personal performance. This underpin relating to 
the formulaic outturn of the LTIP reflects the extent to which the Group has operated within its stated risk appetite and 
ensures that Management is not incentivised to accept risk outside of appetite in the pursuit of improved delivery against 
LTIP performance targets. It also offers a broader assessment than the previous focus on the management of the Group’s 
debt position. 

For the Group CEO, awards vesting under the LTIP will be subject to a cap on threshold performance of the lower  
of 50% of salary or 25% of maximum vesting.

The rules of the Company’s LTIP reserve discretion for the Committee to adjust the outturn for any LTIP performance 
measures (from zero to any cap) should it consider that to be appropriate. The Committee may operate this discretion 
having regard to such factors as it considers relevant, including the performance of the Group, any individual or business.

All-Employee Share Plans

With regard to the 2024 LTIP grants to be made in March, the Committee will review the outcome at the point of vesting 
in 2027 to consider if any windfall gains have been made.
Executive Directors have the opportunity to participate in HMRC tax advantaged ShareSave and Share Incentive Plans 
on the same basis as all other UK employees. Employees based in the Republic of Ireland and Germany have the 
opportunity to join the Irish SIP and International Purchase Plan.

All incentive plans are subject to malus/clawback. See ‘Notes to the Remuneration policy table’ on pages 122 to 125 of the 2022 Annual Report 
for details.

 The amounts within the benefits columns reflect the fact that the reimbursement of expenses to Non-Executive Directors for travel and accommodation costs incurred in attending Phoenix Group 
Holdings plc Board and associated meetings represent a taxable benefit. This position has been clarified with HMRC and the amounts shown are for reimbursed travel and accommodation expenses 
(and the related tax liability which is settled by the Group).
 Nicholas Lyons stepped down from the Board on 1 September 2022 and commenced his sabbatical. He returned as Chair of the Group Board on 1 December 2023.
 Alastair Barbour became Chair of the Group Board on 1 September 2022 and stepped down from the position of Chair of the Group Board and the Nomination Committee on 30 November 2023. 
Alastair Barbour then retired from the Board on 31 December 2023.

4  Stephanie Bruce retired from the Board on 11 May 2023 and waived all emoluments with regard to her Directors’ fees.
5  Eleanor Bucks was appointed as a Director on 1 December 2023.
6  Mark Gregory was appointed as a Director on 1 April 2023 and became a member of the Risk Committee on 1 April 2023.
7  Hiroyuki Iioka has waived all current and future emoluments with regard to his Directors’ fees.
8  David Scott was appointed as a Director on 11 May 2023 and has waived all current and future emoluments with regard to his Directors’ fees.
9  Nicholas Shott became Chair of the Remuneration Committee on 4 May 2023.
10  Kory Sorenson retired from the Board on 30 June 2023. 
11  

 The increase in fees for Non-Executive Directors of the Company reflect the increase in base fee from 2022 to 2023 and fees in relation to chairing a committee as well as changes  
to committee membership.

The aggregate remuneration of all Executive and Non-Executive Directors under salary, fees, benefits, cash supplements in lieu of pensions  
and annual incentive was £5.963 million (2022: £6.181 million).

On 1 April 2023 the base fee for Non-Executive Directors increased by 4%, lower than that of the wider workforce. Consistent with the approach 
for executive directors, there will be no increases to Non-Executive Directors’ base fees in 2024. 

The Chair’s fee was last reviewed in August 2021 with the next review due to take place in August 2024. For simplicity, it has been decided not  
to proceed with the review in 2024 and instead to consider the Chair’s fee at the same time as the annual review of Non-Executive Director fees 
from 2025, which is normally in quarter one.

The total figure of remuneration for 2020 shown above is a combination of the single figures for Clive Bannister and Andy Briggs to reflect the 
change in Group CEO in 2020.

The DRR regulations also require that this performance graph is supported by a table summarising aspects of the Group CEO’s remuneration  
for the period covered by the above graph.

1  Andy Briggs was not in receipt of a 2019 LTIP due to the timing of his appointment.
2 

 Clive Bannister left the role of Group CEO on 10 March 2020 and left Phoenix Group on the same date. Andy Briggs was appointed to the Board on 10 February 2020 and remained  
as CEO-designate until 10 March 2020.

3  See footnote 11 on page 130 of the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts for details of Andy Briggs’s LTIP vesting.
4  Clive Bannister’s 2020 single figure of total remuneration does not include compensation for loss of office. 
5  

 Clive Bannister’s 2020 single figure of total remuneration does not include any value in respect of the 2018 LTIP. LTIP awards which vested after Clive Bannister stepped down from the Board  
of the Company have been reported as Payments to Past Directors on page 132 of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts and are not included in the single figure of total remuneration, in line  
with the reporting regulations.
 The single figure of total remuneration for 2019 has been restated and now reflects the actual price of shares on the day the 2017 LTIP vested (24 March 2020, 557.4 pence per share) rather than  
the three-month average share price to 31 December 2019 (717.09 pence per share) which was required to be used last year for the single figure of total remuneration.

6 

7  The long-term incentive vesting rate is shown as 57%. The group CEO decided to voluntarily waive any entitlement in excess of two-thirds of the shares which would otherwise have vested.

CEO pay ratio
The table below details the CEO pay ratio for the year ended 31 December 2023, in line with the UK regulatory requirements. The ratios 
compare the CEO total pay against the pay of three UK employees, whose earnings represent the lower quartile, median, and upper quartile 
positions of the UK employee population. The calculations are based on Option A of the three methodologies, which we believe is the most 
statistically robust approach.

The CEO value used is the total single figure remuneration data for 2023 (as detailed on page 119). For the 2023 ratio, the total compensation 
figure for UK employees follows the same methodology as for the CEO and is based on a full-time equivalent of actual earnings including 
amounts due from incentive plans. 

The Group reviewed the pay of the three identified employees at the 25th percentile, 50th percentile (median) and 75th percentile and 
concluded that they were a fair representation of pay at the relevant quartiles of the UK employee base. Each individual was a direct employee 
on a permanent or fixed-term contract during 2023 and received remuneration in line with Group-wide remuneration policies. None received  
an exceptional award that would otherwise inflate their pay figure. 

The table below sets out the salary and total single figure remuneration for the Group CEO and percentile employees included in the below ratios.

The reduction in ratio for 2023 reflects the lower level of total compensation for the CEO compared to 2022 due in part to the lower AIP outturn 
and LTIP vesting figures. Additionally, salary and total compensation levels at the relevant data points have increased reflecting our changed 
demographic as result of the Group-wide organisational review and capability uplift to deliver on our future strategy, in particular in our growth 
centres. The figures are also impacted by a number of lower earners transferring out of the Group as part of our ongoing outsource strategy.

Colleagues are also eligible to participate in our all-employee share plans, which were not included in the values in the employee single figure. 
Nearly half of all employees participate in Phoenix Group’s growth and success through either the ShareSave Scheme, the Share Incentive Plan 
or the International Purchase Plan.

Phoenix Group is committed to attracting best in class talent at all levels with a compelling and competitive total reward proposition. This includes 
a holistic core and flexible suite of benefits with the ability to customise these to meet individual needs, as well as industry-leading people policies 
including equal parental leave.

We are confident that the median pay ratio reported this year is consistent with our approach to pay, reward, career progression and growth  
for all colleagues. All colleagues have the opportunity for annual pay awards, performance-driven pay and recognition, as well as access to 
opportunities to develop their careers at Phoenix Group, ensuring we create an environment for everyone to feel it is the best place our 
colleagues have ever worked. 

Directors’ percentage change in pay 2022 to 2023 
In accordance with the DRR regulations, the table below provides a comparison of the percentage change in the prescribed pay elements  
of each individual who was a Director during the year (salary, taxable benefits and annual incentive outcomes) between financial years 2022  
and 2023 and the equivalent percentage changes in the average of all staff employed by Phoenix Group. As no staff are employed directly by 
Phoenix Group Holdings plc, we have disclosed information for an appropriate group that is representative of the employees of Phoenix Group 
and its subsidiaries, in line with the regulatory guidance for this disclosure). This group was selected as being representative of the wider 
workforce using the same process as was used for this comparison in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts.

1  The Taxable Benefits figures used for Andy Briggs and Rakesh Thakrar includes ongoing taxable benefits only.
2 

 The Taxable Benefits figures reflect a change in approach to reporting from 2022 whereby the benefits under the ShareSave and Share Incentive Plan (previously included within the LTIP figure 
within the Single Figure Table) are now included within Taxable Benefits instead. 
 The increase in fees for Non-Executive Directors of the company reflects the increases in base fees from 2022 to 2023 and fees in relation to chairing a committee and membership of a committee 
as well as changes to the membership of a committee. See page 128 for further details on fees and taxable benefits for Non-Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the AIP.

3 

4  No taxable benefit received in the prior year and therefore not possible to calculate a percentage change.
5  Eleanor Bucks, Mark Gregory and David Scott, are newly appointed Directors and therefore it is not possible to calculate a percentage change.
6  Whilst Alistair Barbour, Kory Sorenson and Stephanie Bruce resigned from the Board in 2023, their details have been included as they were active members during the year.

For both Executive Directors the figures shown above reflect the change in the total salary figures as disclosed in the Single Figure Table for  
the years 2022 and 2023. As the disclosures reflect salary earned during 2023 compared to salary earned during 2022 the figures shown above 
do not therefore equate to 4%. The agreed increase of 4% of salary was applied to the salaries of both Executive Directors in April 2023.

The reduction in taxable benefits figure reflects a lower premium for private medical cover in 2023 (whilst retaining the same level of cover).  
The reduction for Rakesh also reflects that the 2022 figure included a gain under his ShareSave Scheme; there was no such gain in 2023.

The change in Annual Incentive for both Executive Directors reflects the increase in maximum potential incentive for the 2023 performance year 
from 150% to 200% of salary. 

With regard to the figures for the wider employee population:
• The pay review in April 2023 was operated using a consistent approach with a pay budget of 6%. As in 2022, the pay budget was focused 

on colleagues at lower grades ensuring a higher increase for this population compared to more senior colleagues. Additional salary increases 
were awarded throughout the year, where appropriate, to ensure consistency, internal relativities, and to retain talent. A separate exercise 
was also undertaken to review all senior management compensation to ensure market alignment. As part of this review, car allowance was 
removed and an appropriate sum in lieu of this was added to base salary. The changes made as a result of this exercise have impacted the 
figure shown above. 

• The change to the taxable benefits figure compared to 2022 is largely as a result of: (i) a reduction in the PMI premium for 2023; (ii) the removal 
of car allowance where appropriate; and (iii) the post-pandemic £1,000 payment to all colleagues below senior management and the working 
from home allowance were not continued beyond 2022. As in previous years, ShareSave and Share Incentive Plan values are not included 
in the wider employee population figures.

• The increase in annual incentive payments compared to 2022 relates primarily to the fact that bonuses are salary linked. Over 2023 base 

salaries increased on average by 8.9% driven by the high inflation environment in the UK over this period and other factors described under 
both the pay review paragraph above and the CEO Ratio on page 130.

2023

Profit distributed by way of dividend has been taken as the dividend paid and proposed in respect of the relevant financial year. For 2023 this  
is the Interim dividend paid (£260 million) and the recommended Final dividend of 26.65 pence per share multiplied by the total share capital 
issued at the date of the Annual Report and Accounts as set out in note D1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. No share 
buy-backs were made in the year.

Overall expenditure on pay has been taken as employee costs as set out in note C5 ‘Expenses’ in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
Expenditure on pay has increased by 9% in the period reflecting the impact of the continued planned expansion of key areas in the Pensions 
and Savings and Retirement Solutions business, the acquisition of the Sun Life of Canada UK business, as well as the impact of a 6% pay increase 
to the wider workforce and the resulting higher share scheme costs. These increases have been partly offset by the impact from the Group’s 
Transition and Transformation programme which has reduced headcount within the customer teams in 2023.

Wider workforce pay
Alignment to wider workforce
The Committee considers a range of factors when setting the remuneration for Executive Directors, one of which is the alignment with 
remuneration practices across the wider workforce. Phoenix provides colleagues across the Group with a competitive reward package  
with details of each element included in the table below. 

Salary 

Executive Directors and Executive Committee
Salaries are reviewed annually and increases are typically in line with  
or less than the wider employee population.

Senior Management

Wider workforce
Base salary is the basis for a  
competitive total reward package  
for all employees, and these are  
reviewed annually with engagement  
from employee representatives. 

Regular benchmarking exercises are 
carried out to ensure salaries remain 
competitive against the market.

We are an accredited Living Wage 
employer and all employees are paid  
at least the Real Living Wage.

Benefits and Pension All employees are eligible to participate in our range of flexible benefits and wellbeing initiatives in respective markets.

Core benefits include private medical cover, 12 times life assurance cover, group income protection and a range of flexible 
benefits. The level of core benefits is the same across all grades. 

Colleagues can participate in a share matching plan under the Phoenix SIP and, in the UK, the Phoenix ShareSave Scheme.

AIP

Deferral

LTIP

SOGs

All employees are automatically enrolled in the Company’s Mastertrust pension scheme with a 10% core contribution and 2% 
matching contribution (plus salary sacrifice uplift of 10% of the employee contribution). Payment in lieu of contribution, reduced 
for the impact of employer’s NIC is permitted where lifetime or annual limits are reached. Separate occupational pension 
schemes with varying contribution rates operate in Ireland and Germany. 
All permanent and fixed-term employees are eligible to participate in an AIP which is based on Group measures, business unit 
performance (where applicable) and personal objectives. Malus and clawback provisions apply.
Half of any AIP award is subject  
to deferral into shares for  
a three- year period. 

One third of any AIP award  
is subject to deferral into shares  
for a three-year period. 

Deferral where required on an  
individual basis for Solvency II purposes. 

Malus and clawback  
provisions apply.
Senior executives participate in a LTIP with a three-year performance period  
and vesting is subject to Group performance outcomes.

Malus and clawback  
provisions apply.

Measures and targets for long-term incentive plans are consistent for all participants 
and measured over a three-year period.

Malus and clawback  
provisions apply.

A number of colleagues with exceptional 
achievements during the performance 
year are considered for a long-term 
incentive award in the form of Phoenix 
shares with a vesting period of three years.

Malus and clawback provisions apply.
A two-year holding period after the 
vesting date also applies for LTIPs.
Shareholding requirements ensure 
greater alignment with interests

Consideration of employee pay
When determining the Remuneration policy and remuneration for our Executive Directors, the Committee took into consideration the pay  
and benefits of the wider workforce to ensure that our reward offering remains competitive, attractive, and suitably aligned to our Group 
performance, while supporting our values and purpose of helping people secure a life of possibilities. 

We have a reward policy that is broadly consistent for all levels of employees, with the same remuneration principles guiding reward decisions  
for all Group colleagues, including Executive Directors. The AIP and LTIP performance metrics are the same for Executive Directors as for other 
eligible colleagues, with a higher proportion of total remuneration for the Executive Directors linked to corporate performance. For certain 
areas, business unit aligned metrics are also included in their AIP. Pay for the wider colleague base is driven primarily by market practice 
and there is a standard benefit offering across all levels, except where the external market drives differences based on role accountability. 
Colleagues are also eligible to participate in the Group’s success through our share schemes (ShareSave and Share Incentive Plan) on the  
same basis as those offered to Executive Directors.

Corporate governanceCorporate governanceDirectors’ Remuneration report continued

We offer benefits which engage and retain our existing colleagues, as well as attract new talent to the organisation. To support this, we offer a 
transparent flexible and tailored reward package that is competitive in the market, with clear principles around pay, alongside comprehensive 
benefits and wellbeing support. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion agenda remains an integral underpin to our approach to reward and to support 
colleague we have extended our Private Medical Insurance for all colleagues to include the addition of IVF treatment and neurodiversity support. 

In 2023 we completed a holistic review of our reward framework to ensure it is appropriate for a business of our size, scale and potential.  
This work included externally benchmarking all roles and career levels to ensure alignment with the external market. A thorough process  
of validation and independent review was undertaken to ensure all colleagues are treated fairly. A number of changes to our grade structure 
were introduced to help accurately define and reward the contribution every role makes. In response to colleague feedback, we also  
published a refreshed and Group-wide set of pay ranges for 2024, rigorously benchmarked using external pay data and designed to give 
greater transparency and confidence on pay at Phoenix Group.  To conclude this extensive remuneration review, we have committed that  
any colleague below the minimum of their pay range will have their fixed pay increased to that minimum level, as a priority, in the 2024 fixed  
pay review. We are a proud Real Living Wage employer, and are committed to ensuring that these pay ranges, which are reviewed annually,  
will always be at or above the Real Living Wage.

Equal pay and consistency of treatment for all colleagues, irrespective of gender or ethnicity, are integral guiding principles of the reward 
practices across the Group. The remuneration principles and framework are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure these are aligned with  
the Group’s purpose, values and sustainability strategy. Maggie Semple, our Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement,  
has joined the Remuneration Committee in 2024 and will provide additional input to the Committee on the views of the wider workforce.  
Further details of Maggie Semple’s engagement with the workforce throughout 2023 are shown on pages 108 to 110 of the Corporate 
governance report.

The tables above have been included to comply with UKLA Listing Rule 9.8.8. In the event of cessation of a Non-Executive Director’s appointment 
(excluding the Chair of the Group Board) they would be entitled to a one-month notice period. The Chair of the Group Board, as detailed in his 
letter of appointment, would be entitled to a six-month notice period.

Dilution
The Group monitors the number of shares issued under the Group’s employee share plans and their impact on dilution limits. The Group’s 
current practice is for all the executive share plans to use market purchase shares which are held in the Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust) on 
exercise of any awards. There is a dividend waiver in place for all shares held in the Trust. For the Group’s all-employee ShareSave Scheme only, 
new shares are issued. Therefore the usage of shares compared to the 10% dilution limits (in any rolling ten-year period) set by the Investment 
Association in respect of all share plans as at 31 December 2023 is 1.39% and no shares count towards the dilution limit for executive plans only 
(5% in any rolling ten-year period). 

Advice provided to the Committee
During the year, the Committee received independent remuneration advice from its appointed adviser, PwC, which is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group (the professional body for remuneration consultants) and adheres to its code of conduct. The Remuneration 
Committee was satisfied that the advice provided by PwC was objective and independent.

PwC also provided general consultancy services to management during the year including support on other Board and Risk matters and 
technical advice regarding share schemes. Separate teams within PwC provided unrelated services in respect of tax, assurance, risk consulting, 
sustainability and transaction support during the year. The Committee is satisfied that these activities did not compromise the independence  
or objectivity of the advice it has received from PwC as Remuneration Committee advisers.

PwC’s fees for work relating to the Committee for 2023 were £142,844 which included continued support for the renewal of the Remuneration 
policy. These were charged on the basis of the firm’s standard terms of business for advice provided. 

The Committee assesses the performance of its advisers regularly, the associated level of fees and reviews the quality of advice provided  
to ensure that it is independent of any support provided to Management.

Directors’ service contracts
The dates of contracts and letters of appointment and the respective notice periods for Directors are as follows:

The Group CEO, Group HR Director, Executive Reward Director and Group Finance Director, attend by invitation various Committee meetings 
during the year. No Executive is ever permitted to participate in discussions or decisions regarding his or her own remuneration.

 The date of expiry refers to each individual Directors’ letter of appointment which covers a three-year term. All Directors are subject to annual re-election at the AGM on 14 May 2024. 

The Committee consults with the Chief Risk Officer (without Management present) on a regular basis. The Chief Risk Officer is asked to detail 
the extent to which the Group has operated within its stated risk appetite during the year and to keep the Committee informed of any risk-related 
concerns that required the Committee to consider using its judgement to moderate incentive plan outcomes. The Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee also sits on the Risk Committee to enable additional linkage between risk matters and remuneration outcomes.

The Directors’ Remuneration policy 

This appendix contains the Directors’ Remuneration policy approved 
by the Group’s shareholders at the Group’s 2023 AGM. It applies for  
a period of three years, until the 2026 AGM, unless a revised policy  
is approved by shareholders before then.

General policy
The Remuneration policy for Executive Directors is summarised in the table below along with the policy on the Chair’s and the Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees. Further details on the Remuneration policy can be found in the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts on pages 122 to 125.

Remuneration principles 

The Group’s overall positioning on remuneration for Executive Directors has been set with reference to the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, best practice and feedback received from shareholders during consultation.

An appropriate balance is maintained between fixed and variable components of remuneration.

Remuneration is aligned to the long-term success of the Group.

Remuneration takes account of the risk profile of the Group.

Remuneration supports a strong pay for performance culture.

Our Remuneration policy benchmarks the total target remuneration for the Executive Directors using appropriate market data sets which are 
consistent with those used for other roles in the Group.

This section does not form part of the Remuneration policy and is for information only.

How our Remuneration policy addresses the following factors set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
Clarity and simplicity
• The reward framework seeks to embed simplicity and transparency in the design and delivery of remuneration. Both the Corporate element 

and the Strategic Scorecard relating to the AIP have transparent, measurable metrics.

• We have included diagrams and charts in this Remuneration report to improve clarity for readers regarding the alignment of Executive 

remuneration with shareholders and our strategy.

Risk
• The Committee undertakes an annual review of risk before confirming the outcomes for the AIP to ensure that there are no risk-related 

concerns that require the moderation of AIP outcomes. 

•  Malus and clawback operate in respect of the AIP and LTIPs (see page 123 in the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts for details on trigger events).

• The Committee may apply discretion to override formulaic outcomes if they are considered inconsistent with the underlying performance 

of the Group.

Proportionality
• A high percentage of rewards are delivered in the form of shares, meaning Executive Directors are strongly aligned with shareholders

• Executive Directors are required to hold shares from LTIP awards for two years following vesting which provides focus on sustainable 

share price growth. Significant deferral levels under the AIP further align remuneration outcomes to shareholders.

Predictability
• The range of potential award levels to individual Executive Directors is set out in the scenario chart on page 118 which also demonstrates 

the impact of potential share price growth by 50% over the three-year performance period until LTIP vesting. 

Alignment to culture
•  We have engaged with our employees through Peakon (our employee engagement survey), PCRF (our colleague representative forum), 

our many employee networks, and our Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement to develop our values and to improve our 
understanding of what is required to become a high-performing organisation. Our remuneration philosophy supports our purpose and core values.

Element and purpose in

Base Salary
This is the core element of pay  
which supports the recruitment  
and retention of Executive Directors  
and reflects the individual’s role and 
position within the Group as well as  
their capability and contribution.

Benefits 
To provide other benefits valued by 
recipient.

Pension
To provide retirement benefits which 
keep Phoenix Group competitive within 
the marketplace and provide for the 
future of our employees.

Policy and operation 

Maximum

Performance measures

• Base salaries are reviewed each 

• Salary levels are specific to the role 

• N/A

and individual. 

• Maximum salary will be the median level 
of salaries for CEOs in the FTSE31–100 
(currently £812,000), provided that this 
figure may be increased in line with UK 
RPI inflation for the duration of this policy.

• However, when reviewing salaries for 

Executive Directors, the Remuneration 
Committee will also review the salaries, 
and salary increases, for senior 
management and employees in relevant
countries to maintain consistency. 
Percentage increases for Executive 
Directors will not exceed that of the 
broader employee population, other 
than in specific circumstances identified 
by the Remuneration Committee 
(e.g. in response to a substantial 
change in responsibilities). 

• It is not possible to prescribe the likely 
change in the cost of insured benefits 
or the cost of some of the other reported 
benefits year-to-year, but the provision 
of benefits will normally operate. 
• The Remuneration Committee will 

monitor the costs in practice and ensure 
that the overall costs do not increase 
by more than the Remuneration 
Committee considers to be appropriate 
in all the circumstances.

• Relocation expenses are subject 
to a maximum limit of £50,000.

• N/A

• Pension contributions for Executive 
Directors are aligned with the wider 
workforce rate which is currently 
12% of salary (reduced to 10.6% when 
taken as cash in lieu of contribution).

• N/A

year against companies of similar 
size and complexity. Both salary levels 
and overall remuneration are set by 
reference to the median data of 
comparators which the Remuneration 
Committee considers to be suitable 
based on index, size and sector. 
• The Remuneration Committee uses 
this data as a key reference point 
in considering the appropriate level 
of salary. Other relevant factors 
including corporate and individual 
performance and any changes in an 
individual’s role and responsibilities,
and the level of salary increases 
awarded to other employees of the 
Group are also considered.

• Base salary is paid monthly in cash.
• Changes to base salaries normally 

take effect from 1 April.

• The Group provides market competitive 
benefits in kind. Details of the benefits 
provided in each year will be set 
out in the Implementation Report. 
The Remuneration Committee 
reserves discretion to introduce new 
benefits where it concludes that it is 
in the interests of the Group to do 
so, having regard to the particular 
circumstances and to market practice.

• Where appropriate, the Group will 

meet certain costs relating to Executive 
Director relocations and other 
exceptional expenses.

• The Group provides a competitive 

employer sponsored defined 
contribution pension plan.

• All Executive Directors are eligible to 

participate in the Defined Contribution 
Pension Plan available to all new joiners 
or they may opt to receive the 
contribution in cash if they are impacted 
by the relevant lifetime or annual limits. 
Any such cash payments are reduced 
for the effect of employers’ National 
Insurance Contributions.

• Phoenix will honour the pensions 
obligations entered into under all 
previous policies in accordance with 
the terms of such obligations.

Annual Incentive Plan (‘AIP’) and  
Deferred Bonus Share Scheme (‘DBSS’)
To motivate employees and incentivise 
delivery of annual performance targets 
aligned to strategy.

Policy and operation 

Maximum

Performance measures

• The maximum annual incentive level for 
an Executive Director is 200% of base 
salary per annum.

• AIP levels and the appropriateness 
of measures are reviewed annually 
to ensure they continue to support the 
Group’s strategy.

• AIP outcomes are paid in cash in one 

tranche (less the deferred share award).

• At least 50% of any annual AIP award 

is to be deferred into shares for a 
period of three years although the 
Remuneration Committee reserves 
discretion to alter the current practice 
of deferral (whether by altering the 
portion deferred, the period of deferral 
or whether amounts are deferred into 
cash or shares). Such alterations may 
be required to ensure compliance with 
regulatory guidelines for pay within the 
insurance sector, but will not otherwise 
reduce the current deferral level or 
the period of deferral.

• Deferral of AIP outcomes into shares 
is currently made under the DBSS.
• Awards under DBSS will be in the 
form of awards to receive shares 
for nil-cost. 

• DBSS awards are typically made 
automatically each year on the 
fourth dealing day following the 
announcement of annual results, 
using the average of the preceding 
three dealing days’ share prices 
to calculate the number of shares 
in awards.

• The three-year period of deferral 
will run to the third anniversary of 
the award date.

• Dividend entitlements will accrue over 
the three-year deferral period and be 
delivered as additional vesting shares.

• Malus/clawback provisions apply to 

the AIP and to amounts deferred under
DBSS as explained in the notes to 
this table.

• The performance measures applied 

to AIP will be set by the Remuneration 
Committee and may be financial or 
non-financial and corporate, divisional 
or individual and in such proportions as
it considers appropriate. However, the 
weighting of financial performance 
measures will not be reduced below 
60% of total AIP potential in any year 
for the duration of this policy.
• In respect of the financial and 

non-financial performance measures, 
attaining the threshold performance 
level produces a £nil annual 
incentive payment.

• On-target performance on all measures 

produces an outcome of 50% of 
maximum annual incentive opportunity. 
However, the Remuneration Committee 
reserves the right to adjust the threshold 
and target levels for future financial 
years in light of competitive practice.
• The AIP operates subject to three levels 

of moderation:
–  either through management 

guidance or consensus forecasts). 
Recognising that the business of 
the Group is to engage in corporate 
activity, the Remuneration Committee
may adjust targets during the year 
to take account of such activity 
and ensure the targets continue 
to reflect performance as 
originally intended.

–  There is a specific adjustment 
factor of 80%–120% of the 
provisional outturn whereby the 
Remuneration Committee may 
adjust the provisional figure 
(but subject to any over-riding 
cap) to take account of its broad 
assessment of performance 
both against pre-set targets, risk 
considerations, and more generally, 
of the wider universe of stakeholders.
With respect to financial performance 
measures, this assessment will include 
consideration of the quality of how 
particular outcomes were achieved.

–  The AIP remains a discretionary 

arrangement and the Remuneration 
Committee reserves discretion to 
adjust the outturn (from zero to 
any cap) should it consider that 
to be appropriate. In particular, 
the Remuneration Committee may 
operate this discretion in respect 
of any risk concern.

Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
To motivate and incentivise delivery  
of sustained performance over the 
long-term in line with our strategy  
and purpose, and to promote  
alignment with shareholders’ interests,  
the Group operates the Phoenix  
Group Holdings plc LTIP.

All-employee share plans 
To encourage share ownership by 
employees, thereby allowing them to 
participate in the long-term success  
of the Group and align their interests  
with those of the shareholders.

Policy and operation 

Maximum

Performance measures

• The Remuneration Committee may 
set such performance measures for 
LTIP awards as it considers appropriate 
(whether financial or non-financial 
and whether corporate, divisional 
or individual). 

• The Remuneration Committee retains 
discretion to adjust the weightings or 
substitute metrics but would expect 
to consult with its major shareholders 
regarding any material changes of the 
current performance measures applied
for LTIP awards made to Executive 
Directors or the relative weightings 
between these performance measures.

• For every LTIP award, appropriate 

disclosures regarding the proposed 
performance conditions will be made 
in the annual Implementation Report.
• Once set, performance measures and 
targets will generally remain unaltered 
unless events occur which, in the 
Remuneration Committee’s opinion, 
make it appropriate to make adjustments 
to the performance measures to ensure 
alignment with strategic objectives, 
provided that any adjusted 
performance measure is, in its opinion, 
neither materially more nor less difficult 
to satisfy than the original measure.
• For each part of an LTIP award subject 
to a specific performance condition, 
the threshold level of vesting will be 
no more than 25% of that part of the 
LTIP award.

• The performance period for LTIP 

awards will be at least three years, but 
the Remuneration Committee reserves 
discretion to lengthen the applicable 
performance periods for LTIP awards.

• Consistent with normal practice, 
such awards are not subject to 
performance conditions.

• The formal limit under the LTIP is 300% 
of base salary per annum (and 400% 
per annum in exceptional cases).
• The Remuneration Committee’s 

practice is to make LTIP awards to 
Executive Directors each year over 
shares with a value (as at the award date) 
of up to 275% of the CEO’s annual base 
salary and 200% of the CFO’s annual 
base salary although discretion is 
reserved to make awards up to the 
maximum levels for the policy as 
stated above.

• Awards under the LTIP may be in 

any of the forms of awards to receive 
shares for nil-cost (as described for 
DBSS above).

• LTIP awards are typically made 
automatically each year on the 
fourth dealing day following the 
announcement of annual results, using 
the average of the preceding three 
dealing days’ share prices to calculate 
the number of shares in awards.

• The vesting period will be at least three 
years and run until the third anniversary 
of the award date (unless a longer 
vesting period is introduced).

• A holding period will apply so that 

Executive Directors may not normally 
exercise vested LTIP awards until the 
fifth anniversary of the award date.
• Dividend entitlements will accrue until 

the end of the holding period in respect 
of performance vested shares and be 
delivered as additional vesting shares.
• Malus/clawback provisions apply on 
a basis consistent with the equivalent 
provisions in the AIP and DBSS and 
as explained in the notes to this table.

• The Group will honour the vesting 

of all awards granted under previous 
policies in accordance with the terms 
of such awards.

• Executive Directors are able to 

• ShareSave – the Remuneration 

participate in all-employee share 
plans on the same terms as other 
Group employees as required by 
HMRC legislation.

Committee has the facility to allow 
individuals to save up to a maximum of 
£500 each month (or such other level 
as permitted by HMRC legislation) for 
a fixed period of three or five years. 
At the end of the savings period, 
individuals may use their savings to 
buy ordinary shares in the Group at 
a discount of up to 20% of the market 
price set at the launch of each scheme.

• Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) – the 

Remuneration Committee has the 
facility to allow individuals to have the 
opportunity to purchase, out of their 
pre-tax salary, shares in the Group and 
receive one matching share for every 
purchased share up to a maximum of 
£50. The maximum saving is £150 each 
month (or up to such level as permitted 
by the Group in line with HMRC 
legislation). SIP also has the facility 
to allow for reinvestment of dividends 
in further shares, or the award of 
additional free shares (up to the limits 
as permitted by HMRC legislation).1

Total ordinary dividend

26.0p per share (2022: 24.8p per share) 

26.65p per share (2022: 26.0p per share)

52.65p per share (2022: 50.8p per share)

Dividends declared in respect of the Company’s ordinary shares must be capable of being cancelled  
and withheld or deferred at any time prior to payment. This is so that the Company’s ordinary shares can  
be counted towards Group capital. Accordingly, the Final dividend will be declared on a conditional basis 
and the Directors reserve the right to cancel or defer the recommended dividend. The Directors do not 
expect to exercise this right other than where they believe that it may be necessary to do so as a result  
of legal or regulatory requirements.

The issued share capital of the Company increased by 1,185,942 shares during 2023 which related to shares 
issued under the Company’s ShareSave Scheme.

At 31 December 2023, the issued ordinary share capital totalled 1,001,538,419. Subsequently, 9,467 ordinary 
shares have been issued in 2024 in connection with the Company’s ShareSave Scheme to bring the total  
in issue to 1,001,547,886 at the date of this Directors’ report. Full details of the issued and fully paid share 
capital as at 31 December 2023 and movements in share capital during the period are presented in note D1 
to the IFRS consolidated financial statements.

At the Company’s 2023 AGM, shareholders approved the renewal of the Company’s authority to make 
purchases of up to 100,045,720 of its own shares and make payment for the redemption or purchase of its 
own shares in any manner permitted by the Companies Act 2006 including without limitation, out of capital, 
profits, share premium or the proceeds of a new issue of shares. The authority was not used and none of the 
Company’s ordinary shares were purchased by the Company during 2023. The authority will expire at the 
2024 AGM. A resolution to renew this authority shall be proposed in the 2024 AGM Notice of Meeting.

Treasury shares

The Company held no treasury shares during the year or up to the date of this Directors’ report.

ability of Phoenix Group to withstand 
market shocks in a range of severe but 
plausible stress scenarios.

Governance

Going concern

Phoenix Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out  
in the Strategic report. The Strategic report includes details of Phoenix Group’s cash flow and solvency position, including sensitivities for both, 
alongside details of any key events affecting the Company (and its consolidated subsidiaries) since the end of the financial year. Principal risks 
and their mitigation are detailed on pages 50 to 57. In addition, the IFRS consolidated financial statements include, amongst other things, notes 
on Phoenix Group’s borrowings (note E5), management of its financial risk including market, credit and liquidity risk (note E6), its commitments and 
contingent liabilities (notes I5 and I6) and its capital management (note I3). The Strategic report (on pages 20 to 23) sets out the business model 
and how Phoenix Group creates value for shareholders and policyholders.

As part of its comprehensive assessment as to whether Phoenix Group is a Going concern, the Board has considered financial projections  
over the period to 31 March 2025, which demonstrate the ability of Phoenix Group to withstand market shocks in a range of severe but  
plausible stress scenarios. Further details of these stress scenarios are included in the Viability statement on pages 58 and 59, but they include  
a recessionary economic stress that reflects a further increase in inflation, additional credit downgrades and falling equity and property values.  
The projections demonstrate that appropriate levels of capital would remain in the Life Companies under both the base and reasonably 
foreseeable stress scenarios, thus supporting cash generation in the Going concern period. In addition, the Board noted Phoenix Group’s 
access to additional funding through its undrawn £1.75 billion revolving credit facility. The stresses do not give rise to any material uncertainties 
over Phoenix Group’s ability to continue as a Going concern.

The Directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that Phoenix Group has adequate resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due and 
continue in operational existence over the period to 31 March 2025, the period covered by the Going concern assessment. Thus, they continue 
to adopt the Going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.

The Directors have acknowledged their responsibilities in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in relation to the IFRS financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Branches

Political donations

Phoenix Group is a politically neutral organisation and, as further explained below, did not make any  
political donations or incur any political expenditure (within the ordinary meaning of those words) in  
2023. The Company regularly engages with regulators and policymakers (including those associated  
with political parties and governments) to listen and to contribute to discussions on a wide range of matters. 
Such engagement is an important part of our strategy and contributes to initiatives enabling the UK in its 
goal of reaching net zero by 2050. Further information on how we engage with stakeholders can be found 
on pages 74 to 77; and our Sustainability and Climate Reports, which include information on our own net 
zero ambitions can be found on our website at www.thephoenixgroup.com. 

Due to the broad definition of political donations under the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) and as a matter 
of good governance and transparency, we have provided information on areas of expenditure incurred as  
a result of this engagement which may be regarded as falling within the scope of the Companies Act 2006. 

During the year ended 31 December 2023, Phoenix Group exhibited at, sponsored, and held events at, 
conferences organised by political parties, spending a total of £63,982.40. This included sponsorship  
of events at the Labour Party Annual Conference (£24,000), Conservative Party Annual Conference 
(£29,396.40) and Scottish National Party Annual Conference (£9,936). The Company also contributed 
£650 to a pensioners fair run the Member of Parliament for the Wythall region, in which the Group has  
an office. These events allow Phoenix Group to present its views on a non-partisan basis to politicians from 
across the political spectrum and non-political stakeholders such as NGOs and other listed and non-listed 
companies. These payments do not indicate support for any political party. At the 2024 AGM, Phoenix 
Group will be seeking renewal from shareholders of the existing authority approved at the 2023 AGM.

Contractual/Other

Significant agreements  
impacted by a change  
of control of the Company

The £1.75 billion revolving credit facility has provisions which would enable the lending banks to require 
repayment of all amounts borrowed following a change of control. 

All of the Company’s employee share and incentive plans contain specific provisions relating to a change  
of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable/available on the 
date of notification, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions and pro rata reduction as may 
be applicable under the rules of the employee share incentive plans.

Apart from the aforementioned, there are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon  
a change of control of the Company, such as commercial contracts. None is considered to be significant  
in terms of their potential impact on the business of Phoenix Group.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the  
Annual Report of Phoenix Group Holdings plc 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
consolidated financial statements and the Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and regulations.

The Board has prepared a Strategic report which provides an 
overview of the development and performance of Phoenix Group’s 
business for the year ended 31 December 2023, covers the future 
developments in the business of Phoenix Group and its consolidated 
subsidiaries and provides details of any important events affecting 
the Company and its subsidiaries after the year end. The Strategic 
report and the Directors’ report together constitute the management 
report as required under DTR 4.1.8R.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare the consolidated  
and the Company financial statements for each financial year.  
Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the 
consolidated and Company financial statements in accordance  
with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (‘IASs’) in 
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair  
view of the state of affairs of Phoenix Group and of the profit  
or loss of Phoenix Group and the Company for that period. 

In preparing these financial statements the Directors are required to:

• select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors and then apply them consistently;

• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable, 

relevant and reliable;

• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 

• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IASs is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on Phoenix Group financial position and financial performance; 

•

•

in respect of Phoenix Group financial statements, state whether 
UK-adopted IASs have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

in respect of the parent Company financial statements, 
state whether applicable UK accounting standards, have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and

• prepare the consolidated and the Company financial statements 
on the Going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that Phoenix Group will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain Phoenix Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of Phoenix Group, and enable them to ensure 
that the Company and the consolidated financial statements and  
the Directors’ Remuneration report comply with the Companies  
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets  
of Phoenix Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 

Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ report, 
Directors’ Remuneration report and Corporate governance 
statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

The Directors as at the date of this Directors’ report, whose names 
and functions are listed in the Board of Directors section on pages  
64 to 67, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:

•

•

•

the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with UK-adopted IASs give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company 
and undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 

the Annual Report, including the Strategic report, includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and

the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for users (who have a reasonable knowledge of business 
and economic activities) to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.

The Strategic report and the Directors’ report were approved  
by the Board of Directors on 20 March 2024.

Opinion
In our opinion:
•  Phoenix Group Holdings plc’s consolidated financial statements 

and Parent Company financial statements (the ‘financial 
statements’) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s  
and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2023  
and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;

•  the consolidated financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international 
accounting standards;

•  the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 

prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international 
accounting standards as applied in accordance with section  
408 of the Companies Act 2006; and

•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance  

with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 

We have audited the financial statements of Phoenix Group Holdings 
plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the 
year ended 31 December 2023 which comprise:

31 December 2023

Related notes A1 to I7 to the 
consolidated financial statements 
(except for note I3 where it is marked 
as unaudited), including material 
accounting policy information

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in  
their preparation is applicable law and UK-adopted international 
accounting standards and as regards the Parent Company  
financial statements, as applied in accordance with section 408  
of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section  
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We are independent of the Group and Parent in accordance with  
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 

The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we 
remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in 
conducting the audit. 

Conclusions relating to going concern 
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that  
the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting  
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.  
Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group and  
Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting included: 
•  confirming our understanding of management’s going concern 
assessment process and obtaining management’s assessment 
which covers the period to 31 March 2025;

•  with support from our actuarial team, challenging the key  

actuarial assumptions used in management’s three-year Annual 
Operating Plan (‘AOP’), which forms the basis for management’s 
going concern projections and determining that the models are 
appropriate to enable management to make an assessment  
on the going concern of the Group;

•  assessing the accuracy of management’s analysis by testing  
the inputs and the clerical accuracy of the models used;

•  assessing management’s consideration of how solvency and 

liquidity has been managed in response to the current economic 
environment and evaluated the liquidity and solvency position of the 
Group by reviewing base case liquidity and solvency projections;

Overview of our audit approach

Audit scope

Key audit 
matters

•  We performed an audit of the complete financial 
information of the Group Function, Phoenix Life 
Limited (which includes Phoenix Life Assurance 
Limited and Standard Life Assurance Limited) 
and ReAssure Limited and audit procedures  
on specific balances for Other Companies (the 
‘reporting components’). Our scope is explained 
further on pages 151 to 152.

•  The components where we performed full or 
specific audit procedures accounted for 99% 
(2022: 99%) of the equity and 95% (2022: 98%) 
of the profit before tax of the Group.

•  Valuation of insurance contract liabilities, 

comprising the following risk areas:
–  actuarial assumptions; and
–  actuarial modelling.

•  Valuation of contractual service margin  

and its subsequent release.

•  Valuation of certain complex and illiquid 

financial investments.

•  Recoverability of intangible assets arising  
from the acquisition of ReAssure Limited, 
Standard Life Assurance Limited and other 
acquired entities.

•  Transition to IFRS 17 Insurance contracts, 
including the selection and application of 
accounting policies and financial statement  
and other disclosures.

•  Recoverability of the Parent Company’s 
investments in Group undertakings.

Materiality

•  Overall Group materiality of £93 million (2022: 
£83 million) which represents 2% of total equity 
attributable to owners of the Parent plus the 
contractual service margin (‘CSM’) net of tax 
(‘adjusted Group equity’) (2022: 2% of total 
equity attributable to owners of the Parent).

•  challenging the key assumptions underlying the mandatory 

obligations of the Group up to 31 March 2025, used in  
management’s stress scenarios based on our understanding  
of the Group and the available external data, respectively;

•  evaluating management’s forecast analysis to understand  

how severe the downside scenarios would have to be to result  
in the elimination of solvency headroom;

•  assessing management’s considerations of operational risks, 
including those related to Outsourced Service Providers  
(‘OSPs’) and their impact on the going concern assessment;

•  assessing the plausibility of available management actions to 

mitigate the impact of the key risks by considering the success  
of previous similar management actions and the robustness  
of the plans in the context of our understanding of the Group;

•  checking that all mandatory debt and interest payments are 
forecast to be met under the base case and adverse stress 
scenarios and that the Group is able to meet target debt 
repayments throughout the going concern period;

•  performing enquiries of management and those charged  

with governance to identify risks or events that may impact the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. We also obtained 
management’s assessment approved by the Board, minutes of 
meetings of the Board and its committees; and

•  testing the appropriateness of the going concern disclosures  
by comparing the disclosures with management’s assessment  
and considering their compliance with the relevant  
reporting requirements.

Based on management’s assessment, we have observed that  
the Group continues to have surplus cash and solvency above  
its Solvency Coverage Ratio in a number of extreme downside 
scenarios and the Group continues to service customers and  
meet its commitments in the current environment.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified  
any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the  
Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going  
concern for the period to 31 March 2025.

In relation to the Group and Parent Company’s reporting on how 
they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have 
nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether  
the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with 
respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections  
of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.

An overview of the scope of the Parent Company  
and Group audits 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope  
for each company within the Group. Taken together, this enables  
us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  
We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group 
and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business 
environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results 
when assessing the level of work to be performed at each company
.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the consolidated 
financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 
four reporting components of the Group. The Group reporting 
components consist of Phoenix Life Limited, ReAssure Limited,  
the Group Function and Other Companies.

The Phoenix Life Limited component includes Phoenix Life Limited 
(‘PLL’), Phoenix Life Assurance Limited (‘PLAL’), and Standard Life 
Assurance Limited (‘SLAL’), which are the most significant insurance 
companies of the component. ReAssure Limited (‘RAL’) is the  
most significant company in the ReAssure component. The Group 
Function consists of Group entities that primarily hold external debt 
and the pension schemes of the Group as well as the consolidation 
adjustments. The Other Companies include the Phoenix Life and 
Standard Life service companies, ReAssure Life Limited, ReAssure 
UK Services Limited, ReAssure MidCo Limited, ERIP Limited 
Partnership, Standard Life International Designated Activity 
Company (‘SLIDAC’) and Sun Life Assurance Company of  
Canada UK Limited (‘SLOC’).

Three of the reporting components were audited by component 
teams as set out below:

Of the four components selected, we performed an audit of the 
complete financial information of three components (‘full scope 
components’) which were selected based on their size or risk 
characteristics. For the remaining Other Companies component,  
we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that 
component that we considered had the potential for the greatest 
impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements  
either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. 
Additionally, the acquisition balance sheet in respect of SLOC  
was in the scope of the SLOC component team.

The reporting components where we performed audit procedures 
accounted for 99% (2022: 99%) of the adjusted Group equity and 
95% (2022: 98%) of the Group’s profit before tax. For the current  
year, the full scope components contributed 81% (2022: 98%) of  
the adjusted Group equity and 81% (2022: 94%) of the Group’s  
profit before tax. The specific scope components, including the 
components with specified procedures contributed 18% (2022: 1%) 
of the adjusted Group equity and 14% (2022: 4%) of the Group’s 
profit before tax. The audit scope of these components may not have 
included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will 
have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for 
the Group.

Changes from the prior year 
During the year the Group acquired SLOC which is now part of the 
specific scope of other companies. Furthermore, the EY primary  
team have audited all the IFRS 17 adjustments for the Group.

Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit,  
we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken  
at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement 
team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms 
operating under our instruction. 

The primary audit team provided detailed audit instructions  
to the component teams which included guidance on areas of  
focus, including the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed 
above, and set out the information required to be reported to the 
primary audit team. For the Other Companies, where the work was 
performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate 
level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit 
evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group 
as a whole.

The primary audit team followed a programme of planned visits that 
has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor visited 
each of the full scope components. For all full scope components,  
in addition to the component visits, the primary audit team reviewed 
key working papers and participated in the component teams’ 
planning, including the component teams’ discussion of fraud and 
error. The primary audit team attended the closing meetings with  
the management of the Phoenix Life Limited and ReAssure Limited 
and the Audit Committee meetings at the components.

For the specific scope components, the primary audit team have 
reviewed the audit procedures performed by the component  
teams on the specific accounts, by reviewing relevant workpapers 
and holding meetings with the component teams as necessary.  
The work performed on the components, together with the 
additional procedures performed at the Group level, gave us 
appropriate evidence for our opinion on the consolidated  
financial statements as a whole.

Climate change 
Stakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change  
will impact the Group. The Group has determined that the most 
significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will 
be from financial assets and in insurance and investment contract 
liabilities. These are explained on pages 44 to 45 in the required Task 
Force On Climate Related Financial Disclosures, and on page 52 in 
the principal risks and uncertainties. All of these disclosures form part 
of the “Other information”, rather than the audited financial statements. 
Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted 
solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of 
the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with 
our responsibilities on “Other information”. 

In planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential 
impacts of climate change on the Group’s business and any 
consequential material impact on its financial statements.

The Group has explained in their Significant Accounting Policies  
how they have reflected the impact of climate change in their 
financial statements. Judgements and estimates relating to climate 
change are included in note A4.6. Our audit effort in considering 
climate change was focused on validating this assertion, through 
considering the potential effects of climate risks on liability and asset 
valuations and associated disclosures where values are determined 
through modelling future cash flows. As part of this evaluation,  
we performed our own risk assessment, supported by our climate 
change internal specialists, to determine whether any risks of  
material misstatement in the financial statements from climate 
change needed to be considered in our audit. We also challenged 
the Directors’ considerations of climate change in their assessment  
of going concern and viability and associated disclosures.

We also challenged the Directors’ considerations of climate  
change in their assessment of going concern and viability and 
associated disclosures.

Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate 
change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or  
to impact a key audit matter.

Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
that we identified. These matters included those which had the 
greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit  
of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon,  
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

FinancialsFinancialsKey observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee

We determined that  
the models used are 
appropriate, that 
changes to the models 
were implemented as 
intended, and that 
controls over 
management’s 
processes for modelling 
insurance contract 
assets and liabilities 
using the core actuarial 
modelling systems were 
operating effectively. 

We also determined  
that liabilities modelled 
outside these core 
actuarial modelling 
systems are reasonable. 

Risk area 

Our response to the risk

To obtain sufficient audit evidence to conclude on core actuarial modelling 
systems and balances calculated outside these systems, using EY actuaries  
as part of our audit team we performed the following procedures:
• obtained an understanding of management’s process for model changes 
to the core actuarial system and tested the design, implementation and 
operating effectiveness of key controls over that process (including the 
governance over model change);
tested the IT general controls of the core actuarial models;

•
• evaluated and corroborated the methodology, inputs and assumptions 
applied to model changes made in the core actuarial modelling systems 
over the year; 

• with respect to the migration of ReAssure business onto a new model 
we tested management’s migration process with a focus on both the 
robustness of the outputs and ensuring that the differences between 
current and previous models were understood;

• validated the results of management’s analysis of movements in insurance 
contract assets and liabilities to corroborate that the actual impact of 
changes to models was consistent with that expected when the model 
change was implemented; and

• stratified the components of the balance modelled outside the core 

actuarial system as at the balance sheet date and focused our testing on 
those that, in our professional judgment, presented a higher risk of material 
misstatement. As part of the testing, we gained an understanding of the 
rationale for balances calculated outside of the core actuarial system and 
validated the appropriateness of the applied calculation methodology. 
In addition, we also performed an independent valuation of a sample of 
insurance contract assets and liabilities which are modelled outside the 
core actuarial system.

Actuarial modelling (Group) 

Refer to Audit Committee Report 
(page 98).

We consider the integrity  
and appropriateness of models  
to be critical to the overall  
valuation of insurance contract 
 assets and liabilities. 

The majority of insurance contract 
liabilities are modelled using the core 
actuarial modelling systems, with the 
residual balance modelled outside 
these systems to cater for any 
additional required liabilities  
not reflected in the models. 

We consider the key risks to relate to:
i)
the appropriateness of the core 
actuarial model;

iii)

ii) model developments applied to 
the core actuarial models; and 
the appropriateness of out of 
model adjustments and the 
movement of the out of model 
adjustments to core actuarial 
modelling systems.

In addition, the migration of a portion 
of the ReAssure business to a new 
actuarial model was a key risk area for 
2023, as was the transition to IFRS 17 
which is discussed in the Key Audit 
Matter below.

Independent auditor’s report continued

Risk area
Valuation of insurance contract liabilities (£115.8bn; 2022: £107.6bn).

Refer to the Critical accounting estimates (pages 177 to 178); Accounting policies and note F1 of the consolidated financial statements  
(pages 221 to 226).

We consider the valuation of the best estimate liabilities, risk adjustment and Contractual Service Margin (CSM) included in determining the 
insurance contract assets and liabilities at each reporting date to be a fraud risk, due to the risk of management bias and override along with the 
significant level of judgement involved in relation to uncertain future events which could be susceptible to misstatement as a result of intentional acts 
by management. Assumptions are both internal and external to the business, and small changes can result in a material impact to the resultant valuation.

Consistent with previous periods, we have split the risks relating to the valuation of insurance contract assets and liabilities into component parts. 
However, this year we have removed the significant risk around actuarial data used within the valuation models because the data itself is not 
inherently complex or subject to judgment.

The specific audit procedures performed to address the significant risk are set out below. In addition, we corroborated management’s analysis of 
movements in insurance contract assets and liabilities by obtaining evidence to support large or unexpected movements as this provided 
important audit evidence over the valuation of insurance contract assets and liabilities.

Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee

We determined that the 
actuarial assumptions 
and risk adjustment used 
by management are 
reasonable based on the 
analysis of experience to 
date, industry practice 
and the financial and 
regulatory requirements. 

Risk area 

Our response to the risk

To obtain sufficient audit evidence to conclude on the appropriateness  
of actuarial assumptions, using EY actuaries as part of our audit team,  
we performed the following procedures:
• obtained an understanding and tested the design and operating 

effectiveness of key controls over management’s process for setting 
and updating key actuarial assumptions;

• determined whether the methodology and assumptions applied are 
appropriate by comparing it to our knowledge of ’industry standards 
and the Groups’ regulatory and financial reporting requirements; 

• corroborated the results of management’s experience analysis, 
including the base longevity, persistency and assured mortality, 
to agree whether these justified the adopted assumptions;

• evaluated and corroborated the methodology used in determining 

the discount rate applied;

• discussed management’s decisions on the inclusion or exclusion of 

data from the period impacted by COVID-19 when setting individual 
assumptions, including longevity, mortality, morbidity and persistency;
• evaluated the results of management’s analysis with respect to longevity 
improvements using the results from the industry standard Continuous 
Mortality Investigation (‘CMI’) on longevity trend, and benchmarked 
the output against other industry participants;

• benchmarked the significant assumptions against those of other 

comparable industry participants; 

• performed procedures to test that the assumptions used in the year 

end valuation are consistent with the approved basis; and

• corroborated the expense assumptions adopted by management 
considering an impact of the recent economic volatility (including 
inflation), the impact of the increase in volumes of new insurance 
business written and the inclusion of benefits arising from planned 
future management actions.

Actuarial assumptions (Group)

Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 98).

Economic assumptions are set by 
management taking into account 
market conditions as at the valuation 
date. Non-economic assumptions  
are set based on the Group’s past 
experience, market experience and 
practice, regulations and expectations 
about future trends.

The assumptions that we have 
historically determined to have the 
most significant impact are the base 
and trend longevity, persistency, 
assured mortality and expenses. 
Under IFRS 17 these assumptions 
continue to be important.

Given the recent economic volatility 
we continue to place additional focus 
on future economic assumptions such 
as inflation assumptions at the 2023 
year-end date.

Additionally, the introduction of IFRS 17 
has increased the importance of 
economic assumptions, in particular 
the setting of discount rates. 

Finally, IFRS 17 explicitly requires that 
a risk adjustment (‘RA’) be included 
above the best estimate cashflows 
within the liability for incurred claims. 
IFRS 17 does not specify the 
estimation technique that should be 
used to determine the risk adjustment, 
so management must develop an 
appropriate estimation technique. 
Therefore, due to the inherent 
judgment required to determine both 
an appropriate technique and the 
relevant inputs, we consider the RA  
to be susceptible to management bias.

communicated to the 
Audit Committee

Based on our 
procedures performed 
we are satisfied that 
revenue has been 
recognised in-line  
with the requirements  
of IFRS17.

Independent auditor’s report continued

Risk area 

Our response to the risk

Revenue recognition (Valuation  
of Contractual Service Margin 
(‘CSM’), and it’s subsequent release) 
(Group) £409m (2022: £386m) 

Refer to the Critical accounting 
estimates (pages 177 to 178); 
Accounting policies and note C1  
of the consolidated financial 
statements (pages 185 to 186).

At initial recognition, the CSM  
relates to the unearned profit  
under insurance contracts issued.  
As services are provided under the 
terms of these contracts, the CSM  
is released to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, reflecting 
the profit relating to services 
performed in the period.

There is a high degree of  
complexity and estimation involved  
in deriving the release patterns.

Additionally, it is necessary to 
consider whether each contract 
group is onerous, resulting in a  
charge to the income statement. 

To obtain sufficient audit evidence to conclude on the appropriateness  
of revenue recognition, we engaged our actuaries as part of our audit  
team and performed the following procedures:
• 

 performed walkthroughs of the process implemented by management  
to determine the CSM (including both the derivation of the source data, 
input of the data into the CSM model and output from the model) and 
tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls;

•  compared the appropriateness of evaluated the methodology proposed 
by management for the used to determine coverage units and tested the 
appropriateness of the release of the CSM to the consolidated income 
statement and tested the appropriateness of the coverage units;
leveraged our audit of the CSM at each statement of consolidated 
financial position date to confirm that amounts released to the 
consolidated income statement was reasonable and in line with 
requirements of the standard; 

• 

•  performed analytical procedures to identify unusual release patterns  
and discussed these with management to understand and validate the 
appropriateness of their selection;

•  validated the actual and projected cashflows which are input into the 
model on a sample basis by vouching back to source information; and
•  substantively tested management’s assessment of onerous contracts to 

confirm the completeness of those contracts designated as onerous and 
ensure they have been calculated accurately.

Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee

Based on our 
procedures performed 
on the ERM financial 
investments and the 
modelled debt 
securities, we are 
satisfied that the 
valuation of these 
complex and illiquid 
assets is reasonable.

Risk area 

Our response to the risk

Valuation of certain complex and 
illiquid financial investments 
(Group) (Equity release mortgages 
£4.5bn; 2022: £3.9bn); (Modelled 
debt securities £8.2bn; 2022: £6.4bn)

Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 99); Critical accounting 
estimates (page 178); Accounting 
policies and notes E1 and E2 of the 
consolidated financial statements 
(pages 195 to 205).

There has been no change in  
our assessment of this risk from  
the prior year.

The extent of judgment applied by 
management in valuing the Group’s 
financial investments varies with the 
nature of securities held, the markets 
in which they are traded and the 
valuation methodology applied. 

Observable inputs are not readily 
available for the valuation of equity 
release mortgages (‘ERM’) financial 
investments and modelled debt 
securities, such as private placements, 
local authority loans, infrastructure 
loans and commercial real estate 
loans. Consequently, management 
use models with other inputs to 
estimate their value. 

We consider that the key risks on the 
valuation of ERM financial investments 
relate to: 
i) 

 assumptions, as these are largely 
based on non-observable inputs 
and are highly judgmental, and 
the completeness and accuracy of 
data feeding the valuation model.

ii) 

We consider the key risks related to 
valuation of modelled debt securities 
to be: 
i) 

the use of complex valuation 
methodologies as opposed  
to observable prices; 
significant judgments involved  
in setting the spread above 
risk-free rate; 
the subjectivity surrounding the 
selection of the comparable 
bonds to derive that spread; and 
the reasonableness of  
credit ratings.

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

We used EY valuation specialists and actuaries to test the valuation of ERM 
financial investments and modelled debt securities. To obtain sufficient audit 
evidence to conclude on the valuation of ERM financial investments, we:
•  tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls over 

management’s assumption setting processes for valuing these instruments;
•  tested the completeness of the ERM financial investments and underlying 

data at the period end through independent confirmations;

•  tested the accuracy of mortgage data used in the valuation model by 

agreeing a sample of new loans to supporting evidence and validating  
any movements on static data over the period;

•  corroborated the methodology, inputs and assumptions used to value the 
ERM financial investments including the No Negative Equity Guarantee 
(‘NNEG’) (such as house price inflation, residential house price volatility, 
longevity improvement and base mortality, as well as economic 
assumptions such as discount rate);

•  validated the key assumptions by comparing them to published market 

benchmarks and demographic and economic assumptions used by other 
industry participants, to confirm that key valuation inputs were consistent 
with industry norms and our understanding of the instrument type  
and were appropriate considering the current economic volatility; and

•  developed our own independent model to value the ERM financial 

investments and compared the output to the results produced by the Group.

To obtain sufficient audit evidence to conclude on the valuation of modelled 
debt securities, we:
• 

 obtained the ISAE 3402 SOC report of the OSPs covering the period  
to 30 September 2023, including those controls over the valuation of 
modelled debt securities outsourced to the third party, and determined 
the impact of any identified control exceptions; 

•  obtained the bridging letter for the period 1 October 2023 to 31 

December 2023 to review that the controls over the valuation of modelled 
debt securities were operating during the period; 
inspected evidence of the operation of management’s oversight controls 
over the OSPs;

• 

•  understood the valuation process of modelled debt securities applied by 
the OSP of the Phoenix Life Limited and ReAssure Limited components 
and validated the appropriateness of any methodology and assumption 
changes during the year, including the impact of the current economic 
volatility on economic assumptions; 

•  for modelled debt securities overseen by the in-house Independent 

Pricing Valuation (‘IPV’) and Credit and Valuation Committee, we have 
obtained an understanding of the valuation methodology and tested  
the design and operating effectiveness of the key controls;

•  engaged EY valuation specialists to test the appropriateness of the 

valuation methodology, calculate an independent range of comparable 
values for a sample of modelled debt securities using an independent 
valuation model and compared reasonable alternative key assumptions 
based on comparable securities; 
 validated the accuracy of security related inputs to the valuation of 
modelled debt securities by tracing a sample of inputs to the underlying 
agreements and documentation;
 performed independent calibration on securities by reviewing the implied 
rate and sector credit spreads to validate the reasonableness of credit 
ratings used in the comparable values assessment; and
 discussed the downgrade of credit ratings or changes of spread in 
management’s credit watchlist and known market risks in our independent 
comparable values assessment.

Our response to the risk

Recoverability of intangibles from 
the historical acquisitions of SLAL, 
ReAssure and other associated 
entities (Group) (AVIF £1.9bn;  
2022: £2.2bn) 

Refer to the Audit committee report 
(page 99), the accounting policies and 
note G2 of the consolidated financial 
statements (pages 260 to 262)

Each reporting period management  
is required to perform an assessment 
on the acquired intangible assets  
to identify any indicators of 
impairment. Where such indicators 
exist, management performs  
a recoverability assessment. 

To obtain sufficient audit evidence to assess recoverability of AVIF intangible 
assets arising from the acquisition of ReAssure and Standard Life, using EY 
actuaries as part of the audit team we performed the following procedures:
• obtained and understood management’s process, model and assumptions 

•

supporting the recoverability assessment;
tested design and implementation of the controls over the completeness 
and accuracy of the data used in the recoverability assessment;
• validated management’s assessment of impairment indicators by 

considering current market factors and evaluated their impact on the 
ReAssure and Standard Life AVIF values as at 31 December 2023; and

Based on our 
procedures performed 
on the recoverability of 
intangible assets arising 
from the acquisition of 
ReAssure and Standard 
Life, we are satisfied that 
there is no impairment 
necessary as at  
31 December 2023. 

• obtained management’s expectations of future profitability of the 

acquired entities and validated the assumptions applied by management 
by comparing key assumptions and judgments with experience of the 
wider market and that of Phoenix.

To obtain sufficient audit evidence to conclude on the transition  
to IFRS 17, we:
•

tested the design and implementation of key controls implemented 
by management over the transition;

• assessed the appropriateness of the transition approach adopted 

for each group of insurance contracts, including the judgements and 
supporting estimates used to determine the Full Retrospective 
Approach or Fair Value Approach, as applicable;

• assessed whether the judgements, methodology and assumptions applied 

by management in determining their accounting policies, including 
simplifications, are in compliance with the IFRS 17 accounting standard 
and have been implemented as intended;

• confirmed on a sample basis that the criteria used by management 

in determining the units of account were in line with the requirements 
of IFRS 17 and had been applied as intended;

• validated the integrity of new models implemented on transition by 

considering the testing performed by management and, where necessary, 
performing independent model validation activity on a sample basis, 
comparing the output between our calculations and those produced 
by management;
tested the completeness and accuracy of new data flows and system 
interfaces incorporated within the IFRS 17 production process; and

•

• corroborated the completeness of management’s estimate of the 
impact of implementing IFRS 17 on equity and profit before tax.

Transition to IFRS 17 Insurance 
contracts, including the selection 
and application of accounting 
policies and financial statement  
and other disclosures (Group)

Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 98); Accounting policy note 
A2.1 of the consolidated financial 
statements (pages 172 to 174).

The transition to IFRS 17, the new 
insurance accounting standard, 
effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2023, 
has resulted in significant change to 
the Group’s reporting processes and 
consolidated financial statements. 
IFRS 17 has introduced new financial 
statement line items and disclosures 
and has required significant changes 
to the measurement of insurance 
contract assets and liabilities.  
This has also resulted in the additional 
disclosure of the transition Statement 
of consolidated financial position as at 
1 January 2022 and the restatement 
of the comparative Statement of 
consolidated financial position and 
Statement of comprehensive income 
for 2022. New systems, data flows, 
system interfaces and models have 
been implemented, increasing the 
risks of material misstatement. 

Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee

Through the procedures 
performed, we have 
determined that 
management have 
appropriately 
implemented the IFRS 17 
Insurance contracts 
accounting standard 
within their financial 
reporting and this is 
reflected within the 
transition Statement of 
consolidated financial 
position as at 1 January 
2022 and the 
restatement of the 
comparative Statement 
of consolidated financial 
position and Statement 
of comprehensive 
income for 2022 
incorporated within  
the consolidated 
financial statements.

We consider the key risks in relation to 
the implementation of IFRS 17 include: 
i)

the risk of management’s 
methodology and 
assumptions being out 
of line with the standard;
the risk of management’s 
transition approach (including 
use of the Full Retrospective or 
Fair Value Approach) being out 
of line with the standard;

FinancialsFinancialsKey observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee

Based on the work 
performed and the 
evidence obtained, we 
consider the carrying 
amount of the company’s 
investments in Group 
entities to be appropriate.

Independent auditor’s report continued

Risk area 

Our response to the risk

We performed the following audit procedures related to the recoverability of 
the parent company’s investments in group undertakings:
•

 tested the reasonableness and appropriateness of the assumptions used 
in the cash flows based on our knowledge of the Group and the markets 
in which the subsidiaries operate;

• evaluated and corroborated the methodology used in determining the 

discount rate applied, including engaging our valuation experts to assess 
the appropriateness of the inputs into the discount rate; 

• obtained management’s assessment of the terminal value and validated the 
assumptions applied by management by comparing key assumptions and 
judgments with experience of the wider market and that of Phoenix; and

• evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures.

Recoverability of the Parent 
Company’s investments in Group 
undertakings (Company)

Refer to the Parent Company 
accounting policy on Investments  
in Group entities (page 294) and  
the Parent Company’s financial 
statements – Investments in Group 
entities (page 301).

The carrying amount of the Parent 
Company’s investments in subsidiaries 
is significant and in excess of the 
market capitalisation of the Group. 
This gives rise to an indicator of 
impairment. The estimated recoverable 
amount of these balances is subjective 
due to the inherent uncertainty in 
forecasting trading conditions and 
discounting future cash flows. The 
effect of these matters is that, as part 
of our risk assessment, we determined 
that the recoverable amount of 
investment in subsidiaries has a high 
degree of estimation uncertainty.

Under IAS 36 the recoverable amount 
is the higher of value in use (‘VIU’)  
and fair value less costs of disposal 
(‘FVLCD’) and calculating both the 
VIU and the FVLCD is not necessary  
if either of these amounts exceeds the 
asset’s carrying amount. Management 
calculated a VIU which exceeded the 
carrying amount of the investment  
at year end, indicating no impairment  
is required.

Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the 
audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion. 

Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually  
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence  
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. 
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent 
of our audit procedures.

We determined materiality for the Group to be £93 million  
(2022: £83 million), which is 2% of Group IFRS adjusted shareholders’ 
equity (2022: 2% of total equity attributable to owners of the Parent). 

Prior to the implementation of IFRS 17, we set materiality at 2%  
of equity attributable to owners of the Parent on the basis that  
it most closely correlated with key Group performance metrics  
of Solvency II surplus and Own Funds.

Under IFRS 17, revenue and profit recognition of day 1 gains on 
annuity contracts is deferred into recognition at a point in the future, 
by being added to the contractual service margin (‘CSM’). This has 
seen the development of an APM, IFRS adjusted shareholder equity 
(“Adjusted Equity”) across the UK life insurance industry. Whilst this  
is an APM, it is the addition of two IFRS measures from the IFRS 
Statement of financial position. These considerations have led us  
to conclude that Adjusted Equity is the most appropriate measure  
on which to base our materiality under IFRS 17 since this measure  
is the closest IFRS measure to Solvency II Own Funds. 

We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be £131 million 
(2022: £139 million), which is 2% (2022: 2%) of equity of the Parent 
Company equity attributable to owners. We have used a capital-
based measure for determining materiality considering the nature  
of the Parent Company as a holding company. For the Group audit 
purposes, we performed our audit procedures to the lower of the 
Parent Company and the Group allocated performance materiality. 

• Starting point – £2.50bn (Total equity attributable to parent)
• Based on 31 December 2023

• Addition of CSM – net of tax £2.14bn

Starting
basis

Adjustments

Materiality

• Totals £4.64bn (Adjusted equity)
• Materiality of £93m (2% of Adjusted equity)

Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance 
level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level  
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.

On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment  
of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 50% (2022: 50%) of our planning 
materiality, namely £46 million (2022: £41 million). 

Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit 
coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk 
of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk 
of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of 
performance materiality allocated to components was £10 million to  
£36 million (2022: £8 million to £27 million).

Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered 
as being clearly trivial.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to  
them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £5 million 
 (2022: £4 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well  
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 

We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light  
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in  
the Annual Report set out on pages 1 to 324, other than the  
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors 
are responsible for the other information contained within the  
Annual Report. 

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent  
with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the 
course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise 
to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves.  
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there  
is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required  
to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

FinancialsFinancialsIndependent auditor’s report continued

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to  
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course  
of the audit:
•

 the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 

•

the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course  
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report or the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report  
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 

•

Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 

law are not made; or

• we have not received all the information and explanations we 

require for our audit.

Corporate Governance Statement
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement in relation to going 
concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the Group and Company’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have 
concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 
Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial 
statements, or our knowledge obtained during the audit:
• Directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of 

adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 
uncertainties identified set out on page 143;

• Directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the Group’s 

prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period 
is appropriate set out on page 58;

• Director’s statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation 

that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meets its 
liabilities set out on page 59;

• Directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set 

out on page 145;

• Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment 

of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 57;

• The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of 
effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems 
set out on page 97; and;

• The section describing the work of the audit committee set out 

on page 92 to 99.

Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ statement of responsibilities 
set out on page 147, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible  
for assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as  
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report  
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level  
of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable 
of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance  
with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including 
fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud 
is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery  
or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent  
to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, 
including fraud is detailed below.

However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection 
of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the 
Company and management. 

• We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 

frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined 
that the most significant are relevant laws and regulations related 
to elements of company law and tax legislation, and the financial 
reporting framework. Our considerations of other laws and 
regulations that may have a material effect on the financial 
statements included permissions and supervisory requirements 
of the Prudential Regulation Authority (‘PRA’), the Financial 
Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) and the UK Listing Authority (‘UKLA’). 

• We understood how Phoenix Group Holdings plc is complying 
with those frameworks by making enquiries of management and 
those responsible for legal and compliance matters. We also 
reviewed correspondence between the company and UK 
regulatory bodies; reviewed minutes of the Group board and 
its committees; and gained an understanding of the Group’s 
approach to governance, demonstrated by the board’s approval 
of the Group’s governance framework.

• We assessed the susceptibility of the consolidated financial 

statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might 
occur by considering the controls that the Group has established 
to address risks identified by the entity, or that otherwise seek to 
prevent, deter or detect fraud. Our procedures over the Group’s 
control environment included assessment of the consistency of 
operations and controls in place within the Group and the OSPs.

Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as  
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we  
have formed.

Stuart Wilson 
(Senior statutory auditor)
for and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor
London 
22 March 2024

• The fraud risk was considered to be higher within the valuation 

of insurance contract assets and liabilities We considered 
management override risk to be higher in this area due to the 
significant judgments and estimates involved. 

Our procedures, as detailed in the key audit matters 
above, included:
–  Reviewing accounting estimates for evidence 

of management bias; 

–  Testing the appropriateness of journal entries recorded 

in the general ledger, with a focus on manual and 
non-routine journals; and 

–  Evaluating the business rationale for significant 

and/or unusual transactions. 

• Our procedures involved: making enquiries of those charged 

with governance and senior management for their awareness of 
any non-compliance of laws or regulations, enquiring about the 
policies that have been established to prevent non-compliance 
with laws and regulations by officers and employees, enquiring 
about the Company’s methods of enforcing and monitoring 
compliance with such policies, and inspecting significant 
correspondence with the PRA and FCA.

• The Company operates in the insurance industry which is a 
highly regulated environment. As such the Senior Statutory 
Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the 
engagement team to ensure that the team had the appropriate 
competence and capabilities, which included the use of 
specialists where appropriate. 

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  
This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.

Other matters we are required to address 
• Following the recommendation from the audit committee, we were 
appointed by the Company on 13 December 2018 to audit the 
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018 and 
subsequent financial periods. 

The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 
renewals and reappointments is six years, covering the years 
ending 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2023. 

• The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the 

audit committee.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

A. Significant accounting policies
A1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 set out on pages 164 to 290 comprise the financial statements of 
Phoenix Group Holdings plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as ‘the Group’), and were authorised by the Board of 
Directors for issue on 21 March 2024. 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for investment property, owner-
occupied property and those financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) that have been measured at fair value.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling (£) rounded to the nearest million except where otherwise stated.

Assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of consolidated financial position only when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liability 
simultaneously. Income and expenses are not offset in the consolidated income statement unless required or permitted by an International 
Financial Reporting Standard (‘IFRS’) or interpretation, as specifically disclosed in the accounting policies of the Group.

Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (‘IASs’) and the 
legal requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, including collective 
investment schemes, where the Group exercises overall control. In accordance with the principles set out in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial 
Statements, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has all the following:

•  power over the investee;
•  exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
•  the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.

The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including relevant activities, 
substantive and protective rights, voting rights and purpose and design of an investee. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an 
investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Further details about the 
consolidation of subsidiaries, including collective investment schemes, are included in note H1.

Going concern
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors have, at the time of approving the 
consolidated financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the period covered by the assessment having assessed the principal risks, forecasts, projections and other relevant 
evidence for the period to 31 March 2025. Further details of the going concern assessment are included in the Directors’ Report on page 143.

A2. Adoption of new accounting pronouncements in 2023
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has adopted the following standards and amendments effective from 1 January 
2023 and which have been endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board (‘UKEB’):

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts – see note A2.1; 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – see note A2.2; 

• 
• 
•  Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making 

Materiality Judgements). The amendments are intended to assist entities in deciding which accounting policies to disclose in their financial 
statements and requires an entity to disclose ‘material accounting policy information’ instead of its ‘significant accounting policies’. Accounting 
policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an entity’s financial statements, it can reasonably 
be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial 
statements. The IASB has also developed guidance and examples to explain and demonstrate the application of the ‘four-step materiality 
process’ described in IFRS Practice Statement 2;

•  Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors). The 

amendments replace the definition of a ‘change in accounting estimates’ with a definition of ‘accounting estimates’. Under the new definition, 
accounting estimates are ‘monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty’. The Board has retained the 
concept of changes in accounting estimates in the standard by including a number of clarifications; 

• 

•  Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes). The amendments narrow 
the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of IAS 12 so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, 
give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The IASB expects that the amendments will reduce diversity in reporting and 
align the accounting for deferred tax on such transactions with the general principle in IAS 12 of recognising deferred tax for temporary 
differences; and
International Tax Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes). The scope of IAS 12 has been amended to clarify that 
the standard applies to income taxes arising from tax law enacted or substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two model rules published 
by the OECD, including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes described in those rules. The amendments 
introduce a temporary exception to the accounting requirements for deferred taxes in IAS 12, so that an entity would neither recognise nor 
disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. The Group confirms that it has applied this 
exception during the period.

The nature and impact of the adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 are disclosed in notes A2.1 and A2.2 below. The remaining amendments to standards 
are not considered to have a material effect on these consolidated financial statements.

FinancialsFinancialsA. Significant accounting policies continued
A2.1 Adoption of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
The Group has adopted IFRS 17 effective from 1 January 2023 and comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2022 has been 
retrospectively restated. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and significantly changes the way the Group recognises, measures, 
presents and discloses its insurance contracts, investment contracts with discretionary participation features (‘DPF’) and reinsurance contracts 
held. It introduces a model that measures groups of contracts based on the present value of future cash flows with an explicit risk adjustment for 
non-financial risk and a contractual service margin (‘CSM’), representing the unearned profit to be recognised in profit or loss over the 
coverage period.

New accounting policies adopted following the implementation of IFRS 17 are included within note F1 and critical accounting estimates and 
judgements applied are detailed in note A4.

A2.1.1 Transition approach
Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 17 have been applied using a fully retrospective approach (‘FRA’) to the 
extent practicable and using a Fair Value Approach (‘FVA’) approach where the FRA was considered impracticable. The FRA requires 
the Group to: 

identify, recognise and measure each group of insurance and reinsurance contracts as if IFRS 17 had always applied; 

•
• derecognise any existing balances that would not exist had IFRS 17 always applied; and 
•

recognise any resulting net difference in equity.

In determining whether it was practicable for the FRA transition method to be applied, the Group has considered the following key factors:

•

•

•

the ability to obtain assumptions and data at the required level of granularity, without the material use of hindsight, particularly in relation to 
contracts within acquired businesses and where the Group’s financial reporting metrics did not require such information;
the availability and usability of historic data given the significant integration work performed by the Group on both its policy administration 
and actuarial modelling systems where re-platforming from legacy systems onto a unified platform has been carried out; and 
the significant level of regulatory change experienced by the insurance industry, such as Solvency II, which impacts on the level of change 
undertaken on both legacy and current policy administration and actuarial modelling systems.

The FRA has been applied to the following insurance business on transition to IFRS 17:

• bulk purchase annuities;
• annuities and unit-linked policies that originated from 1 January 2021 onwards for the acquired Standard Life Assurance business entities;
• SunLife policies that originated post 1 January 2018; and
• ReAssure Assurance Limited annuities and non-profit policies from acquisition date of the ReAssure entities.

The FVA has been applied to the Group’s remaining insurance business. On transition, 58% of the CSM (net of reinsurance) is calculated under 
the FRA and 42% under the FVA. However, of the business transitioned under FRA a significant amount of the CSM relates to the ReAssure 
business acquired in 2020 and fair valued at that date. Management therefore considers c.95% of the liabilities, equating to c.84% of the CSM, 
to be a more accurate reflection of the use of the FVA. 

In applying the FVA, the CSM (or loss component) has been determined at 1 January 2022 as the difference between the fair value of a group of 
contracts and the present value of expected future cash flows including acquisition costs, plus an explicit risk adjustment. In determining the fair 
value, the Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, except for the demand deposit floor requirement, as required 
by IFRS 17. The fair value determined by the Group uses cash flows with contract boundaries consistent with IFRS 17 requirements. The 
measurement of the fair value of contracts includes items taken into consideration by a market participant but which are not included in the IFRS 
17 measurement of contracts, such as a risk premium to reflect a market participant’s view of uncertainty inherent in the contract cash flows being 
valued and a profit margin. Significant judgements and estimates used in determining the fair value have been set out in note A4.1.

The fair value for the groups of with-profits contracts, has been determined at transition date as the sum of the best estimate liability (‘BEL’); the 
policyholders’ share of the estate; a risk premium; and other fair value adjustments, i.e. profits on annuities vesting into the non-profit fund.

The treatment for reinsurance contracts held at transition is similar to that for insurance contracts with a few exceptions. The reinsurance BEL is 
calculated using the IFRS 17 discounted probability-weighted expected present value of the cash flows on transition date. The cash flows under 
the reinsurance contract are stressed in order to calculate the risk premium, plus an adjustment is made for risk of reinsurer default (i.e. additional 
risk of claims received being lower than the best estimate) in the risk premium.

A2.1.2 Impact of transition
Total equity attributable to owners of the parent
The Group has determined the quantitative impact of moving to IFRS 17 on 1 January 2022 to be a decrease in the total equity attributable to 
owners of the parent of £48 million, from £5,815 million to £5,767 million. The main drivers of this reduction are:

Derecognition of intangible 
assets related to contracts 
measured under IFRS 17

Remeasurement of 
insurance contract liabilities 
(net of reinsurance)

On adoption of IFRS 17, the acquired in force business (‘AVIF’) and customer relationship 
intangibles and deferred acquisition cost assets associated with the acquisition of insurance 
contracts are no longer held as separate assets and instead are included implicitly in the 
measurement of insurance contract assets and liabilities.

£m

(2,030)

The remeasurement of insurance contract liabilities primarily includes the following items:

5,481

•

•

removal of IFRS 4 margins as IFRS 17 requires cash flows to be measured on a best estimate 
basis with the addition of an explicit adjustment for risk;
inclusion of future shareholder profits from with-profit and unit-linked business that are not 
fully recognised under IFRS 4; and

• changes in the discount rate, most materially impacting annuity contracts.

Also included is the impact of a change in treatment in respect of hybrid contracts. These are 
typically contracts which contain elements of unit-linked and with-profits. Under IFRS 4 these 
components were separated and reported under IAS 39 and IFRS 4 respectively. Under IFRS 
17 if the contract as a whole meets the definition of an investment with DPF contract, the whole 
contract falls within the scope of IFRS 17 unless the criteria for a distinct investment component 
is met. If it does not, the whole contract falls within the scope of IFRS 9. On transition a 
significant proportion of the Group’s hybrid contracts were determined to fall within the scope 
of IFRS 17 and did not meet the criteria to be separated into its components. A small portion of 
hybrid contracts are accounted for under IFRS 9.

Recognition of a risk adjustment 
(net of reinsurance)

IFRS 17 requires an explicit adjustment in respect of non-financial risk, this replaces some of the 
margins for uncertainty implicitly included in the measurement of cash flows under IFRS 4.

The contractual service margin reflects the unearned profit to be recognised in profit or loss as 
services are provided.

In addition to the above IFRS 17 has impacted how insurance and reinsurance contract-related balances are presented in the statement of 
consolidated financial position. Certain assets and liabilities previously reported separately are now included within IFRS 17 balances, these 
include balances such as unallocated surplus, deposits received from reinsurers and insurance contract/reinsurance payables/receivables and 
payables related to direct insurance contracts. Other liabilities and assets have been partly reclassified within IFRS 17 liabilities and assets where 
these balances relate to insurance contracts, such as provisions, loans and deposits (policy loans), other payables and other receivables. Costs 
that are assessed as directly attributable to insurance contracts are accounted for under IFRS 17 and this includes those that would have 
previously determined in accordance with the requirements of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets to be included 
in provisions.

Details of the adjusted operating profit methodology following the transition to IFRS 17 is set out in note B1.

The main drivers of this reduction are:

•  the change in profit recognition pattern. Under IFRS 17 profits are spread over the life of contracts as service is provided. This includes the 

deferral of new business profits from annuity contracts written in the period;

•  economic variances have increased in relation to the Solvency II hedging in place. The interest rate sensitive liabilities reduce compared to 
IFRS 4 as the majority of the Group’s CSM uses locked-in discount rates resulting in a higher level of ‘over-hedging’. In addition, the offset to 
the losses primarily from interest rate hedging from gains arising on equity hedges in the previously reported numbers is reduced, as under 
IFRS 17 these hedges now partially offset adverse market impacts arising in the income statement from unit-linked and with-profits business 
which have a loss component;

•  a reduction in amortisation of the element of acquired in-force (‘AVIF’) business associated with insurance contracts which is derecognised 

on transition to IFRS 17; and

•  other non-operating items have reduced due to costs that have been assessed as directly attributable to insurance contracts being included 

in the calculation of the CSM. 

A2.2 Adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The 
Group elected, under the amendments to IFRS 4, to apply the temporary exemption from IFRS 9, to defer the initial application date of IFRS 9 to 
align with the initial application of IFRS 17. The Group has therefore adopted the requirements of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2023 and in accordance 
with the transition provisions in the standard, comparatives have not been restated. 

IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and liabilities, impairment methodology, and general hedge 
accounting rules and replaced the corresponding sections of IAS 39. 

New accounting policies adopted following the implementation of IFRS 9 are included within note E1.

A2.2.1 Classification and measurement of financial instruments
Financial assets
IFRS 9 requires all financial assets to be assessed based on a combination of the Group’s business model for managing the assets and the 
instruments’ contractual cash flow characteristics. As a result of adopting IFRS 9 on 1 January 2023, certain loans and deposits and cash and 
cash equivalents investment asset balances, previously classified as amortised cost, have now been reclassified at fair value through profit or loss 
(‘FVTPL’) (mandatory) category. The classification adopted is driven by the business model assessment which determined that these assets are 
managed and evaluated on a fair value basis. These financial assets, which back policyholder liabilities, are actively managed and therefore 
support the wider objective of the Group to maximise Solvency II headroom. The reclassification of these assets has not resulted in an adjustment 
to equity at 1 January 2023 as the fair value of these assets at this date was equal to the amortised cost.

Under IAS 39, certain underlying items of participating contracts were designated as at FVTPL because the Group managed them and 
evaluated their performance on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented investment strategy. Under IFRS 9, portfolios of these assets 
are mandatorily measured at FVTPL as the business model assessment concludes that they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis and 
consequently the classification as FVTPL remains unchanged upon adoption of IFRS 9.

All other financial assets that are not actively managed such as certain cash and cash equivalents, receivables and loans and deposits, are 
typically held to collect cash flows and therefore continue to be classified as amortised cost under IFRS 9.

The Group has not elected to measure any equity securities financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’). Further, 
no other debt securities financial assets are classified as FVOCI on adoption of IFRS 9.

Financial liabilities
IFRS 9 has not had a significant effect on the Group’s accounting policies for financial liabilities as the classification and measurement of financial 
liabilities remains largely unchanged from IAS 39. Financial liabilities are either classified as amortised cost or at FVTPL. 

Investment contracts without DPF, which do not transfer significant insurance risk, continue to be accounted for as a financial liability and 
designated at FVTPL on the basis that these liabilities are both managed on a fair value basis and are designated as such to avoid an accounting 
mismatch with the assets held to back them. 

On transition to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, deposits from reinsurers are no longer classified as financial liabilities under IFRS 9 in accordance with the 
IFRS 17 requirements for ‘premium withheld’ arrangements. The premiums withheld have now become a component of fulfilment cash flows and 
for contracts with deposit back arrangements, the presentation of the deposit back liability has now changed to be shown as an offset to the 
reinsurance asset.

The Group has assessed the IFRS 9 requirement that changes in fair value of financial liabilities relating to credit risk be presented in OCI, with 
the balance of the change in fair value to be presented in profit and loss, unless this treatment would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch 
in profit and loss. Based on this assessment, no financial liabilities were identified as requiring split presentation of movements between OCI and 
profit and loss as this would create an accounting mismatch as the assets held to back these liabilities are at FVTPL. 

The valuation of investment contract liabilities without DPF are measured at the fair value of the related assets and liabilities. The liability is the 
sum of the investment contract liabilities plus an additional amount to cover the present value of the excess of future policy costs over 
future charges.

The application of the classification and measurement requirements in IFRS 9 at 1 January 2023 resulted in the following 
reclassification adjustments:

A2.2.2 Impairment
The adoption of IFRS 9 has changed the Group’s accounting for impairment losses for financial assets held at amortised cost by replacing IAS 
39’s incurred loss approach with a forward-looking expected credit loss (‘ECL’) approach. The new impairment model applies to the Group’s 
financial assets carried at amortised cost. 

A significant portion of Group’s financial assets are carried at FVTPL under IFRS 9 and are therefore not subject to ECL assessment. The other 
financial assets classified as amortised cost and subject to ECL mainly relate to certain loan assets, other receivables and certain cash and cash 
equivalents balances.

FinancialsFinancialsNotes to the consolidated financial statements continuedA. Significant accounting policies continued
A2.2.2 Impairment continued
In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group has applied the ECL model to financial assets measured at amortised cost. For these in-scope financial 
assets at the reporting date either the lifetime expected credit loss or a 12-month expected credit loss is provided for, depending on the Group’s 
assessment of whether the credit risk associated with the specific asset has increased significantly since initial recognition. The Group’s current 
credit risk grading framework comprises the following categories:

Category 

Description 

Basis for recognising ECL

Performing 

The counterparty has a low risk of default and does not have any past-due amounts

12 month ECL

Doubtful 

In default

Write-off 

There has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition

Lifetime ECL – not credit impaired

There is evidence indicating the asset is credit impaired

There is evidence indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty 
and the Group has no realistic prospect of recovery

Lifetime ECL – credit impaired

Amount is written off

The financial assets held at amortised cost are assessed at transition as ‘performing’ and this assessment is summarised below. 

Loans and deposits – the Group has assessed the estimated credit losses of these loans and deposits as low due to the external credit ratings of 
the counterparties resulting in low credit risk and there being no past-due amounts. 

Other receivables – these balances relate to investment broker balances and other regular receivables due to the Group in the normal course of 
business. Expected credit losses are assessed as being immaterial given the typically short-term nature of these balances.

Cash and cash equivalents – the Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions, which have investment grade 
credit ratings of “BBB” or above. The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings 
of the counterparties and no history of default. The impact to the net carrying amount stated in the table above is therefore considered not 
to be material.

Based on the above assessment, an immaterial credit loss balance has been determined due to these financial assets being predominantly 
short-term and having low credit risk.

A2.2.3 Hedge accounting
The Group has applied IFRS 9’s hedge accounting requirements. The Group uses cross currency swaps to hedge the currency risk arising from 
borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. The Group has carried over the current hedging relationships as cash flow hedges under IFRS 9. 
The IFRS 9 hedge accounting model requires the extended documentation of each hedging relationship. The Group has updated the existing 
hedging documentation to reflect the changes to the effectiveness testing process to include qualitative testing on a prospective basis including 
the analysis of the economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument, analysis of source of hedge ineffectiveness, 
determining the hedge ratio and assessment of whether the effect of credit risk dominates the value changes that result from the economic 
relationship. The current hedging relationships are straightforward arrangements whereby the cross currency swaps fully hedge the underlying 
hedged item and they are all fully collateralised. 

A3. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies have been consistently applied in these consolidated financial statements. An exception to this is where IFRS 9 
has been adopted prospectively from 1 January 2023 and IAS 39 has been applied in the comparative period. Where an accounting policy can 
be directly attributed to a specific note to the consolidated financial statements, the policy is presented within that note, with a view to enabling 
greater understanding of the results and financial position of the Group. All other significant accounting policies are disclosed below.

A3.1 Foreign currency transactions
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Group’s 
presentation currency.

The results and financial position of all Group companies that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated 
into the presentation currency as follows:

• assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the period end;
•
income, expenses and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated at average exchange rates; and
• all resulting exchange differences are recognised through the statement of consolidated comprehensive income.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the transacting Group entity using exchange rates prevailing at the 
date of the translation. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Translation differences on 
non-monetary items at fair value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.

A3.2 Other operating income
Other operating income includes income from all other operating activities which are incidental to the principal activities of the Group.

A4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of 
policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Disclosures of judgements made by management in applying the 
Group’s accounting policies include those that have the most significant effect on the amounts that are recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements. Disclosures of estimates and associated assumptions include those that have a significant risk of resulting in a material change to the 
carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next year. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and 
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of the judgements as to the 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Critical accounting estimates are those which involve the most complex or subjective judgements or assessments. The areas of the Group’s 
business that typically require such estimates are the measurement of insurance and investment contract liabilities with DPF, determination of the 
fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, and valuation of pension scheme assets and liabilities.

The application of critical accounting judgements that could have the most significant effect on the recognised amounts include classification 
of contracts to be accounted for as insurance or investment contracts, the determination of adjusted operating profit, the recognition of an 
investment as an associate and determination of control with regard to underlying entities. 

Details of all critical accounting estimates and judgements are included below.

A4.1 Insurance contract and investment contract with DPF liabilities
The Group applies significant judgement and estimation when classifying and measuring insurance contracts, including determination of the 
inputs, assumptions and techniques it uses to determine the BEL, risk adjustment and CSM at each reporting period to measure the insurance 
contract and reinsurance contact liabilities/assets. The main areas where significant judgement and estimation were required are:

Contract classification 
Classification of contracts as insurance (or reinsurance) is based upon an assessment of the significance of insurance risk transferred to the 
Group. Insurance contracts are defined by IFRS 17 as those containing significant insurance risk if, and only if, an insured event could cause an 
insurer to make significant additional payments in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance, at the inception of 
the contract.

Classification of contracts as investment with DPF is based upon an assessment of whether the discretionary amount of benefits is expected to 
be a significant amount of the total benefits. 

Measurement of insurance contract liabilities
In applying IFRS 17 requirements for the measurement of insurance contract liabilities, the following inputs and methods were used that include 
significant estimates:

•

•
•
•

the present value of future cash flows is estimated using deterministic scenarios, except where stochastic modelling involves projecting future 
cash flows under a large number of possible economic scenarios for market variables such as interest rates and equity returns and where the 
cash flows reflect a series of interrelated options that are implicit or explicit;
the approach and assumptions used to derive discount rates, including any illiquid premiums (see note F11.2.1);
the approach and confidence level for estimating risk adjustments for non-financial risk (see note F11.2.2); and
the assumptions about future cash flows relating to mortality, morbidity, policyholder behaviour, and expense inflation (see note F11.2.3). 

Details of how insurance contract liabilities are accounted for are included within the accounting policies in note F1.

Amortisation of the CSM
The Group applies judgements when determining the amount of the CSM for a group of insurance contracts to be recognised in profit or loss as 
insurance revenue in each period to reflect the insurance contract services provided in that period. The amount is determined by considering for 
each group of contracts the quantity of the benefits provided and its expected coverage period. Determining the coverage unit requires 
significant judgement, taking into consideration a number of areas, including: 

•

•

identification of a coverage unit that is deemed to be a suitable proxy for the service provided. This is particularly relevant for products that 
provide a combination of different types of insurance coverage, investment-related service and investment-return service; and
the allowance for time value of money in the release of the coverage unit (i.e. whether or not the coverage units should be discounted).

For deferred annuities the weighting between the deferral phase and the payment phase coverage units is calculated so that the services 
provided in the deferral phase reflect the investment return and those in the payment phase reflect the annuity payment with the total services 
adjusted to provide a consistent level of service when transitioning between the deferral phase and the payment phase.

Following an assessment, the Group has determined the quantity of the benefits provided under each contract to be a suitable proxy for the 
service provided as follows:

Type of business/products

Term life assurance
Endowment
Non-participating whole-life
Other protection products

Immediate annuity

Deferred annuity

Unit linked

Coverage unit (quantity of benefits)

Sum assured in force

Annuity payments

Fund size during deferred period and annuity payments for the 
payment period

Annual management charge and insurance charges

Conventional with-profits (‘CWP’) & Unitised with-profits (‘UWP’)

Maximum of the guaranteed benefit and asset share

In relation to the application of discount rate in determining the coverage units, the Group has elected to apply discounting as this gives a more 
even allocation of profit as services are provided over the life of a group of contracts. The discount rate is the locked-in rate for insurance 
contracts measured under the general model (‘GM’) and current rates for insurance contracts measured under the variable fee approach (‘VFA’). 

In addition, the sections noted below are areas where significant judgement and estimation has been required on transition to IFRS 17.

Determination of transition method and its application
The Group exercised significant judgement in determining which transition method was applied for each group of insurance contracts, 
considering the impracticability assessment for the application of the FRA, including determining whether sufficient reasonable and 
supportable information was available to apply the FRA. Where it was assessed that a FRA was impracticable, the Group determined, in line with 
the options available in IFRS 17, to use the FVA.

FinancialsFinancialsNotes to the consolidated financial statements continuedA. Significant accounting policies continued
A4.1 Insurance contract and investment contract with DPF liabilities continued
Amortisation of the CSM continued
In applying the FVA, the Group has used reasonable and supportable information at the transition date in order to identify groups of insurance 
contracts and to determine whether any contracts are considered to be direct participating contracts, which meet the VFA eligibility criteria. 
For groups of contracts measured using the FVA, the Group has aggregated contracts issued more than one year apart.

In estimating the fair value, the Group has used significant judgement to determine adjustments required to reflect a market participant’s view, 
and also to allocate fair value between groups of insurance contracts as follows:

• only relevant future cash flows within the boundaries of the insurance contracts were included in the fair value estimation; 
• assumptions about BEL were adjusted and simplified by applying IFRS 17 parameters i.e. discount rate, expenses, contract boundary plus 

incorporating the risk premium to reflect the view of a market participant;

• discount rates were determined at the transition date, based on the risk-free rate with an allowance for illiquid premium taken into account; 
•
the risk premium was calibrated to a market participant view of an appropriate cost of capital rate; and
• a proportional approach was used to allocate the risk premium to each group of insurance contracts.

Eligibility assessment for use of VFA
The Group has issued unit-linked and with-profits contracts, which fall within the scope of IFRS 17, where the return on the underlying items is 
shared with policyholders. Underlying items comprise mainly specified portfolios of investment assets for unit-linked contracts and the net assets 
of a with-profits fund for with-profits policies that determine amounts payable to policyholders. The Group has exercised significant judgement 
to assess whether the amounts expected to be paid to the policyholder constitute a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying 
items. The policyholder’s share of the fair value returns on underlying items includes amounts deducted to cover non-investment services, e.g. 
administration and risk charges. The fair value returns assumed on the underlying items also reflect the expected real world returns over the 
duration of the contract or group of insurance contracts being tested.

Determination of contract boundaries
The assessment of the contract boundary defines which future cash flows are included in the measurement of a contract. This requires 
judgement and consideration of the Group’s substantive rights and obligations under the contract. The Group exercises significant judgement in 
determining the appropriate contract boundaries, taking into consideration a number of factors, including: features and terms and conditions of 
products; any implied substantive obligations and rights arising from the features of the product or policyholder needs it is meeting; pricing 
practices; and administrative practices. 

Cash flows are within the boundaries of investment contracts with DPF if they result from a substantive obligation of the Group to deliver cash at 
a present or future date.

Separating distinct investment components from insurance and reinsurance contracts
When assessing whether an investment component is distinct, the Group considers the following, which may indicate that the insurance and 
investment component are highly interrelated:

the value of one component varies with the other component;

•
• existence of an option to switch between the different components;
• discounts that span both elements e.g. reduced asset management charges based on total size of contract; and
• other interacting features, e.g. insurance risk from premium waivers, return of premium covering both elements of the policy.

Where the investment component is non-distinct, the whole contract is measured under IFRS 17. Distinct investment components are separated 
from the host insurance contract and measured under IFRS 9. 

A4.2 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value and accounted for as set out in the accounting policies in note E1. Financial instruments 
valued where valuation techniques are based on observable market data at the period end are categorised as Level 2 financial instruments. 
Financial instruments valued where valuation techniques are based on non-observable inputs are categorised as Level 3 financial instruments. 
Level 2 and Level 3 financial instruments therefore involve the use of estimates.

Further details of the estimates made are included in note E2. In relation to the Level 3 financial instruments, sensitivity analysis is performed in 
respect of the key assumptions used in the valuation of these financial instruments. The details of this sensitivity analysis are included in note E2.4.

A4.3 Pension scheme obligations
The valuation of pension scheme obligations is determined using actuarial valuations that depend upon a number of assumptions, including 
discount rate, inflation and longevity. External actuarial advice is taken with regard to setting the financial assumptions to be used in the valuation. 
As defined benefit pension schemes are long-term in nature, such assumptions can be subject to significant uncertainty. 

Further details of these estimates and the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to key assumptions are provided in note G1.

A4.4 Adjusted operating profit
Adjusted operating profit is the Group’s non-GAAP measure of performance and provides stakeholders with a comparable measure of the 
underlying performance of the Group. The Group is required to make judgements as to the appropriate longer-term rates of investment return 
for the determination of adjusted operating profit based on yields at the start of the financial year, as detailed in note B2, and as to whether items 
are included within adjusted operating profit or excluded as an adjustment to adjusted operating profit in accordance with the accounting 
policy detailed in note B1. Items excluded from adjusted operating profit are referred to as ‘non-operating items’.

A4.5 Control and consolidation 
The Group has invested in a number of collective investment schemes and other types of investment where judgement is applied in determining 
whether the Group controls the activities of these entities. These entities are typically structured in such a way that owning the majority of the 
voting rights is not the conclusive factor in the determination of control in line with the requirements of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The control assessment therefore involves a number of further considerations such as whether the Group has a unilateral power of 
veto in general meetings and whether the existence of other agreements restrict the Group from being able to influence the activities. Further 
details of these judgements are given in note H1.

A4.6 How climate risk affects our accounting judgments and estimates 
In preparation of these financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate change across a number of areas, predominantly 
in respect of the valuation of financial instruments, insurance and investment contract liabilities and goodwill and other intangible assets. 

Many of the effects arising from climate change will be longer-term in nature, with an inherent level of uncertainty, and have been assessed as 
having a limited effect on accounting judgments and estimates for the current period. 

The majority of the Group’s financial assets are held at fair value and use quoted market prices or observable market inputs in their valuation. 
The use of quoted market prices and market inputs to determine fair value reflects current information and market sentiment regarding the effect 
of climate risk. For the valuation of level 3 financial instruments, there are no material unobservable inputs in relation to climate risk. Note E6 
provides further risk management disclosures in relation to financial risks including sensitivities in relation to credit and market risk. In addition, 
further details on managing the related climate change risks are provided in the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’) on 
page 44 of the Annual Report and Accounts. 

Insurance and investment contract liabilities with DPF use economic assumptions taking into account market conditions at the valuation date as 
well as non-economic assumptions such as future expenses, longevity and mortality, which are set based on past experience, market practice, 
regulations and expectations about future trends. Due to the level of annuities written by the Group, it is particularly exposed to longevity risk. At 
31 December 2023 there are no adjustments made to the longevity assumptions to specifically allow for the impact of climate change on 
annuitant mortality. Further details as to how assumptions are set and of the sensitivity of the Group’s results to annuitant longevity and other key 
insurance risks are set out in note F11. 

The assessment of impairment for goodwill and intangible assets is based on value in use calculations. Value in use represents the value of future 
cash flows and uses the Group’s three-year annual operating plan and the expectation of long-term economic growth beyond this period. The 
three-year annual operating plan reflects management’s current expectations on competitiveness and profitability and reflects the expected 
impacts of the process of moving towards a low carbon economy. Note G2 provides further details on goodwill and other intangible assets and 
on impairment testing performed.

A5. New accounting pronouncements not yet effective 
The IASB has issued the following standards or amended standards and interpretations which apply from the dates shown. The Group has 
decided not to early adopt any of these standards, amendments or interpretations where this is permitted.

Classification of Liabilities as Current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements) 
(1 January 2024)
The initial amendments clarify rather than change existing requirements and aim to assist entities in determining whether debt and other 
liabilities with an uncertain settlement date should be classed as current or non-current. It is currently not expected that there will be any 
reclassifications as a result of this clarification.

Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements) (1 January 2024)
Further amendments were then made which specify that covenants of loan arrangements which an entity must comply with only after the reporting 
date would not affect classification of a liability as current or non-current at the reporting date. However, those covenants that an entity is required 
to comply with on or before the reporting date would affect classification as current or non-current, even if the covenant is only assessed after the 
entity’s reporting date. The amendments also introduce additional disclosure requirements. When an entity classifies a liability arising from a loan 
arrangement as non-current and that liability is subject to the covenants which an entity is required to comply with within 12 months of the reporting 
date, the entity shall disclose information in the notes that enables users of financial statements to understand the risk that the liability could 
become repayable within 12 months of the reporting period. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.

Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases) (1 January 2024)
The amendments relate to how a seller-lessee accounts for variable lease payments that arise in a sale and leaseback transaction. On initial 
recognition, the seller-lessee is required to include variable lease payments when measuring a lease liability arising from a sale-and-leaseback 
transaction. After initial recognition, they are required to apply the general requirements for subsequent accounting of the lease liability such 
that no gain or loss relating to the retained right of use is recognised. Seller-lessees are required to reassess and potentially restate sale-and-
leaseback transactions entered into since the implementation. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.

Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures) 
(1 January 2024)
The amendments add a disclosure objective to IAS 7 stating that an entity is required to disclose information about its supplier finance 
arrangements that enables users of financial statements to assess the effects of those arrangements on the entity’s liabilities and cash flows. In 
addition, IFRS 7 was amended to add supplier finance arrangements as an example within the requirements to disclose information about an 
entity’s exposure to concentration of liquidity risk These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.

Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates) (1 January 2025)
The amendments clarify how an entity should assess whether a currency is exchangeable and how it should determine a spot exchange rate 
when exchangeability is lacking, as well as require the disclosure of information that enables users of financial statements to understand the 
impact of a currency not being exchangeable. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.

Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28) 
(Effective date deferred)
The amendments address the conflict between IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is sold or contributed 
to an associate or joint venture. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.

The following amendments to standards listed above have been endorsed for use in the UK by the UK Endorsement Board:

• Classification of Liabilities as Current and Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1);
• Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1); 
• Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases); and
• Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures).

FinancialsFinancialsNotes to the consolidated financial statements continuedAdjusted operating profit excludes the impacts of the following items:

Economic variances 
•

the difference between actual and expected experience for economic items recognised in the income statement, impacts of economic 
assumptions on the valuation of liabilities measured under the General Model and the change in value of loss components on Variable Fee 
Approach business resulting from market movements on underlying items;

• economic volatility arising from the Group’s hedging strategy which is calibrated to protect the Solvency II capital position and cash 

•

•

•

generation capability of the operating companies;
the accounting mismatch resulting from the application of IFRS 17 between the measurement of non-profit business in a with-profit fund 
(noted above) and the change in fair value of this business included within the measurement of the with-profit contracts under the Variable 
Fee Approach;
the accounting mismatch resulting from buy-in contracts between the Group’s pension schemes and Phoenix Life Limited, the Group’s main 
insurance subsidiary. The mismatch represents the difference between the unwind of the IAS 19 discount rate calculated with reference to a 
AA-rated corporate bond and the expected investment returns on the backing assets; and
the effect of the mismatch between changes in estimates of future cash flows on General Model contracts measured at current discount 
rates and the corresponding adjustment to the CSM measured at the discount rate locked-in at inception. 

Other
• amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (net of policyholder tax);
• finance costs attributable to owners;
• gains or losses on the acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries (net of related costs);
•
•
•
• any other items which, in the Director’s view, should be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature or incidence to enable a full 

the financial impacts of mandatory regulatory change;
the profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests;
integration, restructuring or other significant one-off projects impacting the income statement; and

understanding of the Group’s financial performance. This is typically the case where the nature of the item is not reflective of the underlying 
performance of the operating companies. 

The items excluded from adjusted operating profit are referred to as ‘non-operating items’. Whilst the excluded items are important to an 
assessment of the consolidated financial performance of the Group, management considers that the presentation of adjusted operating profit 
provides a good indicator of the underlying performance of the Group’s operating segments and the Group uses this, as part of a suite of 
measures, for decision-making and monitoring performance. The Group’s adjusted operating profit should be read in conjunction with the 
IFRS profit before tax.

Revisions to methodology
The methodology to determine adjusted operating profit has been revised, compared to that disclosed in the Interim Financial Report 2023, 
for the following items:

• A 1-year (rather than a 15-year) risk-free rate has been used to derive the expected investment return assumption on assets backing 

insurance contract liabilities to reduce unintended economic volatility (see note B2.1); 

• an adjustment to remove mismatches between the discount rate used within the valuation of the Group’s pension scheme liabilities and the 

returns on the underlying assets, as noted within Economic Variances above; and 

• a refinement to the approach used to quantify the level of trading profits.

The segmental result for the year ended 31 December 2022 presented in note B1.1 incorporates these revisions. The impact of these revisions 
is to reduce total segmental adjusted operating profit by £26 million, and correspondingly to increase economic variances by £26 million. 
There is no impact on the loss before the tax attributable to owners of the parent.

B. Earnings performance
B1. Segmental analysis

The Group defines and presents operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ which requires such segments to be 
based on the information which is provided to the Board, and therefore segmental information in this note is presented on a different basis 
from profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. 

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, 
including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the Group.

For management purposes the Group is organised into value centres. During the period the Group reassessed its reportable segments to 
reflect its transition to a purpose-led retirement specialist and the commencement of the grow, optimise and enhance stage of our strategic 
journey. The Group now has five operating segments comprising Retirement Solutions, Pensions & Savings, With-Profits, SunLife & Protection, 
and Europe & Other. The comparative information has been restated to reflect this change. For reporting purposes, operating segments are 
aggregated where they share similar economic characteristics including the nature of products and services, types of customers and the 
nature of the regulatory environment. The SunLife & Protection operating segment has been aggregated with the Europe operating segment 
into the Europe & Other reportable segment.

The Retirement Solutions segment includes new and in-force individual annuity and Bulk Purchase Annuity contracts written within 
shareholder funds, with the exception of individual annuity contracts written as a result of Guaranteed Annuity Options on with-profit 
contracts. Such contracts remain in the With-Profits segment following the transition to IFRS 17, as they fall within the contract boundary of the 
original savings or pension contract. The Retirement Solutions segment also includes UK individual annuity business written within the 
Standard Life Heritage With-Profit Fund as the profits are primarily attributable to the shareholder through the Recourse Cash Flow 
mechanism established on demutualisation. 

The Pensions & Savings segment includes new and in-force life insurance and investment unit-linked policies in respect of pensions and 
savings products that the Group continues to actively market to new and existing policyholders. This includes products such as workplace 
pensions and Self-Invested Personal Pension (‘SIPPs’) distributed through the Group’s Strategic Partnership with abrdn plc. In addition, it 
includes in-force insurance and investment unit-linked products from legacy businesses which no longer actively sell products to 
policyholders and which therefore run-off gradually over time. The Pensions & Savings segment also includes UK unitised business written in 
the Standard Life Heritage With-Profit funds, as profits are primarily attributable to the shareholder through the Recourse Cash 
Flow mechanism.

The With-Profits segment includes all policies written by the Group’s with-profit funds, with the exception of Standard Life Heritage With-
Profit Fund contracts reflected in other segments as noted above for Retirement Solutions and Pensions & Savings where profits are primarily 
attributable to the shareholder through the Recourse Cash Flow mechanism. 

The Europe & Other segment includes business written in Ireland and Germany. This includes products that are actively being marketed to 
new policyholders and legacy in-force products that are no longer being sold to new customers. The segment also includes protection 
products and products sold under the SunLife brand.

The Corporate Centre segment, which is not a reportable segment, principally comprises central head office costs that are not directly 
attributable to the Group’s insurance or investment contracts. Management services costs are now allocated to the four reportable segments.

Inter-segment transactions are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. Segmental results include 
those transfers between business segments which are then eliminated on consolidation.

Segmental measure of performance: Adjusted operating profit
The Group uses a non-GAAP measure of performance, being adjusted operating profit, to evaluate segmental performance. Adjusted 
operating profit is considered to provide a comparable measure of the underlying performance of the business as it excludes the impact of 
short-term economic volatility and other one-off items. 

The Group’s adjusted operating profit methodology has been updated since it was disclosed in the 2022 consolidated financial statements 
following the transition to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.

The following sets out the adjusted operating profit methodology:

For unit-linked business accounted for under IFRS 9, adjusted operating profit reflects the fees collected from customers less operating 
expenses including overheads. 

For unit-linked and With-Profits business accounted for under IFRS 17, adjusted operating profit reflects the release of the risk adjustment, 
amortisation of CSM, and demographic experience variances in the period. 

For shareholder annuity, other non-profit business and With-Profits funds receiving shareholder support accounted for under IFRS 17, 
adjusted operating profit includes the release of the risk adjustment, amortisation of CSM, and demographic experience variances in the 
period. Adjusted operating profit also incorporates an expected return on the financial investments backing this business and any surplus 
assets, with allowance for the corresponding movement in liabilities. 

Adjusted operating profit excludes the above items for non-profit business written in a With-Profits fund where these amounts do not accrue 
directly to the shareholder. 

Adjusted operating profit includes the effect of experience variances relating to the current period for non-economic items, such as mortality 
and expenses. It also incorporates the impacts of asset trading and portfolio rebalancing where not reflected in the discount rate used in 
calculating expected return.

Adjusted operating profit is reported net of policyholder finance charges and policyholder tax.

•  £15 million of past service costs in relation to a Group pension scheme. Further details are included in note G1.1;
•  £14 million relating to a support package to help colleagues navigate cost of living challenges, which included giving all colleagues, except the 

most senior staff, a one-off net of tax payment of £1,000 in August 2022;

•  £12 million costs associated with the acquisition of SLF of Canada UK Limited; and
•  Corporate project costs and net other one-off items totalling a cost of £55 million.

Further details of the investment return variances and economic assumption changes on long-term business, and the variance on owners’ funds 
are included in note B2.

The long-term nature of much of the Group’s operations means that, for internal performance management, the effects of short-term 
economic volatility are treated as non-operating items. The Group focuses instead on an adjusted operating profit measure that incorporates 
an expected return on investments supporting its long-term business. The accounting policy adopted in the calculation of adjusted operating 
profit is detailed in note B1. The methodology for the determination of the expected investment return is explained below together with an 
analysis of investment return variances and economic assumption changes recognised outside of adjusted operating profit.

B2.1 Calculation of the long-term investment return
Adjusted operating profit for life assurance business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder, 
annuity, other non-profit business, With-Profit funds receiving shareholder support and surplus assets, with allowance for the corresponding 
movements in liabilities. 

The methodology to determine the expected investment returns on financial investments has been revised, compared to that disclosed in the 
Interim Financial Report 2023, to use the 1-year (rather than 15-year) risk-free rate for deriving the expected investment return assumption on 
assets backing the insurance contract liabilities to reduce unintended economic volatility as set out in note B1. The information below for the year 
ended 31 December 2022 includes these revisions and is presented on a consistent basis to that at 31 December 2023.

The long-term risk-free rate used as the basis for deriving the long-term investment return is consistent with that set out in note F11.2.1 at the 1-year 
duration for assets backing the insurance contract liabilities and surplus cash assets, and at the 15-year duration for surplus non-cash assets. 

A risk premium of 380 bps is added to the risk-free yield for equities (31 December 2022: 370 bps), 50 bps for properties (31 December 2022: 
280 bps) and 130bps for debt securities (31 December 2022: 80 bps). 

The principal assumptions, determined as at 1 January of each reporting period, underlying the calculation of the long-term investment return 
for surplus assets are:

Equities
Properties
Debt securities

2023 
%
7.4
4.1
4.9

2022 
%
4.6
3.7
1.7

During 2022 UK interest rates increased significantly, this had the impact of increasing the risk-free yield at the 15-year point by 271bps from 
0.91% to 3.62%.

B2.2 Life assurance business 
The economic variances excluded from the long-term business operating profit are as follows:

Economic variances

2023
 £m
147

2022
 £m
(3,309)

The net favourable economic variances of £147 million (2022: adverse £3,309 million) have primarily arisen as a result of a more stable market 
environment compared with the significant volatility experience during 2022. The impact of positive changes to discount rates, primarily on 
annuities and including the impact of methodology refinements (see note B2.1), more than offsets the losses arising from the impact of positive 
equity market movements on the hedges the Group holds to protect the Solvency II position. As the full value of future profits impacted by 
equity markets is not held on the IFRS balance sheet, this results in volatility in the Group’s IFRS results.

B3. Earnings per share

The Group calculates its basic earnings per share based on the present shares in issue using the earnings attributable to ordinary equity 
holders of the parent, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. 

Diluted earnings per share are calculated based on the potential future shares in issue assuming the conversion of all potentially dilutive 
ordinary shares. The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of dilutive share awards granted 
to employees.

The basic and diluted earnings per share calculations are also presented based on the Group’s adjusted operating earnings net of financing 
costs. Adjusted operating profit is a non-GAAP performance measure that is considered to provide a comparable measure of the underlying 
performance of the business as it excludes the impact of short-term economic volatility and other one-off items.

The result attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent for the purposes of determining earnings per share has been calculated as set out below.

2023
Profit/(loss) before the tax attributable to owners
Tax (charge)/credit attributable to owners
Profit/(loss) for the year attributable to owners

B4. Dividends

Final dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity when they are approved by the Group’s owners. 
Interim dividends are deducted from equity when they are paid. 

Dividends for the year that are approved after the reporting period are dealt with as an event after the reporting period. Declared dividends 
are those that are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the entity.

On 10 March 2023, the Board recommended a final dividend of 26.0p per share in respect of the year ended 31 December 2022. The dividend 
was approved at the Group’s Annual General Meeting, which was held on 4 May 2023. The dividend amounted to £260 million and was paid on 
10 May 2023. 

On 15 September 2023, the Board declared an interim dividend of 26.0p per share for the half year ended 30 June 2023. The dividend 
amounted to £260 million and was paid on 23 October 2023.

C. Other Income Statement notes
C1. Insurance Revenue

The Group’s insurance revenue reflects the provision of services arising from a group of insurance contracts at an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. Insurance revenue from a group of insurance 
contracts is therefore the relevant portion for the period of the total consideration for the contracts, (i.e. the amount of premiums paid to the 
Group adjusted for financing effect (the time value of money) and excluding any investment components). The total consideration for a group 
of contracts covers amounts related to the provision of services and is comprised of: 

•  the release of the CSM;
•  changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk relating to current services;
•  claims and other insurance service expenses incurred in the period, generally measured at the amounts expected at the beginning of the period;
•  experience adjustments arising from premiums received in the period other than those that relate to future service; 
• 

insurance acquisition cash flows recovery which is determined by allocating the portion of premiums related to the recovery of those cash 
flows on the basis of the passage of time over the expected coverage of a group of contracts; and

•  other amounts, including any other pre-recognition cash flow assets derecognised at the date of initial recognition.

The amount of the CSM of a group of insurance contracts that is recognised as insurance revenue in each year is determined by identifying the 
coverage units in the group, allocating the CSM remaining at the end of the year equally to each coverage unit provided in the year and 
expected to be provided in future years, and recognising in profit or loss the amount of the CSM allocated to coverage units provided in the year. 

The number of coverage units in a group is the quantity of service provided by the contracts in the group, determined by considering for each 
contract the quantity of benefits provided under a contract and its expected coverage period. The coverage units are reviewed and updated 
at each reporting date.

The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period is calculated as follows:

The Group consider the following when determining coverage units: 

Issued ordinary shares at beginning of the year
Effect of ordinary shares issued
Effect of non-contingently issuable shares in respect of Group's long-term incentive plan
Own shares held by the employee benefit trust

The diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period is 1,003 million (2022: 1,001 million). The Group’s long-term 
incentive plan, deferred bonus share scheme and sharesave schemes increased the weighted average number of shares on a diluted basis by 
2,259,377 shares for the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: 1,841,988 shares). As losses have an anti-dilutive effect, none of the share-based 
awards had a dilutive effect in the calculation of basic earnings per share for either of the years ended 31 December 2022 or 31 December 2023.

Earnings per share disclosures are as follows:

•  the quantity of benefits provided by contracts in the group; 
•  the expected coverage period of contracts in the group; 
•  the likelihood of insured events occurring, only to the extent that they affect the expected coverage period of contracts in the group;
•  for insurance contracts without direct participation features, the generation of an investment return for the policyholder, if applicable 

(investment-return service); and

•  for insurance contracts with direct participation features, the management of underlying items on behalf of the policyholder (investment-

related service).

The coverage units for groups of reinsurance contracts held are determined based on the quantity of coverage provided by the reinsurance 
contracts held in the group but not the coverage provided by the insurer to its policyholders through the underlying insurance contracts. 
However, where the reinsurance held is a 100% quota share arrangement, it is expected that the coverage units would be consistent with the 
underlying insurance contracts. Where there is a change to the fulfilment cash flows of the group of underlying policies that does not adjust 
the CSM, it also would not adjust the CSM of the group of reinsurance contracts.

1.  Prior period comparatives have been restated on transition to IFRS17 Insurance Contracts ( see note A2.1 for further details).

Remaining performance obligations
The practical expedient under IFRS 15 has been applied and remaining performance obligations are not disclosed as the Group has the right to 
consideration from customers in amounts that correspond with the performance completed to date. Specifically management charges become 
due over time in proportion to the Group’s provision of investment management services.

In the period no amortisation or impairment losses from contracts with customers were recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.

C3. Net investment income

Net investment income comprises interest, dividends, rents receivable, net interest income/(expense) on the Group defined benefit pension 
scheme asset/(liability), fair value gains and losses on financial assets (except for reinsurers’ share of investment contract liabilities without DPF, 
see note E1), financial liabilities and investment property at fair value and impairment losses on loans and receivables.

Interest income is recognised in the consolidated income statement as it accrues using the effective interest method.

Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated income statement on the date the right to receive payment is established, which in the case 
of listed securities is the ex-dividend date.

Rental income from investment property is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.

Fair value gains and losses on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. Fair value gains and losses includes both realised and unrealised gains and losses.

Net insurance finance income

There is a close relationship between the net investment income in note C3, as it relates to assets backing contracts within the scope of IFRS 17, 
and net insurance finance (expense)/income. Net investment income includes the results for all investment assets including those backing 
investment contracts and surplus assets. 

For Retirement Solutions the principal product is annuities. The insurance finance (expense)/income primarily reflects the unwind of the discount 
rate on the liabilities. This is largely offset by the interest income earned, included within net investment income, on the assets backing the 
annuity contracts which primarily consist of debt securities and equity release mortgages. Changes in the discount rates used to discount the 
annuity cash flows in the measurement of the insurance contract liabilities are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the backing assets, 
included in net investment income, in respect of BEL and risk adjustment. 

Mismatches between net investment income and insurance finance expense arises for the following reason:

•  the annuity business within the Retirement Solutions segment uses the General Model for measurement. As a result, the CSM is measured 

using discount rates locked in at inception, whereas the assets backing the CSM are based on current economic assumptions. 

•  the discount rate for annuity business uses the Strategic Asset Allocation as set out in Note F11.2.1, and therefore insurance finance expenses 
are impacted by changes to this reference portfolio where the asset mix is based on the strategic investment objectives of the Group. Net 
investment income is determined with reference to the actual assets held by the Group during the reporting period. 

•  changes in non-economic assumptions for General Model business impacts BEL and risk adjustment using current discount rates and CSM 

using locked in discount rates. This gives rise to a mismatch for which there is no corresponding item within net investment income. 

For Pensions & Savings the principal products are unit-linked and hybrid contracts which contain an element of unit-linked and unitised 
with-profits within a single contract. These contracts are measured primarily using the Variable Fee Approach as the amounts payable to 
policyholders reflect a substantial share of the fair value returns on the backing assets. As a result the change in fair value of underlying items 
within insurance finance (expense)/income will be closely matched by changes in the backing assets which are also measured at fair value. 

The unwind of discount rate on cash flows within insurance finance (expenses)/income is offset by the investment income recognised in respect 
of backing assets. The discount rate used for BEL and risk adjustment is determined on a bottom-up basis, as set out in note F11.2.1, based on the 
liquidity characteristics of the liabilities rather than with reference to the backing assets and therefore a mismatch occurs. 

For With-Profits business there are differing impacts dependent on the nature of the liabilities within the fund. For with-profit business without 
guarantees the relationship between net investment income and insurance finance (expense)/income will be consistent with that for the business 
within Pensions & Savings. In respect of guarantees, the value of these is typically influenced by changes in interest rates. The Group hedges its 
interest rate risk in respect of these guarantees with derivatives such that the effect of changes in interest rates on guarantees within insurance 
finance (expense)/income are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the derivatives used for hedging in net investment income. 

For non-profit business in a with-profit fund where profits from these contracts accrue to the with-profit policyholders or to the with-profit fund 
estate, the non-profit contracts and their backing assets are considered to be an underlying item of the with-profit contracts and therefore 
changes in their fair value are included within insurance finance (expense)/income. 

The non-profit contracts are measured based on their substance. For non-profit annuities which fall within the scope of IFRS 17, they are 
measured using the IFRS 17 General Model and the treatment of the non-profit contract is consistent with the non-profit annuities within the 
Retirement Solutions segment. The effect of these non-profit annuities on the income statement does not match the change in fair value 
measurement used to measure their effect on the with-profit policyholders and therefore a mismatch arises. For unit-linked business which falls 
within the scope of IFRS 9 it is measured in line with the Group’s accounting policy for investment contracts with this impact being taken through 
‘change in investment contract liabilities’ and therefore is not included in net investment income. The assets backing the non-profit business in 
the with-profit fund are typically measured at fair value with investment income and changes in fair value being included within net 
investment income. 

The Europe & Other segment contains business consistent with that in the segments noted above and will mirror the relationships between net 
investment income and insurance finance (expense)/income as noted above for the relevant type of business. In addition, this segment contains 
protection business which uses a bottom-up discount rate based on the liability characteristics rather than being based on the backing assets, 
which leads to mismatches between net investment income and insurance finance (expenses)/income.

C5. Expenses

Insurance service expenses
Insurance service expenses arising from insurance contracts are recognised in profit or loss generally as they are incurred. They exclude 
repayments of investment components and comprise the following items:

•  adjustment to liabilities for incurred claims and benefits, excluding investment components reduced by loss component allocations; 
•  other incurred directly attributable expenses, including amounts of any other pre-recognition cash flows assets (other than insurance 

acquisition cash flows) derecognised at the date of initial recognition; 
insurance acquisition cash flows amortisation; 
insurance acquisition cash flows assets impairment; and

• 
• 
•  reversal of impairment of assets for insurance acquisition cash flows.

Net income or expense from reinsurance contracts held
Income and expenses from reinsurance contracts are presented separately from income and expenses from insurance contracts. Income and 
expenses from reinsurance contracts, other than insurance finance income or expenses, are presented on a net basis as ‘net expenses from 
reinsurance contracts’ in the insurance service result.

Net expenses from reinsurance contracts comprise an allocation of reinsurance premiums paid less amounts recovered from reinsurers.

The Group recognises an allocation of reinsurance premiums paid in profit or loss as it receives services under groups of reinsurance 
contracts. The allocation of reinsurance premiums paid relating to services received for each period represents the total of the changes in the 
asset for remaining coverage that relates to services for which the Group expects to pay consideration.

Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses are recognised in the consolidated income statement as incurred.

Total expenses are analysed by expenses type as follows:

Claim and benefits
(Reversal of losses)/losses on onerous insurance contracts
Cost of retroactive cover on reinsurance contracts held
Employee costs
Outsourcer expenses
Professional fees
Commission expenses
Office and IT costs

No services were provided by the Company’s auditors to the Group’s pension schemes in either 2023 or 2022. 

The increase in the audit fee during 2023 principally reflects the additional work undertaken in connection with the transition to IFRS 17.

Audit-related assurance services includes fees payable for services where the reporting is required by law or regulation to be provided by the 
auditor, such as reporting on regulatory returns. It also includes fees payable in respect of reviews of interim financial information and services 
where the work is integrated with the audit itself.

There were no other non-audit services provided during the year (2022: £nil). 

Further information on auditor’s remuneration and the assessment of the independence of the external auditor is set out in the Audit Committee 
report on pages 92-99.

1  Prior period comparatives have been restated on transition to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (see note A2.1 for further details).

The Group, as a proxy for policyholders in the UK, is required to pay taxes on investment income and gains each year. Accordingly, the tax credit 
or expense attributable to UK life assurance policyholder earnings is included in income tax expense. The tax charge attributable to policyholder 
earnings was £184 million (2022: £577 million credit).

The 2023 current tax prior year adjustment arises principally from the carry back of tax losses arising from adverse market movements in 2022. 
The carry back of losses reduces the tax charge relating to prior periods and is broadly offset by a reduction in tax losses carried forward to 
future periods, on which a deferred tax asset is recognised. This is partially offset by true-ups from the tax reporting provisions in various entities 
within the group.

The 2022 current tax prior year adjustment relates principally to a tax dispute with HMRC in relation to the tax treatment of an asset formerly held 
by Guardian Assurance Limited (before the business was transferred to ReAssure Limited) was resolved in the period in favour of the Group. The 
2021 current tax liability included an accrual for the total tax under dispute. The matter was heard before the First Tier Tribunal in May 2022 and 
the Court found in favour of ReAssure Limited. HMRC did not appeal against this decision and so the accrual for the potential tax liability 
was released.

Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in the statement of consolidated comprehensive income or the statement of consolidated changes in equity, in 
which case it is recognised in these statements.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
date of the statement of consolidated financial position together with adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.

The tax charge is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders’ returns and tax that is payable on owners’ returns. 
This allocation is calculated based on an assessment of the effective rate of tax that is applicable to owners for the year.

1  The Phoenix operating segments are predominantly in the UK. The reconciliation of tax charge has therefore, been completed by reference to the standard rate of UK tax. 

2  Relates principally to a profit arising on consolidation due to the purchase of the SLF of Canada UK Limited, not subject to deferred tax.

3  The 2023 prior year tax charge relates to true-ups from the tax reporting provisions in various entities within the group.

4  Profits taxed at rates other than 23.5% relates to overseas profits, consolidated fund investments and UK life company profits subject to marginal shareholder tax rates

5  Relates principally to increases in the recognised value of tax attributes in SLIDAC offset by a reduction in the future value of capital losses in ReAssure Limited. 

6  Deferred tax rate change relates primarily to movements in deferred tax liabilities which are expected to unwind at rates in excess of the current year rate of 23.5%.

7  Relates to losses accruing in Phoenix Life Assurance Europe DAC in relation to which a deferred tax asset cannot be recognised.

During the year, 1,185,942 shares (2022: 816,419) were issued at a premium of £6 million (2022: £4 million) in order to satisfy obligations to 
employees under the Group’s sharesave schemes (see note I1).

The balance in the merger reserve arose upon the issuance of equity shares in 2020 as part consideration for the acquisition of the entire share 
capital of ReAssure Group plc. The Group has applied the relief in section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 to present the difference between 
the consideration received and the nominal value of the shares issued of £1,819 million in a merger reserve as opposed to in share premium. 

D2. Shares held by the employee benefit trust

Where the Phoenix Group Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) acquires shares in the Company or obtains rights to purchase its shares, the 
consideration paid (including any attributable transaction costs, net of tax) is shown as a deduction from owners’ equity. Gains and losses on 
sales of shares held by the EBT are charged or credited to the own shares account in equity.

The EBT holds shares to satisfy awards granted to employees under the Group’s share-based payment schemes.

The number of shares held by the EBT at 31 December 2023 was 2,626,940 (2022: 2,092,022).

The Company provided the EBT with an interest-free non-recourse facility arrangement to enable it to purchase the shares. 

D3. Other Reserves

The other reserves comprise the owner-occupied property revaluation reserve and the cash flow hedging reserve.

Owner-occupied property revaluation reserve
This reserve comprises the revaluation surplus arising on revaluation of owner-occupied property. When a revaluation loss arises on a 
previously revalued asset it should be deducted first against the previous revaluation gain. Any excess impairment will then be recorded as an 
impairment expense in the consolidated income statement.

Cash flow hedging reserve
Where a cash flow hedging relationship exists, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify 
as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The 
gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, and is reported in net 
investment income.

Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods 
when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity at that time is recycled to profit or loss over the period the hedged item impacts profit or loss.

Further details of the Group’s hedge accounting policy are included in note E1.

In June 2021, the Group entered into four cross currency swaps which were designated as hedging instruments in order to effect cash flow 
hedges of the Group’s Euro and US Dollar denominated borrowings (see note E5). Hedge accounting has been adopted effective from the date 
of designation of the hedging relationship. The objective of the hedging relationships is to hedge the risk of variability in functional currency 
equivalent cash flows with the foreign currency denominated borrowings due to changes in forward rates. The hedge ratio (i.e. the relationship 
between the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item in terms of their relative weighting) is such that there is an 
exact match in the relative weightings of the hedged items and hedging instruments within each of the hedging relationships.

On 26 April 2018, Old PGH (the Group’s ultimate parent company up to December 2018) issued £500 million of Tier 1 Notes, the proceeds of which 
were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of the Standard Life Assurance businesses. The Tier 1 Notes bear interest on 
their principal amount at a fixed rate of 5.75% per annum up to the ‘First Call Date’ of 26 April 2028. Thereafter the fixed rate of interest will be reset 
on the First Call Date and on each fifth anniversary of this date by reference to a 5 year gilt yield plus a margin of 4.169%. Interest is payable on the 
Tier 1 Notes semi-annually in arrears on 26 October and 26 April. The coupon paid in the year was £29 million (2022: £29 million).

At the issue date, the Tier 1 Notes were unsecured and subordinated obligations of Old PGH. On 12 December 2018, the Company was 
substituted in place of Old PGH as issuer. 

The Tier 1 Notes have no fixed maturity date and interest is payable only at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company; accordingly the Tier 
1 Notes meet the definition of equity for financial reporting purposes and are disclosed as such in the consolidated financial statements. If an 
interest payment is not made, it is cancelled and it shall not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter.

The Tier 1 Notes may be redeemed at par on the First Call Date or on any interest payment date thereafter at the option of the Company and also 
in other limited circumstances. If such redemption occurs prior to the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date, such redemption must be funded out of 
the proceeds of a new issuance of, or exchanged into, Tier 1 Own Funds of the same or a higher quality than the Tier 1 Notes. In respect of any 
redemption or purchase of the Tier 1 Notes, such redemption or purchase is subject to the receipt of permission to do so from the PRA.

On 27 October 2020, the terms of the Tier 1 Notes were amended and the consequence of a trigger event, linked to the Solvency II capital 
position, was changed. Previously, the Tier 1 Notes were subject to a permanent write-down in value to zero. The amended terms require that the 
Tier 1 Notes would automatically be subject to conversion to ordinary shares of the Company at the conversion price of £1,000 per share, subject 
to adjustment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes and all accrued and unpaid interest would be cancelled. Following any 
such conversion there would be no reinstatement of any part of the principal amount of, or interest on, the Tier 1 Notes at any time.

D5. Non-controlling interests

The non-controlling interests of £549 million (2022: £532 million) reflects third party ownership of abrdn Private Equity Opportunities Trust plc 
(‘APEOT’) determined at the proportionate value of the third party interest in the underlying assets and liabilities. APEOT is a UK Investment Trust 
listed and traded on the London Stock Exchange. As at 31 December 2023, the Group held 53.6% (2022: 53.6%) of the issued share 
capital of APEOT. 

The Group’s interest in APEOT is held in the With-Profit and unit-linked funds of the Group’s life companies. Therefore, the shareholder exposure 
to the results of APEOT is limited to the impact of those results on the shareholder share of distributed profits of the relevant fund.

Financial assets
Financial assets are to be classified into one of the following measurement categories: Fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’), fair value 
through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) and amortised cost. Classification is made based on the objectives of the entity’s business 
model for managing its financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instruments.

Financial assets are measured at amortised cost where they have:

•  contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specified dates, that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 

amount outstanding; and

•  are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by holding to collect contractual cash flows.

These financial assets are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration paid for the acquisition of the financial asset. All 
transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are also included in the cost of the financial asset. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
these financial assets are carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.

Equities, debt securities, collective investment schemes, derivatives and certain loans and deposits and cash and cash equivalents are 
measured at FVTPL as they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Where derivative financial instruments are held to hedge the Group’s Euro and US Dollar borrowings, the effective portion of any gain or loss 
that arises on remeasurement to fair value is initially recognised in other comprehensive income and is recycled to profit or loss as the hedged 
item impacts the profit or loss. For such instruments, the timing of the recognition of any gain or loss that arises on remeasurement to fair value 
in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

The Group has treaties in place with third party insurance companies to provide reinsurance in respect of liabilities that are linked to the 
performance of funds maintained by those companies. The contracts in question do not transfer significant insurance risk and therefore are 
classified as financial instruments and are valued at fair value through profit and loss. These contracts are disclosed under Reinsurers’ share of 
investment contract liabilities in the statement of consolidated financial position.

Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses the expected credit losses associated with its loans and deposits, receivables, cash and cash equivalents and other 
financial assets carried at amortised cost. The measurement of credit impairment is based on an Expected Credit Loss (‘ ECL’) model and 
depends upon whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For those credit exposures for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures loss allowances at 
an amount equal to the total expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date 
(‘12-month ECL’). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the Group 
measures and recognises an allowance at an amount equal to the expected credit losses over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective 
of the timing of the default (‘Lifetime ECL’). If the financial asset becomes ‘credit-impaired’ (following significant financial difficulty of issuer/
borrower, or a default/breach of a covenant), the Group will recognise a Lifetime ECL. ECLs are derived from unbiased and probability-
weighted estimates of expected loss. 

The loss allowance reduces the carrying value of the financial asset and is reassessed at each reporting date. ECLs and subsequent 
remeasurements of the ECL, are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Fair value estimation
The fair values of financial instruments traded in active markets such as publicly traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market 
prices at the period end. The quoted market price used for financial assets is the applicable bid price on the period end date. The fair value of 
investments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques such as broker quotes, pricing models or 
discounted cash flow techniques. Where pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the period end. Where 
discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on contractual cash flows using current market conditions 
and market calibrated discount rates and interest rate assumptions for similar instruments.

For units in unit trusts and shares in open-ended investment companies, fair value is determined by reference to published bid values. The fair 
value of receivables and floating rate and overnight deposits with credit institutions is their carrying value. The fair value of fixed interest-
bearing deposits is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques.

Associates
Investments in associates that are held for investment purposes are accounted for under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments for the current period 
(2022: IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) as permitted by IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. 
These are measured at fair value through profit or loss. There are no investments in associates which are of a strategic nature. 

Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset (or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised where:

•  the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; 
•  the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the assets, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a 

third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or 

•  the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and has either transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset, or has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 

Financial liabilities
On initial recognition, financial liabilities are recognised when due and measured at the fair value of the consideration received less directly 
attributable transaction costs (with the exception of liabilities at FVTPL for which all transaction costs are expensed).

E1.1 Fair value analysis
The table below sets out a comparison of the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments as at 31 December 2023:

Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities (except for liabilities under investment contracts without DPF and other liabilities 
designated at FVTPL) are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 

Financial liabilities are designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL where doing so results in more meaningful information because either:

• 

it eliminates or significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising 
the gains and losses on them on different bases; or

•  a group of financial assets, financial liabilities or both is managed and its performance is evaluated and managed on a fair value basis, in 

accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the investments is provided internally on 
that basis to the Group’s key management personnel.

Investment contracts without DPF
Contracts under which the transfer of insurance risk to the Group from the policyholder is not significant are classified as investment contracts 
and accounted for as financial liabilities.

Receipts and payments on investment contracts without DPF are accounted for using deposit accounting, under which the amounts collected 
and paid out are recognised in the statement of consolidated financial position as an adjustment to the liability to the policyholder.

Investment contracts without DPF are measured at fair value which is determined using a valuation technique to provide a reliable estimate of 
the amount for which the liability could be transferred in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, subject 
to a minimum equal to the surrender value. The valuation of liabilities on unit-linked contracts are held at the fair value of the related assets and 
liabilities. The liability is the sum of the unit-linked liabilities plus an additional amount to cover the present value of the excess of future policy 
costs over future charges.

Movements in the fair value of investment contracts without DPF and reinsurers’ share of investment contract liabilities are included in Change 
in investment contract liabilities in the consolidated income statement. 

Investment contract policyholders are charged for policy administration services, investment management services, surrenders and other 
contract fees. These fees are recognised as revenue over the period in which the related services are performed. If the fees are for services 
provided in future periods, they are deferred and recognised over those periods. ‘Front end’ fees are charged on some non-participating 
investment contracts. Where the non-participating investment contract is measured at fair value, such fees which relate to the provision of 
future investment management services are deferred and recognised as the services are provided.

Net asset value attributable to unitholders
The net asset value attributable to unitholders represents the non-controlling interest in collective investment schemes which are consolidated 
by the Group. This interest is classified at FVTPL and measured at fair value, which is equal to the bid value of the number of units of the 
collective investment scheme not owned by the Group.

Obligations for repayment of collateral received
It is the Group’s practice to obtain collateral in stock lending and derivative transactions, usually in the form of cash or marketable securities. 
Where cash collateral received is available to the Group for investment purposes, it is recognised as a ‘financial asset’ and the collateral 
repayable is recognised as ‘obligations for repayment of collateral received’ in the statement of consolidated financial position. The 
‘obligations for repayment of collateral received’ are measured at amortised cost, which in the case of cash is equivalent to the fair value of the 
consideration received. Further details of the Group’s collateral arrangements are included in note E4.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.

Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position only when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. When financial assets and liabilities are offset any related interest income and expense is offset in the income statement. 

Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in order to effect cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge 
relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management 
objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, 
the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk. 

Where a cash flow hedging relationship exists, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify 
as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The 
gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in net investment income. 

Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods 
when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. 

Hedge accounting is discontinued if: the Group’s hedging objective has changed (can result in a partial discontinuance); the hedged item or 
hedging instrument no longer exists or is sold; there is no longer an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument; or the effect of credit risk starts to dominate the value changes that result from the economic relationship. Any gain or loss 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time is recycled to profit or loss over the period the hedged 
item impacts profit or loss.

E2.1 Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy of financial instruments

Level 1 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as exchange traded securities and derivatives) is based on quoted market 
prices at the period end provided by recognised pricing services. Market depth and bid-ask spreads are used to corroborate whether an 
active market exists for an instrument. Greater depth and narrower bid-ask spread indicate higher liquidity in the instrument and are classed as 
Level 1 inputs. For collective investment schemes and reinsurers’ share of investment contract liabilities, fair value is by reference to 
published bid prices.

Level 2 financial instruments
Financial instruments traded in active markets with less depth, or wider bid-ask spreads, which do not meet the classification as Level 1 inputs, 
are classified as Level 2. The fair values of financial instruments not traded in active markets are determined using broker quotes or valuation 
techniques with observable market inputs. Financial instruments valued using broker quotes are classified as Level 2, only where there is a 
sufficient range of available quotes. The fair value of over-the-counter derivatives is estimated using pricing models or discounted cash flow 
techniques. Collective investment schemes where the underlying assets are not priced using active market prices are determined to be Level 2 
instruments. Where pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the period end. Where discounted cash flows 
are used, estimated future cash flows are based on management’s best estimates and the discount rate used is a market related rate 
for a similar instrument. The fair value of investment contract liabilities reflects the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities in the funds 
plus an additional amount to cover the present value of the excess of future policy costs over future charges. The liabilities are consequently 
determined to be Level 2 instruments.

Level 3 financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments determined by valuation techniques using non-observable market inputs are based on a combination 
of independent third party evidence and internally developed models. In relation to investments in hedge funds and private equity 
investments, non-observable third party evidence in the form of net asset valuation statements is used as the basis for the valuation. 
Adjustments may be made to the net asset valuation where other evidence, for example recent sales of the underlying investments in the fund, 
indicates this is required. Securities that are valued using broker quotes which could not be corroborated across a sufficient range of quotes 
are considered as Level 3. For a small number of investment vehicles and debt securities, standard valuation models are used, as due to their 
nature and complexity they have no external market. Inputs into such models are based on observable market data where applicable. The fair 
value of loans, derivatives and some borrowings with no external market is determined by internally developed discounted cash flow models 
using appropriate assumptions corroborated with external market data where possible.

For financial instruments that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred 
between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole) during each reporting period.

Fair value hierarchy information for non-financial assets measured at fair value is included in note G3 for owner-occupied property and in note 
G4 for investment property.

reinsurers’ share of investment contract liabilities of £25 million.

4  Amounts classified as financial liabilities held for sale include derivative liabilities of £4 million and investment contract liabilities of £8,312 million.

E1.2 impairment of financial assets held at amortised cost
The adoption of IFRS 9 has changed the Group’s accounting for impairment losses for financial assets held at amortised cost by replacing 
IAS 39’s incurred loss approach with a forward-looking expected credit loss (‘ECL’) approach. The new impairment model applies to the Group’s 
financial assets carried at amortised cost.

A significant portion of the Group’s financial assets are carried at FVTPL under IFRS 9 and are therefore not subject to ECL assessment. The 
financial assets classified as amortised cost and subject to ECL mainly relate to certain loan assets, other receivables and certain cash and cash 
equivalents balances.

For the in-scope financial assets at the reporting date either the lifetime expected credit loss or a 12-month expected credit loss is provided for, 
depending on the Group’s assessment of whether the credit risk associated with the specific asset has increased significantly since initial 
recognition. The Group’s current credit risk grading framework comprises the following categories:

Category 

Description 

Basis for recognising ECL

Performing 

The counterparty has a low risk of default and does not have any past-due amounts

12 month ECL

Doubtful 

In default

Write-off 

There has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition

Lifetime ECL – not credit impaired

There is evidence indicating the asset is credit impaired

There is evidence indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty 
and the Group has no realistic prospect of recovery

Lifetime ECL – credit impaired

Amount is written off

The financial assets held at amortised cost are assessed at transition as ‘performing’ and this assessment is summarised below. 

Loans and deposits – the Group has assessed the estimated credit losses of these loans and deposits as low due to the external credit ratings of 
the counterparties resulting in low credit risk and there being no past-due amounts. 

Other receivables – these balances relate to investment broker balances and other regular receivables due to the Group in the normal course of 
business. Expected credit losses are assessed as being immaterial given the typically short-term nature of these balances.

Cash and cash equivalents – the Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions, which have investment grade 
credit ratings of ‘BBB’ or above. The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings 
of the counterparties and, there being no history of default. The impact to the net carrying amount stated in the table above is therefore not 
considered to be material.

Based on the above assessment, an immaterial credit loss balance has been determined due to these financial assets being predominantly 
short-term and having low credit risk.

1  Broker indicative prices: Although such valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not 

change the fair value significantly.

2  Net asset value statements: Net asset statements are provided by independent third parties, and therefore no significant non-observable input or sensitivity information has been prepared for those 

instruments valued on this basis.

3  Discounted cash flow (‘DCF’) model: Except where otherwise stated, the discount rate used is based on a risk-free curve and a credit spread. The risk-free rate is taken from an appropriate gilt of 

comparable duration. The spread is derived from a basket of comparable securities.

4  ERM loans: The loans are valued using a DCF model and a Black-Scholes model for valuation of the No-Negative Equity Guarantee (‘NNEG’). The NNEG caps the loan repayment in the event of death or 
entry into long-term care to be no greater than the sales proceeds from the property. The future cash flows are estimated based on assumed levels of mortality derived from published mortality tables, 
entry into long-term care rates and voluntary redemption rates. Cash flows include an allowance for the expected cost of providing a NNEG assessed under a real world approach using a closed form 
model including an assumed level of property value volatility. For the NNEG assessment, property values are indexed from the latest property valuation point and then assumed to grow in line with an RPI 
based assumption. Cash flows are discounted using a risk free curve plus a spread, where the spread is based on recent originations, with margins to allow for the different risk profiles of ERM loans.

5 

Income strips are transactions where an owner-occupier of a property has sold a freehold or long leasehold interest to the Group, and has signed a long lease (typically 30-45 years) or a ground lease 
(typically 45-175 years) and retains the right to repurchase the property at the end of the lease for a nominal sum (usually £1). The income strips are valued using an income capitalisation approach, 
where the annual rental income is capitalised using an appropriate yield. The yield is determined by considering recent transactions involving similar income strips.

6 

IFL92C15 and IML92C15 relate to immediate annuitant female and male lives and refer to the 92 series mortality tables produced by the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI).

7  Derivative liabilities include forward investments of £54 million (2022: £146 million) which include a commitment to acquire or provide funding for fixed rate debt instruments at specified future dates.

8 

9 

Included within derivative assets and liabilities are longevity swap contracts with corporate pension schemes with a fair value of £230 million (2022: £152 million) and £100 million (2022: £34 million) respectively.

Included within derivative liabilities is the Equity Release Income Plan (‘ERIP’) total return swap with a value of £50 million (2022: £63 million), under which a share of the disposal proceeds arising on a 
portfolio of property reversions is payable to a third party (see note E.3.3 for further details).

E2.4 Sensitivities of Level 3 instruments continued
For the property reversions loans and bridging loans to private equity funds, there are no reasonably possible movements in unobservable input 
values which would result in a significant movement in the fair value of the financial instruments.

For those assets valued using net asset value statements (equities and collective investment schemes) no sensitivity information has been 
prepared as the net asset statements are provided by independent third parties.

Consistent with the prior year, all the Group’s Level 1 and Level 2 assets have been valued using standard market pricing sources. 

The application of the Group’s fair value hierarchy classification methodology at an individual security level, in particular observations with 
regard to measures of market depth and bid-ask spreads, resulted in an overall net movement of debt securities from Level 1 to Level 2 in both the 
current and prior period.

Gains and losses on Level 3 financial instruments are included in net investment income in the consolidated income statement. There were no 
gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income in either the current or comparative period.

E3. Derivatives

The Group purchases derivative financial instruments principally in connection with the management of its insurance contract and investment 
contract liabilities based on the principles of reduction of risk and efficient portfolio management. The Group does not typically hold 
derivatives for the purpose of selling and repurchasing in the near term or with the objective of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations 
in price or margin. The Group also holds derivatives which are designated as hedging instruments in order to hedge the Group’s Euro and US 
Dollar borrowings. These hedging relationships qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 and are designated as cash flow hedges.

Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to fair value. The gain or loss on 
remeasurement to fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement where the derivatives are held for trading. Where derivative 
financial instruments are held to hedge the Group’s Euro and US Dollar borrowings, the effective portion of any gain or loss that arises on 
remeasurement to fair value is initially recognised in other comprehensive income and is recycled to profit or loss as the hedged item impacts 
the profit or loss. See notes E1 and D3 for further details of the Group’s hedging accounting policy.

E3.2 Longevity swap contracts
The Group has in place longevity swap arrangements with corporate pension schemes which do not meet the definition of insurance contracts 
under the Group’s accounting policies. Under these arrangements the majority of the longevity risk has been passed to third parties. Derivative 
assets of £230 million and derivative liabilities of £100 million have been recognised as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £152 million and £34 million 
respectively).

E3.3 Equity Release Income Plan (‘ERIP’) total return swap
ERIP contracts are an equity release product under which the Group holds a reversionary interest in the residential property of policyholders 
who have been provided with a lifetime annuity in return for the legal title to their property (see note G4). The Group is party to an ERIP total 
return swap under which a share of the future generated cash flows arising under the ERIP contracts is payable to a third party. Over time, as the 
property reversions are realised, the relevant share of disposal proceeds is transferred to a third party who also holds a beneficial interest in 
these residential properties. The carrying amount of the derivative liability is the present value of all future cash flows due to the third party under 
the total return swap.

E4. Collateral arrangements

The Group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or non-cash assets in respect of stock lending transactions, derivative contracts 
and reinsurance arrangements in order to reduce the credit risk of these transactions. The amount and type of collateral required where the 
Group receives collateral depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty, but is usually in the form of cash and 
marketable securities.

Collateral received in the form of cash, where the Group has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated and is available to the 
Group for investment purposes, is recognised as a financial asset in the statement of consolidated financial position with a corresponding 
financial liability for its repayment. Non-cash collateral received is not recognised in the statement of consolidated financial position, unless 
the counterparty defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.

Non-cash collateral pledged where the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated is not derecognised from the 
statement of consolidated financial position, unless the Group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement. Cash collateral 
pledged, where the counterparty has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, is derecognised from the statement of 
consolidated financial position and a corresponding receivable is recognised for its return.

The Group is also party to reverse repurchase agreements under which securities are purchased from third parties with an obligation to resell 
the securities. The securities are not recognised as financial assets on the statement of consolidated financial position, unless the counterparty 
defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement. The right to receive the return of any cash paid as purchase consideration plus 
interest is recognised as a financial asset on the statement of financial position.

E4.1 Financial instrument collateral arrangements
The Group has no financial assets and financial liabilities that have been offset in the statement of consolidated financial position as at 
31 December 2023 (2022: none).

The table below contains disclosures related to financial assets and financial liabilities recognised in the statement of consolidated financial 
position that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements. Such agreements do not meet the criteria 
for offsetting in the statement of consolidated financial position as the Group has no current legally enforceable right to offset recognised 
financial instruments. Furthermore, certain related assets received as collateral under the netting arrangements will not be recognised in 
the statement of consolidated financial position as the Group does not have permission to sell or re-pledge, except in the case of default. Details 
of the Group’s collateral arrangements in respect of these recognised assets and liabilities are provided below.

E4.2 Derivative collateral arrangements
Assets accepted
It is the Group’s practice to obtain collateral to mitigate the counterparty risk related to over-the-counter (‘OTC’) derivatives usually in the form of 
cash or marketable financial instruments.

The fair value of financial assets accepted as collateral for OTC derivatives but not recognised in the statement of consolidated financial position 
amounts to £505 million (2022: £471 million). 

The amounts recognised as financial assets and liabilities from cash collateral received at 31 December 2023 are set out below.

The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of OTC derivative assets is £2,629 million (2022: £3,747 million) of which credit risk of 
£2,434 million (2022: £3,348 million) is mitigated by use of collateral arrangements (which are settled net after taking account of any OTC 
derivative liabilities owed to the counterparty).

Credit risk on exchange traded derivative assets of £137 million (2022: £324 million) is mitigated through regular margining and the protection 
offered by the exchange.

Assets pledged 
The Group pledges collateral in respect of its OTC derivative liabilities. The value of assets pledged at 31 December 2023 in respect of OTC 
derivative liabilities of £3,126 million (2022: £5,606 million) amounted to £1,936 million (2022: £3,228 million).

E4.3 Stock lending collateral arrangements
The Group lends listed financial assets held in its investment portfolio to other institutions. 

The Group conducts stock lending only with well-established, reputable institutions in accordance with established market conventions. The 
financial assets do not qualify for derecognition as the Group retains all the risks and rewards of the transferred assets except for the voting rights. 

It is the Group’s practice to obtain collateral in stock lending transactions, usually in the form of cash or marketable financial instruments.

The fair value of financial assets accepted as such collateral but not recognised in the statement of consolidated financial position amounts to 
£897 million (2022: £1,586 million).

The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of stock lending transactions is £836 million (2022: £1,451 million) of which credit risk 
of £833 million (2022: £1,451 million) is mitigated through the use of collateral arrangements.

 E4.4 Other collateral arrangements 
At 31 December 2023, the Group had entered into reverse repurchase transactions under which it purchased securities and had taken on the 
obligation to resell the securities. The fair value of the financial assets accepted as collateral in respect of these transactions, but not recognised 
in the statement of consolidated financial position, is £100 million (2022: £nil).

The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of reverse repurchase transactions is £100 million (2022: £ nil) of which credit risk of £100 million 
(2022: £ nil) is mitigated through the use of collateral arrangements.

Details of collateral received to mitigate the counterparty risk arising from the Group’s reinsurance transactions is given in note F10.

Collateral has also been pledged and charges have been granted in respect of certain Group borrowings. The details of these arrangements 
are set out in note E5.

E5. Borrowings

The Group classifies the majority of its interest-bearing borrowings as financial liabilities carried at amortised cost and these are recognised 
initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. The difference between initial cost and the redemption value is amortised 
through the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest method.

Certain borrowings are designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value where doing so 
provides more meaningful information due to the reasons stated in the financial liabilities accounting policy (see note E1). Transaction costs 
relating to borrowings designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are expensed as incurred. 

Borrowings are classified as either policyholder or shareholder borrowings. Policyholder borrowings are those borrowings where there is 
either no or limited shareholder exposure, for example, borrowings attributable to the Group’s with-profit operations.

abrdn Private Equity Opportunities Trust plc (’APEOT’) has in place a syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility, of which £90 million 
(2022: £62 million) had been drawn down as at 31 December 2023. During 2022 the amount of the facility was increased from £200 million 
to £300 million and its term maturity was extended to December 2025. Interest accrues on this facility at a margin over the reference rate of 
the currency drawn. 

b  The Property Reversions loan from Santander UK plc (‘Santander’) was recognised in the consolidated financial statements at fair value. It 
relates to the sale of Extra-Income Plan policies that Santander finances to the value of the associated property reversions. As part of the 
arrangement Santander receives an amount calculated by reference to the movement in the Halifax House Price Index and the Group is 
required to indemnify Santander against profits or losses arising from mortality or surrender experience which differs from the basis used to 
calculate the reversion amount. During 2023, repayments totalling £21 million were made (2022: £15 million). Note G4 contains details of the 
assets that support this loan. 

c  On 23 January 2015, PGH Capital plc (‘PGHC’) issued £428 million of subordinated notes due 2025 at a coupon of 6.625%. Fees 

associated with these notes of £3 million were deferred and are being amortised over the life of the notes in the statement of consolidated 
financial position. Upon exchange £32 million of these notes were held by Group companies. During 2017, the internal holdings were sold to 
third parties, thereby increasing external borrowings by £32 million. On 20 March 2017, Old PGH (the Group’s ultimate parent company up 
to December 2018) was substituted in place of PGHC as issuer of the £428 million subordinated notes and then on 12 December 2018 the 
Company was substituted in place of Old PGH as issuer. On 7 December 2023, the Company repurchased £231 million of the principal 
amount of the notes via a tender offer. The remaining principal amount of the notes at 31 December 2023 is £197 million.

d  On 6 July 2017, Old PGH issued US $500 million Tier 2 bonds due 2027 with a coupon of 5.375%. Fees associated with these notes of 

£2 million were deferred and are being amortised over the life of the notes. On 12 December 2018 the Company was substituted in place of 
Old PGH as issuer. 

e  On 24 September 2018, Old PGH issued €500 million Tier 2 notes due 2029 with a coupon of 4.375%. Fees associated with these notes of 
£7 million were deferred and are being amortised over the life of the notes. On 12 December 2018 the Company was substituted in place of 
Old PGH as issuer.

E5.1 Analysis of borrowings continued
f  On 29 January 2020, the Company issued US $750 million fixed rate reset perpetual restricted Tier 1 contingent convertible notes (the 

‘Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes’) which are unsecured and subordinated. The Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes have no fixed 
maturity date and interest is payable only at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company. The Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes bear 
interest on their principal amount at a fixed rate of 5.625% per annum up to the ‘First Reset Date’ of 26 April 2025. Thereafter the fixed rate 
of interest will be reset on the First Reset Date and on each fifth anniversary of this date by reference to the sum of the yield of the Constant 
Maturity Treasury (‘CMT’) rate (based on the prevailing five-year US Treasury yield) plus a margin of 4.035%, being the initial credit spread 
used in pricing the notes. Interest is payable on the Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes semi-annually in arrears on 26 April and 26 October. 
If an interest payment is not made it is cancelled and it shall not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter.

The terms of the Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes contain a contingent settlement provision which is linked to the occurrence of a 
‘Capital Disqualification Event’. Such an event is deemed to have taken place where, as a result of a change to the Solvency II regulations, the 
Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes are fully excluded from counting as own funds. On the occurrence of such an event and where the 
Company has chosen not to use its corresponding right to redeem the notes the Company shall no longer be able to exercise its discretion to 
cancel any interest payments due on such Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes on any interest payment date following the occurrence of 
this event. Accordingly the Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes are considered to meet the definition of a financial liability for financial 
reporting purposes.

The Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes may be redeemed at par on the First Reset Date or on any interest payment date thereafter at the 
option of the Company and also in other limited circumstances. If such redemption occurs prior to the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date such 
redemption must be funded out of the proceeds of a new issuance of, or exchanged into, Tier 1 Own Funds of the same or a higher quality 
than the Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes. In respect of any redemption or purchase of the Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes, such 
redemption or purchase is subject to the receipt of permission to do so from the PRA. Furthermore, on occurrence of a trigger event, linked 
to the Solvency II capital position and as documented in the terms of the Contingent Convertible Tier 1 Notes, the Contingent Convertible 
Tier 1 Notes will automatically be subject to conversion to ordinary shares of the Company at the conversion price of US $1,000 per share, 
subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes and all accrued and unpaid interest will be cancelled. 
Following such conversion there shall be no reinstatement of any part of the principal amount of, or interest on, the Contingent Convertible 
Tier 1 Notes at any time.

g  On 28 April 2020, the Company issued £500 million fixed rate Tier 2 Notes (the ‘Tier 2 Notes’) which are unsecured and subordinated. The 
Tier 2 Notes have a maturity date of 28 April 2031 and include an issuer par call right for the three-month period prior to maturity. The Tier 2 
Notes bear interest on the principal amount at a fixed rate of 5.625% per annum payable annually in arrears on 28 April each year.

h  On 4 June 2020, the Company issued US $500 million fixed rate reset callable Tier 2 notes (the ‘Fixed Rate Reset Tier 2 Notes’) which are 
unsecured and subordinated. The Fixed Rate Reset Tier 2 notes have a maturity date of 4 September 2031 with an optional issuer par call 
right on any day in the three-month period up to and including 4 September 2026. The Fixed Rate Reset Tier 2 Notes bear interest on the 
principal amount at a fixed rate of 4.75% per annum up to the interest rate reset date of 4 September 2026. If the Fixed Rate Reset Tier 2 
Notes are not redeemed before that date, the interest rate resets to the sum of the applicable CMT rate (based on the prevailing five-year US 
Treasury yield) plus a margin of 4.276%, being the initial credit spread used in pricing the notes. Interest is payable on the Fixed Rate Reset 
Tier 2 Notes semi-annually in arrears on 4 March and 4 September each year. On 7 December 2023, the Company repurchased US 
$150 million of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Reset Tier 2 Notes via a tender offer. The remaining principal amount of the notes at 
31 December 2023 is US $350 million.

i  On 22 July 2020, as part of the acquisition of ReAssure Group plc, the Group assumed the £500 million 5.867% Tier 2 subordinated notes. 
On the same date, the Company was substituted in place of ReAssure Group plc as issuer of the notes. The £500 million 5.867% Tier 2 
subordinated notes have a maturity date of 13 June 2029 and were initially recognised at their fair value as at the date of acquisition of 
£559 million. The fair value adjustment is being amortised over the remaining life of the notes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on 
13 June and 13 December.

j  On 22 July 2020, as part of the acquisition of ReAssure Group plc, the Group assumed the £250 million fixed rate reset callable Tier 2 

subordinated notes. On the same date, the Company was substituted in place of ReAssure Group plc as issuer of the notes. The £250 million 
fixed rate reset callable Tier 2 subordinated notes have a maturity date of 13 June 2029 and were initially recognised at their fair value as at 
the date of acquisition of £275 million. The fair value adjustment is being amortised over the remaining life of the notes. The notes include an 
issuer par call right exercisable on 13 June 2024. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on 13 June and 13 December. These notes 
initially bear interest at a rate of 5.766% on the principal amount and the rate of interest will reset on 13 June 2024, and on each interest 
payment date thereafter, to a margin of 5.17% plus the yield of a UK Treasury Bill of similar term.

k  On 22 July 2020, as part of the acquisition of ReAssure Group plc, the Group assumed the £250 million 4.016% Tier 3 subordinated notes. 
On the same date, the Company was substituted in place of ReAssure Group plc as issuer of the notes. The £250 million 4.016% Tier 3 
subordinated notes have a maturity date of 13 June 2026 and were initially recognised at their fair value as at the date of acquisition of 
£259 million. The fair value adjustment is being amortised over the remaining life of the notes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on 
13 June and 13 December.

l  On 6 December 2023, the Company issued £350 million fixed rate reset callable Tier 2 notes which are unsecured and subordinated. The 
notes have a maturity date of 6 December 2053 with an optional issuer par call right on any day in the six-month period up to and including 
6 December 2033. The notes bear interest on the principal amount at a fixed rate of 7.75% per annum up to the interest rate reset date of 
6 December 2033. If the notes are not redeemed before that date, the interest rate resets to the sum of the 5 year benchmark Gilt rate plus a 
margin of 4.65%, being the sum of the initial credit spread used in pricing the notes and a 1% margin step-up. Interest is payable on the notes 
semi-annually in arrears on 6 June and 6 December each year.

m  The Group has in place a £1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the ‘revolving facility’), maturing in June 2026. The facility accrues 

interest at a margin over SONIA that is based on credit rating. The facility remains undrawn as at 31 December 2023.

E5.2 Reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities

FinancialsFinancialsNotes to the consolidated financial statements continuedE. Financial assets & liabilities continued
E6. Risk management – financial and other risks
This note forms one part of the risk management disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An overview of the Group’s approach to 
risk management is outlined in note I3 and the Group’s management of insurance risk is detailed in note F11.

E6.1 Financial risk and the Asset Liability Management (‘ALM’) framework
The use of financial instruments naturally exposes the Group to the risks associated with them, chiefly market risk, credit risk and financial 
soundness risk. 

Responsibility for agreeing the financial risk profile rests with the Board of each Life Company, as advised by investment managers, internal 
committees and the actuarial function. In setting the risk profile, the Board of each Life Company will receive advice from the Chief Investment 
Officer, the relevant With-profit Actuary and the relevant actuarial function holder/Chief Actuary as to the potential implications of that risk 
profile with regard to the probability of both realistic insolvency and of failing to meet the regulatory Minimum Capital Requirement. The Chief 
Actuary will also advise the extent to which the investment risk taken is consistent with the Group’s commitment to help customers secure a life of 
possibilities, including meeting the FCA’s expectations under the New Consumer Duty.

Derivatives are used in many of the Group’s funds, within policy guidelines agreed by the Board of each Life Company and overseen by 
investment committees of the Boards of each Life Company supported by management oversight committees. Derivatives are primarily used for 
risk hedging purposes or for efficient portfolio management, including the activities of the Group’s Treasury function.

More detail on the Group’s exposure to financial risk is provided in note E6.2 below.

The Group is also exposed to insurance risk arising from its Life, Pensions and Savings business. Life insurance risk in the Group arises through its 
exposure to longevity, persistency, mortality and to other variances between assumed and actual experience. These variances can be in factors 
such as administrative expenses and new business pricing. More detail on the Group’s exposure to insurance risk is provided in note F11.

The Group’s overall exposure to market and credit risk is monitored by appropriate committees, which agree policies for managing each type of 
risk on an ongoing basis, in line with the investment strategy developed to achieve investment returns in excess of amounts due in respect of 
insurance contracts. The effectiveness of the Group’s ALM framework relies on the matching of assets and liabilities arising from insurance and 
investment contracts, taking into account the types of benefits payable to policyholders under each type of contract. Separate portfolios of 
assets are maintained for with-profit business funds (which include all of the Group’s participating business), non-linked non-profit funds and 
unit-linked funds.

E6.2 Financial risk analysis
Transactions in financial instruments result in the Group assuming financial risks. These include credit risk, market risk and financial soundness 
risk. Each of these are described below, together with a summary of how the Group manages the risk, along with sensitivity analysis where 
appropriate. The sensitivity analysis does not take into account the impact on the Group’s pension schemes, including any impact arising as a 
result of the elimination of intra-group buy-in transactions between the life companies and the Group’s pension schemes. It also does not include 
second order impacts of market movements, for example, where a market movement may give rise to potential indicators of impairment for the 
Group’s intangible balances.

Climate risk
The Group is exposed to financial risks (in particular market and credit risk) related to the transition to a low carbon economy, and the physical 
impacts resulting from climate change which could result in long-term market, credit, insurance, reputation, proposition and operational 
implications. As such, this risk is treated as a component of the cross-cutting Sustainability risk in the Group’s Risk Universe. 

Identification of climate related risks has been embedded into the Group’s Risk Management Framework. Significant progress has been made in 
recent years in developing risk metrics and establishing appropriate governance and risk management processes. The Group has adopted a 
proactive approach towards combatting climate change, with key net zero targets. Further details on these targets and on managing the related 
climate change risks are provided in the Climate Report and Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’).

E6.2.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as the risk of reductions in earnings and/or value, through financial or reputational loss, as a result of the default of a 
counterparty or an associate of such a counterparty to a financial transaction (i.e. failure to honour their financial obligations, or failing to perform 
them in a timely manner), whether on or off balance sheet.

There are two principal sources of credit risk for the Group:

•  credit risk which results from direct investment activities, including investments in debt securities, derivatives counterparties, collective 

investment schemes, hedge funds and the placing of cash deposits; and

•  credit risk which results indirectly from activities undertaken in the normal course of business. Such activities include premium payments, 

outsourcing contracts, reinsurance agreements, exposure from material suppliers and the lending of securities.

The amount disclosed in the statement of consolidated financial position in respect of all financial assets, together with rights secured under off 
balance sheet collateral arrangements, but excluding the minority interest in consolidated collective investment schemes and those assets that 
back policyholder liabilities, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. The credit risk borne by the shareholder on with-profit 
policies is dependent on the extent to which the underlying insurance fund is relying on shareholder support.

The impact of non-government debt securities and, inter alia, the change in market credit spreads during the year is fully reflected in the values 
shown in these consolidated financial statements. Credit spreads are the excess of corporate bond yields over gilt yields to reflect the higher 
level of risk. Similarly, the value of derivatives that the Group holds takes into account fully the changes in swap rates. 

There is an exposure to spread changes affecting the prices of corporate bonds and derivatives. This exposure applies to supported with-profit 
funds (where risks and rewards fall wholly to shareholders), non-profit funds and shareholders’ funds.

The Group holds £18,479 million (2022: £15,977 million) of corporate bonds which are used to back annuity liabilities in non-profit funds. 
These annuity liabilities include an aggregate credit default provision of £388 million (2022: £305 million) to fund against the risk of default.

A 100bps widening of credit spreads, with all other variables held constant and no change in assumed expected defaults, would result in a 
decrease in the profit after tax in respect of a full financial year, and in equity, of £357 million (2022: £480 million), and a decrease in CSM of 
£5 million (2022: £6 million).

A 100bps narrowing of credit spreads, with all other variables held constant and no change in assumed expected defaults, would result in an 
increase in the profit after tax in respect of a full financial year, and in equity, of £485 million (2022: £626 million), and an increase in CSM of 
£6 million (2022: £10 million).

Credit risk is managed by the monitoring of aggregate Group exposures to individual counterparties and by appropriate credit risk 
diversification. The Group manages the level of credit risk it accepts through credit risk tolerances and limits (including asset class, industry and 
geography limits). Additional controls for illiquid asset concentration risk are set out via specific risk limits within the risk appetite framework. 
Credit risk on derivatives and securities lending is mitigated through the use of collateral with appropriate haircuts. 

Credit quality of assets
An indication of the Group’s exposure to credit risk is the quality of the investments and counterparties with which it transacts. The following 
table provides information regarding the aggregate credit exposure split by credit rating.

 For financial assets that do not have credit ratings assigned by external ratings agencies, the Group assigns internal ratings for use in management and monitoring of credit risk. £169 million of AAA, 
£1,435 million of AA, £2,470 million of A, £1,819 million of BBB and £247 million of BB and below debt securities are internally rated. If a financial asset is neither rated by an external agency nor 
internally rated, it is classified as ‘non-rated’.

2  Non-rated debt securities includes equity release mortgages with a value of £4,486 million (further details are set out in note E2.3) and non-rated bonds.

2  For financial assets that do not have credit ratings assigned by external ratings agencies, the Group assigns internal ratings for use in management and monitoring of credit risk. £149 million of AAA, 
£1,083 million of AA, £1,742 million of A, £2,766 million of BBB and £367 million of BB and below debt securities are internally rated. If a financial asset is neither rated by an external agency nor 
internally rated, it is classified as ‘non-rated’.

3  Non-rated debt securities includes equity release mortgages with a value of £3,934 million (further details are set out in note E2.3) and non-rated bonds.

Credit ratings have not been disclosed in the above tables for the assets of the unit-linked funds since the shareholder is not directly exposed to 
credit risks from these assets. Included in unit-linked funds are assets which are held as reinsured external fund links. Under certain 
circumstances, the shareholder may be exposed to losses relating to the default of the reinsured external fund link. 

Credit ratings have not been disclosed in the above tables for holdings in unconsolidated collective investment schemes and investments in 
associates. The credit quality of the underlying debt securities within these vehicles is managed by the safeguards built into the investment 
mandates for these vehicles.

The Group maintains accurate and consistent risk ratings across its asset portfolio. This enables management to focus on the applicable risks and 
to compare credit exposures across all lines of business, geographical regions and products. The rating system is supported by a variety of 
financial analytics combined with market information to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk. All risk ratings are 
tailored to the various categories of assets and are assessed and updated regularly.

FinancialsFinancialsNotes to the consolidated financial statements continuedE. Financial assets & liabilities continued
E6.2.1 Credit risk continued
Credit quality of assets continued
The Group operates an Asset Management Risk Committee, a Rating Committee and a Portfolio Credit Committee to monitor and perform 
oversight of internal credit ratings for externally rated and internally rated assets. A variety of methods are used to validate the appropriateness 
of credit assessments from external institutions and fund managers. Internally rated assets do not have a public rating from an external credit 
assessment institution or from external asset managers. Instead internal credit ratings are used by the Group which are provided by fund 
managers or for certain assets (in particular, equity release mortgages and illiquid assets) are determined by the Life Companies. The 
Committees review the policies, processes and practices to ensure the appropriateness of the internal ratings, and to ensure they are in line with 
regulatory requirements.

Throughout 2023, the Group has taken de-risking action to increase the overall credit quality of its asset portfolio and mitigate the impact of 
future downgrades on risk capital. Further details are included in the Risk Management section of the Strategic Report.

The Group has increased exposure to an array of illiquid credit assets such as equity release mortgages, local authority loans, social housing, 
infrastructure and commercial real estate loans with the aim of achieving greater diversification and investment returns, consistent with the 
Strategic Asset Allocation approved by the Board.

A further indicator of the quality of the Group’s financial assets is the extent to which they are neither past due nor impaired. All of the amounts in 
the table above for the current and prior year are neither past due nor impaired.

Additional life company asset disclosures are included on page 306 and include information on the Group’s market exposure analysed by credit 
rating, sector and country of exposure for the shareholder debt portfolio.

Credit risk of financial liabilities designated at FVTPL
The fair value of investment contracts and net asset value attributable to unitholders liabilities are determined based upon the performance of 
the assets backing those liabilities. This has the effect that the fair value of the liability primarily reflects asset-specific performance risk rather 
than credit risk. As a result, the value of credit risk associated with financial liabilities designated at FVTPL is not considered to be significant.

Concentration of credit risk
Concentration of credit risk might exist where the Group has significant exposure to an individual counterparty or a group of counterparties with 
similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic 
and other conditions. The Group has most of its counterparty risk within its life business and is monitored by the Group Counterparty Credit Risk 
Framework contained within the Group Credit Risk Policy. It is further provided for in investment management agreements, overlaid by 
regulatory requirements and the monitoring of aggregate counterparty exposures across the Group against additional Group counterparty 
limits. Counterparty risk in respect of OTC derivative counterparties is monitored using a Potential Future Exposure (‘PFE’) value metric.

The Group is also exposed to concentration risk with outsource partners. The Group operates a policy to manage outsourcer service counterparty 
exposures and the impact from default is reviewed regularly by executive committees and measured through stress and scenario testing.

Reinsurance
The Group is exposed to credit risk as a result of insurance risk transfer contracts with reinsurers. The Group’s policy is to place reinsurance only 
with highly rated counterparties (minimum rating requirement of A-). The Group restricts concentration with individual external reinsurers by 
specifying limits on ceding and minimum conditions for acceptance and retention of reinsurers. In recent years the Group has made progress in 
increasing the number of reinsurers it transacts with, however, an element of concentration remains due to the nature of the reinsurance market 
and the restricted range of reinsurers available. The Group manages its exposure to reinsurance credit risk through the operation of a credit 
policy, collateralisation, and regular monitoring of exposures at the Reinsurance Management Committee and other credit focused committees.

Collateral
The credit risk of the Group is mitigated, in certain circumstances, by entering into collateral agreements. The amount and type of collateral 
required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty. Guidelines are implemented regarding the acceptability of types of 
collateral and the valuation parameters. Collateral is mainly obtained in respect of stock lending, certain reinsurance arrangements and to 
provide security against the daily mark to model value of derivative financial instruments. Management monitors the market value of the collateral 
received, requests additional collateral when needed, and performs an impairment valuation when impairment indicators exist and the asset is 
not fully secured and is not carried at fair value. See note E4 for further information on collateral arrangements.

E6.2.2 Market risk
Market risk is defined as the risk of reductions in earnings and/or value, through financial or reputational loss, from unfavourable market 
movements. The risk typically arises from exposure to equity, property and fixed income asset classes and the impact of changes in interest rates, 
inflation rates and currency exchange rates.

The Group is mainly exposed to market risk as a result of:

•  the mismatch between liability profiles and the related asset investment portfolios;
•  the investment of surplus assets including shareholder reserves yet to be distributed, surplus assets within the with-profit funds and assets held 

to meet regulatory capital and solvency requirements; and

•  the income flow of management charges derived from the value of invested assets of the business.

The Group manages the levels of market risk that it accepts through the operation of a market risk policy using a number of controls and 
techniques including:

•  defined lists of permitted securities and/or application of investment constraints and portfolio limits;
•  clearly defined investment benchmarks for policyholder and shareholder funds;
•  stochastic and deterministic asset/liability modelling;
•  active use of derivatives to improve the matching characteristics of assets and liabilities and to reduce the risk exposure of a portfolio; and
•  setting risk limits for main market risks and managing exposures against these appetites.

All operations comply with regulatory requirements relating to the taking of market risk.

Assets in the shareholder funds are managed against benchmarks that ensure they are diversified across a range of asset classes, instruments 
and geographies that are appropriate to the liabilities of the funds or are held to match the cash flows anticipated to arise in the business. A 
combination of limits by name of issuer, sector, geographical region and credit rating are used where relevant to reduce concentration risk 
among the assets held.

The assets of the participating business are principally managed to support the liabilities of the participating business and are appropriately 
diversified by both asset class and geography, considering:

•  the economic liability and how this varies with market conditions;
•  the need to invest assets supporting participating business in a manner consistent with the participating policyholders’ reasonable 

expectations and Principles and Practices of Financial Management (‘PPFM’); and

•  the need to ensure that regulatory and capital requirements are met.

In practice, an element of market risk arises as a consequence of the need to balance these considerations, for example, in certain instances 
participating policyholders may expect that equity market risk will be taken on their behalf, and derivative instruments may be used to 
manage these risks.

Markets remain volatile particularly given geopolitical tensions, heightened inflation, and action by central banks to reduce inflationary pressures 
on economies whilst balancing the need to aid post-pandemic recovery. This is noted in the Strategic Report principal risk section.

Interest rate and inflation risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate relative to the respective liability due to the 
impact of changes in market interest rates on the value of interest-bearing assets and on the value of future guarantees provided under certain 
contracts of insurance. The paragraphs in this section also apply to inflation risk, but references to fixed rate assets and liabilities would be 
replaced with index-linked assets and liabilities.

The Group is required to manage its interest rate exposures in line with qualitative risk appetite statements, quantitative risk metrics and any 
additional hedging benchmarks. Interest rate risk is managed by matching assets and liabilities where practicable and by entering into derivative 
arrangements for hedging purposes where appropriate. This is particularly the case for the non-participating funds and supported participating 
funds. For unsupported participating business, some element of investment mismatching is permitted where it is consistent with the principles of 
treating customers fairly. The with-profit funds of the Group provide capital to allow such mismatching to be effected. In practice, the life 
companies of the Group maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate instruments according to the underlying insurance or investment 
contracts and will review this at regular intervals to ensure that overall exposure is kept within the risk profile agreed for each particular fund. This 
also requires the maturity profile of these assets to be managed in line with the liabilities to policyholders.

The sensitivity analysis for interest rate and inflation risk indicates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument 
arising from changes in market interest and inflation rates at the reporting date result in a change in profit after tax, equity and CSM. It takes into 
account the effect of such changes in market interest and inflation rates on all assets and liabilities that contribute to the Group’s reported profit 
after tax and in equity. Changes in the value of the Group’s holdings in swaptions as a result of time decay or changes to interest rate volatility are 
not captured in the sensitivity analysis. 

With-profit business and non-participating business within the with-profit funds are exposed to interest rate risk as guaranteed liabilities are 
valued relative to market interest rates and investments include fixed interest securities and derivatives. For unsupported with-profit business the 
profit or loss arising from mismatches between such assets and liabilities is largely offset by increased or reduced discretionary policyholder 
benefits dependent on the existence of policyholder guarantees. The contribution of unsupported participating business to the Group result is 
largely limited to the shareholders’ share of bonuses. The contribution of the supported participating business to the Group result is determined 
in line with IFRS 17, which exposes the shareholder to changes in the value of the liabilities backed by shareholder assets and the value of capital 
advanced to the with-profit funds. 

In the non-participating funds, policy liabilities’ sensitivity to interest rates are matched primarily with debt securities and hedging if necessary to 
match duration on a regulatory basis for the Group’s Solvency II position, with the result that sensitivity to changes in interest rates is very low. The 
Group’s exposure to interest rates on an IFRS basis principally arises from the Group’s hedging strategy to protect the regulatory capital position, 
which results in an adverse impact on profit on an increase in interest rates. 

The Group is exposed to inflation risk through certain contracts, such as annuities, which may provide for future benefits to be paid taking 
account of changes in the level of experienced and implied inflation, and also through the Group’s cost base. The Group seeks to manage 
inflation risk within the ALM framework through the holding of derivatives, such as inflation swaps, or physical positions in relevant assets, such 
as index-linked gilts, where appropriate.

The sensitivity analysis results for IFRS are based on a combination of modelled results and Solvency II adjusted sensitivity results. Sensitivity 
results include an allowance for estate distribution absorption on with-profit business and the second-order impact on Risk Adjustment but 
excludes the impact on the Group’s pension schemes.

Equity and property risk
The Group is exposed to the risk of reductions in the valuation of equities (or changes in the volatility) or property investments which could result 
in reductions in asset values and losses for policyholders or shareholders. In this context, equity assets should be taken to include shares, equity 
derivatives, equity collectives and unlisted equities. Property assets include direct property investment, shares in property companies, property 
collectives and structured property assets.

The portfolio of marketable equity securities and property investments which is carried in the statement of consolidated financial position at fair 
value has exposure to price risk. The Group’s objective in holding these assets is to earn higher long-term returns by investing in a diverse 
portfolio of equities and properties. Portfolio characteristics are analysed regularly and price risks are actively managed in line with investment 
mandates. The Group’s holdings are diversified across industries and concentrations in any one company or industry are limited.

Equity and property price risk is primarily borne in respect of assets held in with-profit funds, unit-linked funds or equity release mortgages in the 
non-profit funds. For unit-linked funds this risk is borne by policyholders and asset movements directly impact unit prices and hence policy 
values. For with-profit funds policyholders’ future bonuses will be impacted by the investment returns achieved and hence the price risk, whilst 
the Group also has exposure to the value of guarantees provided to with-profit policyholders. In addition some equity investments are held in 
respect of shareholders’ funds. For the non-profit fund property price risk from equity release mortgages is borne by the Group with the aim of 
achieving greater diversification and investment returns, consistent with the Strategic Asset Allocation approved by the Board. The Group as a 
whole is exposed to price risk fluctuations impacting the income flow of management charges from the invested assets of all funds; this is 
primarily managed through the use of derivatives.

Equity and property price risk is managed through the agreement and monitoring of financial risk profiles that are appropriate for each of the 
Group’s life funds in respect of maintaining adequate regulatory capital and treating customers fairly. This is largely achieved through asset class 
diversification and within the Group’s ALM framework through the holding of derivatives or physical positions in relevant assets where appropriate. 

The shareholders’ exposure to equity risk principally arises from the Group’s hedging strategy to protect the regulatory capital position, which 
results in an adverse impact on profit on an increase in equity prices.

1  Prior period comparatives have been restated on transition to IFRS17 Insurance Contracts (see note A2.1 for further details).

The sensitivity to changes in equity prices is primarily driven by the Group’s equity hedging arrangements over the value of future management 
charges that are linked to asset values. 

Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that changes in the value of currencies could lead to reductions in asset values which may result in losses for 
policyholders and shareholders. With the exception of Standard Life International business sold in Germany and the Republic of Ireland and 
some historic business written in the Republic of Ireland, the Group’s principal transactions are carried out in sterling. The assets for these books 
of business are generally held in the same currency denomination as their liabilities, therefore, any foreign currency mismatch is largely mitigated. 
Consequently, the foreign currency risk relating to this business mainly arises when the assets and liabilities are translated into sterling.

The Group’s financial assets are primarily denominated in the same currencies as its insurance and investment liabilities. Thus, the main foreign 
exchange risk arises from recognised assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than those in which insurance and investment 
liabilities are expected to be settled and, indirectly, from the non-UK earnings of UK companies.

Some of the Group’s with-profit funds have an exposure to overseas assets which is not driven by liability considerations. The purpose of this 
exposure is to reduce overall risk whilst maximising returns by diversification. This exposure is limited and managed through investment mandates 
which are subject to the oversight of the investment committees of the Boards of each life company. Fluctuations in exchange rates from certain 
holdings in overseas assets are hedged against currency risks. 

During 2021, the Group entered into four hedging relationships to hedge the currency risk on its Euro and US dollar denominated hybrid debt (US 
$500 million Tier 2 bonds, €500 million Tier 2 notes, US $750 million contingent convertible Tier 1 notes and US $500 million Fixed Rate Reset Tier 
2 notes as set out in note E5) through cross currency rate swaps.

FinancialsFinancialsNotes to the consolidated financial statements continuedE. Financial assets & liabilities continued
E6.2.3 Financial soundness risk
Financial soundness risk is a broad risk category encompassing capital management risk, tax risk and liquidity and funding risk.

Capital management risk is defined as the failure of the Group, or one of its separately regulated subsidiaries, to maintain sufficient capital to 
provide appropriate security for policyholders and meet all regulatory capital requirements whilst not retaining unnecessary capital. The Group 
has exposure to capital management risk through the requirements of the Solvency II capital regime, as implemented by the PRA, to calculate 
regulatory capital adequacy at a Group level. The Group’s UK life subsidiaries have exposure to capital management risk through the Solvency II 
regulatory capital requirements mandated by the PRA at the solo level. The Group’s approach to managing capital management risk is described 
in detail in note I3.

Tax risk
Tax risk is defined as the risk of reductions in earnings and/or value, through financial or reputational loss, due to an unforeseen tax cost, or by the 
inappropriate reporting and disclosure of information in relation to taxation. Tax risk can be caused by:

incorrect calculation of tax provisions; 

•  the Group, or one of its subsidiaries, making a material error in its tax reporting; 
• 
•  failure to implement the optimum financial arrangements to underpin a commercial transaction; and 
• 

incorrect operation of policyholder tax requirements.

Tax risk is managed by maintaining an appropriately-staffed tax team who have the qualifications and experience to make judgements on tax 
issues, augmented by advice from external specialists where required. In addition, the Group has a formal tax risk policy, which sets out its risk 
appetite in relation to specific aspects of tax risk, and which details the controls the Group has in place to manage those risks.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as failure to maintain adequate levels of financial resources to meet obligations as they fall due. Funding risk relates to the 
potential inability to raise additional capital or liquidity when required in order to maintain the resilience of the balance sheet. The Group has 
exposure to liquidity risk as a result of servicing its external debt and equity investors, and from the operating requirements of its subsidiaries. The 
Group’s subsidiaries have exposure to liquidity risk as a result of normal business activities, specifically the risk arising from an inability to meet 
short-term cash flow requirements and to meet obligations to policy liabilities. The Board of Phoenix Group Holdings plc has defined a number 
of governance objectives and principles and the liquidity risk frameworks of each subsidiary are designed to ensure that:

liquidity risk is managed in a manner consistent with the subsidiary company Boards’ strategic objectives, risk appetite and PPFM;

• 
•  cash flows are appropriately managed and the reputation of the Group is safeguarded; and
•  appropriate information on liquidity risk is available to those making decisions.

The Group’s liquidity risk management strategy is based on a risk appetite of less than a 1 in 200 chance of having insufficient liquid or tangible 
assets to meet financial obligations as they fall due and is supported by:

•  holding appropriate assets to meet liquidity buffers;
•  holding high quality liquid assets to support day to day operations;
•  an effective stress testing framework to ensure survival horizons are met under different severe, but plausible scenarios;
•  effective liquidity portfolio management including Early Warning Indicators; and
• 

liquidity risk contingency planning.

The Group’s funding strategy aims to maintain the appropriate level of debt and equity in order to support the Group’s organic and inorganic 
growth ambitions, while maintaining sufficient headroom for hybrid capital under Solvency II rules.

Liquidity forecasts showing headroom against liquidity buffers are prepared regularly to predict required liquidity levels over both the short and 
medium-term allowing management to respond appropriately to changes in circumstances. In the event of a liquidity shortfall, either current or 
projected, this would be managed in line with the Group’s Contingency Liquidity Plan where the latest available contingency management 
actions would be considered. 

In extreme circumstances, the Group could be exposed to liquidity risk in its unit-linked funds. This could occur where a high volume of 
surrenders coincides with a tightening of liquidity in a unit-linked fund to the point where assets of that fund have to be sold to meet those 
withdrawals. Where the fund affected consists of less liquid assets such as property, it can take several months to complete a sale and this would 
impede the proper operation of the fund. In these situations, the Group considers its risk to be low since there are steps that can be taken first 
within the funds themselves both to ensure the fair treatment of all investors in those funds and to protect the Group’s own risk exposure.

The vast majority of the Group’s derivative contracts are traded OTC and have a two-day collateral settlement period. The Group’s derivative 
contracts are monitored daily, via an end-of-day valuation process, to assess the need for additional funds to cover margin or collateral calls.

Some of the Group’s commercial property investments, cash and cash equivalents are held through collective investment schemes. 
The collective investment schemes have the power to restrict and/or suspend withdrawals, which would, in turn, affect liquidity.

The following table provides a maturity analysis showing the remaining contractual maturities of the Group’s undiscounted financial liabilities 
and associated interest.

A significant proportion of the Group’s financial assets are held in gilts, cash, supranationals and investment grade securities which the Group 
considers sufficient to meet the liabilities as they fall due. The vast majority of these investments are readily realisable immediately since most of 
them are quoted in an active market. 

The Group has a set of established policies and processes to manage its exposure to liquidity risk, including impacts arising from the economic 
environment, business developments and funding changes. Where liquidity risk is heightened, such as during periods of significant market 
volatility, triggers are in place to enhance the frequency of liquidity monitoring and to implement available contingency actions to ensure 
sufficient liquidity is maintained.

E6.2.4 Strategic risk
Strategic risks threaten the achievement of the Group strategy through poor strategic decision-making, implementation or response to changing 
circumstances. The Group recognises that core strategic activity brings with it exposure to strategic risk. However, the Group seeks to 
proactively review, manage and control these exposures. 

The Group’s strategy and business plan are exposed to external events that could prevent or impact the achievement of the strategy; events 
relating to how the strategy and business plan are executed; and events that arise as a consequence of following the specific strategy chosen. 
The identification and assessment of strategic risks is an integrated part of the Risk Management Framework. Strategic risk should be considered 
in parallel with the Risk Universe as each of the risks within the Risk Universe can impact the Group’s strategy.

A Strategic Risk Policy is maintained and reported against regularly, with a particular focus on risk management, stakeholder management, 
corporate activity and overall reporting against the Group’s strategic ambitions.

E6.2.5 Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of reductions in earnings and/or value, through financial or reputational loss, from inadequate or failed internal 
processes and systems, or from people-related or external events. Operational risk arises due to failures in one or more of the following aspects 
of our business:

indirect exposures through outsourcing service providers and suppliers;

• 
•  direct exposures through internal practices, actions or omissions;
•  external threats from individuals or groups focused on malicious or criminal activities, or on external events occurring which are not within the 

Group’s control; and

•  negligence, mal-practice or failure of employees, or suppliers to follow good practice in delivering operational processes and practices. 

It is accepted that it is neither possible, appropriate nor cost effective to eliminate all operational risks from the business as operational risk is 
inherent in any operating environment particularly given the regulatory framework under which the Group operates. As such the Group will 
tolerate a degree of operational risk subject to appropriate and proportionate levels of control around the identification, management and 
reporting of such risks. A set of operational risk policies are maintained that set out the nature of the operational risk exposure and key controls in 
place to control the risk.

E6.2.6 Customer risk
Customer risk is the risk of financial failure, reputational loss, loss of earnings and/or value through inappropriate or poor customer treatment 
(including poor advice). It can arise as a result of:

•  Customer Outcomes: The risk that our decisions, actions or behaviors individually or collectively result in a failure to act to deliver good 
outcomes for our customers, including in the following areas: Product Design & Development, Communication & Guidance, Customer 
Support & Understanding, Monitoring & Oversight, Customer Feedback, and Culture & standards.

•  Customer Transformation: The design, governance and oversight of Strategic Customer Transformation Activity in retained functions and 
service providers, fails to deliver on reasonable customer expectations, taking account of the Phoenix Group customer treatment risk 
appetites and regulatory requirements.

The Group has both a Conduct Risk appetite to focus on behaviours within the business, and a Customer Risk appetite to focus on achieving 
good customer outcomes (both of which apply to the Company). The behaviours and standards all colleagues are expected to achieve are 
detailed in our Group Code of Conduct. For our customers, what represents a good outcome is articulated in our Customer Standards and 
supporting Business Unit processes. In addition, the Group Conduct Strategy, which overarches our Risk Universe and all risk policies is designed 
to detect where our customers are at risk of poor outcomes, minimise conduct risks, and respond with timely and appropriate mitigating actions. 

The Group also has a suite of customer polices which set out the key customer risks and control objectives in place to mitigate them. The 
customer risks for the Group are regularly reported to management oversight committees.

F. Insurance contracts, investment contracts with DPF and reinsurance
F1. Liabilities under insurance contracts

Classification 
Contracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk are classified as insurance contracts. Contracts held by the Group under 
which it transfers significant insurance risk related to underlying insurance contracts are classified as reinsurance contracts. Some contracts 
entered into by the Group have the legal form of insurance contracts but do not transfer significant insurance risk and expose the Group to 
financial risk. These contracts are classified as financial liabilities and are referred to as investment contracts.

All references in these accounting policies to insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts include contracts issued, initiated or acquired by 
the Group, unless otherwise stated. 

Insurance contracts are classified as direct participating contracts or contracts without direct participation features. Direct participating 
contracts are contracts for which, at inception:

•  the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;
•  the Group expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items; and
•  the Group expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value 

of the underlying items. 

All other insurance contracts and all reinsurance contracts are classified as contracts without direct participation features. 

Some investment contracts issued by the Group contain discretionary participation features (‘DPF’), whereby the investor has the right and is 
expected to receive, as a supplement to the amount not subject to the Group’s discretion, potentially significant additional benefits based on 
the return of specified pools of investment assets. The Group accounts for these contracts under IFRS 17 consistent with insurance contracts.

The classification assessment is made at the date of inception or for business combinations or portfolio transfers, as at the date of acquisition. 
Once a contract is assessed as insurance, investment with DPF or reinsurance, the classification continues until the contract is 
derecognised or modified.

When considering classification, and applying the provisions of IFRS 17, the Group identifies a contract as the smallest unit of account. 
The Group also makes an evaluation of whether a series of contracts can be treated together in applying IFRS 17 based on reasonable and 
supportable information, or whether a single contract contains components that need to be separated and treated as if they were stand-
alone contracts.

Accounting treatment
Separating components from insurance and reinsurance contracts
The Group assesses its insurance products to determine whether they contain components, which must be accounted for under accounting 
standards other than IFRS 17 (distinct non-insurance components).

Where an insurance contract has a distinct investment component and meets the separation criteria established under IFRS 17, the investment 
component is separated from the host contract and accounted for under IFRS 9. The assessment of whether a contract has a distinct 
investment component is carried out at inception of the contract, or the date of acquisition in the case of a business combination.

When assessing whether the investment component is distinct, the Group considers the following, which may indicate that the insurance and 
investment component are highly interrelated:

•  the value of one component varies with the other component;
•  existence of an option to switch between the different components;
•  discounts that span both elements e.g. a reduced asset management charge based on total size of contract; and
•  other interacting features e.g. insurance risk from premium waivers and return of premium covering both elements of the policy.

After separating any distinct components, the Group applies the requirements of IFRS 17 to all remaining components of the insurance 
contract or where distinct criteria are not met, the whole contract is accounted for within IFRS 17.

Level of aggregation
The Group is required to divide its business into groups for the purposes of recognition and measurement. The Group’s business is firstly split 
into portfolios. Portfolios contain groups of contracts with similar risks, which are managed together. Portfolios are further divided based on 
expected profitability at inception into three categories: onerous contracts, contracts that are profitable at initial recognition and have no 
significant risk of becoming onerous, and the remaining profitable contracts. For reinsurance contracts the same three groups would be 
identified with ‘onerous’ being replaced with ‘net gain’ and ‘profitable’ being replaced with ‘net cost’. Contracts which are issued more than 
one year apart are not permitted to be included within the same group. However as permitted by IFRS 17, the groups of contracts for which the 
FVA has been adopted on transition include contracts issued more than one year apart.

The Group has defined portfolios of insurance and reinsurance contracts issued broadly based on the predominant risks inherent in the 
products/contracts, for example, longevity, persistency, mortality, and by considering whether groups of products are managed together. 
These portfolios are further split by legal entity, with-profit fund and contracts subject to different IFRS 17 measurement models are grouped 
separately. The portfolios are allocated to cohorts based on whether they are onerous at inception or based on their expected level of 
profitability using information available at inception.

For reinsurance contracts held, portfolios are based upon similar risks to those of the underlying contracts. The reinsurance contracts held are 
assessed for aggregation requirements on an individual contract basis.

The grouping of the insurance contracts are determined at initial recognition and are not subsequently reassessed. Therefore, a contract will 
remain within the assigned aggregation group until it is derecognised, either by expiry or modification.

F1. Liabilities under insurance contracts continued

Recognition
The Group recognises groups of insurance contracts that it issues from the earliest of the following:

•  the beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts; 
•  the date when the first payment from the policyholder in the group is due or actually received if there is no due date; or
•  for a group of onerous contracts, as soon as facts and circumstances indicate that the group is onerous.

Investment contracts with DPF are initially recognised at the date when the Group becomes a party to the contract.

Insurance contracts acquired in a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations or a portfolio transfer are 
accounted for as if they were entered into at the date of acquisition or transfer.

Reinsurance contracts held are recognised from the earliest of the following:

•  the beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held. However, the Group delays the recognition of a group of 
reinsurance contracts held that provide proportionate coverage (for example, through a quota share arrangement) until the date when any 
underlying insurance contract is initially recognised, if that date is later than the beginning of the coverage period of the group of 
reinsurance contracts held; and

•  the date the Group recognises an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts if the Group entered into the related reinsurance 

contract held in the group of reinsurance contracts held at or before that date.

The Group adds new contracts to the group in the reporting period in which that contract meets one of the criteria set out above.

Contract boundaries
The Group includes in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts all the future cash flows within the boundary of each contract in the 
group. Cash flows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they arise from the rights and obligations that exist during the period in 
which the policyholder is obligated to pay premiums or the Group has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with insurance 
contract services. A substantive obligation to provide insurance contract services ends when:

•  the Group has the practical ability to reprice the risks of the particular policyholder or change the level of benefits so that the price fully 

reflects those risks; or 

•  both of the following criteria are satisfied:

–  the Group has the practical ability to reprice the contract or a portfolio of contracts so that the price fully reflects the reassessed risk of 

that portfolio; and 

–  the pricing of premiums up to the date when risks are reassessed does not reflect the risks related to periods beyond the 

reassessment date.

Where an expected premium or expected claim is not within the contract boundary, it is not recognised as a cash flow of the contract and is 
instead considered to relate to a future insurance contract and recognised when those contracts meet the recognition criteria.

The contract boundary is reassessed at each reporting date to include the effect of changes in circumstances on the Group’s substantive 
rights and obligations and, therefore, may change over time.

The contract boundary for a reinsurance contract is dependent on the terms and conditions of the reinsurance contract and therefore may 
not necessarily be the same as for the underlying contracts. Where the reinsurance contract is open to new business on agreed terms for a 
period of time, the contract boundary may include estimates of reinsurance on insurance contracts that have not yet been issued or reported.

Measurement
The Group’s insurance contracts issued without direct participation features are grouped together under annuity, protection and other 
non-linked insurance business. These groups of insurance contract are measured under the General Model (‘GM’). 

Direct participating contracts issued by the Group are contracts with DPF where the Group holds the pool of underlying assets. Direct 
participating insurance contracts are grouped together and reported primarily as either unit-linked or with-profit business although some 
protection contracts are considered to have direct participation features. These groups of contracts are measured using the variable fee 
approach (‘VFA’), unless they fail the eligibility test to be treated under this approach, in such circumstances they are measured under the GM. 

Reinsurance contracts held are measured under the GM irrespective of the measurement model used for the underlying contracts. Certain 
with-profit funds within the Group hold non-profit insurance business such as annuities. This business will also be measured under the GM.

Initial measurement – Insurance contracts
On initial recognition, the Group measures a group of insurance contracts as the total of (a) the fulfilment cash flows, which comprise estimates 
of future cash flows, adjusted to reflect the time value of money and the associated financial risks, and a risk adjustment for non-financial risk; 
and (b) the contractual service margin (‘CSM’). The fulfilment cash flows of a group of insurance contracts do not reflect the Group’s non-
performance risk.

The fulfilment cash flows comprise:

•  unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of future cash flows that are within the contract boundary plus an adjustment to reflect the 

time value of money and the financial risks related to future cash flows, to the extent that the financial risks are not included in the estimates 
of future cash flows (‘BEL’); and

•  a risk adjustment for non-financial risk.

The measurement of fulfilment cash flows includes insurance acquisition cash flows which are allocated as a portion of premium to profit or 
loss (through insurance revenue) over the period of the contract in a systematic and rational way based on the passage of time.

The risk adjustment for non-financial risk for a group of insurance contracts, determined separately from the other estimates, is the 
compensation required for bearing uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk. The Group 
applies a confidence level technique. The risk adjustment is allocated to groups of contracts based on an analysis of the risk profiles of the 
groups, reflecting the effects of the diversification benefits between Group entities to the extent that the Group includes it when determining 
the compensation required to bear that risk. The Group includes diversification between Group entities which use the Group Internal Model 
for management decision-making. Where a Standard Formula approach is used, no diversification with other entities within the Group is 
allowed for. The Group determines the risk adjustment using a one-year time horizon, consistent with the time horizon used for Solvency II, a 
key metric underlying how the Group is managed.

The CSM of a group of insurance contracts represents the unearned profit that the Group will recognise over the life of the contract as 
insurance and investment-related services are provided. For profitable groups of insurance contracts the CSM is established to ensure that no 
profit or loss is recognised at inception and consequently it offsets the net present value of the expected cash flows (including initial premium 
and insurance acquisition cash flows) and the risk adjustment. For a group of insurance contracts that are onerous, the CSM is set to nil and a 
loss is immediately recognised in profit or loss. A loss component of the liability for remaining coverage (‘LRC’) is established for the amount of 
loss recognised. 

The initial recognition of the CSM is consistent for insurance contracts applying the GM and VFA measurement approaches, however there 
are key differences for subsequent measurement of the CSM under these measurement models. 

For groups of contracts acquired in a transfer of contracts or a business combination, the consideration received for the contracts is included 
in the fulfilment cash flows as a proxy for the premiums received at the date of acquisition. In a business combination, the consideration 
received is the fair value of the contracts at that date.

With-profit estate
The Group has a number of with-profit funds where surpluses are shared between policyholders and shareholders. All such funds are closed 
to new business. These funds typically have an estate, being a surplus of assets over those needed to meet the liabilities of current 
policyholders. As these funds are closed to new business, the surplus is expected to be distributed to existing policyholders over time and the 
Group has determined it appropriate to allocate the expected future policyholder payments from the estate to specific groups of contracts 
within the measurement of the best estimate cash flows.

Subsequent measurement – Insurance contracts
The carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts at each reporting date is the sum of the LRC and the liability for incurred claims (‘LIC’). 
The LRC comprises the BEL, risk adjustment and any remaining CSM at that date. The LIC includes the BEL and risk adjustment (the fulfilment 
cash flows for incurred claims and expenses that have not yet been paid, including claims that have been incurred but not yet reported). There 
is no CSM associated with the LIC, and as a result, any changes in the LIC are taken directly to profit or loss.

The fulfilment cash flows of groups of insurance contracts are measured at the reporting date using current estimates of future cash flows, 
current discount rates and current estimates of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk. Changes in fulfilment cash flows are 
recognised as follows.

Changes relating to future services insurance

Adjusted against the CSM (or recognised in the insurance service 
result in profit or loss if the group is onerous)

Changes relating to current or past services

Recognised in the insurance service result in profit or loss

Effects of the time value of money, financial risk and changes

Recognised in insurance finance income or expenses therein on 
estimated future cash flows

Where, during the coverage period, a group of insurance contracts becomes onerous, the Group recognises a loss in profit or loss for the net 
outflow, resulting in the carrying amount of the liability for the group being equal to the fulfilment cash flows. A loss component is established 
by the Group for the liability for remaining coverage for such groups of onerous contracts representing the losses recognised. 

The CSM of each group of contracts is calculated at each reporting date as follows:

Insurance contracts measured under GM
For insurance contracts measured under the GM approach, the CSM is adjusted by applying locked-in discount rates, while the BEL and risk 
adjustment are adjusted using current discount rates.

The carrying amount of the CSM at each reporting date is the carrying amount at the start of the year, adjusted for:

•  the CSM of any new contracts that are added to the group in the year;
• 
interest accreted on the carrying amount of the CSM during the year;
•  changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future services, except to the extent that:

–  any increases in the fulfilment cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the CSM, in which case the excess is recognised as a loss in profit 

or loss and creates a loss component; or

–  any decreases in the fulfilment cash flows are allocated to the loss component, reversing losses previously recognised in profit or loss;

•  the effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM; and
•  the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the services provided in the year (see the ‘Insurance revenue’ accounting policy in 

note C1 for further details).

FinancialsFinancialsNotes to the consolidated financial statements continuedF. Insurance contracts, investment contracts with DPF and reinsurance continued
F1. Liabilities under insurance contracts continued

Changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service that adjust the CSM comprise:

•  experience adjustments arising from the difference between premiums received and the expected amounts estimated at the beginning of 

the period, that relate to future service, along with any associated acquisition costs;

•  changes in estimates of the present value of future cash flows in the BEL and risk adjustment;
•  differences between any investment component expected to become payable in the period and the actual investment component that 

becomes payable; and

•  changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that relate to future service.

The impact of discounting the risk adjustment for business measured under GM is disaggregated and recognised within Net finance income 
or expenses from insurance contracts within the income statement. 

Insurance contracts measured under VFA model
The Group’s unit-linked and with-profit business that meets the VFA eligibility criteria are direct participating contracts under which the 
Group’s obligation to the policyholder is the net of:

•  the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items; and
•  a variable fee in exchange for future services provided by the contracts, being the amount of the Group’s share of the fair value of the 
underlying items less fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items. The Group provides investment 
services under these contracts by giving a return based on underlying items, in addition to insurance coverage.

For unit-linked and with-profit contracts that are measured under the VFA, interest is not accreted on the CSM using a locked-in discount rate, 
instead it is determined with reference to the underlying items, reflecting that on these types of insurance contracts the Group fees for 
providing investment-related services are determined with reference to the value of the investments associated with the policyholder’s policy. 
For example, annual management charges (‘AMC’) are determined by reference to the value of the policyholder’s fund value and the 
shareholder’s share of bonuses on a with-profit policy in a 90:10 fund is determined based on the performance of the with-profit fund.

The variable fee earned by the Group is consequently the Group’s share of the fair value of underlying items less fulfilment cash flows that do 
not vary based on returns of the underlying items.

For unit-linked contracts, the underlying items are funds that the unit price of the investment chosen by the policyholder varies with.

For with-profits contracts, the underlying items are typically the net assets of the relevant with-profit fund, including the estate and the fair 
value of non-profit contracts within the fund. With-profit funds can vary in their nature and operation, therefore will be dependent on facts 
and circumstances.

When measuring a group of unit-linked and with-profit contracts using the VFA, the Group adjusts the fulfilment cash flows for the whole of 
the changes in the obligation to pay policyholders an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items. These changes do not relate to 
future services and are recognised in profit or loss. The Group then adjusts any CSM for changes in the amount of the Group’s share of the fair 
value of the underlying items, which relate to future services, as explained below.

The carrying amount of the CSM at each reporting date is the carrying amount at the start of the year, adjusted for:

•  the CSM of any new contracts that are added to the group in the year;
•  the change in the amount of the Group’s share of the fair value of the underlying items and changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to 

future services, except to the extent that:
–  the Group has applied the risk mitigation option to exclude from the CSM changes in the effect of financial risk on the amount of its share 

of the underlying items or fulfilment cash flows;

–  a decrease in the amount of the Group’s share of the fair value of the underlying items, or an increase in the fulfilment cash flows that relate 
to future services, exceeds the carrying amount of the CSM, giving rise to a loss in profit or loss (included in insurance service expenses) 
and creating a loss component; or

–  an increase in the amount of the Group’s share of the fair value of the underlying items, or a decrease in the fulfilment cash flows that relate 

to future services, is allocated to the loss component, reversing losses previously recognised in profit or loss (included in insurance 
service expenses);

•  the effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM; and
•  the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the services provided in the year (see the ‘Insurance revenue’ accounting policy in 

note C1 for further details).

Changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service include the changes relating to future services specified above for contracts 
without direct participation features (measured at current discount rates) and changes in the effect of the time value of money and financial 
risks that do not arise from underlying items.

The Group does not currently apply the risk mitigation option to any material extent. 

Loss components
A loss component represents a notional record of the losses attributable to each group of onerous insurance contracts. The loss component is 
released based on a systematic allocation of the subsequent changes relating to future service in the fulfilment cash flows to (i) the loss 
component; and (ii) the liability for remaining coverage excluding the loss component. The loss component is also updated for subsequent 
changes in estimates of the fulfilment cash flows and the risk adjustment relating to future service. The systematic allocation of subsequent 
changes to the loss component results in the total amounts allocated to the loss component being equal to zero by the end of the coverage 
period of a group of insurance contracts. The Group uses coverage units as the method of systematic allocation.

Reinsurance contracts held – measurement
The carrying amount of a group of reinsurance contracts at each reporting date is the sum of the asset/liability for remaining coverage and the 
asset/liability for incurred claims. The asset/liability for remaining coverage comprises (a) the fulfilment cash flows that relate to services that 
will be received under the contracts in future periods and (b) any remaining CSM at that date.

The measurement of reinsurance contracts held at initial recognition follows the same principles as those for insurance contracts issued, with 
the exception of the following:

•  measurement of the cash flows include an allowance on a probability-weighted basis for the effect of any non-performance by the 

reinsurers, including the effects of collateral;

•  the risk adjustment for non-financial risk is determined so that it represents the amount of risk being transferred to the reinsurer; and
•  the Group recognises both gains and losses at initial recognition in the statement of consolidated financial position as CSM and releases 

this to profit or loss as the reinsurer renders services, except for any portion of a loss that relates to events before initial recognition. Where 
the Group recognises a loss on initial recognition of an onerous group of underlying contracts, it establishes a loss-recovery component of 
the asset for remaining coverage depicting the recovery of losses recognised.

To determine the risk adjustment for reinsurance contracts held, the Group will apply the approach set out above for insurance contracts both 
gross and net of reinsurance and determine the amount of risk being transferred to the reinsurer as the difference between the two results.

The loss-recovery component determines the amounts that are subsequently presented in profit or loss as reversals of recoveries of losses 
from reinsurance contracts and are excluded from the allocation of reinsurance premiums paid. It is adjusted to reflect changes in the loss 
component of the onerous group of underlying contracts, but it cannot exceed the portion of the loss component of the onerous group of 
underlying contracts that the Group expects to recover from the reinsurance contracts.

The Group adjusts the CSM of the group to which a reinsurance contract belongs and as a result recognises income when it recognises a loss 
on initial recognition of onerous underlying contracts, if the reinsurance contract is entered into before or at the same time as the onerous 
underlying contracts are recognised. The adjustment to the CSM is determined by multiplying:

•  the amount of the loss that relates to the underlying contracts; and
•  the percentage of claims on the underlying contracts that the Group expects to recover from the reinsurance contracts. 

The subsequent measurement of reinsurance contracts held follows the same principles as those for insurance contracts issued, with the 
exception of the following:

•  changes in the fulfilment cash flows are recognised in profit or loss if the related changes arising from the underlying ceded contracts have 

been recognised in profit or loss. Alternatively, changes in the fulfilment cash flows adjust the CSM; and

•  changes in the fulfilment cash flows that result from changes in the risk of non-performance by the issuer of a reinsurance contract held do 

not adjust the CSM as they do not relate to future service. The effect of the non-performance risk of the reinsurer is assessed at each 
reporting date and the effect of changes in the non-performance risk is recognised in profit or loss.

Modification and derecognition
The Group derecognises insurance and reinsurance contracts when: 

•  the rights and obligations relating to the contract are extinguished (i.e. discharged, cancelled or expired); or
•  the contract is modified such that the modification results in a change in the measurement model, or the applicable standard for measuring 

a component of the contract. In such cases, the Group derecognises the initial contract and recognises the modified contract as a 
new contract.

Disclosure Groups 
The Group disaggregates information for the purposes of making the disclosures required by IFRS 17 into the following disclosure groups:

•  Retirement Solutions;
•  Pensions & Savings;
•  With-Profits; and
•  Europe & Other

The disclosure groups are aligned to the segments used for segmental reporting in note B1.

F7. Recognition of CSM in profit or loss
The following tables set out when the Group expects to recognise the carrying value of the CSM in the consolidated income statement for 
insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held. For General Model business this is shown after allowing for future accretion of 
interest on the CSM at the locked in rate. The amounts presented represent the net impact in each period of expected release of the CSM 
recognised in revenue less the accretion of interest on the CSM on General Model business recognised in insurance finance expenses.

F10. Collateral arrangements
It is the Group’s practice to obtain collateral to mitigate the counterparty risk related to reinsurance transactions usually in the form of cash 
or marketable financial instruments. 

Where the Group receives collateral in the form of marketable financial instruments which it is not permitted to sell or re-pledge except in the 
case of default, it is not recognised in the statement of consolidated financial position. The fair value of financial assets accepted as collateral for 
reinsurance transactions but not recognised in the statement of consolidated financial position amounts to £4,880 million (2022: £4,002 million). 

Where the Group receives collateral on reinsurance transactions in the form of cash it is recognised in the statement of consolidated financial 
position along with a corresponding liability to repay the amount of collateral received, disclosed as part of ‘Reinsurance contract assets’. Where 
there is interest payable on such collateral, it is recognised within Net finance income/(expense) from reinsurance contracts. The amounts 
recognised as financial assets and liabilities from cash collateral received at 31 December 2023 are set out below.

F11. Risk management – insurance risk
This note forms one part of the risk management disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An overview of the Group’s approach to 
risk management is outlined in note I3 and the Group’s management of financial and other risks is detailed in note E6.

Insurance risk refers to the risk of reductions in earnings and/or value, through financial or reputational loss, due to fluctuations in the timing, 
frequency and severity of insured/underwritten events and to fluctuations in the timing and amount of claim settlements. This includes 
fluctuations in profits due to customer behaviour. The Life businesses are exposed to the following elements of insurance risk:

Mortality

Longevity

 higher than expected death claims on assurance products, lower than expected improvements in mortality or adverse 
movement in mortality rates on Equity Release Mortgages;

 lower than expected number of deaths experienced on annuity products or greater than expected improvements in 
annuitant mortality;

Morbidity/Disability

 higher than expected number of inceptions on critical illness or income protection policies and lower than expected 
termination rates on income protection policies or adverse movements in morbidity rates on Equity Release Mortgages;

Expenses

Persistency

 unexpected timing or value of expenses incurred;

 adverse movement in surrender rates, premium paying rates, premium indexation rates, cash withdrawal/drawdown 
rates, GAO surrender rates, GAO take-up rates, policyholder retirement dates, propensity to commute benefits, transfer 
out rates or the occurrence of a mass lapse event or adverse change in mortgage prepayment rates leading to losses; 

New business pricing  inappropriate pricing of new business that is not in line with the underlying risk factors for that business.

Concentration of risk

 concentration of risk arising from insurance contracts might exist where the Group has significant exposure to specific 
demographic factors such as age, smoker status, geographical location. The Group’s exposure to insurance risk is 
spread across a diversified portfolio of products and approximately 12 million policyholders. Concentration risk might 
also arise from insurance contracts that expose the Group to financial risk as a result of options and guarantees 
contained within the product. Details of the Group’s approach to managing these features are contained in F11.3 
Managing Product Risk. 

The Group sets individual risk limits as a key control within its Risk Appetite Framework.  Risk limits are reviewed as part 
of approving the Group’s Annual Operating Plan and permit concentrations of certain risks only where the strategy can 
be demonstrated as affordable within risk appetite.

The Group sets individual risk limits as a key control within its Risk Appetite Framework. Risk limits are reviewed as part of approving the Group’s 
Annual Operating Plan and permit concentrations of certain risks only where the strategy can be demonstrated as affordable within risk appetite.

Objectives and policies for mitigating insurance risk
Insurance risks are managed by monitoring risk exposure against pre-defined appetite limits. If a risk is moving out of appetite, the Group can 
choose to mitigate it via reinsurance in the case of longevity, mortality and morbidity risks, or by taking other risk reducing actions.

This is supported by additional methods to assess and monitor insurance risk exposures for both individual types of risks insured and overall risks. 
These methods include internal risk measurement models, experience analyses, external data comparisons, sensitivity analyses, scenario 
analyses and stress testing. Assumptions that are deemed to be financially significant are reviewed at least annually for pricing and 
reporting purposes.

The profitability of the run-off of the closed book of business within the Group depends, to a significant extent, on the values of claims paid in the 
future relative to the assets accumulated to the date of claim. Typically, over the lifetime of a contract, premiums and investment returns exceed 
claim costs in the early years and it is necessary to set aside these amounts to meet future obligations. The amount of such future obligations is 
assessed on actuarial principles by reference to assumptions about the development of financial and insurance risks.

It is therefore necessary for the Directors of each life company to make decisions, based on actuarial advice, which ensure an appropriate 
accumulation of assets relative to liabilities. These decisions include investment policy, bonus policy and, where discretion exists, the level of 
payments on early termination.

In the Retirement Solutions operating segment, longevity risk exposures continue to increase as a result of the Bulk Purchase Annuity deals it has 
successfully acquired, however the vast majority of these exposures are reinsured to third parties. New business growth driven by product 
segments such as Workplace unit-linked pensions, within the Pensions and Savings business, exposes the Group to persistency and 
expense risks.

F11.1 Sensitivities
Insurance liabilities are sensitive to changes in risk variables, such as prevailing market interest rates, currency rates and equity prices, since these 
variations alter the value of the financial assets held to meet obligations arising from insurance contracts and changes in investment conditions 
also have an impact on the value of insurance liabilities themselves. Additionally, insurance liabilities are sensitive to the assumptions which have 
been applied in their calculation, such as mortality and lapse rates. Sometimes allowance must also be made for the effect on future assumptions 
of management or policyholder actions in certain economic scenarios. This could lead to changes in assumed asset mix or future bonus rates. 
The most significant non-economic sensitivities arise from mortality, longevity and lapse risk. The table below analyses how the CSM, profit after 
tax and equity would have increased or (decreased) if changes in underwriting risk variables that were reasonably possible at the reporting date 
had occurred. This analysis presents the sensitivities both before and after risk mitigation by reinsurance and assumes that all other variables 
remain constant.

F11.2 Assumptions
The assumptions used to determine the liabilities are updated at each reporting date to reflect recent experience, unless IFRS17 requires 
otherwise. Material judgement is required in calculating these liabilities and, in particular, in the choice of assumptions about which there is 
uncertainty over future experience. The principal assumptions are as follows:

F11.2.1 Discount rates
All cash flows are discounted using risk-free yield curves adjusted to reflect the timing and liquidity characteristics of those cash flows. For the 
risk-free yield curve the Group uses those published by the PRA and EIOPA for regulatory reporting. Where necessary, yield curves are 
interpolated between the last available market data point and the ultimate forward rate.

The Group uses a top-down approach primarily for annuities and a bottom-up discount rate for all other business. Under the top-down 
approach, the discount rate is determined from the yield implicit in the fair value of an appropriate reference portfolio of assets that reflects the 
characteristics of the liabilities. For annuity business, the Group determines the reference portfolio based on the strategic asset allocation (‘SAA’) 
which aligns to the strategic investment objectives of the Group. The SAA sets out the target level of investment in a range of asset classes and 
the yield for these asset classes is determined based on the fair value of assets in that class held at the valuation date. 

Adjustments are made for differences between the reference portfolio and the insurance contract liability cash flows, including an allowance for 
credit defaults. The credit default deduction comprises an allowance for both expected and unexpected defaults and takes into consideration 
long-term historical data on actual defaults and an allowance for variability around these defaults. The credit default deduction is determined 
based on the assets held at the valuation date. 

The approach to determining unexpected defaults is based on a percentage of spread less the expected default allowance. The percentage of 
spread was set using a top-down view that took into consideration management’s best estimate as to the allocation of the spread between 
illiquidity factors and the risk of default. Given the widening of spreads during 2022 resulting from macro-economic conditions driven by the war 
in Ukraine and resulting food and energy crises, surging inflation and the Mini Budget, this judgement became more material. Since the 
beginning of 2022, the Group has been developing a credit model for use in the Phoenix Solvency II Internal Model (subject to PRA approval), 
which also provides a best estimate view of credit defaults. The new model applies a stress to long-term historical actual default data to 
determine the variability of defaults. From 30 June 2022, the new model has been used as an input in determining the assumption for 
unexpected credit defaults as it is considered to provide a more refined view of the variability of defaults, particularly in volatile 
market conditions.

F11.2.1 Discount rates continued
The top-down approach was further refined as at 31 December 2023. This refinement related to the determination of the yield used in relation to 
the Equity Release Mortgages asset class. The previous approach calculated the yield by reference to the internal securitisation structure 
established for this asset class for Solvency II purposes. This was amended as at the reporting date to determine the yield based on the 
underlying Equity Release Mortgage loans themselves. This refinement had the impact of increasing the liquidity premium applied at 
31 December 2023 for GBP Annuities by circa 19bps. 

Under the bottom-up approach, the discount rate is determined as the risk-free yield curve, adjusted for differences in liquidity characteristics 
by adding an illiquidity premium. For with-profits business a single illiquidity premium is determined for each fund based on the cash flow 
characteristics of the contracts within the fund and applied to all contracts within the fund. 

The tables below set out the yield curves used to discount the cash flows of insurance contracts for major currencies.

F11.2.2 Risk adjustment
The Group has used the confidence level technique to derive the risk adjustment for non-financial risk. The risk adjustment percentile is 
determined based on the Group’s view of the compensation required in respect of non-financial risk. The diversification benefit included in the 
risk adjustment reflects diversification between contracts within the perimeter of the Group’s Internal Model. There is no diversification allowed 
for between contracts measured under standard formula and the internal model. The confidence level percentile is calculated on a one year 
basis. The risk adjustment calibration is set at least annually, off-cycle, based on the Group’s current view of risk. The risk adjustment calculation is 
reassessed at each reporting date, i.e. the risk adjustment is not locked-in at initial recognition. 

For with-profit business, the shareholder’s portion of non-financial risks (including an allowance for burn-through costs to the shareholder) is 
allowed for in the derivation of the risk adjustment. For non-profit business held within a with-profit fund, the risk adjustment takes into account 
the compensation required by both the shareholder and the participating policyholders.

Confidence level techniques are used to derive the overall risk adjustment for non-financial risk and this is allocated down to each group of 
contracts in accordance with their risk profiles. The confidence level percentile input used to determine the risk adjustment is as follows:

Insurance contracts (gross of reinsurance)

2023
80th

2022
80th

The one year confidence level used to determine the risk adjustment has been converted to an approximate lifetime confidence level using an 
approach which involves dividing by the square root of the lifetime duration of the insurance business.

F11.2.3 Other assumptions
Other assumptions such as policyholder behaviours (lapses and surrender rates), expense inflation and demographic assumptions (i.e. longevity, 
mortality) are a key component of determining the cash flows related to the insurance contract liabilities. The underwriting risk variables and 
assumptions are set based on past experience and/or relevant industry data, market practice, regulations and expectations about future trends. 
Economic assumptions used in the measurement of fulfilment cash flows are market consistent.

Expenses and expense inflation
Insurance contract liabilities include an allowance for the best estimate of future expenses associated with the administration of in-force policies. 
This requires the allocation of the Group’s future expenses between those that relate to the administration of in-force policies, those attributable 
to the acquisition of new business and other costs, such as corporate costs. There is a level of judgement applied in the analysis that supports this 
allocation. Additionally, judgement is applied in the determination of the projected costs of the Group, in particular where those projections 
include the impact of transition and integration activity.

Expenses are assumed to increase at either the rate of increase in the Retail Price Index (‘RPI’), or a rate derived from the UK inflation swaps curve, 
plus fixed margins in accordance with the various management service agreements (‘MSAs’) the Group has in place with outsource partners. For 
with-profit business the rate of RPI inflation is determined within each stochastic scenario. For other business it is based on the Bank of England 
inflation spot curve. For MSAs with contractual increases set by reference to national average earnings inflation, this is approximated as RPI 
inflation or RPI inflation plus 1%. In instances in which inflation risk is not mitigated, appropriate margins are applied to reflect central 
expectations of earnings inflation in excess of RPI.

Mortality and longevity rates
Mortality rates are based on company experience and published tables, adjusted appropriately to take account of changes in the underlying 
population mortality since the table was published, company experience and forecast changes in future mortality. Where appropriate, a margin 
is added to assurance mortality rates to allow for adverse future deviations. Annuitant mortality rates are adjusted to make allowance for future 
improvements in pensioner longevity.

Lapse and surrender rates (persistency)
The assumed rates for surrender and voluntary premium discontinuance depend on the length of time a policy has been in force and the relevant 
company experience. Surrender or voluntary premium discontinuances are only assumed for realistic basis funds. Withdrawal rates used in the 
valuation of with-profit policies are based on observed experience and adjusted when it is considered that future policyholder behaviour will be 
influenced by different considerations than in the past. In particular, it is assumed that withdrawal rates for unitised with-profit contracts will be 
higher on policy anniversaries on which Market Value Adjustments do not apply.

Discretionary participating bonus rate
The regular bonus rates assumed in each scenario are determined in accordance with each company’s Principles and Practices of Financial 
Management (‘PPFM’). Final bonuses are assumed at a level such that maturity payments will equal asset shares subject to smoothing rules set out 
in the PPFM and the value of guaranteed benefits.

Policyholder options and guarantees
Some of the Group’s products give potentially valuable guarantees, or give options to change policy benefits which can be exercised at the 
policyholders’ discretion. These products are described below:

Most with-profit contracts give a guaranteed minimum payment on a specified date or range of dates or on death if before that date or dates. For 
pensions contracts, the specified date is the policyholder’s chosen retirement date or a range of dates around that date. For endowment 
contracts, it is the maturity date of the contract. For with-profit bonds it is often a specified anniversary of commencement, in some cases with 
further dates thereafter. Annual bonuses when added to with-profit contracts usually increase the guaranteed amount.

There are guaranteed surrender values on a small number of older contracts.

Some pensions contracts include guaranteed annuity options. The total amounts provided in the with-profit and non-profit funds in respect of 
the future costs of guaranteed annuity options are £860 million (2022: £922 million) and £61 million (2022: £61 million) respectively.

In common with other life companies in the UK which have written pension transfer and opt-out business, the Group has set up provisions for the 
review and possible redress relating to personal pension policies. These provisions, which have been calculated from data derived from detailed 
file reviews of specific cases and using a certainty equivalent approach, which give a result very similar to a market consistent valuation, are 
included in liabilities arising under insurance contracts. The total amount provided in the with-profit funds and non-profit funds in respect of the 
review and possible redress relating to pension policies, including associated costs, are £191 million (2022: £195 million) and £2 million (2022: 
£2 million) respectively.

With-profit deferred annuities participate in profits only up to the date of retirement. At retirement, a guaranteed cash option allows the 
policyholder to commute the annuity benefit into cash on guaranteed terms.

Assumption changes
During the year a number of changes were made to assumptions to reflect changes in expected experience. The impact of material changes 
during the year was as follows:

For insurance contracts:

Change in longevity assumptions
Change in persistency assumptions
Change in mortality assumptions
Change in expenses assumptions

For reinsurance contracts:

Change in longevity assumptions
Change in persistency assumptions
Change in mortality assumptions

F11.2.3 Other assumptions continued
Assumption changes continued
2023:
The £320 million net of reinsurance increase in CSM due to changes in longevity assumptions reflects updates to base and improvement 
assumptions to reflect latest experience analyses, including moving to the latest CMI model.

As well as annual persistency updates to reflect latest experience, assumption changes were made for late retirements and GAO take-up rates 
during the year. 

The £(87) million net of reinsurance decrease in CSM due to change in mortality assumptions is driven by changes in Europe & Other base 
mortality valuation assumptions.

The £(183) million net of reinsurance decrease in CSM and £(35) million net of reinsurance decrease in loss component are due to changes in 
expense assumptions is driven by an increase in reserves principally in respect of delivery of the Group Target Operating Model for IT and 
Operations included the migration of policyholder administration onto the Tata Consultancy Services (‘TCS’) platform together with Group 
expense provisions and an increase in modelled maintenance expenses assumptions. This is partly offset due to changes in modelled investment 
expenses and release of an investment manual.

2022:
The £117 million net of reinsurance increase in CSM due to changes in longevity assumptions reflects updates to base and improvement 
assumptions to reflect latest experience analyses. The £17 million gross increase in loss component is driven by longevity assumption changes on 
Phoenix BPA business.

Persistency assumptions have been updated to reflect latest experience analyses, leading to a £17 million impact on loss component.

The £87 million net of reinsurance increase in CSM due to changes in mortality assumptions is driven by changes in morbidity assumption for 
German morbidity riders.

The £(205) million net of reinsurance decrease in CSM and £59 million net of reinsurance increase in loss component due to changes in expense 
assumptions primarily reflects an increase in the anticipated costs associated with the implementation of IFRS 17 and the delivery of the Group 
Target Operating Model for IT and Operations.

£12,966 million (2022: £11,753 million) of liabilities are subject to longevity swap arrangements.

With-profit fund (unitised and traditional)
The Group operates a number of with-profit funds in which the with-profit policyholders benefit from a discretionary annual bonus (guaranteed 
once added in most cases) and a discretionary final bonus. Non-participating business is also written in some of the with-profit funds and some of 
the funds may include immediate annuities and deferred annuities with Guaranteed Annuity Rates (‘GAR’).

The investment strategy of each fund differs, but is broadly to invest in a mixture of fixed interest investments and equities and/or property and 
other asset classes in such proportions as is appropriate to the investment risk exposure of the fund and its capital resources.

The Group has significant discretion regarding investment policy, bonus policy and early termination values. The process for exercising 
discretion in the management of the with-profit funds is set out in the PPFM for each with-profit fund and is overseen by with-profit committees. 
Advice is also taken from the with-profit actuary of each with-profit fund. Compliance with the PPFM is reviewed annually and reported to the 
PRA, Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) and policyholders.

The bonuses are designed to distribute to policyholders a fair share of the return on the assets in the with-profit funds together with other 
elements of the experience of the fund. The shareholders of the Group are entitled to receive one-ninth of the cost of bonuses declared for 
some funds and £nil for others. For the Heritage With Profits Fund (‘HWPF’), under the Scheme of Demutualisation, shareholders are entitled to 
receive certain defined cash flows arising on specified blocks of UK and Irish business. 

Unitised and traditional with-profit policies are exposed to equivalent risks, the main difference being that unitised with-profit policies purchase 
notional units in a with-profit fund whereas traditional with-profit policies do not. Benefit payments for unitised policies are then dependent on 
unit prices at the time of a claim, although charges may be applied. A unitised with-profit fund price is typically guaranteed not to fall and 
increases in line with any discretionary bonus payments over the course of one year.

Deferred annuities
Deferred annuity policies are written to provide either a cash benefit at retirement, which the policyholder can use to buy an annuity on the terms 
then applicable, or an annuity payable from retirement. The policies contain an element of guarantee expressed in the form that the contract is 
written in, i.e. to provide cash or an annuity. Deferred annuity policies written to provide a cash benefit may also contain an option to convert the 
cash benefit to an annuity benefit on guaranteed terms; these are known as GAR policies. Deferred annuity policies written to provide an annuity 
benefit may also contain an option to convert the annuity benefit into cash benefits on guaranteed terms; these are known as Guaranteed Cash 
Option (‘GCO’) policies. In addition, certain unit prices in the HWPF are guaranteed not to decrease.

Long-term interest rates remain relatively low compared to historical levels and life expectancy has increased more rapidly than originally 
anticipated. The guaranteed terms on GAR policies are more favourable than the annuity rates currently available in the market available for cash 
benefits. The guaranteed terms on GCO policies are currently not valuable. Deferred annuity policies which are written to provide annuity 
benefits are managed in a similar manner to immediate annuities and are exposed to the same risks.

The option provisions on GAR policies are particularly sensitive to downward movements in interest rates, increasing life expectancy and the 
proportion of customers exercising their option. Adverse movements in these factors could lead to a requirement to increase reserves which 
could adversely impact profit and potentially require additional capital. In order to address the interest rate risk (but not the risk of increasing life 
expectancy or changing customer behaviour with regard to exercise of the option), insurance subsidiaries within the Group have purchased 
derivatives that provide protection against an increase in liabilities and have thus reduced the sensitivity of profit to movements in interest rates 
(see note E6.2.2).

The Group seeks to manage this risk in accordance with both the terms of the issued policies and the interests of customers, and has obtained 
external advice supporting the manner in which it operates the long-term funds in this respect.

Immediate annuities
This type of annuity is purchased with a single premium at the outset, and is paid to the policyholder for the remainder of their lifetime. Payments 
may also continue for the benefit of a surviving spouse or partner after the annuitant’s death. Annuities may be level, or escalate at a fixed rate, or 
may escalate in line with a price index and may be payable for a minimum period irrespective of whether the policyholder remains alive.

The main risks associated with this product are longevity and investment risks. Longevity risk arises where the annuities are paid for the lifetime of 
the policyholder, and is managed through the initial pricing of the annuity and through reinsurance (appropriately collateralised) or transfer of 
existing liabilities. Annuities may also be a partial ‘natural hedge’ against losses incurred in protection business in the event of increased mortality 
(and vice versa) although the extent to which this occurs will depend on the similarity of the demographic profile of each book of business. In 
addition, the Group has in place longevity swaps that provide downside protection over longevity risk. 

The pricing assumption for mortality risk is based on both historic internal information and externally-generated information on mortality 
experience, including allowances for future mortality improvements. Pricing will also include a contingency margin for adverse deviations 
in assumptions.

Market and credit risk is influenced by the extent to which the cash flows under the contracts have been matched by suitable assets which is 
managed under the ALM framework. Asset/liability modelling is used to monitor this position on a regular basis.

Protection
These contracts are typically secured by the payment of a regular premium payable for a period of years providing benefits payable on certain 
events occurring within the period. The benefits may be a single lump sum or a series of payments and may be payable on death, serious 
illness or sickness.

The main risk associated with this product is the claims experience and this risk is managed through the initial pricing of the policy (based 
on actuarial principles), the use of reinsurance and a clear process for administering claims.

Market and credit risk is influenced by the extent to which the cash flows under the contracts have been matched by suitable assets which is 
managed under the ALM framework. Asset/liability modelling is used to monitor this position on a regular basis.

G. Other statement of consolidated financial position notes
G1. Pension schemes

Defined contribution pension schemes
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income 
statement as incurred.

Defined benefit pension schemes
The net surplus or deficit (the economic surplus or deficit) in respect of the defined benefit pension schemes is calculated by estimating the 
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years; that benefit is discounted to 
determine its present value and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted. 

The economic surplus or deficit is subsequently adjusted to eliminate on consolidation the carrying value of insurance policies issued by 
Group entities to the defined benefit pension schemes (the reported surplus or deficit). A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying 
values of insurance contract liabilities and investment contract liabilities.

As required by IFRIC 14, IAS 19 –‘The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’, to the extent that 
the economic surplus (prior to the elimination of the insurance policies issued by Group entities) will be available as a refund, the economic 
surplus is stated after a provision for tax that would be borne by the scheme administrators when the refund is made. The Group recognises a 
pension surplus on the basis that it is entitled to the surplus of each scheme in the event of a gradual settlement of the liabilities, due to its 
ability to order a winding up of the Trust.

Additionally under IFRIC 14 pension funding contributions are considered to be a minimum funding requirement and, to the extent that the 
contributions payable will not be available to the Group after they are paid into the Scheme, a liability is recognised when the obligation arises. 
The net pension scheme asset/liability represents the economic surplus net of all adjustments noted above.

The Group determines the net interest expense or income on the net pension scheme asset/liability for the period by applying the discount 
rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the opening net pension scheme asset/liability. 
The discount rate is the yield at the period end on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s 
obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

The movement in the net pension scheme asset/liability is analysed between the service cost, past service cost, curtailments and settlements 
(all recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement), the net interest cost on the net pension scheme asset/
liability, including any reimbursement assets (recognised within net investment income in the consolidated income statement), 
remeasurements of the net pension scheme asset/liability (recognised in other comprehensive income) and employer contributions.

This note describes the Group’s five main defined benefit pension schemes for its employees, the Pearl Group Staff Pension Scheme (‘Pearl 
Scheme’), the PGL Pension Scheme, the Abbey Life Staff Pension Scheme (‘Abbey Life Scheme’) the ReAssure Staff Pension Scheme (‘ReAssure 
Scheme’) and from 3 April 2023, the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada 1988 UK and Irish Employee Benefits Scheme (‘Sun Life of Canada 
Scheme’), and explains how the pension scheme asset/liability is calculated.

1  The Pearl Scheme and the PGL Pension Scheme have both executed buy-in transactions with a Group life company and subsequently assets supporting the Group’s actuarial liabilities are recognised 

on a line-by-line basis within financial assets in the statement of consolidated financial position. Further details are included in notes G1.1 and G1.2 below. 

In the current and prior periods an adjusted net pension scheme asset has been presented in relation to both these pension schemes. The value of the assets held by PLL within financial assets in 
respect of the PGL Pension Scheme buy-ins is equal to the assets posted to a ring-fenced collateral account. For the Pearl Scheme the assets held by PLL supporting the buy-ins are not ring-fenced 
and the value has been determined as the value of the insurance contract liability within the PLL financial statements less the value of the associated reinsurance asset.

  Movements in these financial assets are reflected in the consolidated income statement within net investment income, however as noted in the accounting policy, the movement in the net pension 

scheme liability (as shown in notes G1.1 and G1.2) is primarily reflected in other comprehensive income. 

Risks
The Group’s defined benefit schemes typically expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are:

Asset volatility – the value of the schemes’ assets will vary as market conditions change and as such is subject to considerable volatility. The 
liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will create a 
deficit. The majority of the assets are held within a liability driven investment strategy which is linked to the funding basis of the schemes (set with 
reference to government bond yields). As such, to the extent that movements in corporate bond yields are out of line with movements in 
government bond yields, volatility will arise.

Inflation risk – a significant proportion of the schemes’ benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities 
(although in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are 
held within a liability driven investment strategy which allows for movements in inflation, meaning that changes in inflation should not materially 
affect the surplus.

Life expectancy – the majority of the schemes’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member therefore increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities. For the Pearl and PGL schemes, this is largely offset by the buy-in policies that move in line 
with the liabilities. These buy-in policies are eliminated on consolidation (see notes G1.1 and G1.2 for further details).

A High Court legal ruling in June 2023 (Virgin Media Limited v NTL Pension Trustees II Limited) decided that certain rule amendments were 
invalid if they were not accompanied by the correct actuarial confirmation. While the ruling only applied to the specific pension scheme in 
question, if it stands it will form part of case law and can therefore be expected to apply across other pension schemes. The ruling is subject to 
appeal and it may take some time for the outcome of the appeal to be known. The Group has not assessed the extent of any likely impacts from 
this ruling and considers that there is sufficient uncertainty not to warrant recognition of any potential obligation in respect of this in the 
consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023. Any subsequent developments following this ruling will be monitored 
by the Group.

Information on each of the Group’s pension schemes is set out below.

G1.1 Pearl Group Staff Pension Scheme
Scheme details
The Pearl Scheme comprises a final salary section, a money purchase section and a hybrid section (a mix of final salary and money purchase). The 
Pearl Scheme is closed to new members and has no active members.

Defined benefit scheme
The Pearl Scheme is established under, and governed by, the trust deeds and rules and has been funded by payment of contributions to a 
separately administered trust fund. A Group company, Pearl Life Holdings Limited (‘PeLHL’), is from 1 October 2023 the principal employer of 
the Pearl Scheme (previously Pearl Group Holdings No.2 Limited (‘PGH2’)). PeLHL assumed the Scheme covenant together with all obligations 
of the Scheme following the transfer.

The principal employer meets the administration expenses of the Pearl Scheme. The Pearl Scheme is administered by a separate trustee 
company, P.A.T. (Pensions) Limited, which is separate from PeLHL. The trustee company is comprised of three representatives from the Group, 
three member nominated representatives and one independent trustee in accordance with the trustee company’s articles of association. The 
trustee is required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets.

The valuation has been based on an assessment of the liabilities of the Pearl Scheme as at 31 December 2023, undertaken by independent 
qualified actuaries. The present values of the defined benefit obligation and the related interest costs have been measured using the projected 
unit credit method.

A triennial funding valuation of the Pearl Scheme as at 30 June 2021 was completed in 2022 by a qualified actuary. This showed a surplus as at 
30 June 2021 of £67 million, on the agreed technical provisions basis. The funding and IFRS accounting bases of valuation can give rise to 
different results for a number of reasons. The funding basis of valuation is based on general principles of prudence whereas the accounting 
valuation is based on best estimates. Discount rates are gilt-based for the funding valuation whereas the rate used for IFRS valuation purposes is 
based on a yield curve for high quality AA-rated corporate bonds. In addition the values are prepared at different dates which will result in 
differences arising from changes in market conditions and employer contributions made in the subsequent period.

Pension Scheme Commitment Agreement and buy-in transactions
On 17 November 2020, the Pearl Scheme entered into a Commitment Agreement with PGH2 to complete a series of buy-ins. At the same time, 
the Pearl Scheme completed the first buy-in with Phoenix Life Limited (‘PLL’) covering 25% of the Scheme’s pensioner and deferred member 
liabilities, transferring the associated risks, including longevity improvement risk, to PLL effective from 30 September 2020.

Two further buy-in transactions were completed in July 2021 and October 2021 covering 35% and 15% respectively of the Scheme’s pensioner 
and deferred member liabilities and the final buy-in transaction was completed in November 2022. Risks, including longevity improvement risk, 
were transferred to PLL effective from 28 May 2021 and 31 August 2021 and 30 September 2022 respectively.

G. Other statement of consolidated financial position notes continued
G1.1 Pearl Group Staff Pension Scheme continued
Pension Scheme Commitment Agreement and buy-in transactions continued
Upon completion of each buy-in transaction the Scheme transferred the following plan assets to PLL:

• 

• 

• 

• 

In November 2020, £731 million of plan assets were transferred to PLL in satisfaction of the premium of £735 million and was net of a £4 million 
payment by PLL to the Scheme in respect of members’ benefits for October and November 2020.
In July 2021, £1,049 million of plan assets were transferred to PLL in satisfaction of the premium and a further £12 million cash payment was 
paid by the Scheme in August 2021. PLL paid £5 million to the Scheme in respect of members’ benefits for June and July 2021; and
In October 2021, £433 million of plan assets were transferred to PLL in satisfaction of the premium of £435 million and was net of a £2 million 
payment by PLL to the Scheme in respect of members’ benefits for September and October 2021. A further £1 million cash payment in respect 
of the premium was paid by the Scheme in December 2021.
In November 2022, £556 million of plan assets were transferred to PLL in satisfaction of the premium of £560 million and was net of a 
£4 million payment by PLL to the Scheme in respect of members’ benefits for October and November 2022.

The assets transferred to PLL are recognised in the relevant line within financial assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. The 
economic effect of the buy-in transactions in the Scheme is to replace the plan assets transferred with a single line insurance policy 
reimbursement right asset which is subsequently eliminated on consolidation. The value of this insurance policy at 31 December 2023 was 
£1,507 million (2022: £1,501 million) which includes an amount owed by PLL of £nil million (2022: £2 million).

The Commitment agreement contained provisions under which payments by PGH2 to the Scheme were required in the event that the Group 
did not meet the minimum buy-in completion schedule. Following completion of the last buy-in transaction in 2022 the Group no longer has an 
obligation to pay gilts deficit recovery contributions.

The new agreement also introduced a new form of security provided by PGH2 to the trustee. The share charges over certain Group entities were 
replaced by a new surety bond arrangement, whereby two external third-party insurers, each provided £100 million of cover payable to the 
Scheme following certain trigger events. This cover provided by the surety bond guarantee was fully released upon completion of the final 
buy-in transaction in November 2022.

No contributions were paid to the Pearl Scheme in either the current or prior period. PeLHL meets the administrative and non-investment 
running expenses of the Scheme as set out in the schedule of contributions (PGH2 prior to 1 October 2023).

During 2022, the Company reached an agreement for the removal of a trustee discretion to pay some pension increases in excess of the 5% cap. 
The trustee agreed to give up this discretion in exchange for a single 1.6% uplift for current pensions in payment effective from 1 April 2022 and 
a 1.3% increase to eligible benefits of both pension and deferred members effective from 1 April 2023. In the current period, the financial impact 
of the 1.3% uplift has been to recognise an increase in the defined benefit obligation of £12 million and a past service cost in the consolidated 
income statement (at 31 December 2022, the financial impact of the 1.6% uplift was £15 million).

Reimbursement right asset in respect of Reinsurance arrangement
In March 2022, PLL entered into a quota share reinsurance arrangement with an external insurer to reinsure a further 27% of the risks transferred 
to PLL as part of the third buy-in transaction with the Pearl Scheme. A total of approximately 91% of these liabilities have now been reinsured. A 
premium of £104 million was paid by PLL to the reinsurer. As PLL expects to use the claims received to pay for its obligations under the insurance 
contract between it and the Pearl Scheme (i.e. to settle the defined benefit obligation) the reinsurance arrangement is considered to be a 
non-qualifying insurance policy and is classified as a reimbursement right. The reinsurance arrangement is expected to match a proportion of 
the defined benefit obligation of the Pearl Scheme therefore the valuation of the reimbursement right is consistent with the valuation of the 
associated defined benefit obligation. The value of the reimbursement right asset amounted to £202 million (31 December 2022: £205 million).

Defined benefit obligation
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation can be allocated to the scheme’s members as follows:

•  Deferred scheme members: 33% (2022: 40%); and
•  Pensioners: 67% (2022: 60%)

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2023 is 13.5 years (2022: 13.5 years).

Principal assumptions
The principal financial assumptions of the Pearl Scheme are set out in the table below:

Rate of increase for pensions in payment (5% per annum or RPI if lower)
Rate of increase for deferred pensions ('CPI')
Discount rate
Inflation – RPI
Inflation – CPI

2023

2022 
%
3.05
2.70
4.95
3.30

The discount rate and inflation rate assumptions have been determined by considering the shape of the appropriate yield curves and the 
duration of the Pearl Scheme’s liabilities. This method determines an equivalent single rate for each of the discount and inflation rates, which is 
derived from the profile of projected benefit payments.

G1.1 Pearl Group Staff Pension Scheme continued
Principal assumptions continued
The post-retirement mortality assumptions are in line with a scheme-specific table which was derived from the actual mortality experience in 
recent years based on the SAPS standard tables for males and for females based on year of use. Future longevity improvements from 1 January 
2021 are based on amended CMI 2022 Core Projections (2022: From 1 January 2021 based on amended CMI 2021 Core Projections) and a 
long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% (2022: 1.5%) per annum for males and 1.2% (2022: 1.2%) per annum for females. Under these assumptions, 
the average life expectancy from retirement for a member currently aged 40 retiring at age 60 is 29.0 years and 30.3 years for male and female 
members respectively (2022: 29.2 years and 30.5 years respectively).

A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant actuarial assumptions is shown below:

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to 
occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to 
significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension asset recognised within the statement of 
consolidated financial position.

G1.2 PGL Pension Scheme
The PGL Pension Scheme comprises a final salary section and a defined contribution section.

Scheme details
Defined contribution scheme
On 1 July 2020 the Group closed the defined contribution section of the PGL Scheme and ceased making contributions from this date. 

Defined benefit scheme
The defined benefit section of the PGL Pension Scheme is a final salary arrangement which is closed to new entrants and has no active members.

The PGL Scheme is administered by a separate trustee company, PGL Pension Trustee Ltd. The trustee company is comprised of two 
representatives from the Group, three member nominated representatives and one independent trustee in accordance with the trustee 
company’s articles of association. The trustee is required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and is responsible for the day to 
day administration of the benefits. 

The valuation has been based on an assessment of the liabilities of the PGL Pension Scheme as at 31 December 2023, undertaken by 
independent qualified actuaries.

To the extent that an economic surplus will be available as a refund, the economic surplus is stated after a provision for tax that would be borne 
by the scheme administrators when the refund is made. 

A triennial funding valuation of the PGL Pension Scheme as at 30 June 2021 was completed in 2022 by a qualified actuary. This showed a 
surplus as at 30 June 2021 of £2 million. The IFRS valuation cash flows reflect the latest available data and are not limited to being updated 
following the completion of each funding valuation.

There are no further committed contributions to pay in respect of the defined benefit section of the Scheme. 

Insurance policies with Group entities
In March 2019, the PGL Pension Scheme entered into a buy-in agreement with PLL which covered the remaining pensioner and deferred 
members of the Scheme not covered by the first such agreement concluded in December 2016. The plan assets transferred to PLL as premium 
are held in a collateral account and are recognised in the relevant line within financial assets in the statement of consolidated financial position. 
The economic effect of these transactions in the Scheme is to replace the plan assets transferred with a single line insurance policy 
reimbursement asset which is eliminated on consolidation along with the relevant insurance contract liabilities in PLL.

The value of the insurance policies with Group entities at 31 December 2023 is £1,093 million (2022: £1,079 million).

During the year, £18 million of scheme assets were transferred to PLL as premium for the buy-out transaction which completed in January 2024. 
A debtor of £18 million, to reflect the prepayment of this premium at 31 December 2023 (2022: £nil), has been eliminated on consolidation. 
Further details of this transaction are included in note I7.

Defined benefit obligation
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation can be allocated to the scheme’s members as follows:

•  Deferred scheme members: 36% (2022: 36%); and
•  Pensioners: 64% (2022: 64%)

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2023 is 13.5 years (2022: 13.5 years).

G1.2 PGL Pension Scheme continued
Principal assumptions
The principal financial assumptions of the PGL Pension Scheme are set out in the table below:

Rate of increase for pensions in payment (7.5% per annum or RPI if lower)
Rate of increase for deferred pensions ('CPI')
Discount rate
Inflation – RPI
Inflation – CPI

3.10
2.60

2022 
%
3.30
2.70
4.95
3.30
2.70

The discount rate and inflation assumptions have been determined by considering the shape of the appropriate yield curves and the duration of 
the PGL Pension Scheme liabilities. This method determines an equivalent single rate for each of the discount and inflation rates, which is derived 
from the profile of projected benefit payments.

The post-retirement mortality assumptions are in line with 86%/94% of S1P Light base tables for males and females. Future longevity 
improvements from 1 January 2021 are based on amended CMI 2022 Core Projections (2022: From 1 January 2021 based on amended CMI 
2021 Core Projections) with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% (2022: 1.5%) per annum for males and 1.2% (2022: 1.2%) per annum for 
females. Under these assumptions, the average life expectancy from retirement for a member currently aged 40 retiring at age 62 is 27.4 years 
(2022: 27.7 years) and 28.8 years (2022: 29.1 years) for male and female members respectively.

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to 
occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to 
significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of 
consolidated financial position.

G1.3 Abbey Life Staff Pension Scheme
Scheme details
On 30 June 2017, the Abbey Life Scheme was transferred from Abbey Life to PeLHL, a fellow subsidiary. PeLHL assumed the scheme covenant 
together with all obligations of the scheme following implementation of the transfer. The Abbey Life Scheme is a registered occupational 
pension scheme, set up under trust, and legally separate from the employer PeLHL. The scheme is administered by Abbey Life Trust Securities 
Limited (the trustee), a corporate trustee. There are three trustee directors, one of whom is nominated by the Abbey Life Scheme members and 
two of whom are appointed by PeLHL. The trustee is responsible for administering the scheme in accordance with the trust deed and rules and 
pensions laws and regulations. The Abbey Life Scheme is closed to new entrants and has no active members.

The valuation has been based on an assessment of the liabilities of the Abbey Life Scheme as at 31 December 2023 undertaken by independent 
qualified actuaries. The present values of the defined benefit obligation and the related interest costs have been measured using the projected 
unit credit method.

Funding
The last funding valuation of the Abbey Life Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2021 and showed a deficit of 
£86 million. Following completion of the funding valuation a recovery plan was agreed between the Group and the trustee of the Abbey Life 
Scheme for PeLHL to pay monthly contributions of £400,000 into the Scheme until 31 July 2025 to eliminate the funding shortfall. In addition, 
the entire balance of the 2013 Charged Account of £42 million was paid to the Scheme in December 2021.

A new schedule of contributions was agreed effective from November 2021, for PeLHL to pay the following amounts in respect of deficit 
contributions in addition to the amounts payable under the recovery plan:

•  fixed monthly contributions of £400,000 payable from 1 August 2025 to 30 June 2026;
•  monthly contributions in respect of administration expenses of £106,295 payable up to 31 March 2022, then increasing annually in line with 

the Retail Prices Index assumption to 30 June 2028; and

•  annual payments of £4 million into the New 2016 Charged Account by 31 July each year, with the next payment being made on 31 July 2022, 

and the last payment due by 31 July 2025.

The charged account is an Escrow account which was created to provide the trustees with additional security in light of the funding deficit. 
The amounts held in the charged account does not form part of Abbey Life Scheme assets.

Under the terms of the New 2016 Funding Agreement the funding position of the Abbey Life Scheme will be assessed as at 31 March 2027. 
A payment will be made from the New 2016 Charged Account to the Scheme if the results of the assessment reveal a shortfall calculated in 
accordance with the terms of the New 2016 Funding Agreement. The amount of the payment will be the lower of the amount of the shortfall and 
the amount held in the New 2016 Charged Account.

An additional liability of £2 million (2022: £3 million) has been recognised reflecting a charge on any refund of the resultant IAS 19 surplus that 
arises after adjustment for discounted future contributions of £11 million (2022: £15 million) in accordance with the minimum funding requirement. 
A deferred tax asset of £3 million (2022: £3 million) has also been recognised to reflect tax relief at a rate of 25% that is expected to be available 
on the contributions once paid into the Scheme.

The post-retirement mortality assumptions are in line with a scheme-specific table which was derived from the actual mortality experience in 
recent years, performed as part of the actuarial funding valuation as at 31 March 2021, using the SAPS S3 ‘Light’ tables for males and for females 
based on year of use. Future longevity improvements from 1 January 2021 are based on amended CMI 2022 Core Projections (2022: From 
1 January 2021 based on amended CMI 2021 Core Projections) and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% (2022: 1.5%) per annum for males 
and 1.2% (2022: 1.2%) per annum for females. Under these assumptions the average life expectancy from retirement for a member currently 
aged 45 retiring at age 65 is 24.5 years and 25.6 years for male and female members respectively (2022: 24.8 years and 25.9 years respectively).

G1.4 ReAssure Life Staff Pension Scheme
Scheme details
The ReAssure Scheme is a registered occupational pension scheme, set up under trust, and legally separate from the employer ReAssure Midco 
Limited (‘RML’). The scheme is administered by ReAssure Pension Trustees Limited, a corporate trustee. There are six trustee directors, two of 
whom are nominated by the ReAssure Scheme members and four of whom are appointed by RML. The trustee is responsible for administering 
the scheme in accordance with the trust deed and rules and pensions laws and regulations. The ReAssure Scheme is closed to new entrants and 
to future accrual for active members.

The valuation has been based on an assessment of the liabilities of the ReAssure Scheme as at 31 December 2023 undertaken by independent 
qualified actuaries. The present values of the defined benefit obligation and the related interest costs have been measured using the projected 
unit credit method.

Funding
The last funding valuation of the ReAssure Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 December 2020 and showed a deficit 
of £77 million.

Following the completion of the 2020 valuation a recovery plan was agreed in September 2021 between the trustee and RML in order to make 
good the deficit. RML agreed to pay contributions of £17.7 million into the existing Custody Account spread over four annual payments of 
£4.425 million payable on 1 April 2022, 1 April 2023, 1 April 2024 and 1 April 2025. It is anticipated that these payments will be sufficient to cover 
the difference between the funding shortfall and the balance of the Custody Account at 31 December 2020 and to remove any remaining 
deficit at 31 December 2025. 

The amounts held in this account do not form part of the Scheme’s plan assets and are instead held in the Custody Account and are included 
within financial assets in the statement of consolidated financial position. 

The Group agrees to cover those expenses incurred by the ReAssure Scheme and the cost of the death-in-service benefits for those members of 
the scheme entitled to those benefits. Payments of £2 million (2022:£2 million) have been made during the year to cover these costs.

Defined benefit obligation
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation can be allocated to the ReAssure Scheme’s members as follows:

•  Deferred scheme members: 66% (2022: 66%); and
•  Pensioners: 34% (2022: 34%)

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2023 is 17 years (2022: 17 years).

Principal assumptions 
The principal assumptions of the ReAssure Scheme are set out in the table below:

the ReAssure Scheme liabilities. This method determines an equivalent single rate for each of the discount and inflation rates, which is derived 
from the profile of projected benefit payments. 

The post-retirement mortality assumptions are in line with SAPS Series 3 light base tables with a 102% (2022: 102%) multiplier for males and a 
95% (2022: 95%) multiplier for females, with CMI 2019 projections in line with a 1.5% pa long-term trend up to and including 31 December 2020. 
Future longevity improvements from 1 January 2021 onwards are in line with amended CMI 2022 Core Projections (2022: from 1 January 2021 in 
line with amended CMI 2021 Core Projections) with a long-term trend of 1.5% pa (2022: 1.5%) for males and 1.2% (2022: 1.2%) for females.

Under these assumptions the average life expectancy from retirement for a member currently aged 45 retiring at age 60 is 29.7 years and 31.3 
years for male and female members respectively (2022: 30.0 years and 31.6 years for male and female members respectively).

G1.5 Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada 1988 UK and Irish Employee Benefits scheme
Scheme details
The Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada 1988 UK and Irish Employee Benefits scheme (‘Sun Life of Canada Scheme’) was consolidated 
within the Group financial statements following the acquisition of the Sun Life businesses on 3 April 2023. The Sun Life of Canada Scheme is a 
registered occupational pension scheme, set up under trust, and legally separate from the principal employer Sun Life Assurance Company of 
Canada (U.K.) Limited. The Scheme is administered by a specialist third party administrator, Hymans Robertson LLP. A Trustee Board is 
responsible for ensuring the Scheme is run in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules and for ensuring compliance with legislation although 
certain tasks are delegated to third parties. The Trustee Board is made up of three Trustees; an Independent Trustee who is also the Chair, a 
Principal Employer appointed Trustee and a Member-Nominated Trustee. The Independent Trustee is Capital Cranfield Pension Trustees 
Limited. The Sun Life of Canada Scheme is closed to new entrants and to future accrual for active members.

The valuation has been based on an assessment of the liabilities of the Sun Life of Canada Scheme as at 31 December 2023 undertaken by 
independent qualified actuaries. The present values of the defined benefit obligation and the related interest costs have been measured using 
the projected unit credit method.

The economic surplus of the Scheme is anticipated to be used to cover future costs of the Scheme and will be fully utilised prior to any winding-
up of the Scheme. As a result, no provision for tax is deducted from the surplus.

Funding
The last funding valuation of the Sun Life of Canada Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 December 2022 and showed a 
surplus of £6 million. No contributions are required to be paid by the employer into the Scheme.

Defined benefit obligation
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation can be allocated to the Sun Life of Canada Scheme’s members as follows:

•  Deferred scheme members: 40%; and
•  Pensioners: 60%.

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2023 is 12.8 years.

Principal assumptions 
The principal assumptions of the Sun Life of Canada Scheme are set out in the table below:

Rate of increase for pensions in payment
Rate of increase for deferred pensions
Discount rate
Inflation – RPI
Inflation – CPI

2023
%
3.05
2.15
4.60
3.10
2.30

The discount rate and inflation assumptions have been determined by considering the shape of the appropriate yield curves and the duration of 
the Sun Life of Canada Scheme liabilities. This method determines an equivalent single rate for each of the discount and inflation rates, 
which is derived from the profile of projected benefit payments. 

The post-retirement mortality assumptions are in line with 2022 VITA Lite tables. Future longevity improvements are in line with the 2022 CMI 
model with no weight on 2020 and 2021 experience and 25% weighting on 2022 experience, with a long-term trend of 1.5% p.a. for males and 
1.5% p.a. for females.

Under these assumptions the average life expectancy from retirement for a member currently aged 45 retiring at age 65 is 23.1 years and 26.1 
years for male and female members respectively. 

A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant actuarial assumptions is shown below:

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to 
occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to 
significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of 
consolidated financial position.

G2. Intangible assets

Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the 
acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.

Goodwill is measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually or when there is evidence of possible impairment. For impairment 
testing, goodwill is allocated to relevant cash generating units. Goodwill is impaired when the recoverable amount is less than the 
carrying value.

In certain acquisitions an excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities, contingent 
liabilities and non-controlling interests over cost may arise. Where this occurs, the surplus of the fair value of net assets acquired over the fair 
value of the consideration is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Acquired in-force business
Investment contracts without DPF acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers are measured at fair value at the time of 
acquisition. The difference between the fair value of the contractual rights acquired and obligations assumed and the liability measured at fair 
value which is determined using a valuation technique to provide a reliable estimate of the amount for which the liability could be transferred 
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, subject to a minimum equal to the surrender value. This 
acquired in-force business is amortised on a diminishing balance basis. 

An impairment review is performed whenever there is an indication of impairment. When the recoverable amount is less than the carrying 
value, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. 

The acquired in-force business is allocated to relevant cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing.

Brands 
Brands are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is the fair value as at the 
date of the acquisition. The cost of an intangible asset acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset is measured at fair value as at the date of 
the transaction. Following initial recognition, the brand and other contractual arrangement intangible assets are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of brands over their estimated useful lives. They are tested for 
impairment whenever there is evidence of possible impairment. For impairment testing, they are allocated to the relevant cash generating unit. 
Brands are impaired when the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value.

1   Prior period comparatives have been restated on transition to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (see note A2.1 for further details).

G2.1 Goodwill
The carrying value of goodwill has been tested for impairment at the year end and the results of this exercise are detailed below. 

Goodwill with a carrying value of £10 million (2022: £10 million) was recognised on the acquisition of AXA Wealth during 2016 and has been 
allocated to the Pensions & Savings and Europe & Other segments. This represents the value of the workforce assumed and the potential for 
future value creation, which relates to the ability to invest in and grow the SunLife brand. Value in use has been determined as the present value 
of certain future cash flows associated with that business. The cash flows used in the calculation are consistent with those adopted by 
management in the Group’s operating plan, and for the period 2028 and beyond, assume a zero growth rate. The underlying assumptions of 
these projections include market share, customer numbers, commission rates and expense inflation. The cash flows have been valued at a risk 
adjusted discount rate of 14% (2022: 14%) that makes prudent allowance for the risk that future cash flows may differ from that assumed. 

This test demonstrated that value in use was greater than carrying value. Given the magnitude of the excess of the value in use over carrying 
value, management does not believe that a reasonably foreseeable change in key assumptions would cause the carrying value to exceed 
value in use.

G2.2 Acquired in-force business
Acquired in-force business (‘AVIF’) on investment contracts without DPF represents the difference between the fair value of the contractual 
rights under these contracts and the liability measured at fair value which is determined using a valuation technique to provide a reliable estimate 
of the amount for which the liability could be transferred in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, subject 
to a minimum equal to the surrender value. AVIF on these investment contracts is amortised in line with emergence of economic benefits over 
their expected term. AVIF balances are assessed for impairment where an indicator of impairment has been identified.

AVIF of £16 million was recognised during the year upon acquisition of SLF of Canada UK Limited. Further details are included in note H2.

On 23 February 2021, the Group entered into an agreement with abrdn plc to simplify the arrangements of their Strategic Partnership. Under 
the terms of the transaction, the Group will sell its UK investment and platform related products, comprising Wrap SIPP, Onshore bond and UK 
TIP to abrdn plc and this will be effected through a Part VII transfer. Since 2021, the balances in the statement of consolidated financial position 
relating to this business have been classified as a disposal group held for sale.

The total proceeds of disposal for this business were not expected to exceed the carrying value of the related net assets and accordingly the 
disposal group was recognised at fair value less costs to sell. The value of the AVIF at 23 February 2021, which relates to the SIPP and Onshore 
business, was £122 million and an impairment charge of £67 million was recognised in 2021. A further impairment of £28 million has been 
recognised during the year (2022: £17 million). The AVIF balance classified as held for sale has not been amortised up to 31 December 2023.

As at 31 December 2023, the insured funds element of the Wrap SIPP and Onshore Bond businesses will no longer transfer to abrdn (see note 
H3 for further details). As a result, this business no longer meets the requirements to be classified as held for sale. Consequently, the AVIF, which 
has a carrying value of £9 million at 31 December 2023, will be classified within the AVIF line in the consolidated statement of financial position. 
The AVIF will be amortised in line with the transfer of the economic risk and rewards for this business to abrdn plc via the profit 
transfer arrangement.

G2.3 Brands
An intangible asset was recognised at cost on acquisition of AXA Wealth and represents the value attributable to the SunLife brand as at 
1 November 2016. The intangible asset was valued on a ‘multi-period excess earnings’ basis and was recognised at a cost of £20 million. 
Impairment testing was performed in a combined test with the AXA goodwill (see section G2.1). The value in use continues to exceed its carrying 
value. This brand intangible is being amortised over a 10 year period. The carrying value of the AXA Wealth brand as at 31 December 2023 is 
£6 million (2022: £8 million).

On 23 February 2021, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire ownership of the Standard Life brand as part of a larger transaction with 
abrdn plc, which transferred to the Group in May 2021. The Standard Life brand was initially recognised at a value of £111 million which 
represented the fair value attributable to the brand as at the transaction date. The intangible asset was valued on a ‘multi-period excess earnings’ 
basis and is being amortised over a period of 30 years. The carrying value of the Standard Life brand as at 31 December 2023 is £100 million 
(2022: £104 million).

G3. Property, plant and equipment

Owner-occupied property is stated at its revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated 
depreciation and impairment. Owner-occupied property is depreciated over its estimated useful life, which is taken as 20 – 50 years. Land is 
not depreciated. Accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the owner-occupied 
property and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Gains and losses on owner-occupied property are recognised in 
other comprehensive income. 

The right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairments, and 
adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the remaining lease term which is 
between 1 and 11 years (2022: 1 and 11 years).

Equipment consists primarily of computer equipment and fittings. Equipment is stated at historical cost less deprecation. Where acquired in a 
business combination, historical cost equates to the fair value at the acquisition date. Depreciation on equipment is charged to the 
consolidated income statement over its estimated useful life of between 2 and 15 years.

Owner-occupied properties have been valued by accredited independent valuers at 31 December 2023 on an open market basis in accordance 
with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ requirements, which is deemed to equate to fair value. The fair value measurement for the 
properties of £28 million (2022: £32 million) has been categorised as Level 3 based on the non-observable inputs to the valuation technique 
used. Unrealised loss for the current year is £5 million (2022: £6 million).

The fair value of the owner-occupied properties was derived using the investment method supported by comparison with similar market 
transactions for similar properties. The significant non-observable inputs used in the valuations are the expected rental values per square foot 
and the capitalisation rates.

The fair value of the owner-occupied properties valuation would increase (decrease) if the expected rental values per square foot were to be 
higher (lower) and the capitalisation rates were to be lower (higher).

G4. Investment property

Investment property, including right of use assets, is initially recognised at cost, including any directly attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequently investment property is measured at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell a property in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is determined without any deduction for transaction costs that 
may be incurred on sale or disposal. Gains and losses arising from the change in fair value are recognised as income or an expense in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 

Investment property includes right-of-use assets, where the Group acts as lessee. Leases, where a significant portion of the risks and rewards 
of ownership are retained by the lessor, are classified as operating leases. Where investment property is leased out by the Group, rental 
income from these operating leases is recognised as income in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the period 
of the lease.

As at 31 December 2023, a property portfolio including amounts classified held for sale of £5,621 million (2022: £6,070 million) is held by the life 
companies in a mix of commercial sectors, spread geographically throughout the UK and Europe.

Investment properties also includes £42 million (2022: £62 million) of property reversions arising from sales of the NPI Extra Income Plan (see 
note E5 for further details) and £64 million (2022: £80 million) from the Group’s interest in the residential property of policyholders who have 
previously entered into an Equity Release Income Plan (‘ERIP’) policy.

Certain investment properties held by the life companies possess a ground rent obligation which gives rise to both a right-of-use asset and a 
lease liability. The right-of-use asset associated with the ground rent obligation is valued at fair value and is included within the total investment 
property valuation. The value of the ground rent right-of-use asset as at 31 December 2023 was £15 million (2022: £21 million). The 
remeasurement resulted in no change in value of the ground rent right-of-use asset (2022: increase of £2 million). There were no additions (2022: 
£2 million) and £6 million disposals (2022: £4 million) of ground rent right-of-use assets during the period.

G4. Investment property continued
Commercial investment property is measured at fair value by independent property valuers having appropriate recognised professional 
qualifications and recent experiences in the location and category of the property being valued. The valuations are carried out in accordance 
with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (‘RICS’) guidelines with expected income and capitalisation rate as the key non-observable inputs.

The NPI residential property reversions, an interest in customers’ properties which the Group will realise upon their death, are valued using 
a discounted cash flow model based on the Group’s proportion of the current open market value, and discounted for the expected lifetime of 
the policyholder derived from published mortality tables, the mortality rates are 130% for both males and females based on the IFL92C15 table 
for males and the IML92C15 table for females. The open market value is measured by independent local property surveyors having appropriate 
recognised professional qualifications with reference to the assumed condition of the property and local market conditions. The individual 
properties are valued triennially and indexed using regional house price indices to the year end date. The discount rate is a 3 year swap rate plus 
1.7% margin (2022: 3 year swap rate plus 1.7% margin), and adjusted for the deferred possession rate of 3.7% (2022: 3.7%). Assumptions are also 
made in the valuation for future movements in property prices, based on a risk free rate. The residential property reversions have been 
substantially refinanced under the arrangements with Santander as described in note E5. 

The ERIP residential property reversions, an interest in the residential property of policyholders who have previously entered into an ERIP policy 
and been provided with a lifetime annuity in return for the legal title to their property, are valued using unobservable inputs and management’s 
best estimates. As the inward cash flows on these properties will not be received until the lifetime lease is no longer in force, which is usually upon 
the death of the policyholder, these interests are valued on a reversionary basis which is a discounted current open market value. 

The open market values of the properties are independently revalued every two years by members of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors and in the intervening period are adjusted by reference to the Nationwide Building Society regional indices of house prices. The 
discount period is based on the best estimates of the likely date the property will become available for sale and the discount rate applied is 
determined by the general partner as its best estimate of the appropriate discount rate. The mortality assumption is based on the PMLO8HAWP 
table for males and the PFLO8HAWP table for females, adjusted to reflect the historic experience of the business concerned. The mortality rates 
are projected using future mortality improvements from the CMI Mortality Projection Model. No explicit allowance is made for house price 
inflation in the year through to their realisation. Therefore, the key assumptions used in the valuation of the reversionary interests are the interest 
discount rate and the mortality assumption. The discount rate was 5% (2022: 5%). 

The fair value measurement of the investment properties has been categorised as Level 3 based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used. 
The following table shows the valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the investment properties, the significant non-observable 
inputs used, the inter-relationship between the key non-observable inputs and the fair value measurement of the investment properties:

•  the mortality rate were to be higher (lower). 

The estimated fair value of the ERIP residential property reversions would increase (decrease) if:

•  the discount rate were to be lower (higher);
•  the mortality rate were to be higher (lower).

Direct operating expenses (offset against rental income in the consolidated income statement) in respect of investment properties that 
generated rental income during the year amounted to £36 million (2022: £27 million). The direct operating expenses arising from investment 
property that did not generate rental income during the year amounted to £5 million (2022: £5 million).

Deposits are subject to a combination of fixed and variable interest rates. The carrying amounts of balances held at amortised cost approximate 
to fair value at the period end. Cash and cash equivalents in long-term business operations and consolidated collective investment schemes of 
£6,994 million (2022: £8,597 million) are primarily held for the benefit of policyholders and so are not generally available for use by the owners.

G7. Provisions

A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, as a result of a past event, which is likely to result in an 
outflow of resources and where a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect is material, the provision is 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 

A provision is recognised for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from the contracts are less than the related 
unavoidable costs. The unavoidable costs reflect the net cost of exiting the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any 
compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. Costs that meet the requirements to be classified as a provision but are determined to 
be directly attributable to insurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF are classified within the insurance contract assets 
and liabilities.

Where it is expected that a part of the expenditure required to settle a provision will be reimbursed by a third party the reimbursement is 
recognised when, and only when, it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received. This reimbursement is recognised as a separate 
asset within other receivables and will not exceed the amount of the provision.

G7. Provisions continued
Leasehold properties
The leasehold properties provision includes a £9 million (2022: £7 million) dilapidations provision in respect of obligations under operating leases 
and £nil (2022: £2 million) in respect of the excess of lease rentals and other payments on properties that are currently vacant or are expected to 
become vacant, over the amounts to be recovered from subletting these properties. 

Staff related
Staff related provisions include provisions for unfunded pensions of £8 million (2022: £4 million), and private medical and other insurance costs 
for former employees of £3 million (2022: £3 million).

Known incidents
The known incidents provision was created for historical data quality, administration systems problems and process deficiencies on the policy 
administration, financial reconciliations and operational finance aspects of business outsourced. These balances represent the best estimates of 
costs payable to customers. Additional information has been given below in respect of the more significant balances within this provision.

During 2021, a £15 million provision was recognised in relation to errors in final encashment calculations for With Profits Trustee Investment Plans 
and in 2022 it was increased to £29 million. During 2023, £18 million (2022: £nil) was utilised and £7 million was released. The remaining balance 
at 31 December 2023 is £4 million (2022: £29 million). An £11 million provision was also recognised in April 2021 following identification that 
certain customers who have a Protected Pension Age or a Protected Tax Free Lump Sum may not have had their benefits settled correctly. 
During 2023, £4 million (2022: £4 million) was released and the remaining balance at 31 December 2023 is £3 million (2022: £7 million). These 
provisions will be utilised within one to four years.

In 2020, following completion of the Part VII transfer of the Legal & General business, a £12 million provision was recognised in respect of 
amounts owed to customers due to various system and processing errors resulting in incorrect rules having been applied to policies. During the 
year, the provision was increased by £2 million (2022: £nil) and a further £1 million (2022: £4 million) was released. The remaining balance at 
31 December 2023 is £3 million (2022: £2 million). A new provision of £5 million was created during 2023 in relation to a pricing error within the 
same business transfer caused by incorrect static data. During the year, £4 million was utilised and the remaining balance at 31 December 2023 
is £1 million. These provisions will be utilised within one to two years.

The remaining provisions of £4 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £10 million) are expected to be utilised within one to four years. As at 
31 December 2023, there are no significant uncertainties which could give rise to a material change to the value of the provisions held for current 
known incidents.

Indirect tax provision
The indirect tax provision relates to various indirect tax matters across operational taxes, employment taxes and VAT. During the year, the 
provision was strengthened by £43 million (2022: £nil). £3 million (2022: £nil) was utilised and a further £10 million (2022: £nil) was released. 
The remaining balance at 31 December 2023, of £59 million (2022: £29 million) represents the Group’s estimate of the maximum exposure 
as at the reporting date and is expected to be utilised in one to three years.

Restructuring provisions
Transition and transformation provision
Following the acquisition of the Standard Life Assurance businesses in August 2018, the Group established a transition and transformation 
programme which aims to deliver the integration of the Group’s operating models via a series of phases. During 2019, the Group announced its 
intention to extend its strategic partnership with TCS to provide customer servicing, to develop a digital platform and for migration of existing 
Standard Life policies to this platform which raised a valid expectation of the impacts in those likely to be affected. 

The initial provision was established in 2019 and included migration costs, severance costs and other expenses. Migration costs are considered a 
direct expenditure necessarily entailed by the restructuring and represent an obligation arising from arrangements entered into with TCS during 
2019. No costs have been provided for that relate to the ongoing servicing of policies. Migration costs payable to TCS are subject to limited 
uncertainty as they are fixed under the terms of the agreement entered into. There was an increase in costs during 2022 following on from a 
strategic decision to re-phase the programme. The severance costs are subject to uncertainty and will be impacted by the number of staff that 
transfer to TCS, and the average salaries and number of years’ service of those affected. 

During the year, the provision was increased by £6 million (2022: £33 million), a further £20 million (2022: £19 million) was utilised and £11 million 
(2022: nil) was released. The remaining £47 million (2022: £72 million) is expected to be utilised within one to three years.

Transfer of policy administration
A significant proportion of the Group’s policy administration is outsourced to Diligenta Limited (‘Diligenta’), a UK-based subsidiary of Tata 
Consultancy Services (‘TCS’). Diligenta provide life and pension business process services to a large number of the Group’s policyholders. 
During 2018, the Group announced its intention to move to a single outsourcer platform and to transfer a further 2 million of the Group’s legacy 
policies to Diligenta.

An initial provision was recognised in 2018 for the expected cost of the platform migration and for severance and other costs associated with 
exiting from the current arrangements. Migration costs are considered a direct expenditure necessarily entailed by the restructuring and 
represent an obligation arising from arrangements entered into with TCS during 2018. No costs have been provided for that relate to the 
ongoing servicing of policies. The migration elements of the provision are subject to limited uncertainty as a consequence of the signed 
agreements that are in place. The uncertainty in relation to the severance and associated exit costs is limited as the restructuring programme is 
nearing completion. During the year the provision was increased by £1 million (2022: £4 million) and a further £4 million (2022: £4 million) was 
utilised. The remaining provision of £5 million (2022: £8 million) is expected to be utilised within one year. 

Other provisions 
Other provisions includes £3 million (2022: £4 million) of obligations arising under a gift voucher scheme operated by the SunLife business and 
a commission clawback provision which represents the expected future clawback of commission income earned by the SunLife business as a 
result of assumed lapses of policies or associated benefits. 

Another provision of £1 million was also recognised during the year upon acquisition of SLF of Canada UK Limited in relation to restructuring 
and litigation.

The remaining other provisions of £5 million (2022: £7 million) consist of a number of small balances, all of which are less than £3 million in value. 

Discounting
The impact of discounting on all provisions during the year from either the passage of time or from a change in the discount rate is not material.

G8. Tax assets and liabilities 

Deferred tax is provided for on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not provided in respect of temporary differences arising from the initial 
recognition of goodwill and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time 
of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of 
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at 
the period end.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

The standard rate of UK corporation tax for the year ended 31 December 2023 is 23.5% (2022: 19%). 

An increase from the 19% UK corporation tax rate to 25%, effective from 1 April 2023, was announced in the Budget on 3 March 2021, and 
substantively enacted on 24 May 2021. Accordingly, shareholder deferred tax assets and liabilities, where provided, are reflected at 25%. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit is probable.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of:
Tax losses carried forward
Excess expenses and deferred acquisition costs
Actuarial liability differences between local GAAP and IFRS 17
Intangibles
Deferred tax assets not recognised on capital losses

The Group also has £635 million of BLAGAB trading losses carried forward as at 31 December 2023 in Phoenix Life Limited, ReAssure Limited 
and Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (UK) Limited (2022: £ 456 million of losses across Phoenix Life Limited, ReAssure Limited and 
Phoenix Life Assurance Limited). Of the £635 million, a deferred tax asset was recognised in respect of £623 million of losses (2022:£164 million 
of losses). The remaining £12 million of gross losses are projected to be utilised, however no value has been attributed to these deferred tax assets 
given the interaction with other deductible temporary differences (2022: £158 million of losses). In 2022 deferred tax assets were not recognised 
in respect of the remaining £134 million of losses due to the uncertainty of future trading profits against which the losses could be offset.

There is a technical matter which is currently being discussed with HMRC in relation to the L&G insurance business transfer to ReAssure Limited. 
These discussions are not sufficiently progressed at this stage for recognition of any potential tax benefit arising.

A tax dispute with HMRC in relation to the tax treatment of an asset formerly held by Guardian Assurance Limited (before the business was 
transferred to ReAssure Limited) was resolved in the period in favour of the Group. The 2021 current tax liability included an accrual for the total 
tax under dispute on the basis that there was sufficient risk that the tax treatment of the Group would not then be accepted. In 2022 this tax 
liability was released.

The Group in conjunction with a number of other companies has challenged HMRC’s position on the corporation tax treatment of overseas 
portfolio dividends from companies resident in the EU (‘EU dividends’) using a Group Litigation Order (‘GLO’). The issue relates to whether the 
UK tax rules, which taxed EU dividends received prior to 1 July 2009, was contrary to EU law given that dividends received from UK companies 
were exempt from tax. In 2009 UK tax law was changed with both overseas and UK dividends being treated as exempt from corporation tax.

In July 2018, the Supreme Court concluded in favour of the tax payer and a tax benefit of £13 million was recognised at the end of 2018 in 
relation to enhanced double tax relief claims which the Group is entitled to in accordance with the Court judgement. As a result of the insurance 
business transfer from Legal and General Assurance Society during YE20, the tax refund for the benefit of the Group’s with-profit and unit 
linked funds increased to £45 million and £23 million respectively. In the case of the with-profit funds there was an increase in unallocated surplus 
and for the unit linked funds there was a corresponding increase in investment contract liabilities as a result of the recognition of the tax asset. 

In January 2020, HMRC issued a communication to taxpayers who are affected by the dividend GLO but are not direct participants of it, 
setting out HMRC’s intended approach to settling enquiries into the amount of double tax relief available for statutory protective or other claims. 
The Group has been discussing the claims with HMRC during the course of 2022 and 2023, but due to the significant number of cases and years 
affected, no amounts have as yet been repaid. The level of tax refund expected is currently unchanged as at the end of 2023.

Some companies of the Group were late joiners or not members of the GLO but have made statutory protective tax claims totalling circa 
£14 million for the benefit of unit linked life funds based on the Supreme Court decision. HMRC has challenged the validity of such claims and is 
currently considering further tax litigation in this area against other third parties. Some progress through the courts has been made in the course 
of 2022 and 2023, but it is expected that the litigation will continue to run. Due to the uncertainty around the potential success of the claims a tax 
asset has not been recognised in respect of these claims.

The Group is continuing to monitor developments in relation to the G20-OECD Inclusive Framework “Pillar Two” rules, as the Group expects to 
be within the scope of the rules from 1 January 2024. Broadly, these rules seek to ensure that, on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, large 
multinational enterprises pay a minimum tax rate of 15% on worldwide profits arising after 31 December 2023.

The Group also notes the enactment of legislation in Bermuda in December 2023 which introduced a Corporate Income Tax with a headline rate 
of 15% effective from 1 January 2025. This legislation is expected to apply to the Group’s local Bermudian operations. Given the current size of 
local operations, the Group does not expect the immediate impact to be material.

As at year end 2023, the main other overseas jurisdictions where we operate and which have enacted local Pillar Two legislation are Germany, 
Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

The Group is continuing to assess the impact of the Pillar Two income taxes legislation on its future financial performance. Based on the work 
completed to date on most recent historical financial information, the Group does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. 
Nonetheless, the Group notes that the Pillar Two income taxes legislation is expected to continue developing, the rules are inherently complex 
and can potentially lead to arbitrary outcomes. Further that historical financial performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance, 
so the actual impact that the Pillar Two income taxes legislation may have on the Group’s future financial performance may be different 
from expectations.

G9. Lease Liabilities

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted 
using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. For ground rent leases, the 
incremental borrowing rate of investment funds holding the associated investment properties is used as the discount rate. The lease liability is 
subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a 
change in future lease payments arising from, for example, rent reviews or from changes in the assessment of whether a termination option is 
reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group has applied judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts with 
break clauses.

H. Interests in subsidiaries and associates
H1. Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that effective control is obtained by the Group (see basis of consolidation in note A1) and are 
excluded from consolidation from the date they cease to be subsidiary undertakings. For subsidiaries disposed of during the year, any 
difference between the net proceeds, plus the fair value of any retained interest, and the carrying amount of the subsidiary including 
non-controlling interests, is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

The Group uses the acquisition method to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of 
the consideration. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. In certain 
acquisitions an excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities and 
non-controlling interests over cost may arise. Where this occurs, the surplus of the fair value of net assets acquired over the fair value of the 
consideration is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Directly attributable acquisition costs are included within administrative expenses, except for acquisitions undertaken prior to 2010 when they 
are included within the cost of the acquisition. Costs directly related to the issuing of debt or equity securities are included within the initial 
carrying amount of debt or equity securities where these are not carried at fair value. Intra-group balances and income and expenses arising 
from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

The Group has invested in a number of collective investment schemes such as Open-ended Investment Companies (‘OEICs’), unit trusts, 
Société d’Investissement à Capital Variable (‘SICAVs’), investment trusts and private equity funds. These invest mainly in equities, bonds, 
property and cash and cash equivalents. The Group’s percentage ownership in these collective investment schemes can fluctuate according 
to the level of Group and third party participation in the structures.

When assessing control over collective investment schemes, the Group considers those factors described under the ‘Basis of consolidation’ in 
note A1. In particular, the Group considers the scope of its decision-making authority, including the existence of substantive rights (such as 
power of veto, liquidation rights and the right to remove the fund manager) that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee. 
The assessment of whether rights are substantive rights, and the circumstances under which the Group has the practical ability to exercise 
them, requires the exercise of judgement. This assessment includes a qualitative consideration of the rights held by the Group that are 
attached to its holdings in the collective investment schemes, rights that arise from contractual arrangements between the Group and the 
entity or fund manager and the rights held by third parties. In addition, consideration is made of whether the Group has de facto power, for 
example, where third party investments in the collective investment schemes are widely dispersed.

Where Group companies are deemed to control such collective investment schemes they are consolidated in the Group financial statements, 
with the interests of external third parties recognised as a liability (see the accounting policy for ‘Net asset value attributable to unitholders’ in 
note E1 for further details).

Certain of the collective investment schemes have non-coterminous period ends and are consolidated on the basis of additional financial 
statements prepared to the period end.

Portfolio transfers
When completing an acquisition, the Group first considers whether the acquisition meets the definition of a business combination under IFRS 
3 Business Combinations. IFRS 3, and the use of acquisition accounting, does not apply in circumstances where the acquisition of an asset or a 
group of assets does not constitute a business, and is instead a portfolio of assets and liabilities. In such cases, the Group’s policy is to recognise 
and measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies for those assets and liabilities. The 
difference between the consideration and the net assets or liabilities acquired is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

H1.1 Significant restrictions
The ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans and advances is subject to local laws, 
regulations and solvency requirements.

Each UK life company and the Group must retain sufficient capital at all times to meet the regulatory capital requirements mandated by or 
otherwise agreed with the relevant national supervisory authority. Further information on the capital requirements applicable to Group entities 
are set out in the Capital Management section (note I3). Under UK company law, dividends can only be paid if a UK company has distributable 
reserves sufficient to cover the dividend.

In addition, contractual requirements may place restrictions on the transfer of funds as follows:

•  Pearl Life Holdings Limited (‘PeLHL’) is required to make payments of contributions into charged accounts on behalf of the Abbey Life 

Scheme. These amounts do not form part of the pension scheme assets and at 31 December 2023, PeLHL held £9 million (2022: £9 million) 
within debt securities and £24 million (2022: £18 million) within cash and cash equivalents in respect of these charged accounts. Further details 
of when the remaining amounts may become payable to the pensions scheme are included in note G1.3.

•  ReAssure Midco Limited (‘RML’) is required to make payments of contributions into a ring-fenced account on behalf of the ReAssure Staff 
Pension Scheme. These amounts do not form part of the pension scheme assets and at 31 December 2023, RML held £44 million (2022: 
£40 million) within debt securities in respect of this account. Further details of when these amounts may become payable to the pensions 
scheme are included in note G1.4.

H2. Acquisition of SLF of Canada UK Limited
On 3 April 2023, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of SLF of Canada UK Limited from Sun Life Assurance Company of 
Canada, part of the Sun Life Financial Inc. Group, for total cash consideration of £250 million. 

SLF of Canada UK Limited and its subsidiaries are a closed book life insurance business that has a portfolio of pension, life and annuity products.

The acquisition is in line with the Group’s strategy to undertake mergers and acquisitions (‘M&A’) to acquire new customers at scale and deliver 
better outcomes for them. The Group also transforms acquired businesses to deliver significant cost and capital synergies, creating significant 
shareholder value. The table below summarises the fair value of identifiable assets and acquired liabilities assumed as at the date of acquisition.

H2. Acquisition of SLF of Canada UK Limited continued
Acquired in-force business (AVIF)
An asset of £16 million arises reflecting the present value of future profits associated with the acquired in-force business. The AVIF has been 
determined by reference to the fair value of investment contract rights acquired.

The valuation of AVIF has been determined by reference to the assumptions expected to be applied by a market participant in an orderly 
transaction. The valuation approach uses present value techniques applied to the best estimate cash flows expected to arise from policies that 
were in-force at the acquisition date, adjusted to reflect the price of bearing the uncertainty inherent in those cash flows. This approach 
incorporates a number of judgements and assumptions which have impacted on the resultant valuation, the most significant of which include 
expected policy lapses and surrender costs, and the expenses associated with servicing the policies, together with economic assumptions such 
as future investment returns and the discount rate. The determination of the majority of these assumptions is carried out on a consistent basis with 
those used in financial reporting with appropriate adjustments to reflect a market participant’s view. The adjustment for risk for the uncertainty in 
the cash flows has been determined using a cost of capital approach.

The valuation of insurance contract liabilities and associated reinsurance assets has been carried out on a consistent basis with that applied by 
the Group under the fair value approach on the transition to IFRS 17. Further information on the fair value approach used for the transition to IFRS 
17 is set out in note A4.1 Determination of transition method and its application. 

Deferred acquisition costs of £1 million and a deferred income liability of £2 million have been derecognised on acquisition and replaced as part 
of the AVIF balance.

Other receivables
The financial assets acquired include other receivables with a fair value of £64 million. The gross amount due under the contracts is £64 million, 
of which no balances are expected to be uncollectable. 

Tax
The tax impact of the fair value adjustments recognised on acquisition has been reflected in the acquisition balance sheet.

Gain on acquisition
A gain on acquisition of £66 million has been recognised in the Group’s consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2023, 
reflecting the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired over the consideration paid for the acquisition of the SLF of Canada UK businesses.

The consideration for the acquisition was fixed and determined using a ‘locked box’ pricing mechanism as at 31 December 2021. Over the period 
between 31 December 2021 and the completion date, the value of the net assets acquired increased. This principally reflects a negative impact 
on assets from increasing yields being more than offset by a reduction in liabilities as a result of favourable assumption changes and 
demographic experience. 

Additionally, in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the acquired defined benefit pension schemes has been measured on 
acquisition in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies as set out in note G1, as opposed to a fair value basis.

Transaction costs
Transaction costs of £4 million have been expensed and are included in administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement. All of 
these costs were paid.

Impact of the acquisition on results
From the date of acquisition, the SLF of Canada UK business contributed £199 million to revenue and £24 million of profit after tax 
attributable to owners. 

It is not possible to provide revenue and profit after tax attributable to owners for the Group had the acquisition taken place at the beginning of 
the year as key income statement items such as the amortisation of the contractual service margin recognised under IFRS 17 are calculated with 
reference to the fair value as at the date of acquisition.

Since 2021, the balances in the statement of consolidated financial position relating to the Wrap SIPP, Onshore Bond and TIP business have 
been classified as a disposal group held for sale. The total proceeds of disposal were not expected to exceed the carrying value of the related 
net assets and accordingly the disposal group was measured at fair value less costs to sell, resulting in an impairment of the acquired in-force 
business (‘AVIF’) of £59 million at the date of the transaction. As at 31 December 2023, the expected completion date for the transfer of the TIP 
business was March 2025.

Prior to 31 December 2023, a re-scoping exercise was undertaken with abrdn plc and it was agreed that the insured funds elements of the Wrap 
SIPP and Onshore Bond businesses will no longer transfer to abrdn plc, and as a result this business no longer meets the requirements to be 
classified as held for sale. The self-invested elements of the Wrap SIPP business, which are held off-balance sheet, are still expected to transfer 
after April 2025. As at 31 December 2023, only the TIP business has been classified as a disposal group held for sale.

The AVIF, which relates to the Wrap SIPP and Onshore Bond business, has been further impaired since 2021 and a further impairment charge of 
£28 million has been recognised in the year (2022: £17 million) prior to being removed from its classification as held for sale. As at 31 December 
2023, the balances relating to the Wrap SIPP and Onshore Bond business have been included within the respective line items in the 
consolidated statement of financial position, and assets of £2,410 million and liabilities of £2,412 million have been removed from the held for sale 
classification. The major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are as follows:

Acquired in-force business 
Investment property
Financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents
Assets classified as held for sale
Assets in consolidated funds1
Total assets of the disposal group

Investment contract liabilities

1   Included in assets of the disposal group are assets in consolidated funds, which are held to back investment contract liabilities of the Wrap SIPP, Onshore Bond and TIP business and are disclosed 

within financial assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group controls these funds at 31 December 2023 and therefore consolidates 100% of the assets with any non-controlling 
interest recognised as net asset value attributable to unitholders.

H4. Associates: Investment in UK commercial property REIT (‘UKCPR’) 
UKCPR is a property investment company which is domiciled in Guernsey and is admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority and to 
trading on the London Stock Exchange.

The Group’s interest in UKCPR is held in the with-profit funds of the Group’s life companies. Therefore, the shareholder exposure to fair value 
movements in the Group’s investment in UKCPR is limited to the impact of those movements on the shareholder share of distributed profits of the 
relevant fund. 

As at 31 December 2023, the Group held 43.4% (2022: 44.6%) of the issued share capital of UKCPR and the value of this investment, measured 
at fair value and included within financial assets, was £349 million (2022: £329 million). Management has concluded that the Group did not 
control UKCPR in either the current or comparative periods. The Group does not hold a unilateral power of veto in general meetings and voting 
is subject to certain restrictions in accordance with the terms of an existing relationship agreement it has with UKCPR.

H3. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale 

Summary consolidated financial information (at 100%) for UKCPR group is shown below:

The Group classifies disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use. Disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of the disposal group, excluding finance costs and 
income tax expense. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in the statement of consolidated 
financial position.

Agreement with abrdn plc
On 23 February 2021, the Group entered into a new agreement with abrdn plc to simplify the arrangements of their Strategic Partnership, 
enabling the Group to control its own distribution, marketing and brands, and focusing the Strategic Partnership on using abrdn plc’s asset 
management services in support of Phoenix Group’s growth strategy. Under the terms of the transaction, the Group agreed to sell its UK 
investment and platform-related products, comprising Wrap Self Invested Personal Pension (‘Wrap SIPP’), Onshore Bond and UK Trustee 
Investment Plan (‘TIP’) to abrdn plc through a Part VII transfer. The economic risk and rewards for this business transferred to abrdn plc effective 
from 1 January 2021 via a profit transfer arrangement. Consideration received of £62 million in respect of this business was deferred until 
completion of the Part VII and the payments to abrdn plc in respect of the profit transfer arrangement are being offset against the deferred 
consideration balance.

H5. Structured entities
A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the 
entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual 
arrangements. A structured entity often has some or all of the following features or attributes: (a) restricted activities; (b) a narrow and well-
defined objective, such as to provide investment opportunities for investors by passing on risks and rewards associated with the assets of the 
structured entity to investors; (c) insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support; 
and (d) financing in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or other risks (tranches).

H5. Structured entities continued
The Group has determined that all of its investments in collective investment schemes are structured entities. In addition, a number of debt 
security structures and private equity funds have been identified as structured entities. The Group has assessed that it has interests in both 
consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities as shown below:

•  Unit trusts;
•  OEICs;
•  SICAVs;
•  Private equity funds;
•  Asset backed securities;
•  Collateralised Debt Obligations (‘CDOs’);
•  Other debt structures; and
•  Phoenix Group Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’). 

The Group’s holdings in the investments listed above are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values. Holdings 
in investment funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective fund’s prospectus and the Group holds redeemable shares or units 
in each of the funds. The funds are managed by internal and external fund managers who apply various investment strategies to accomplish their 
respective investment objectives. All of the funds are managed by fund managers who are compensated by the respective funds for their 
services. Such compensation generally consists of an asset-based fee and a performance-based incentive fee and is reflected in the valuation 
of each fund.

H5.1 Interests in consolidated structured entities
The Group has determined that where it has control over funds, these investments are consolidated structured entities.

The EBT is a consolidated structured entity that holds shares to satisfy awards granted to employees under the Group’s share-based 
payment schemes.

During the year, the Group granted further loans to the EBT of £12 million (2022: £13 million).

As at the reporting date, the Group has no intention to provide financial or other support to any other consolidated structured entity.

H5.2 Interests in unconsolidated structured entities
The Group has interests in unconsolidated structured entities. These investments are held as financial assets in the Group’s consolidated 
statement of financial position held at fair value through profit or loss. Any change in fair value is included in the consolidated income statement 
in ‘net investment income’. Dividend and interest income is received from these investments.

A summary of the Group’s interest in unconsolidated structured entities is included below. These are shown according to the financial asset 
categorisation in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The Group’s maximum exposure to loss with regard to the interests presented above is the carrying amount of the Group’s investments. Once the 
Group has disposed of its shares or units in a fund, it ceases to be exposed to any risk from that fund. The Group’s holdings in the above 
unconsolidated structured entities are largely less than 50% and as such the size of these structured entities are likely to be significantly higher 
than their carrying value.

Details of commitments to subscribe to private equity funds and other unlisted assets are included in note I5.

H6. Group entities
The table below sets out the Group’s subsidiaries (including consolidated collective investment schemes), associates and significant holdings in 
undertakings (including undertakings in which the holding amounts to 20% or more of the nominal value of the shares or units and they are not 
classified as a subsidiary or associate).

I. Other notes
I1. Share-based payment

Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at 
the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Further details regarding the determination of the 
fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out below.

The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each period end, the Group revises its estimate of the 
number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of 
the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the consolidated income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

I1.1 Share-based payment expense
The expense recognised for employee services receivable during the year is as follows:

Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The Group implemented a Long-Term Incentive Plan to retain and motivate its senior management group. The awards under this plan are in the 
form of nil-cost options to acquire an allocated number of ordinary shares.

Assuming no good leavers or other events which would trigger early vesting rights, the 2021, 2022 and 2023 LTIP awards are subject to 
performance conditions tied to the Group’s performance in respect of net operating cash receipts, return on shareholder value, persistency and 
total shareholder return (‘TSR’). The 2022 and 2023 LTIP awards also include a performance condition tied to the Group’s performance on 
decarbonisation. See the Directors’ Remuneration Report for further details of the performance conditions.

For all LTIP awards, a holding period applies so that any LTIP awards to Executive Committee members for which the performance vesting 
requirements are satisfied will not be released for a further two years from the third anniversary of the original award date. Dividends will accrue 
on LTIP awards until the end of the holding period. There are no cash settlement alternatives. 

2023 LTIP awards were granted on 17 March 2023 and are expected to vest on 17 March 2026. The 2020 LTIP awards vested on 13 March 2023. 
The 2021 awards will vest on 12 March 2024 and the 2022 awards will vest on 18 March 2025. 

The fair value of these awards is estimated at the average share price in the three days preceding the date of grant, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The fair value of the LTIP awards is adjusted in respect of the TSR performance 
condition which is deemed to be a ‘market condition’. The fair value of the 2020, 2021 and 2022 TSR elements of the LTIP awards has been 
calculated using a Monte Carlo model. The inputs to this model are shown below:

Dividends are received by holders of the awards 
therefore no adjustment to fair value is required

On 4 October 2023, 19 August 2022 and 17 August 2021, LTIP awards were granted to certain senior management employees. The vesting 
periods and performance conditions for these awards are linked to the core 2021, 2022 and 2023 LTIP awards respectively.

On 17 March 2023 and 4 October 2023 LTIP Buy-out awards were granted to certain senior management employees. There are discrete vesting 
periods for these awards and these grants of shares are conditional on the employees remaining in employment with the Group for the vesting 
period. Similar awards were also issued on 18 March 2022, 19 August 2022, 12 March 2021 and 17 August 2021.

Each year, the Group issues a Chairman’s share award under the terms of the LTIP which is granted to a small number of employees in recognition 
of their outstanding contribution in the previous year. The awards are granted on the same dates as the core 2021, 2022 and 2023 LTIP awards. 
These grants of shares are conditional on the employees remaining in employment with the Group for the vesting period and achieving an 
established minimum good/good performance grading. Good leavers will be able to, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, exercise 
their full award at vesting.

Deferred Bonus Share Scheme (‘DBSS’)
Each year, part of the annual incentive for certain executives is deferred into shares of the parent company. The grant of these shares is 
conditional on the employee remaining in employment with the Group for a period of three years from the date of grant. Good leavers will be 
able to, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, exercise their full award at vesting. Dividends will accrue for DBSS awards over the 
three-year deferral period.

The 2023 DBSS was granted on 17 March 2023 and is expected to vest on 17 March 2026. The 2020 DBSS awards vested on 13 March 2023. The 
2021 awards are expected to vest on 12 March 2024 and the 2022 awards are expected to vest on 18 March 2025. 

The fair value of these awards is estimated at the average share price in the three days preceding the date of the grant, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.

Sharesave scheme
The sharesave scheme allows participating employees to save up to £500 each month for the UK scheme and up to €500 per month for the Irish 
scheme over a period of either three or five years. The 2023 sharesave options were granted on 25 October 2023. Irish Sharesave options are no 
longer granted.

Under the sharesave arrangement, participants remaining in the Group’s employment at the end of the three or five year saving period are 
entitled to use their savings to purchase shares at an exercise price at a discount to the share price on the date of grant. Employees leaving the 
Group for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares if they leave prior to the end of their three or five year period.

The fair value of the options has been determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Key assumptions within this valuation model include 
expected share price volatility and expected dividend yield.

The following information was relevant in the determination of the fair value of the 2019 to 2023 UK sharesave options:

Share price (£)
Exercise price (£)
Expected life (years)

government gilts commensurate with

The information for determining the fair value of the 2021 Irish sharesave options differed from that included in the table above as follows:
- Share price (€): 8.618
- Exercise price (€): 6.880
- Risk-free rate (%): (0.4) (for 3.25 year scheme) and (0.3) (for 5.25 year scheme)
- No Sharesave awards were granted to Irish employees during either 2022 or 2023.

Share Incentive Plan
The Group operates two Share Incentive Plans (‘SIP’) open to UK and Irish employees which allows participating employees to purchase 
‘Partnership shares’ in the Company through monthly contributions. In respect of the UK SIP, the contributions are limited to the lower of £150 
per month and 10% gross monthly salary. In 2019 the matching element of the UK SIP was amended to give the employee one ‘Matching share’ 
for each ‘Partnership share’ purchased limited to £50. Contributions above £50 are not matched. The Irish SIP, which was launched in 2019, gives 
the employee 1.4 ‘Matching shares’ for each ‘Partnership share’ purchased. For this plan monthly contributions are limited to the lower of €40 
per month and 7.5% of gross monthly salary.

The fair value of the Matching shares granted is estimated as the share price at date of grant, taking into account terms and conditions upon 
which the instruments were granted. At 31 December 2023, 546,430 matching shares (excluding unrestricted shares) were conditionally 
awarded to employees (2022: 543,995).

I3. Capital management

The Group’s capital management is based on the Solvency II framework as implemented in the UK. This involves a valuation in line with 
Solvency II principles of the Group’s Own Funds and risk-based assessment of the Group’s Solvency Capital Requirement (‘SCR’).

This note sets out the Group’s approach to managing capital and provides an analysis of Own Funds and SCR.

Risk and capital management objectives
The risk management objectives and policies of the Group are based on the requirement to protect the Group’s regulatory capital position, 
thereby safeguarding policyholders’ guaranteed benefits whilst also ensuring the Group can meet its various cash flow requirements. Subject to 
this, the Group seeks to use available capital to achieve increased returns, balancing risk and reward, to generate additional value for 
policyholders and shareholders.

In pursuing these objectives, the Group deploys financial and other assets and incurs insurance contract liabilities and financial and other 
liabilities. Financial and other assets principally comprise investments in equity securities, debt securities, collective investment schemes, 
property, derivatives, reinsurance, trade and other receivables, and banking deposits. Financial liabilities principally comprise investment 
contracts, borrowings for financing purposes, derivative liabilities and net asset value attributable to unitholders.

I3. Capital management continued
Risk and capital management objectives continued
The Group’s Risk Management Framework is described in the risk management commentary on pages 46 to 57 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts and the Risk Universe component of this framework summarises the comprehensive set of risks to which the Group is exposed. 
The major risks (‘Level 1’ risks) that the Group’s businesses are exposed to and the Group’s approach to managing those risks are outlined in the 
following notes:

•  note E6: Credit risk, market risk, financial soundness risk, strategic risk, customer risk and operational risk; and
•  note F11: Insurance risk.

The section on risk and capital management objectives is included below. 

Capital Management Framework
The Group’s Capital Management Framework is designed to achieve the following objectives:

•  to provide appropriate security for policyholders and meet all regulatory capital requirements under the Solvency II regime while not 

retaining unnecessary excess capital, operating within a Solvency II Shareholder Capital Coverage ratio of 140-180%;

•  to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet obligations to policyholders and other creditors;
•  to manage our leverage position, including optimisation of the Solvency II leverage ratio and the Fitch leverage ratio to maintain an 

investment grade credit rating; and 

•  to maintain a dividend policy to pay an ordinary dividend that is progressive and sustainable.

The framework comprises a suite of capital management policies that govern the allocation of capital throughout the Group to achieve 
the framework objectives under a range of stress conditions. The policy suite is defined with reference to policyholder security, creditor 
obligations, owner dividend policy and regulatory capital requirements.

Group capital
Group capital is managed on a Solvency II basis. Under the Solvency II framework, the primary sources of capital managed by the Group 
comprises the Group’s Own Funds as measured under the Solvency II principles adjusted to exclude surplus funds attributable to the Group’s 
unsupported with-profit funds and unsupported pension schemes. 

A Solvency II capital assessment involves valuation in line with Solvency II principles of the Group’s Own Funds and a risk-based assessment of 
the Group’s Solvency Capital Requirement (‘SCR’). Solvency II surplus is the excess of Own Funds over the SCR.

The Group aims to maintain a Solvency II surplus at least equal to its Board-approved capital policy, which reflects Board risk appetite for 
meeting prevailing solvency requirements.

The capital policy of each Life Company is set and monitored by each Life Company Board. These policies ensure there is sufficient capital 
within each Life Company to meet regulatory capital requirements under a range of stress conditions. The capital policy of each Life Company 
varies according to the risk profile and financial strength of the company.

The capital policy of each Group Holding Company is designed to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity to meet creditor obligations through 
the combination of cash buffers and cash flows from the Group’s operating companies.

Own Funds and SCR
Basic Own Funds represents the excess of assets over liabilities from the Solvency II balance sheet adjusted to add back any relevant 
subordinated liabilities that meet the criteria to be treated as capital items.

The Basic Own Funds are classified into three Tiers based on permanency and loss absorbency (Tier 1 being the highest quality and Tier 3 the 
lowest). The Group’s Own Funds are assessed for their eligibility to cover the Group SCR with reference to both the quality of capital and its 
availability and transferability. Surplus funds in with-profit funds of the Life companies and in the pension schemes are restricted and can only be 
included in Eligible Own Funds up to the value of the SCR they are used to support.

Eligible Own Funds to cover the SCR are obtained after applying the prescribed Tiering limits and availability restrictions to the Basic Own Funds.

The SCR is calibrated so that the likelihood of a loss exceeding the SCR is less than 0.5% over one year. This ensures that capital is sufficient to 
withstand a broadly ‘1 in 200 year event’.

The Group operates an Internal Model to calculate Group SCR, all Group companies are within the scope of the single internal model, with the 
exception of acquired ReAssure businesses, the Irish life entities, Standard Life International Designated Activity Company and Phoenix Life 
Assurance Europe Designated Activity Company, and Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.K.) Limited, which determine their capital 
requirements in accordance with the Standard Formula.

Where the Group has a possible future obligation as a result of a past event, or a present legal or constructive obligation but it is not probable 
that there will be an outflow of resources to settle the obligation or the amount cannot be reliably estimated, this is disclosed as a 
contingent liability.

Legal proceedings
In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to certain legal issues, which can involve litigation and arbitration. At the year end, the 
Group has a number of contingent liabilities in this regard, none of which are considered by the Directors to be material.

I7. Events after the reporting period

The financial statements are adjusted to reflect significant events that have a material effect on the financial results and that have occurred 
between the period end and the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions that 
existed at the period end. Events that are indicative of conditions that arise after the period end that do not result in an adjustment to the 
financial statements are disclosed.

On 19 January 2024, the Group completed a buy-out transaction with the PGL Pension Scheme, one of the Group’s defined benefit schemes. 
The impact of this transaction is being determined and will be included in the Group’s results for 2024.

On 6 February 2024, the Board approved the redemption of the £250 million 5.766% Fixed Rate Reset Callable Tier 2 Subordinated Notes due 
2029 on the first call date of 13 June 2024 (subject to regulatory approval).

On 21 March 2024, UK Commercial Property REIT Limited (‘UKCPR’), an associate of the Group, and Tritax Big Box REIT plc (‘BBOX’) announced 
a recommended all-share combination whereby BBOX will acquire the entire share capital of UKCPR for consideration of 0.444 new shares of 
BBOX for each share of UKCPR held. The transaction is expected to complete in May 2024, subject to the approval of both UKCPR and BBOX 
shareholders, and Court sanction of the scheme of arrangement under Part VIII of the Companies Law of Guernsey. On the date of 
announcement, Phoenix Life Limited (‘PLL’), a subsidiary of the Group, held 43.3% of UKCPR’s issued ordinary share capital and had irrevocably 
undertaken to vote in favour of the transaction. Upon completion, PLL is expected to hold shares representing 10.1% of BBOX’s total issued share 
capital. It is anticipated that this transaction, on completion, will result in the Group accounting for its ownership in BBOX as an investment, rather 
than the current associate treatment of UKCPR, as the Group will not have significant influence over BBOX.

On 21 March 2024, the Board recommended a final dividend of 26.65p per share for the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: 26.0p). Payment 
of the final dividend is subject to shareholder approval at the AGM. The cost of this dividend has not been recognised as a liability in the 
consolidated financial statements for 2023 and will be charged to the statement of consolidated changes in equity in 2024.

FinancialsFinancialsNotes to the parent company financial statements

1. Accounting policies 
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for those financial assets 
and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) that have been measured at fair value.

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its own income statement in 
these financial statements. Profit attributable to owners for the year ended 31 December 2023 was £79 million (2022: £116 million).

Statement of Compliance
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK – adopted international accounting standards as applied in 
accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

The financial statements are presented in sterling (£) rounded to the nearest million except where otherwise stated.

Assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liability simultaneously. 

(b) Accounting policies
Where applicable, the accounting policies in the separate financial statements are the same as those presented in the consolidated financial 
statements on pages 171 to 290 with the exception of the one policy whereby the Company has not adopted the Group’s policy of 
hedge accounting. 

Where an accounting policy can be directly attributed to a specific note to the consolidated financial statements, the policy is presented within 
that note. Each note within the Company financial statements makes reference to the note to the consolidated financial statements containing 
the applicable accounting policy. The accounting policy in relation to foreign currency transactions is included within note A3.1 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 

Investments in Group entities
Investments in Group entities are carried in the statement of financial position at cost less impairment.

The Company assesses at each reporting date whether an investment is impaired by assessing whether any indicators of impairment exist. If 
objective evidence of impairment exists, the Company calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount 
of the Group entity and its carrying value and recognises the amount as an expense in the income statement.

The recoverable amount is determined based on the cash flow projections of the underlying entities.

(c) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Critical accounting estimates are those which involve the most complex or subjective judgements or assessments. The area of the Company’s 
business that typically requires such estimates and judgement is the impairment assessment for investments in Group entities.

Impairment of investments in Group entities 
The Company conducts impairment reviews of investments in subsidiaries whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an asset is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount, which 
requires the Company to estimate the value in use. The value in use uses future cash flows and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the 
present value. Where the actual future cash flows are less than expected, an impairment loss may arise. Further details are included in note 11.

2. Financial information
New accounting pronouncements not yet effective
Details of the standards, interpretations and amendments to be adopted in future periods are detailed in note A5 to the consolidated financial 
statements, none of which are expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.

During 2023, the Company issued 1,185,942 shares (2022: 816,419 shares) with a premium of £6 million (2022: £4 million) in order to satisfy its 
obligations to employees under the Group’s sharesave schemes.

The Company has applied the relief in section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 to present the difference between the consideration received 
and the nominal value of the shares issued of £1,819 million in a merger reserve as opposed to in share premium. A merger reserve is required to 
be used as a result of the Company having issued equity shares in 2020 as part consideration for the shares of the ReAssure Group plc and 
securing at least a 90% holding in that entity.

On 12 December 2018, the Company became the ultimate parent undertaking of the Group by acquiring the entire share capital of ‘Old PGH’ 
(the Group’s ultimate parent company until December 2018) via a share for share exchange. The cost of investment in Old PGH was determined 
as the carrying amount of the Company’s share of the equity of Old PGH on the date of the transaction. The difference between the cost of 
investment and the market capitalisation of Old PGH immediately before the share for share exchange of £4 million has been recognised as an 
Other reserve, and is shown as a separate component of equity.

4. Tier 1 notes
The accounting policy and details of the terms for the Tier 1 Notes are included in note D4 to the consolidated financial statements.

On 12 December 2018, the Company was substituted in place of Old PGH as issuer of the Tier 1 Notes and these were recognised at the fair 
value of £411 million in the form of an intragroup loan which was received as consideration. 

On 27 October 2020, the terms of the Tier 1 Notes were amended and the consequence of a trigger event, linked to the Solvency II capital 
position, was changed. Previously, the Tier 1 Notes were subject to a permanent write-down in value to zero. The amended terms require that the 
Tier 1 Notes would automatically be subject to conversion to ordinary shares of the Company at the conversion price of £1,000 per share, subject 
to adjustment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes and all accrued and unpaid interest would be cancelled. Following any 
such conversion there would be no reinstatement of any part of the principal amount of, or interest on, the Tier 1 Notes at any time.

FinancialsFinancialsl  On 31 December 2022, ReAssure Limited (‘RAL’) issued a £718 million term loan of £718 million to the Company, maturing on 31 December 
2027. At the same time, the Company issued a contingent loan to RAL for the same amount (see note 12 (d) for further details). Interest

with the terms of the loan, a corresponding amount of RAL’s obligations under the contingent loan would be offset. The Company made the

t  On 13 September 2022, the Company entered into an uncommitted intra-group cash-pooling facility with certain subsidiaries, under which 
the Company will either borrow funds from, or lend funds to, the relevant subsidiary. All amounts due under the facility attract interest at 
SONIA and are repayable on demand.

interest at a margin over SONIA that is based on credit rating. The facility remains undrawn as at 31 December 2023.

For the purposes of the additional fair value disclosures for liabilities recognised at amortised cost, all borrowings have been categorised as Level 
2 financial instruments. 

Further details of the loans due to third parties (loans a. to j.) are contained in note E5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Derivative collateral arrangements
The accounting policy for collateral arrangements is included in note E4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Assets accepted
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of over-the-counter (‘OTC’) derivative assets is £119 million (2022: £257 million) of which credit 
risk of £30 million (2022: £86 million) is mitigated by use of collateral arrangements (which are settled net after taking account of any OTC 
derivative liabilities owed by the counterparty). 

Assets pledged
The Company has not pledged any collateral in respect of its OTC derivative liabilities.

7. Provisions
The accounting policy for provisions is included in note G7 to the consolidated financial statements.

In 2019, the Company recognised an initial Standard Life transition and transformation restructuring provision of £159 million. During the year, 
£27 million (2022: £28 million) of the restructuring provision was utilised and the provision was decreased by £7 million (2022: increased by 
£33 million). The remaining provision of £63 million (2022: £97 million) is expected to be utilised within one to three years. See note G7 to the 
consolidated financial statements for further details.

FinancialsFinancialsNotes to the parent company financial statements continued7. Provisions continued
Following the acquisition of the ReAssure businesses in 2020, the Group established a transition and transformation programme which aims to 
deliver the integration of the Group’s operating models via a series of phases. During 2023, the Group announced its intention to migrate existing 
ReAssure policies to the TCS platform which raised a valid expectation of the impacts in those likely to be affected. 

The initial provision of £127 million included migration costs, severance costs and other expenses. Migration costs are considered a direct 
expenditure necessarily entailed by the restructuring and represent an obligation arising from arrangements entered into with TCS during 2023. 
No costs have been provided for that relate to the ongoing servicing of policies. Migration costs payable to TCS are subject to limited 
uncertainty as they are fixed under the terms of the agreement entered into. The severance costs are subject to uncertainty and will be impacted 
by the number of staff that transfer to TCS, and the average salaries and number of years’ service of those affected. 

During the year, the provision was increased by £65 million and £33 million was utilised. The remaining provision of £159 million is expected to be 
utilised within one to five years.

8. Lease liabilities
The accounting policy for lease liabilities is included in note G9 to the consolidated financial statements.

Lease liabilities relate to office premises at 20 Old Bailey, London. The lease was assigned on 24 March 2021 for a term of 12 years and 9 months, 
with an option to break the contract on 25 December 2028. It is currently not expected that the break clause will be exercised.

In April 2023, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of SLF of Canada UK Limited business for a cost of £250 million. In 
addition, during the year the Company established a Bermuda based entity, Phoenix Group Holdings (Bermuda) Limited, and capital 
contributions totaling £55 million were paid to the entity. 

During 2023, the following Part VII schemes (transfer of insurance business) were undertaken which had the effect of reallocating the value of 
the Company’s investment in Group entities between certain subsidiaries:

•  the PLL and RLL EU business policies were transferred into a new EU regulated life company, Phoenix Life Assurance Europe DAC (‘PLAE’), 

within the Group.

•  the business of PLAL, SLAL and Standard Life Pension Funds Limited (‘SLPF’) was transferred to PLL. In line with the strategic objectives of the 

Group, the transfer simplifies the operating model whilst resulting in financial, operational and liquidity benefits with the excess capital 
position, after allowing for costs and capital policy, of the life companies improving significantly.

•  Additionally, during 2023 the servicing activities of Pearl Group Services Limited and Standard Life Asset and Employee Services Limited 

were transferred to Phoenix Group Management Services Limited. In line with the strategic objectives of the Group, the transfer simplifies the 
operating model resulting in operational benefits.

As at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the market capitalisation of the Company was lower than the net asset value, and this was 
considered to be an indicator that the Company’s investments in its subsidiaries may have been impaired. Where such indicators are identified, 
an impairment test is performed.

As a starting point, the contribution of the life insurance subsidiaries to the recoverable amount has been determined with reference to Solvency 
II Own Funds, which reflects a probability-weighted best estimate of cash flows for in-force insurance and investment contracts consistent with 
the Group’s operating plan with an allowance for risk, together with an economic valuation of the underlying assets and other liabilities. Suitable 
adjustments were made to Solvency II Own Funds in order to align with the dividend paying capacity of the life insurance subsidiaries, which 
included the removal of the surplus attributable to policyholders in the with-profit funds. Where the Solvency II Own Funds exceeded the 
carrying value of the investment in subsidiary, management has concluded that no impairment is required.

For one of its subsidiaries, Phoenix Life Holdings Limited (“PLHL”), the carrying value of the investment exceeded the Solvency II Own Funds as 
at 31 December 2023. Accordingly, a value in use test was applied that utilises cash flow projections based on the emergence of surplus for 
in-force business on a Solvency II basis, together with new business cash flows on a Solvency II basis. This analysis has been informed by dividend 
projections on a consistent basis to that set out in the Group’s business plan approved by the Board. The value in use calculation has used a 
discount rate of 10%, calculated using a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital approach, and a long term growth rate after the initial five 
year business plan period of 2%. A 1% increase in the discount rate would reduce the recoverable amount by £920 million and would not result 
in any impairment being recognised in respect of PLHL. A 1% reduction in the long-term growth rate would reduce the recoverable amount by 
£684 million and would also not result in any impairment being recognised in respect of PLHL.

Based on the assessment above, no impairment has been recorded in 2023 in respect of the investment in Group entities (2022: £nil).

For a list of principal Group entities, refer to note H6 of the consolidated financial statements in which the entities directly held by the Company 
are separately identified.

All loans and deposit balances are due from Group entities and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The fair 
value of these loans and deposits are also disclosed. None of the loans are considered to be overdue.

a  On 12 December 2018, the Company was assigned a £428 million subordinated loan by Phoenix Life Holdings Limited (‘PLHL’). The loan 

accrues interest at a rate of 6.675% and matures on 18 December 2025. This loan was initially recognised at fair value of £439 million and is 
amortised to par over the period to 2025. At 31 December 2023, the carrying value of the loan was £432 million (2022: £433 million). 

On 12 December 2018, the Company was assigned a £450 million subordinated loan by PLHL. The loan accrues interest at a rate of 4.158% 
and matured on 20 July 2022. On 20 July 2022, the amount due on the maturity of the subordinated loan of £450 million was advanced 
under a new loan to PLHL. The new loan accrues interest at a compounded rate of SONIA rate plus a margin of 1.30% and is capitalised. 
During the year interest of £27 million (2022: £7 million) was capitalised. The loan matures on 31 December 2027. At 31 December 2023, the 
carrying value of the loan was £484 million (2022: £457 million due under the subordinated loan). 

On 12 December 2018, the Company was assigned a US $500 million loan by PLHL due to mature in 2027 with a coupon of 5.375%. This 
loan was initially recognised at fair value of £349 million and is accreted to par over the period to 2027. Movement in foreign exchange 
during the period decreased the carrying value by £20 million (2022: £41 million increase). At 31 December 2023, the carrying value of the 
loan was £368 million (2022: £383 million).

b  On 13 September 2022, the Company entered into an uncommitted intra-group cash-pooling facility with certain subsidiaries, under which 
the Company will either borrow funds from, or lend funds to, the relevant subsidiary. All amounts due under the facility attract interest at 
SONIA and are repayable on demand. 

c  On 18 June 2019, the Company was assigned an interest free facility arrangement with Phoenix Group Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’). As at 
31 December 2023, the carrying value of the loan was £13 million (2022: £13 million). The loan is fully recoverable until the awards held in the 
EBT vest to the participants, at which point the loan is reviewed for impairment. Any impairments are determined by comparing the carrying 
value to the estimated recoverable amount of the loan. During the year funding of £12 million (2022: £12 million) was provided to the EBT and 
£12 million of the loan was impaired (2022: £12 million). 

d  On 31 December 2022, the Company issued a contingent loan of £718 million with RAL which accrues interest at a rate of SONIA plus 

2.95%. Loan repayments and interest payments are made quarterly in arrears. Repayment of principal each quarter is set at the amount of 
surplus emerging from a specified block of unit-linked business in RAL, less interest payable. RAL made the quarterly loan repayments due 
on 30 June and 30 September 2023, and repaid the loan in full on 21 December 2023.

For the purposes of the additional fair value disclosures for assets recognised at amortised cost, all loans and deposits are categorised as Level 3 
financial instruments. The fair value of loans and deposits with no external market is determined by internally developed discounted cash flow 
models using a risk adjusted discount rate corroborated with external market data where possible. 

Details of the factors considered in determination of fair value are included in note E2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Level 3 financial instrument sensitivities
The investment in debt securities is in respect of debt holdings in a property investment structure which was originally transferred to the 
Company via an in-specie dividend received from Old PGH during 2019. The holding was disposed of during the year ended 31 December 
2020, but a balance of £1 million remains in respect of a potential repayment of cash reserves that may be due to the Company. The amount 
recognised has taken account of both the uncertain nature of the value of the proceeds and when they will be received.

17. Capital and risk management
The Company’s capital comprises share capital, the Tier 1 Notes and all reserves as calculated in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as set out in the statement of changes in equity. Under English company law, dividends must be paid from 
distributable profits. As the ultimate parent undertaking of the Group, the Company manages its capital to ensure that it has sufficient 
distributable profits to pay dividends in accordance with its dividend policy. The distributable reserves of the Company as at 31 December 2023 
were £4,621 million (2022: £5,062 million). 

At 31 December 2023, total capital was £6,963 million (2022: £7,398 million). The movement in capital in the period comprises the total 
comprehensive income for the period attributable to owners of £79 million (2022: £116 million), dividends paid of £520 million (2022: 
£496 million), coupon paid on Tier 1 Notes, net of tax relief of £22 million (2022: £22 million), credit to equity for equity-settled share-based 
payments of £22 million (2022: £16 million) and issue of ordinary share capital of £6 million (2022: £4 million). 

In addition, the Group also manages its capital on a regulatory basis as described in note I3 to the consolidated financial statements. 

The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. The Company 
hedges its currency risk exposure arising on foreign currency hybrid debt. 

Details of the Group’s financial risk management policies are outlined in note E6 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort to assess whether 
there has been a significant increase in risk since initial recognition. This includes quantitative and qualitative information and forward-
looking analysis.

Loans and deposits – The Company is exposed to credit risk relating to loans and deposits from other Group companies, which are considered 
to be of low risk. Given their low risk, the loss allowance has been set at less than £1 million. The Company assesses whether there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition by assessing whether there have been any historic defaults, by reviewing the going 
concern assessment of the borrower and the ability of the Group to prevent a default by providing a capital or cash injection. Specific 
considerations for the loan to the Employee Benefit Trust are discussed in note 12.

Amounts due from other Group entities – The credit risk from activities undertaken in the normal course of business is considered to be 
extremely low. Given their low risk, the loss allowance has been set at less than £1 million. The Company assesses whether there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition by assessing past credit impairments, history of defaults and the long-term stability 
of the Group. 

Cash and cash equivalents – The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held with bank and financial institution counterparties which have 
investment grade ‘A’ credit ratings. The Company considers the associated credit risk is low based on the external credit ratings of the 
counterparties and, there being no history of default, the impact to the net carrying amount stated in the table above is therefore considered not 
to be material.

The Company writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and there is no 
realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the counterparty has been placed into liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. 
Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Company’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal 
advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss. 

18. Share-based payments
Detailed information on the Long-term incentive plans, Sharesave schemes and Deferred bonus share schemes is contained in note I1 in the 
consolidated financial statements.

19. Directors’ remuneration
Details of the remuneration of the Directors of Phoenix Group Holdings plc is included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 111 to 140

1  Off-balance sheet AUA represents assets held in respect of certain Group Self-Invested Personal Pension products where the beneficial ownership interest resides with the customer (and which are 

therefore not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position) but on which the Group earns fee revenue.

2  Assets held in Wrap Self-Invested Personal Pension (‘Wrap SIPP’) and Onshore Bond products the associated profits of which accrue to abrdn plc under a profit transfer arrangement have been 

excluded from AUA (see note H3 to the consolidated financial statements for further details).

All of the life companies’ debt securities are held at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2022: IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition & Measurement), and therefore already reflect any reduction in value between the date of purchase and the 
reporting date.

The life companies have in place a comprehensive database that consolidates credit exposures across counterparties, geographies and business 
lines. This database is used for credit monitoring, stress testing and scenario planning. The life companies continue to manage their balance 
sheets prudently and have taken extra measures to ensure their market exposures remain within risk appetite.

For each of the life companies’ significant financial institution counterparties, industry and other data has been used to assess the exposure of 
the individual counterparties. As part of the Group’s risk appetite framework and analysis of shareholder exposure to a potential worsening of the 
economic situation, this assessment has been used to identify counterparties considered to be most at risk from defaults. The financial impact on 
these counterparties, and the contagion impact on the rest of the shareholder portfolio, is assessed under various scenarios and assumptions. 
This analysis is regularly reviewed to reflect the latest economic outlook, economic data and changes to asset portfolios. The results are used to 
inform the Group’s views on whether any management actions are required.

The table below shows the Group’s market exposure analysed by credit rating for the shareholder debt portfolio, which comprises of debt 
securities held in the shareholder and non-profit funds.

FinancialsFinancialsMinimum capital requirements
Under the Solvency II regulations, the Minimum Capital Requirement (‘MCR’) is the minimum amount of capital an insurer is required to hold 
below which policyholders and beneficiaries would become exposed to an unacceptable level of risk if an insurer was allowed to continue its 
operations. For Groups this is referred to as the Minimum Consolidated Group SCR (‘MGSCR’).

The MCR is calculated according to a formula prescribed by the Solvency II regulations and is subject to a floor of 25% of the SCR or 
€4.0 million, whichever is higher, and a cap of 45% of the SCR. The MCR formula is based on factors applied to technical provisions and capital 
at risk. The MGSCR represents the sum of the MCRs of the underlying insurance companies.

The Eligible Own Funds to cover the MGSCR is subject to quantitative limits as shown below:

•  the Eligible amounts of Tier 1 items should be at least 80% of the MGSCR; and
•  the Eligible amounts of Tier 2 items shall not exceed 20% of the MGSCR.

PGH plc’s MGSCR at 31 December 2023 is £1.8 billion (2022: £2.3 billion).

PGH plc’s Eligible Own Funds to cover MGSCR is £7.9 billion (2022: £8.2 billion) leaving an excess of Eligible Own Funds over MGSCR of 
£6.1 billion (2022: £5.9 billion), which translates to an MGSCR coverage ratio of 432% (2022: 361%).

Composition of own funds
Own Funds items are classified into different Tiers based on the features of the specific items and the extent to which they possess the following 
characteristics, with Tier 1 being the highest quality:

•  availability to be called up on demand to fully absorb losses on a going-concern basis, as well as in the case of winding-up (‘permanent 

• 

availability’); and
in the case of winding-up, the total amount that is available to absorb losses before repayment to the holder until all obligations to 
policyholders and other beneficiaries have been met (‘subordination’).

PGH plc’s unrestricted Tier 1 capital accounts for 60% (2022: 61%) of total Own Funds and comprises ordinary share capital, surplus funds of the 
unsupported with-profit funds which are recognised only to a maximum of the SCR, and the accumulated profits of the remaining business.

Restricted Tier 1 capital comprises the contingent convertible Tier 1 Notes issued in January 2020 and the Tier 1 Notes issued in April 2018, the 
terms of which enable the instruments to qualify as restricted Tier 1 capital for regulatory reporting purposes. 

Tier 2 capital is comprised of subordinated notes whose terms enable them to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory reporting purposes.

Tier 3 items include the Tier 3 subordinated notes of £0.2 billion (2022: £0.2 billion) and the deferred tax asset of £0.4 billion (2022: £0.4 billion).

Breakdown of SCR
The Group operates one single PRA approved Internal Model covering all the Group entities, with the exception of the Irish entity, Standard Life 
International Designated Activity Company (‘SLIDAC’), the acquired ReAssure and SLF Canada UK Limited businesses. SLIDAC, ReAssure and 
SLF Canada UK Limited businesses calculate their capital requirements in accordance with the Standard Formula. An analysis of the pre-

FinancialsFinancialsAlternative performance measures 

APM

Definition

Why this measure is used

Reconciliation to financial statements

The Group assesses its financial performance based on a number of measures. Some measures are management derived measures of historic  
or future financial performance, position or cash flows of the Group; which are not defined or specified in accordance with relevant financial 
reporting frameworks such as International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) or Solvency II.

These measures are known as Alternative Performance Measures (‘APMs’).

APMs are disclosed to provide stakeholders with further helpful information on the performance of the Group and should be viewed as 
complementary to, rather than a substitute for, the measures determined according to IFRS and Solvency II requirements. Accordingly,  
these APMs may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies.

A list of the APMs used in our results as well as their definitions, why they are used and, if applicable, how they can be reconciled to the nearest 
equivalent GAAP measure is provided below. Further discussion of these measures can be found in the business review from page 30.

APMs marked with ‘NEW’ have been introduced in the period. IFRS adjusted shareholders’ equity has been introduced following the adoption  
of IFRS 17. New business net funds flows, Operating Cash Generation (‘OCG’), recurring management actions, Return on Capital (‘RoC’) and 
Solvency II leverage have been introduced to reflect the evolution of the Group’s strategy as described in the CEO’s Report and Our strategic 
priorities and KPIs and Directors Remuneration Report sections of the Annual Report. New business contribution (‘NBC’), BPA Capital Strain 
(Pre-Capital Management Policy) and BPA premiums written have been described in previous annual reports but as these have taken on more 
prominence are also marked as new.

APMs marked with ‘CHANGED’ have been amended from that disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts 2022. Fitch leverage ratio and 
adjusted operating profit have been amended to reflect the adoption of IFRS 17.

Adjusted operating profit is a financial 
performance measure based on expected 
long-term investment returns. It is stated  
before tax and non-operating items including 
amortisation and impairments of intangibles, 
finance costs attributable to owners and  
other non-operating items which in the  
Director’s view should be excluded by  
their nature or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of financial performance. 

Further details of the components of this  
measure and the assumptions inherent in the 
calculation of the long-term investment return  
are included in note B2.1 to the consolidated 
financial statements.

The Group’s Assets under Administration (‘AUA’) 
represents assets administered by or on behalf of 
the Group, covering both policyholder fund and 
shareholder assets. It includes assets recognised 
in the Group’s IFRS statement of consolidated 
financial position together with certain assets 
administered by the Group for which beneficial 
ownership resides with customers.

This measure provides a more 
representative view of the Group’s 
performance than the IFRS result after  
tax as it provides long-term performance 
information unaffected by short-term 
economic volatility and one-off items,  
and is stated net of policyholder finance 
charges and tax.

It helps give stakeholders a better 
understanding of the underlying 
performance of the Group by identifying  
and analysing non-operating items.

AUA indicates the potential earnings 
capability of the Group arising from  
its insurance and investment business.  
AUA flows provide a measure of the 
Group’s ability to deliver new business 
growth.

Represents the capital deployment on BPA 
measured on a Solvency II basis, before capital 
management policy, expressed as a proportion of 
the BPA Premium. 

BPA Capital Strain (Pre-Capital 
Management Policy) reflects how 
efficiently capital is deployed on  
BPA to deliver new business growth.

It is calculated as the capital deployed (being the 
Solvency II Technical Provisions plus SCR plus 
acquisition costs plus reinsurance premium less 
BPA Premium, net of tax) as a proportion of the 
BPA Premium.

Represents the aggregate, gross of reinsurance, 
new business premium volume for BPA business, 
measured at the risk transfer date, written in  
the period. 

BPA premiums written provides a  
measure of the Group’s ability to  
deliver new business growth.

A reconciliation of adjusted operating  
profit to the IFRS result before tax attributable 
to owners is included in the business review  
on page 36.

A reconciliation from the Group’s IFRS 
statement of consolidated financial position  
to the Group’s AUA is provided on page 308.

The capital deployed in writing BPA business  
is included within the new business strain 
component of the change in Solvency SII 
surplus in the period, as set out in the  
diagram on page 34. 

BPA premiums written is not directly 
reconcilable to the financial statements as 
premiums are no longer reported on the IFRS 
income statement. BPA premium written is 
included within the ‘Estimates of present value 
of future cash flows’ line on the effect of 
contracts initially recognised in the year in 
Note F8.1 for the Retirement Solutions 
disclosure group. 

Fitch leverage  
ratio

CHANGED

The Fitch leverage ratio is calculated by Phoenix 
(using Fitch Ratings’ stated methodology) as debt 
as a percentage of the sum of debt and equity. 
Debt is defined as the IFRS carrying value of 
shareholder borrowings. Equity is defined as the 
sum of equity attributable to the owners of the 
parent, non-controlling interests, contractual 
service margin (‘CSM’) (net of tax), policyholders’ 
share of the estate and the Tier 1 Notes.

The Group seeks to manage the level of 
debt on its balance sheet by monitoring  
its financial leverage position. One of the 
output metrics used in this regard is the 
Fitch leverage ratio. This is to ensure the 
Group maintains its investment grade  
credit rating as issued by Fitch Ratings.

The adjusted equity component of the Fitch 
leverage ratio is as set out below for the IFRS 
adjusted shareholders’ equity metric.

funds is a subset of Estimates of present value 
of future cash flows within insurance contract 
liabilities in Note F1 on page 226.

Group in force 
Long-term Free 
Cash (‘LTFC’)

Group in force Long-term Free Cash (‘LTFC’) 
comprised of long-term cash to emerge from 
in-force business, plus holding company cash,  
less an allowance for costs associated with  
in-flight mergers and acquisitions and the  
related transition activities, and a deduction  
for shareholder debt outstanding.

The calculation for the LTIP performance  
metric excludes any future shareholder dividends 
and is before interest on debt until maturity. 

LTFC provides a measure of the Group’s 
total long-term cash available for operating 
costs, interest, growth and shareholder 
returns. Increases in LTFC will be driven by 
sources of long-term cash i.e. new business 
and over-delivery of management actions. 
Decreases in LTFC will reflect the uses of 
cash at holding company level, including 
expenses, interest, investment in BPA and 
dividends. Is a measure in the 2023 LTIP. 

The metric is not directly reconcilable to the 
financial statements as it includes a significant 
component relating to cash that is expected to 
emerge in the future. Holding company cash 
included within LTFC is consistent with the 
holding company cash and cash equivalents as 
disclosed in the cash section of the business 
review. Shareholder debt outstanding reflects 
the face value of the shareholder borrowings 
disclosed on page 209.

IFRS adjusted 
shareholders’ 
equity

IFRS adjusted shareholders’ equity is calculated 
as IFRS Total equity attributable to owners of the 
parent plus the CSM, net of tax.

Adjusted shareholders’ equity provides  
a meaningful measure of the value 
generated by the Group, including the 
value held in the CSM for IFRS 17 contracts.

NEW

Incremental new 
business long-term 
cash generation

Incremental new business long-term cash 
generation represents the operating companies’ 
total cash generation that is expected to arise in 
future years as a result of new business transacted 
in the current period. It excludes any costs 
associated with the acquisition of the new business.

This measure provides an indication of the 
Group’s performance in delivering new 
business growth to offset the impact of 
run-off of the Group’s legacy business  
and to bring sustainability to future  
cash generation.

Life Company 
Free Surplus

This figure provides a view of the level of 
surplus capital in the Life Companies that is 
available for distribution to the holding 
companies, and the generation of Free 
Surplus underpins future Operating Cash 
Generation (‘OCG’).

deferred tax rate of 25%.

Incremental long-term cash generation is  
not directly reconcilable to the financial

Net fund flows

Represents the aggregate net position of gross 
AUA inflows less gross outflows. It is an in-year 
movement in the Group’s AUA. 

Net fund flows provides a measure  
of the Group’s ability to deliver new 
business growth. 

The measure provides an assessment  
of the day one value (excluding a cost  
of capital) arising on the writing of new 
business, and is stated after applicable  
tax and acquisition costs. This measure  
is a 2024 AIP metric. 

New business 
contribution 
(‘NBC’)

NEW

Represents the increase in Solvency II 
Shareholder Own funds arising from new 
business written in the year, assuming assets  
have been fully transitioned in to the pricing 
portfolio, and provides an assessment of the  
day one value (excluding a cost of capital)  
arising on the writing of new business on a 
discounted basis. It is adjusted to exclude  
(i) prudence in the Fundamental Spread,  
(ii) the associated risk margin and (iii) any 
restrictions in respect of contract boundaries.  
Is stated on a net of tax basis, is after acquisition 
costs and includes future year cash flows  
in which long term maintenance costs are 
deducted and therefore it excludes any  
short term cost overruns.

New business  
net fund flows 

Represents the aggregate net position of AUA 
inflows less outflows for new business written in 
the period.

New business net fund flows provides a 
measure of the Group’s ability to deliver 
new business growth

The measure provides the sources of 
recurring organic cash generated which 
can be used to support sustainable cash 
remittances from the Life Companies, 
which in turn supports the Group’s  
dividend as well as funding investment  
to generate sustainable growth.

Operating Cash 
Generation 
(’OCG’)

And

Operating  
Surplus  
Generation  
(‘OSG’)

NEW

Recurring 
management 
actions

NEW

Operating Cash Generation (’OCG’) is the 
emergence of cash on a Solvency II basis as 
surplus emerges (being the in-force business run 
off over time and capital unwind, plus day one 
surplus from writing new business (net of day  
1 strain for fee based business) plus group tax 
relief), plus recurring management actions.  
As a cash measure it will be reported in line with 
Life Company Free Surplus view and therefore  
is the excess of their Board approved capital 
according to their capital management policies. 

OCG before adjustment to reflect the release  
of capital management policy is referred to as 
Operating Surplus Generation (‘OSG’).

Recurring management actions are measured on 
a Solvency II basis and represent the Day 1 impact 
on Own Funds and SCR. They are management 
actions that are either genuinely repeatable, 
repeatable in nature but subject to diminishing 
returns or not repeatable but benefits are 
expected from similar types of actions

Net fund flows is not directly reconcilable  
to the financial statements as it includes 
movements in AUA which do not flow directly 
to the Group’s IFRS consolidated income 
statement. However, a reconciliation from  
the Group’s IFRS statement of consolidated 
financial position to the Group’s AUA is 
provided on page 308.

NBC is a subset of the new business element 
within Group’s Solvency II analysis of movement 
set out on page 34 and is adjusted for the 
items stated. 

New business net fund flows is not  
directly reconcilable to the financial 
statements. It is a subset of Net fund flows 
described below.

and one of the sources which can be used 
to support sustainable cash remittances 
from the Life Companies 

Recurring management actions are a subset  
of the Solvency II surplus generated in the 
period as shown in the diagram on page 34.

Policy for making pro forma adjustments in the Annual Report and Accounts
Pro forma adjustments will be used in the Annual Report and Accounts (‘ARA’) where management considers that they allow  
the users of the ARA to better understand the financial performance, financial position, cash flows or outlook of the Group. 

Examples of where pro forma adjustments may be used are in relation to acquisitions or disposals which are material to the Group,  
changes to the Group’s capital structure or changes in reporting frameworks the Group applies such as Solvency II or IFRS. Where pro 
forma adjustments are considered necessary for the understanding of the financial performance, financial position, cash flows or outlook  
of the Group these will be clearly labelled as pro forma with a clear explanation provided as to the reason for the adjustments and the  
Key Performance Indicators, Alternative Performance Metrics and other performance metrics impacted.

Return on  
Capital (’RoC’)

NEW

Reflects the Solvency II Own Funds component 
of the Operating Cash Generation (i.e. the 
inforce and new business surplus generation  
and group tax relief), less financing costs plus 
recurring management actions divided by 
Opening Unrestricted Core Tier 1 Shareholder 
Capital (‘UT1’) + Deferred tax assets (‘DTA’).  
At a high level, this could be more simply 
described as the operating growth in own  
funds less financing costs as a percentage  
of opening own funds excluding debt.

The RoC measure is intended to 
demonstrate our efficiency in allocating 
capital to generate returns for our 
shareholders. It will demonstrate if we are 
using our capital efficiently to generate 
optimal returns, performance and growth  
to deliver long term shareholder value.  
This measure is included in the 2024 LTIP.

Shareholder 
Capital Coverage 
Ratio

Represents total Eligible Own Funds divided  
by the Solvency Capital Requirements (‘SCR’), 
adjusted to a shareholder view through the 
exclusion of amounts relating to those ring-fenced 
with-profit funds and Group pension schemes 
whose Own Funds exceed their SCR.

Solvency II 
Leverage

NEW

Solvency II leverage is calculated as the Solvency 
II value of debt divided by the value of Solvency II 
Regulatory Own Funds. Values for debt are 
adjusted to allow for the impact of currency 
hedges in place over foreign currency 
denominated debt.

The unsupported with-profit funds and 
Group pension funds do not contribute to 
the Group Solvency II surplus. However, the 
inclusion of related Own Funds and SCR 
amounts dampens the implied Solvency II 
capital ratio. The Group therefore focuses 
on a shareholder view of the capital 
coverage ratio which is considered to  
give a more accurate reflection of the 
capital strength of the Group.

The Group are targeting a £500m 
reduction in debt over the medium term  
to deliver a SII leverage ratio of c30%

Cash remitted by the Group’s operating 
companies to the Group’s holding companies.

Total cash 
generation 
(formerly referred  
to as operating 
companies’ cash 
generation) 

The statement of consolidated cash  
flows prepared in accordance with  
IFRS combines cash flows relating to 
shareholders with cash flows relating  
to policyholders, but the practical 
management of cash within the Group 
maintains a distinction between the two. 
The Group therefore focuses on the cash 
flows of the holding companies which relate 
only to shareholders. Such cash flows are 
considered more representative of the  
cash generation that could potentially be 
distributed as dividends or used for debt 
repayment and servicing, Group expenses 
and pension contributions. 

Total cash generation is a key performance 
indicator used by management for planning, 
reporting and executive remuneration.

Share fraud warning to shareholders 
Over recent years, many companies have been informed that their 
shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas-
based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them 
what often turns out to be worthless or high-risk shares in US or UK 
investments. These operations are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’.

Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice,  
offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports about 
Phoenix Group:

•  Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.

•  Check that they are properly authorised by the Financial Conduct 

Authority (‘FCA’) before getting involved by visiting  
www.fca.org.uk/firms/systems-reporting/register.

•  Report the matter to the FCA by calling the FCA Consumer 

Helpline on +44 (0)800 111 6768.

• 

If the calls persist, hang up.

If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible  
to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. The FCA can also be contacted by completing an  
online form available at www.fca.org.uk/consumers/report-scam-
unauthorised-firm. Details of any share dealing facilities that  
Phoenix Group endorses will be included in our shareholder mailings.

genuinely repeatable, repeatable in nature but subject to diminishing 
returns or not repeatable but benefits are expected from similar 
types of actions.

Master Trust
A master trust is a defined contribution workplace pension scheme 
that is established under a trust. A master trust seeks to provide

prudence in the Fundamental Spread, (ii) the associated risk margin 
and (iii) any restrictions in respect of contract boundaries. Is stated  
on a net of tax basis, is after acquisition costs and includes future year 
cash flows in which long term maintenance costs are deducted and

Representative Concentration Pathway (‘RCP’) 
A GHG concentration trajectory adopted by the IPCC.  
The pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5) describe 
different climate futures, all of which are considered possible 
depending on the volume of GHGs emitted in the years to come. 
RCP 2.6 is a very stringent pathway. According to the IPCC,  
RCP 2.6 requires that carbon dioxide emissions start declining  
by 2020 and go to zero by 2100. In RCP 8.5, emissions continue  
to rise throughout the 21st century. It is generally taken as the basis  
for worst-case climate change scenario.

Return on shareholder value
Shareholder value reflects the group’s Eligible Own Funds adjusted  
to remove amounts pertaining to unsupported with-profit funds.

Generation (i.e. the inforce and new business surplus generation  
and group tax relief), less financing costs plus recurring management 
actions divided by Opening Unrestricted Core Tier 1 Shareholder 
Capital (UT1) + Deferred tax assets. At a high level, this could be more 
simply described as the operating growth in own funds less financing 
costs/opening own funds excluding debt. This is a LTIP performance 
metric for the 2024 grant.

developed in line with the scale of reductions required to keep global 
warming below 2C from pre-industrial levels, under recommendations 
by the SBT Institute (‘SBTi’).

Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions
Greenhouse gas emissions are categorised into three groups or 
‘Scopes’. Scope 1 covers direct emissions e.g. use of natural gas, 
company car vehicle emissions. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions

Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions (’TMTP’) is an 
allowance, subject to the PRA’s approval, to apply a transitional 
deduction to technical provisions. The transitional deduction 
corresponds to the difference between net technical provisions 
calculated in accordance with Solvency II principles and net 
technical provisions calculated in accordance with the previous 
regime and is expected to decrease linearly over a period of 16 years 
starting from 1 January 2016 to 1 January 2032. TMTP is subject  
to a mandatory recalculation every two years or on the occurrence  
of certain defined events.

Additional informationAdditional informationForward looking statements

Forward looking statements
The 2023 Annual Report and Accounts contains, and the Group  
may make other statements (verbal or otherwise) containing, forward 
looking statements and other financial and/or statistical data about 
the Group’s current plans, goals, ambitions,outlook, guidance and 
expectations relating to future financial condition, performance, 
results, strategy and/or objectives. Statements containing the  
words: ‘believes’, ‘intends’, ‘will’, ’may’, ‘should’, ‘expects’, ‘plans’, ‘aims’, 
‘seeks’, ‘targets’, ’continues’ and ‘anticipates’ or other words of similar 
meaning are forward looking. Such forward-looking statements and 
other financial and/or statistical data involve risk and uncertainty 
because they relate to future events and circumstances that are 
beyond the Group’s control. For example, certain insurance risk 
disclosures are dependent on the Group’s choices about assumptions 
and models, which by their nature are estimates. As such, actual 
future gains and losses could differ materially from those that the 
Group has estimated. Other factors which could cause actual  
results to differ materially from those estimated by forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to: 

•  domestic and global economic, political, social, environmental  

and business conditions; 

•  asset prices; 

•  market-related risks such as fluctuations in investment yields, 

interest rates and exchange rates, the potential for a sustained 
low-interest rate or high interest rate environment, and the 
performance of financial or credit markets generally; 

•  the policies and actions of governmental and/or regulatory 
authorities including, for example, climate change and the  
effect of the UK’s version of the ‘Solvency II’ regulations on  
the Group’s capital maintenance requirements; 

•  developments in the UK’s relationship with the European Union;

•  the direct and indirect consequences for European and global 
macroeconomic conditions of the conflicts in Ukraine and the 
Middle East, and related or other geopolitical conflicts; 

•  political uncertainty and instability;

•  the impact of changing inflation rates (including high inflation) 

and/or deflation; 

• 

information technology or data security breaches (including  
the Group being subject to cyber-attacks); 

•  the development of standards and interpretations including 
evolving practices in ESG and climate reporting with regard  
to the interpretation and application of accounting;

•  the limitation of climate scenario analysis and the models that 

analyse them;

• 

lack of transparency and comparability of climate-related 
forward-looking methodologies; 

•  climate change and a transition to a low-carbon economy 

(including the risk that the Group may not achieve its targets);

•  the Group’s ability along with governments and other  

stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts  
of climate change effectively;

•  market competition;

324

Phoenix Group Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023

•  changes in assumptions in pricing and reserving for insurance 
business (particularly with regard to mortality and morbidity 
trends, gender pricing and lapse rates); 

•  the timing, impact and other uncertainties of any acquisitions, 

disposals or other strategic transactions; 

•  risks associated with arrangements with third parties; 

• 

inability of reinsurers to meet obligations or unavailability  
of reinsurance coverage; and 

•  the impact of changes in capital, and implementing changes  
in IFRS 17 or any other regulatory, solvency and/or accounting 
standards, and tax and other legislation and regulations in the 
jurisdictions in which members of the Group operate. 

As a result, the Group’s actual future financial condition, 
performance and results may differ materially from the plans,  
goals, ambitions,outlook, guidance and expectations set out  
in the forward-looking statements and other financial and/or  
statistical data within the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.  
No representation is made that any of these statements will come  
to pass or that any future results will be achieved. As a result, you are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking 
statements contained in this 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.

The Group undertakes no obligation to update any of the  
forward-looking statements or data contained within the  
2023 Annual Report and Accounts or any other forward-looking 
statements or data it may make or publish. 

The 2023 Annual Report and Accounts has been prepared for  
the members of the Company and no one else. The Company,  
its Directors or agents do not accept or assume responsibility to  
any other person in connection with this document and any such 
responsibility or liability is expressly disclaimed. Nothing in the  
2023 Annual Report and Accounts is or should be construed as  
a profit forecast or estimate.

Caution about climate and sustainability related disclosures 
Climate and sustainability disclosures in the 2023 Annual Report  
and Accounts use a greater number and level of judgements, 
assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification 
of climate-related activities, than the Group’s reporting of historical 
financial information. These judgements, assumptions and estimates 
are highly likely to change over time, and, when coupled with the 
longer time frames used in these disclosures, make any assessment  
of materiality inherently uncertain. In addition, the Group’s climate 
risk analysis and net zero transition planning will continue to evolve 
and the data underlying the Group’s analysis and strategy remain 
subject to change over time. As a result, the Group expects that 
certain climate and sustainability disclosures made in the 2023 
Annual Report and Accounts are likely to be amended, updated, 
recalculated or restated in the future.
