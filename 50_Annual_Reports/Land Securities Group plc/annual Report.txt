Building on our 
competitive advantages 
First to opportunities, 
in shape to act 

Three years ago we set out our strategy to 
create sustainable value – focusing on areas 
where we have a genuine competitive 
advantage, underpinned by the strength of our 
balance sheet. Since then, we have sold mature 
London offices and made acquisitions that 
bring value, opportunity and long-term growth. 
And we’ve restructured our business to bring 
us closer to our customers and better able to 
take advantage of the changes on the horizon.

High-quality offices, in the right locations, 
continue to attract new businesses and 
talent; the future of major retail destinations 
is more positive than many people thought 
three years ago; and there remains a structural 
need to remodel city centres in a sustainable 
way. With flexibility on the timing of any 
future capital commitments, we are ready 
to seize the opportunities this new market 
environment presents. 

But our strategy is about more than buildings. 
It’s built on a vision and commitment to 
shape successful and sustainable urban places 
where our customers can achieve their goals 
and our communities can realise their potential. 
With the quality of our portfolio, expertise 
of our people and strength of our customer 
relationships underpinning our business, this 
strategy is the right one and we are well 
positioned to continue to pursue it.

Chairman’s statement

 “It has been a year of 
activity and progress 
against objectives, 
despite the backdrop of 
a challenging market as 
interest rates have risen.”

Cressida Hogg
Chairman

This is our third year executing 
on a clear strategy for the 
business under Mark and 
his team. 

Progressing our Strategy
In Central London we have continued 
developing best-in-class assets, while 
recycling capital where appropriate. 
During the year we sold 21 Moorfields, EC2, 
a complex development nearing completion 
that showcased Landsec’s deep development 
expertise during the life of the project. We 
also sold One New Street Square, a recent 
development as part of a larger estate, 
let on a long lease to Deloitte. These two 
significant sales in the City reduce our overall 
exposure to this sub-market, and re-balance 
our portfolio towards London’s West End 
and a portfolio increasingly focused on 
the best quality space. We have several 
developments ongoing in the rest of London 
and are seeing healthy demand for flexible 
and environmentally friendly space amongst 
a wide range of customers. 

We have also continued to strengthen our 
retail portfolio, signing exciting new lettings 
in our major retail destinations and acquiring 
the outstanding 50% of St David’s centre 
in Cardiff that we did not already own. We 
continue to focus on investing as appropriate 
in our leading retail destinations, which 
post-pandemic have recovered well, proving 
that consumers value the experience of the 
best physical retail. 

We have made progress on some exciting 
mixed-use opportunities as well, and our 
team has shown creativity and resilience 
unlocking some complex opportunities in 
London and Manchester. For example we 
obtained planning consent for our 1,800 
homes masterplan at a site on the Finchley 
Road previously used for retail. 

Managing returns
While our strategy has remained clear and 
appropriate, the external macroeconomic 
environment over the last year has been 
difficult in the UK. Rising inflation and 
interest rates have created headwinds for

Introduction to Sir Ian Cheshire
On behalf of the Board I would like 
to thank Cressida for her invaluable 
contribution during her time on the 
Board and as Chairman of Landsec. 
The business has benefited considerably 
from her experience and leadership. 
Cressida’s influence and oversight have 
been significant in getting us to the 
strong strategic position we are in 
today, despite the significant challenges 
faced by this business during the 
pandemic and more recent 
macroeconomic challenges.

I am excited and honoured to be taking 
over as Chair at a time of opportunity 
for significant development of the 
business in the coming years. 

Since joining the Board in March, I have 
spent time visiting Landsec locations 
and meeting members of the senior 
team and getting to understand 
more about the business. I am hugely 
impressed with the work Mark and his 
team are leading to drive the business 
forwards with strategic investments 
and disposals, stronger customer focus 
and operational performance and a 
more agile culture. 

I am looking forward to working with 
Mark and the Board on behalf of all 
of our stakeholders, to continue with 
this clear strategic momentum.

Non-executive Director  
and Chair Designate

innovation in our developments and have 
just completed The Forge in Southwark, 
our first Net Zero carbon building powered 
entirely by renewable energy. Science Based 
Targets are once again embedded in the ESG 
objectives in management remuneration 
schemes (see page 109). 

Board changes
Good governance continues to be 
fundamental to the long-term success 
of Landsec, and in line with governance 
guidelines this will be my last letter to you 
as I hand over to my successor. It has been 
a privilege to serve nine years on the Landsec 
Board, five as your Chairman. We announced 
in January that Sir Ian Cheshire will succeed 
me. Ian has already joined the Board, and 
brings deep experience as a chair and leader 
to Landsec. I hope some of you will have the 
opportunity to meet him around the AGM. 

There have been other Board changes of 
note during the year. Colette O’Shea stepped 
down as COO of the Company, following 
a restructuring of the executive team. 
Colette had been with Landsec for many 
years and made a significant contribution 
to the development and management 
of our portfolio, in London in particular. 
The Board is grateful for the commitment, 
insight and empathy she brought, and we 
wish her well for the future. 

We welcomed Miles Roberts to the Board 
in September. Miles is a serving CEO, and 
also brings deep experience as a NED across 
several sectors. He has been a very positive 
addition to the Board and Committees. 

Looking forward 
Overall the Board is confident that Landsec 
is well positioned relative to others in the 
sector, with a clear and appropriate 
strategy and strong management team to 
deliver it. I would like to thank our Landsec 
colleagues for all their efforts over the year. 
Going forward I wish the Company, the 
Board and stakeholders all future success.

Cressida Hogg
Chairman

business, and rising yields have driven 
down valuations, with a knock on impact 
on share prices. As a business we have 
re-focused on the levers within our control 
as we await more stable conditions. 

The Board and management are always 
focused on disciplined capital allocation, 
and managing the balance sheet 
effectively. Against a backdrop of rising 
interest rates and reducing values, our 
proactive approach to disposals means 
that our loan to value ratio has nonetheless 
fallen and stands at a sustainable 31.7%. 
We were pleased with the issue of our 
innovative Green bond in March as part 
of our ongoing bond issuance programme. 

A key part of our strategy is to provide 
shareholders with a predictable dividend 
each year, underpinned by high-quality 
earnings across our portfolio. The Board 
is focused on the resilience of underlying 
earnings, and factors in income 
considerations when approving sales or 
investments. The organisational review 
undertaken this year should generate 
efficiencies to offset inflation in the near 
term. We appreciate that for most of 
our shareholders our dividends are an 
important attraction, especially when 
capital returns are volatile. 

Our organisation and culture
Since Mark joined the business we have 
been focused on ensuring that Landsec is 
fit for the future, especially in light of the 
upheavals in our market caused by the 
pandemic and macroeconomic change. 
Over the last year the structure of the 
organisation has been re-aligned to our 
future strategy, becoming flatter and 
more streamlined. We have added external 
customer facing, data and technology 
skills to our senior team, and we now have 
a clear roadmap for digital transformation. 
While we have been sad to see some 
long-term colleagues leave as part of this 
project, we are very positive about the 
impact on our culture and efficiency that 
these changes are bringing. We continue 
to be committed to making Landsec’s 
workforce truly reflective of the diverse 
customers and communities that we serve 
see pages 35-38. 

Our sustainability agenda
We continue to be proud of our sector-
leading position on sustainability issues, but 
are not complacent with the level of change 
and investment that will be needed to make 
our existing assets more environmentally 
friendly. We are also driving necessary

Chief Executive’s statement

 “Having made considerable 
progress on our strategy 
over the last couple of years, 
Landsec is well placed to 
drive long-term growth.”

Mark Allan
Chief Executive

Actively executing on our strategy. 
Well positioned in a changing market.
The strategy we launched in late 2020 was 
based on two key principles of sustainable 
value creation: focusing our resources 
where we have a genuine competitive 
advantage, and maintaining a strong 
balance sheet. Back then, interest rates 
and property yields in many sectors were 
at or near all-time low levels, making 
asset values in these sectors look expensive, 
yet since then external market conditions 
have changed materially, in particular 
over the last 12 months. Despite enduring 
customer demand driving rents and 
occupancy higher, increasing interest rates 
meant the value of our portfolio was down 
7.7% for the year, as an average 50bps rise 
in valuation yields offset an overall 3.6% 
ERV growth.

Whereas many slowed or paused activity 
in response, we have remained active, 
pragmatic and future-focused in executing 
our strategy during the year. We sold £1.4bn 
of London offices where our ability to add 
further value was limited, bringing total 
office disposals since late 2020 to £2.2bn, 
with an average yield of 4.4%, on average 
just 4% below book value. We selectively 
invested where we saw value, for example 
buying the debt secured on St David’s, 
Cardiff at an implied property yield of 9.7%. 
We kept to programme on new developments 
by committing to early works during the 
political turmoil in the autumn whilst 
keeping flexibility on c. £400m of future 
spend, which we now expect to commit 
to shortly. And we issued a £400m Green 
bond, to pro-actively extend our sector-
leading debt maturities even further.

Our areas of competitive advantage remain: 
i) our high-quality portfolio; ii) the strength 
of our customer relationships; and iii) our 
ability to unlock complex opportunities 
through our development and asset 
management expertise. Despite the change 
in market conditions, these strengths are 
clearly reflected in our strong operational 
performance during the year and we expect 
these to persist going forward.

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023005

This is important for a number of reasons. 
Firstly, the strategy we set out in late 2020 
was never built on a premise that low 
interest rates would persist forever. Neither 
are our actions now based on the hope that 
markets will just “return to normal” and 
interest rates come back down sharply if 
we wait long enough. They might, but this 
seems unlikely to us and hope is not a 
strategy, so we have not and will not base 
our decision-making on this. Our disposal 
of £1.4bn of mature offices over the past 
year is testament to this.

Secondly, and most importantly, this 
adjustment plays directly to the strengths we 
have been building since late 2020. At that 
time, it was difficult for us to find value in 
a world where excess liquidity and zero 
interest rates meant there was invariably 
someone prepared to borrow more at 
artificially low costs and pay more. However, 
since last summer, property values have 
been quick to adjust to the new reality of 
a higher cost of capital, similar to equities 
and bonds. The full effect of increased 
borrowing costs will likely only work its 
way through the system over time, but 
this should lead to attractive opportunities 
for us. 

Since late 2020 our focus has been on 
i) focusing our new investment where 
we have a genuine competitive advantage 
that enables us to create long-term value; 
ii) the sale of £2.2bn of London offices 
where yields were low and we had little 
opportunity to add further value; and 
iii) maintaining capital discipline. As a 
result, we are well placed now.

To further support this, improve scalability 
and increase pace, we started a review of 
our operating model a year ago, with a 
view of creating a more agile, efficient 
culture, with less internal complexity and 
more external focus. We have built, or are 
on track to build, market-leading operating 
platforms in each of the three areas we 
operate in. We have started to see the 
benefits from this so despite high inflation, 
we expect overhead costs for the current 
year to reduce slightly vs last year. 
Supplemented by ongoing investment in 
our systems, we have clear visibility on the 
further efficiencies this will drive over time. 

Whilst part of the property market is busy 
looking backwards to deal with leverage 
or refinancing issues, we have the rare 
opportunity to look forward to future 
growth. Part of this will be funded by our 
significant headroom and residual c. £1.6bn 

This is supported by the strength of our 
capital base. With a 31.7% LTV and net 
debt/EBITDA of 7.0x at the year-end our 
leverage is low; at 10.3 years our average 
debt maturity is long; and we have no need 
to refinance any debt until 2026. We have 
also created more optionality in our 
attractive pipeline and as a result of our 
strategic choices and decisive action since 
late 2020, we are well placed to take 
advantage of the opportunities that will 
undoubtedly emerge in a new higher rate, 
higher yield environment.

Delivering continued growth 
in operational results 
As people choose to spend time together 
in inspiring places, be it to work, shop or 
spend their leisure time, our customers 
increasingly focus on the best space in the 
best locations to attract the right talent 
and consumers. Building on the positive 
momentum our focus on growing customer 
relationships has started to drive over the 
past three years, we have delivered further 
growth in operational results. 

EPRA EPS for the year increased to 53.1 
pence, or 50.1 pence on an underlying basis, 
excluding the benefit of a £22m increase 
in surrender premiums received during the 
year. Underlying EPRA EPS was up 4.4% 
vs the prior year, towards the high end 
of our guidance of low to mid-single digit 
percentage growth. This was supported by 
growth in like-for-like net rental income of 
6.0%, which more than offset the impact 
from our £1.4bn of disposals and our 
significant deleveraging. In line with growth 
in underlying earnings, our dividend for the 
year is up 4.3% to 38.6 pence, reflecting a 
dividend cover of 1.3 times.

Our strong leasing activity drove 3.6% 
ERV growth, with positive growth across all 
four segments of our portfolio, reflecting 
its enduring appeal to customers. Still, 
the sharp increase in bond yields over 
the past 12 months put upwards pressure 
on valuation yields, leaving our overall 
portfolio value down 7.7% for the year. 
Notwithstanding our strong operational 
results and growth in earnings, EPRA NTA 
per share therefore was down 11.9% to 936 
pence, resulting in a total return on equity 
of -8.3%. 

Our strategy 
Our strategy is focused on three areas – 
Central London offices, major retail 
destinations and mixed-use urban 
neighbourhoods. Each of these benefits 
from growing demand for high-quality, 
sustainable space, which continues to drive 
rental growth. Whilst the proportions of use 
differ, there is increasingly more that unites 
these areas than divides them, as the lines 
between where people want to work, live 
and spend their leisure time blur. What 
binds these areas together is the enduring 
importance of a sense of place.

Whilst our strategic focus remains the 
right one, economic and financial market 
conditions have changed materially over 
the past year. Interest rates have risen 
sharply in response to higher inflation and 
credit conditions are tightening, resulting 
in reduced lending and increased credit 
margins. It is impossible for us to predict 
where interest rates will settle over time, 
but taking a long-term view, it seems clear 
to us that the ultra-low rates over the prior 
decade were the aberration, not the 
adjustment over the past year.

Chief Executive’s statement  
continued

capital recycling programme. However, 
the extent of the opportunity in our office 
and mixed-use pipelines, and for accretive 
external growth, is such that this will likely 
exceed our own balance sheet capacity 
over time. Capital discipline remains our 
priority, so we plan to explore opportunities 
to enhance our own investment in future 
growth with other sources of capital, to 
accelerate our overall growth, capitalise 
on the platform value we are creating, 
and enhance our return on equity. 

Creating value through our 
competitive advantages
Our value creation remains underpinned 
by our key competitive advantages: our 
high-quality portfolio; the strength of 
our customer relationships; and our 
ability to unlock complex opportunities. 
Customer demand continues to bifurcate, 
with growing demand for modern, 
sustainable space in those locations with 
the best amenities in London and fewer, 
but bigger and better stores in key locations 
in retail. Supply of both is limited, which is 
driving growth in rental values across our 
core portfolio.

In London, where 74% of our portfolio 
is now located in the vibrant West End 
and Southwark markets, up from 58% 
in 2020, we completed £43m of leases, 
on average 3% above ERV, with a further 
£6m in solicitors’ hands, 19% ahead of ERV. 
As a result, occupancy increased 110bps 
to 95.9% and at 99.5% occupancy our 
West End offices are effectively full – both 
substantially ahead of the wider market. 
This drove 4.7% ERV growth, which is at the 
high end of our guidance. As demand for 
grade A space remains strong and supply is 
low, we expect continued low to mid single 
digit percent ERV growth this year.

Across our major retail destinations, where 
we selectively expanded our presence with 
our investments in Bluewater in late 2021 
and St David’s in March, we signed £27m 
of new lettings, on average 8% above ERV. 
This was 35% higher than the prior year 
and occupancy of 94.3% was up 110bps 
during the year, highlighting the value 

our revitalised platform and growing 
brand relationships are starting to drive. 
Despite cost of living challenges, we 
continue to see few signs of any let-up 
in demand for space, with £11m of lettings 
in solicitors’ hands 11% above ERV, up 28% 
vs this time last year. Our portfolio saw 
0.9% ERV growth last year and we expect 
low to mid single digit percentage ERV 
growth this year.

Our positive outlook for rental value growth 
reflects the high quality of our portfolio, 
as we expect overall demand for space will 
continue to rationalise in both retail and 
offices. We expect this will start to lead 
to a growing divergence in asset pricing. 
Investment activity remains thin and so 
the emerging stabilisation of values in 
recent months needs to be viewed in that 
context, yet we expect values for the best 
assets to stabilise and return to growth well 
before those where long-term structural 
demand is questionable.

This is supplemented by our ability to 
unlock complex opportunities, such as 
the discounted purchase of the debt on 
St David’s from two separate lenders; the 
resolution to grant planning consent we 
obtained for our 1,800-homes masterplan 
at Finchley Road; the deal we agreed with 
our JV partners at Mayfield, which gives us 
full control of the first phase of this unique 
site; our success at 21 Moorfields, where our 
well-timed sale crystallised £145m of profit 
on cost; the 17.5-year lease extension with 
one of our top-10 customers, temporarily 
moving them across our estate whilst we 
undertake net-zero upgrade works to their 
existing offices; or the pre-letting of 60% 
of our current London pipeline well ahead 
of ERV.

Looking ahead, this also provides us with 
a clear competitive advantage in terms 
of future opportunities. We now have a 
1.1m sq ft consented office pipeline in the 
West End and Southwark, deliverable into 
a window of a significant shortage of 
sustainable Grade A supply, and we could 
potentially start on site with two major 
mixed-use regeneration schemes later this 

year. In addition, we continue to see value 
in major retail destinations, where asset 
values have already repriced materially 
and our differentiated platform provides 
us with the ability to drive income growth. 
We also anticipate refinancing events could 
potentially unearth other opportunities, 
such as to acquire and upgrade well-located 
London offices in need of repositioning. 

Driving returns
We remain decisive in our capital allocation 
decisions – focusing squarely on the future 
returns we expect our investments to 
generate, rather than any historical book 
value. The £1.4bn of offices we sold during 
the year are a good example of this. The 
two principal assets in this had generated 
an attractive 10% IRR over the period we 
had held them, but our expected forward 
return from the price on offer was in the 
mid-single digits. As this is below our 
return ambitions and other investment 
opportunities available to us, such as those 
outlined above, we decided to sell. We will 
maintain this clear discipline in the future.

Overall, we now target a total return on 
equity of 8-10% over time, reflecting a 
combination of income returns and capital 
growth driven by rental value growth and 
development upside. Short-term market 
fluctuations in valuation yields, which are 
outside of our control, mean that our return 
on equity is unlikely to be exactly within this 
range every individual year, as we have seen 
over the past 12 months, but this return 
target is what we base our medium-term 
decisions on.

Within this, we are focused on growing our 
high-quality earnings. Income has always 
been important, but especially so when 
valuations and hence NTAs reflect a greater 
degree of subjectivity, given that market 
evidence is thin. The fact that since last 
summer, our disposals made up c. 40% of 
all investment activity in the City and that 
there have been no transactions in major 
retail destinations underlines this. We are 
already in a strong position on this, with an 
attractive earnings yield at NTA of over 5%. 
This has now almost fully absorbed the

 • our portfolio is well-located and its 

quality is high, which are decisive factors 
for our customers; 

 • our balance sheet strength is sector-

leading, with 7.0x net debt/EBITDA and 
10.3-year debt maturity; 

 • we have sold over £2bn of mature assets, 

creating capacity to invest in higher-
return opportunities; 

 • we have created an attractive and 

profitable pipeline, with flexibility on 
future commitments. 

Reflecting the continued strong demand 
for our best-in-class space, we expect to 
see low to mid single digit ERV growth in 
London and major retail destinations this 
year. We plan to continue to monetise 
assets where our ability to add further value 
is limited, so taking into account that we 
will likely sell more than we buy in the short 
term, we expect EPRA EPS for this year to 
be broadly stable at last year’s underlying 
level, before returning to growth the year 
after. Having made considerable progress 
on our strategy over the last couple of 
years, Landsec is well placed to drive 
long-term growth and although we are 
mindful of the wider economic challenges, 
we are excited about the future.

reset in retail rents over the past few years, 
which has been offset by the recovery 
from the pandemic and growth in London. 
For the past year, this resulted in 4.4% 
growth in underlying EPRA EPS – towards 
the high end of our guidance of low to mid 
single digit growth for the year.

Looking forward, higher interest costs and 
cost inflation are a headwind to earnings 
across every sector, but this is compensated 
by the strengths of our business and the 
successful execution of our strategy:
 • our long 10.3-year debt maturity, which 
provides visibility and underpins our 
sustainability of earnings; 

 • our capital recycling out of mature and 
subscale assets, into developments or 
acquisitions which offer greater potential 
to add value and generate higher income 
and total returns; 

 • our growth in like-for-like income, 

reflecting the strong demand for our 
high-quality space, especially from next 
year onwards once the last historically 
over-rented leases in retail have reset.

For the year to March 2024, we expect 
EPRA EPS to be broadly stable vs last year’s 
underlying level of 50.1 pence, as we expect 
the positive impact from continued strong 
operational performance and like-for-like 
rental growth to be more or less offset by 
the fact that we have been – and in the 
near term will likely remain – a net seller 
of assets. This year we will also see the last 
over-rented leases in retail resetting, the 
start-up cost of opening three new Myo 
locations, and ongoing investment in our 
systems, which have a combined impact 
on earnings of c. £10m. We therefore expect 
EPRA EPS to return to growth for the year 
to March 2025. As our dividend cover is 
currently at the high end of our 1.2-1.3x 
range, we expect our dividend to grow by 
a low single digit percentage per year over 
these two years.

Delivering sustainably
Eighteen months ago we were the first UK 
REIT to set out a detailed net zero transition 
investment plan. We continue to progress 
the implementation of this, as delivery of 
this plan will ensure we stay ahead of the 
Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard 
Regulations, which require a minimum 
EPC B certification by 2030, as well as 
other regulatory requirements. So far our 
work has been focused on optimising 
building management systems and 
conducting the detailed design to install air 
source heat pumps in our office buildings. 

This is on track and the benefit of this in 
terms of higher EPC ratings will start to 
become visible from 2025 onwards, once 
our first new air source heat pumps 
become operational. 

Shortly after the year-end, we also updated 
our carbon reduction targets to align with 
the Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) 
new Net-Zero Standard, as we remain 
committed to reaching net zero in the long 
term. We have committed to a near-term 
target of reducing our direct and indirect 
greenhouse gas emissions by 47% by 2030 
from a 2020 baseline and have committed 
to reach net zero by 2040 from the same 
baseline year. This target now covers 
emissions from all sources, including all of 
our reported scope 3 emissions such as the 
emissions from our development pipeline, 
supply chain and customers. 

During the year, the energy intensity of our 
portfolio increased marginally compared 
to last year, when utilisation was lower 
in the first months of the year after the 
emergence out of lockdown. Still our energy 
intensity was 16.6% below pre-pandemic 
levels and 33.2% below our 2013/14 baseline, 
so we remain firmly on track to reduce 
energy intensity by our targeted 45% by 
2030. Aside from our net zero investments, 
we continue to focus on energy efficiency 
measures and have expanded the 
collaborative work with our largest 
customers to help them identify ways 
to save energy. 

Outlook
Our strategy continues to be grounded 
in our purpose; Sustainable places. 
Connecting communities. Realising 
potential. In executing this, we continue 
to be led by three things: delivering 
sustainably, delivering for our customers, 
and being disciplined with our capital. 

We expect global economic and financial 
uncertainty to remain elevated in the near 
future. The transition from a decade of 
ultra-loose monetary policy to a materially 
higher rate environment was never going 
to be a smooth one. The reversal of decades 
of globalisation and associated inflationary 
pressures will also continue to affect 
economic prospects, for the UK further 
exacerbated by the impact of Brexit. 
Positively, the political situation in the UK 
has stabilised somewhat since late last year 
and despite all uncertainties, our strategic 
decisions since late 2020 mean we are in 
great shape for any eventuality:

The UK real estate market
The real estate investable market in the 
UK is estimated to be valued at £920bn, 
with assets across a wide range of sectors 
including offices, industrial, healthcare, 
retail and residential. Rather than try to 
invest in all areas, and spread our 
management focus too thinly, we currently 
focus on three. These are: Central London 
offices, Major retail destinations and 
Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods – areas 
where we have sources of competitive 
advantage and expertise to be able to 
maximise the value from our portfolio.

The performance of real estate is a 
combination of the movement in values 
and rent. Over the last year, global political 
and economic factors, such as the war in 
Ukraine and the increase in inflation and 
interest rates, have depressed property 
values as yields have increased as a result 
of uncertainty and higher policy rates. 
Conversely, property in general has seen 
a strong operational recovery as the 
effects of Covid diminish and the utilisation 
of physical space has increased.

Major retail destinations

Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods

009

Urban mixed-use is an opportunity area 
for Landsec. The varied potential uses are 
supported by long-term trends, and our 
scale, existing pipeline, and ability to 
complete complex schemes, mean we are 
well placed to become a leading player in 
this market.

The concept of individual localities (or even 
potentially buildings) being reserved for a 
single use is weakening, and there is an 
increasing desire to see a mix of living, 
working and leisure within distinct 
neighbourhoods. The appeal of this further 
strengthened during the pandemic and we 
expect it to be sustained, with convenience 
being a key motivation in a society where 
time is an increasingly precious commodity.

In addition, quality of life, health, wellbeing 
and environmental sustainability are all 
important themes, and political and 
societal awareness of these factors has 
increased considerably in recent times. 
Done well, mixed-use urban communities 
can achieve strong returns, as the appeal 
of the location and amenity increases 
values across phases of development – 
known as placemaking.

At the same time, certain areas of cities 
are rapidly becoming redundant and in need 
of regeneration. There is increasing political 
will behind redevelopment projects, but 
they are complex and there are very few 
developers with the scale and skills required.

From this perspective, developing strong 
public-sector partnerships is critical to 
success. Not only are they political 
stakeholders, but in many cases their 
participation will be key to accessing 
development land – with U+I’s Mayfield 
project in Manchester a case in point.

London is well set to continue its position 
as Europe’s pre-eminent global gateway 
city. It has a unique ecosystem that 
combines a rich network of world-class 
universities, renowned research centres, 
innovative small businesses and global 
industry players. Alongside its global reach, 
London’s ability to attract and retain talent 
continues to be a competitive advantage, 
and its reputation as a safe haven is 
particularly valuable in times of turmoil.

It is clear the way people are using offices 
has changed for the long term. We estimate 
that changing working patterns and office 
use will result in long-term demand for 
office space reducing by 20%. However, 
while overall demand will be lower, we 
believe the demand for the best-quality 
space will remain robust. By this, we mean 
modern, well-configured space in great 
locations, with amenities and excellent 
sustainability credentials.

The demand for flexible space continues 
to grow as both established and new 
businesses are looking to occupy space 
that meets today’s flexible-working needs. 
Conventional space, occupied over a longer 
length of lease, will still play a critical role; 
but successful property companies need to 
provide a range of spaces offering different 
products. Creating workplaces as overt 
displays of a company’s culture, and places 
that facilitate the benefits of collaborating 
in person, will stimulate creativity and, 
ultimately, productivity. We expect this 
trend to continue, alongside the growing 
requirement to ensure offices meet the 
minimum credentials for sustainability by 
2030. As a result, the divergence in the 
performance and resilience of the best 
space, compared with secondary space, 
is likely to widen. 

The last 12 months have seen a significant 
repricing of office values as yields have 
increased as a result of higher interest rates 
and weaker global economic conditions. 
The occupational market continues to 
perform well, with take-up of office space 
up 6.9% and the vacancy rate reducing 
to 8.3%.

The retail market has experienced a number 
of significant changes in recent years 
including the material increase in online 
retail and the change in consumer habits 
caused by the pandemic. The current 
economic environment is also a challenge, 
with retailers facing higher costs due to 
inflation, and consumer disposable income 
facing pressure from higher energy and 
food costs, and higher interest rates. 

It is clear there remains too much physical 
retail space in the UK: perhaps up to 25% 
of this space will be converted to alternative 
uses such as leisure or residential space. 
But physical retail is not dead. The best 
space is thriving. There is clear consumer 
demand for shopping centres with an 
attractive mix of retail, leisure and hospitality, 
but all these elements must be present for 
shopping centres to thrive. And brand 
partners with omnichannel strategies are 
looking for the right space to support their 
online businesses. 

One other significant dramatic change in 
recent years is the cost of physical spaces 
compared with online retailing. Physical 
retail sales have recovered to pre-Covid 
levels, whereas rents are still c. 35% below 
their 2017 peak. In addition, the latest rates 
review came into effect in April this year 
and this has reduced the rates in retail 
assets by c. 30%. At the same time, the 
costs of marketing and delivery for online 
retail have increased significantly over the 
same period. 

The effect of all of these trends is an increase 
in demand from retailers for physical space 
in high-quality retail destinations. Over the 
last 12 months, we have seen this in our 
shopping centres, with 21 brands upsizing 
their space, and 14 brands moving from 
secondary sites to relocate within our 
centres (a ‘flight to prime’).

This demand for physical space has also 
been seen in shopping patterns. Shoppers 
are choosing to spend their money in store, 
rather than online. 

As a result of these trends, we expect 
investment activity to continue to grow. 
Shopping centre yields are high compared 
to other markets and sectors. With the 
prospect of rental income growth, the 
future returns look attractive. This provides 
a cyclical investment opportunity, as there 
are few investors with both the capital and 
operational expertise required.

To achieve our purpose, we need to understand our stakeholders, and the most effective way of 
asking for their input and support. As the nature of commercial real estate is becoming much 
more operational, we need to work even more closely with our customers and other stakeholders.

Who are they?

Why are they  
important to us? 

What do they want  
from us? 

How do we engage  
with them?

Everyone who uses our 
buildings. Our office 
occupiers’ employees and 
their visitors. Our brand 
partners and guests in our 
retail and leisure assets, 
and residents in the 
accommodation we build.

Everyone employed 
directly by Landsec.

Serving our customers is the reason  
we exist. Our occupiers provide us  
with rental income. Our reputation 
depends on meeting the needs of  
all our customers.

Our people put our strategy  
into practice, live our culture,  
and enable us to achieve our 
purpose. Ultimately, they create 
value for our stakeholders.

Those who live in areas 
where we work or where  
we have assets. For 
example, local residents, 
businesses, schools and 
charities.

We want our buildings and activities  
to have a positive impact on the local 
community. To achieve this, we need 
to have good relationships and 
understand local people’s needs.

Customers want us to 
understand and respond to their 
changing needs. That means 
providing sustainable, efficient, 
fabulous space and services 
that enhance their working, 
shopping, leisure and living 
experiences.

Our employees want a  
great career, and a positive  
and motivating work 
environment where they can 
thrive, underpinned by  
a supportive culture that  
embraces diversity  
and inclusion.

Local people want us to  
enhance the physical and  
social infrastructure in their  
area, helping their community 
thrive. They also want us to 
provide the right mix of  
services for their needs. 

We meet our customers regularly 
to understand what’s important 
to them and evaluate the service 
we provide.

We use engagement surveys,  
our Employee Forum, weekly 
updates from across the business 
and ‘town hall’ presentations, 
alongside relevant training and 
development programmes. And we 
have recently launched a new 
recognition platform to celebrate 
those who bring our purpose to life.

Our activities range from providing 
work experience and routes to 
employment, to helping students 
and addressing local socio-economic 
needs. We consult local communities 
ahead of all development activity 
and maintain the relationships 
following completion. Our 
Community Charter sets out a list 
of commitments that we, as a 
responsible developer and landlord, 
must stick to in order to fulfil our 
purpose.

Those who own shares 
in Landsec, and our 
bondholders. 

Investors provide capital to the 
business, as well as valuable 
feedback on our performance 
and strategic options. 

Investors want a clearly 
articulated long-term strategy, 
together with shorter-term 
plans and effective 
communication of our progress. 

Formal results presentation every 
six months plus capital market 
days as appropriate. Financial 
institutions and debt providers 
meet our management regularly. 
We hold an AGM every year. 

Those who have a direct 
working or contractual 
relationship or share a 
mutual interest with us. 

Their vital contributions to our 
business range from providing services 
and advice, through to granting the 
planning permission and approvals 
that allow us to develop buildings and 
run our business. 

Our partners want us to be 
trustworthy and live up to our 
promises. 

We work to find mutually effective 
ways to communicate and collaborate 
with each group. The highest 
standards of health, safety and 
security underpin everything we do.

Our strategy

Landsec focuses on three areas of the UK 
real estate market where we have sources of 
competitive advantage and can maximise the 
value from our portfolio and our talent: Central 
London offices; Major retail destinations; and 
Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods.

What binds these three areas together 
is the importance of a sense of place 
to their enduring success, and to that 
of their surrounding areas. We strive to 
create, curate and activate places that 
inspire people, generating value for all 
our stakeholders. 

Our strategy is underpinned by two key 
principles of sustainable value creation: 
focusing our resources on where we 
have genuine competitive advantage, 
and preserving a strong balance sheet. 
To achieve this strategy, we need a clear 
sense of purpose and a culture that 
supports, respects and motivates our 
people. The three – strategy, purpose, 
culture – are inextricably linked. 

Importantly, our strategy remains grounded 
in our purpose; Sustainable places. 
Connecting communities. Realising potential. 

In executing it, we continue to be led by 
three things: working sustainably, meeting 
the needs of our customers, and being 
disciplined with our capital. It is vital we 
make healthy, sustainable returns to enable 
our business to grow over time. Which is 
why we focus on those areas where we 
believe we have a genuine competitive edge. 

We are a total-return business and the 
investment areas we focus on are attractive 
because of the potential returns they can 
generate. We are not wedded to particular 
assets or regions, and prefer to be nimble, 
applying our skills to where we believe we 
can achieve the best total return over the 
long term.

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023Global economic and financial market 
conditions have changed significantly 
over the past year. Interest rates have 
surged in response to rising inflation, with 
the central bank support that artificially 
depressed them for most of the last decade 
now in reverse. While it is difficult to predict 
where interest rates will settle in the 
longer-term, it is clear we are back to a 
higher-rate environment – the very low 
interest rate environment of the last 
decade was an aberration.

Importantly, the strategy we set out in 
late 2020 was not based on a continuing 
low-rate environment. This is why we said 
we would i) focus our investment on sectors 
where we have a genuine competitive 
advantage that helps us create long-term 
value, rather than sectors which happened 
to be in vogue at the time; ii) over time sell 
c. £2.5bn of mature London assets where 
yields were low, of which we have now sold 
£2.2bn; and iii) maintain capital discipline. 

Our strategic focus on sustainable value 
creation in three key areas, central London 
offices, major retail destinations and 
mixed-use urban neighbourhoods, remains 
the right one. Demand in each area 
remains resilient, underpinned by the 
strength of our customer relationships 
and high-quality portfolio.

In executing our strategy, we are guided 
by three things: developing sustainably, 
succeeding for our customers and being 
disciplined with our capital. The built 
environment accounts for 40% of carbon 
emissions globally, so everything we do 
needs to have sustainability at its heart.

This year, we have refreshed our 
environmental targets, setting far more 
demanding carbon-reduction targets, 
in line with the latest recommendations 
from the Science Based Targets initiative. 
We will continue to strive to remove carbon 
from our construction and the operational 
use of our buildings.

015

At the heart of our philosophy is a belief 
that we can only be successful if our 
customers are successful. We look to build 
positive and lasting relationships with them, 
to understand their businesses better, and 
determine what we can do better or 
differently to help them succeed.

We think constantly and very carefully 
about where to invest, focusing in 
particular on projected returns and the 
associated risks. With visibility and expertise 
across three distinct focus areas, we have 
a unique perspective on relative risk and 
returns, which enables us to be clear and 
decisive in our capital allocation decisions.

We have a total-return approach that is 
aware of the importance of income. To 
generate the returns we are targeting, we 
need to allocate capital to areas of growth 
in a meaningful way. We are also mindful of 
the importance of income – it is a key part 
of the property return, but should not be the 
key driver. We are prepared to sell income-
generating assets to fund investment 
opportunities with better return prospects, 
but we will also preserve income growth 
through careful phasing of our activity.

Offices

Our view of the market 
London offices have seen valuations fall 
as yields have increased in response to 
higher interest rates. However, the market 
remains strong operationally, and rents 
have continued to grow in prime assets 
as demand for this space has remained 
strong. Within this, customers continue 
to want flexible options and strong 
sustainability credentials – so only the best 
spaces will thrive. Our portfolio is well 
placed to benefit from these trends. 

Our plan for our  
Central London portfolio
We sold £1.4bn of mature, single-let offices, 
taking our City office disposals to £1.7bn 
since 2020. The remaining portfolio consists 
of modern space or assets we plan to 
redevelop. 

Three office developments will complete 
in 2023 and these are expected to generate 
£39m of gross income when fully let. 
We have a consented pipeline of 1.1m sq ft 
of office-led development opportunities, 
including Portland House in Victoria and 
Timber Square in Southwark, where we 
are already on site with early works. Our 
developments will offer a range of our 
products – Myo, Customised and Blank 
Canvas – and will provide the space and 
facilities customers now demand. We plan 
to open three new Myo locations in the 
autumn, totalling 138,000 sq ft, with a 
further location to open next summer. 

We also think rising interest rates will lead 
to investment opportunities in 2024, as high 
refinancing costs will cause some owners 
to dispose of assets that no longer meet 
the rising cost of debt. Our balance sheet 
means we are well placed to invest.

With ESG as a consideration, our 
investment in air source heat pumps and 
innovative AI systems to increase efficiency, 
will ensure our portfolio remains sustainable 
and meets the needs of our customers. 
This year, we will install our first air source 
heat pump at Dashwood in the City.

During the last financial year, 
we sold three major office 
assets for a total of £1.4bn. 
All three were let to single 
occupiers on long leases and 
we therefore had limited 
value-creation opportunities 
from these assets. Despite 
deteriorating financial and 
economic conditions, we 
crystallised an average 10% 
lifetime IRR from the disposals. 
We can use the proceeds from 
these to invest in higher-return 
opportunities across the 
portfolio. 

These disposals demonstrate 
our strategy in action. We were 
disciplined in our approach and 
took the opportunity to realise 
value even though property 
values were falling in the market.

Our strategic focus 
Retail

Our view of the market 
Prime retail destinations have been one 
of the most resilient real estate sectors 
over the last year. As the cost of online 
retail has increased in recent years, physical 
retail costs – rent and rates – have declined. 
For many leading brands, online and physical 
channels are now firmly inter-connected, 
so we continue to see existing brands upsize, 
new brands opening stores in our assets as 
they move from nearby locations to benefit 
from higher footfall, and digital-native 
brands opening stores to grow customer 
connectivity and experience. 

Consumer behaviour has gradually reverted 
to pre-Covid trends, with online sales down 
and in-store sales growing over the past 
year. Given the inflationary pressure on 
margins for many brands, both online and 
physical, we expect that the rationalisation 
of the tail-end of brands’ store portfolios 
will further accelerate. This adds to the 
challenges for secondary retail locations, 
where there remains a significant excess 
of space, yet brands are focusing on fewer, 
but bigger and better stores. 

Therefore, prime destinations continue to 
get stronger. With attractive yields and the 
potential for rental growth, we view prime 
retail destinations as attractive assets to 
invest in, albeit the number of centres with 
long-term potential is limited to a relatively 
small number of sites.

Our plan for our retail portfolio 
We will concentrate on catchment-
dominant locations we are confident 
will be long-term winners, by offering 
an experience that draws shoppers time 
and again. We will sell assets where we do 
not have scale or sources of competitive 
advantage: the retail parks from our 
subscale sector, for example. We will also 
make selective disposals and acquisitions, 
to ensure our portfolio always holds retail 
assets that have long-term appeal to brand 
partners and visitors. 

Investing in Cardiff
During the last year we secured 
100% ownership of St David’s 
shopping centre in Cardiff. 
Using our competitive advantage 
to unlock complex opportunities, 
we acquired the outstanding 
50% from two debt holders at 
a net initial yield of 9.7%.

St David’s has firmly established 
itself as the prime, regionally 
dominant shopping destination 
in Cardiff. Leasing momentum 
has been strong, with 30 leases 
signed since March 2022, on 
average 10% ahead of ERV.

Via a separate deal, we also 
acquired the adjacent vacant 
Debenhams store for a minimal 
sum. All combined, this unlocks 
the opportunity to deliver our 
future vision for the centre, to 
further enhance its attractions 
for brands and guests. We 
expect to deliver a high single-
digit income return on 
incremental capital expenditure.

Preparing the pipeline
Our mixed-use schemes are 
regeneration projects in the 
heart of communities. Strong 
relationships with local 
authorities and organisations 
is therefore essential to ensure 
our schemes work both for us 
and their local communities. 

During the year, we made 
progress on the planning phases 
of a number of our schemes. At 
Mayfield in central Manchester, 
we agreed terms with our JV 
partners for a draw-down of 
land for the first phases of 
development, once we intend 
to start on site. In Glasgow, we 
have concluded the first rounds 
of public consultation and 
intend to submit a planning 
application. And at Finchley 
Road in London, we have 
secured a resolution to grant 
planning consent for our 
residential-led scheme.

Our strategic focus
Mixed-use urban 
neighbourhoods

Our view of the market 
There remains a structural need to 
remodel many parts of today’s built 
environment to make sure they suit 
changing consumer expectations for how 
we live, work and spend our leisure time, 
and also suit increasing sustainability 
demands. Situated in attractive locations 
with strong transport links in some of the 
fastest-growing urban areas in the UK, 
our pipeline remains well placed to cater 
for these demands. At the same time, our 
sustainability and development expertise, 
combined with the now fully integrated U+I 
team’s placemaking skills, means we are 
well positioned to meet this structural need.

Done well, these mixed-use urban 
communities can generate strong returns, 
as the appeal of the location and its 
amenity increases the value through phases 
of placemaking. There is political support 
for such projects, but very few developers 
with the scale and skills to take them on.

Our plan for our mixed-use urban 
neighbourhoods portfolio
We have continued to make good progress 
in preparing our pipeline, through planning 
and other pre-development activities. This 
means we now have the option to start the 
first phase at Mayfield in Manchester this 
year. Subject to further planning and land 
assembly workstreams being satisfactorily 
progressed, we could also start on site with 
enabling works at Finchley Road in London 
later this year.

However, the changes in capital market 
conditions have a clear impact on our 
underwriting assumptions. Any decision 
to start a scheme will have to reflect an 
appropriate level of return, with target IRRs 
in the low-to-mid teens. Our mixed-use 
development assets include our three 
shopping centres in London and Glasgow 
which are held for future development, but 
where the existing income is managed on a 
short-term basis to maximise our flexibility 
to obtain access for development.

Operating and  
portfolio review

Overview
Our overall portfolio on a combined basis was valued at 
£10.2bn at the end of March, which adjusted for disposals 
and new investments, was down £848m for the year due 
to a softening of valuation yields, and is made up of the 
following areas:

61%

Central London
Our modern, high-quality office (82%) and retail 
and other commercial space (18%), located in the 
West End (68%), City (26%) and Southwark (7%).

18%

8%

13%

Major retail destinations 
Our investments in six shopping centres and five retail 
outlets, with the seven largest assets comprising 85% 
of the overall retail portfolio value, most of which are 
amongst the highest selling locations for retailers in 
the UK.

Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods 
Our investments in mixed-use assets and future 
development opportunities, focused on five sites 
in London, Manchester and Glasgow, of which some 
still have a short-term use as retail ahead of their 
medium-term redevelopment.

Subscale
Assets in sectors where we have limited scale and 
which we therefore intend to divest over time, split 
broadly equally between retail parks, hotels and 
leisure assets.

Investment activity
When we set out our strategy in late 2020, 
we said we planned to sell c. £4bn of mature 
London offices and assets in sectors which 
were subscale for us over a period of circa six 
years, with a view to reinvest this into higher 
growth opportunities over time. We have 
continued to make strong progress on this, so 
2.5 years into this period, we have now sold 
£2.4bn, including £1.4bn over the past year. 

Our largest sale last year was the £809m 
disposal of our 21 Moorfields, EC2 
development in September. The building is 
fully pre-let to Deutsche Bank for 25 years 
and therefore offered little room to add 
further value. The sale represented a 9% 
discount to March book value, partly 
reflecting the fact that construction had 
not yet completed, but crystallised a 25% 
profit on cost and 11% IRR since we acquired 
the site. 

In January, we sold One New Street Square, 
EC4 for £350m. This building is fully let to 
Deloitte for a further 14 years and, following 
a regear of the lease at the start of the 
year, also offered little to room to add 
further value. The price was 4% below the 
September valuation, yet crystallised a 10% 
IRR since our acquisition of the site in 2005. 
At the start of the year, we also sold 32-50 
Strand, WC2 for £195m, following a 10-year 
lease regear with the sole occupier, 15% 
above its prior book value. In addition, we 
sold £54m of smaller non-core assets, 22% 
ahead of book value, and we have now sold 
or exchanged contracts to sell over half of 
U+I’s non-core assets for £98m, on average 
16% above book value. 

Relative to £1.4bn of disposals, we spent 
£120m on acquisitions and £280m on 
development capex last year. Our main 
purchase was the debt secured on 50% of 
St David’s, Cardiff via separate transactions 
with two lenders. This allowed us to obtain 
100% control of the shopping centre at a 
discount to the £113m book value of our 
existing half of the asset and an implied 
initial and equivalent yield of 9.7%. In 
addition, we spent a small amount on land 
assembly deals around some of our major 
mixed-use projects.

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023We have now sold £2.2bn of the c. £2.5bn 
London offices we earmarked in 2020, at 
an average yield of 4.4% and a 4% discount 
to book value. This means our London 
assets are now 74% in the West End and 
Southwark, with City exposure down from 
39% to 26% over the year. We are planning 
further disposals this year, yet we expect 
future disposal activity to be more 
balanced towards our subscale sectors.

Portfolio valuation 
The sharp increase in interest rates during 
the year meant that transaction volumes 
across global and UK property markets 
slowed materially. Yields reset quickly as a 
result, especially during the second half of 
2022. Despite ERV growth across all key 
segments, this meant the value of our 
portfolio reduced 7.7%. 

The value of our Central London portfolio 
was down 7.3% for the year. This reflected 
a 42bps increase in yields to 4.9%, which 
was partly offset by 4.7% growth in ERVs 
– at the high end of our guidance of low 
to mid single digit ERV growth for the year.

The value of our West End office (-8.0%) 
and retail and other assets (+1.3%), which 
make up 74% of our London investment 
portfolio, proved more resilient than our 
City offices (-15.4%). This reflected our 
strong leasing activity in Victoria, driving 
3.7% ERV growth and strong growth at 
Piccadilly Lights. In the City, where we have 
sold £1.7bn of offices since late 2020, ERV 
growth was 4.7%, which solely reflected 
a major lease regear at a higher rent at 
New Street Square, with the associated 
refurbishment works to facilitate this taken 
as a cost in the valuation. Development 
values were down slightly (-3.0%), with ERV 
growth due to successful lettings offset by 
softer valuation yields.

The value of our major retail assets reduced 
6.4% during the year, despite our successful 
leasing activity driving 0.9% ERV growth. 
Virtually all of this movement occurred in 
the final quarter of the 2022 calendar year, 
as valuers moved yields out by 40bps, 
mostly based on sentiment, as there were 
no comparable transactions during the 

period. We ascribe more value to the 
continued improvement in operational 
performance than “sentiment”, so we 
continue to focus on driving this. Reflecting 
the high income return, the total return of 
our major retail assets was at 0.5% ahead 
of London (-3.4%) and mixed-use (-2.8%).

In mixed-use, our completed assets at 
MediaCity were down 5.9%, as ERV growth 
of 8.6% was offset by a 61bps increase in 
yields. Our future developments were down 
9.4%, reflecting the fact that these are 
mostly valued based on their existing use 
and we manage the income on a short-
term basis to maximise flexibility for future 
development. In Subscale, hotel values 
were down slightly (-3.1%), whilst retail 
parks were down 12.1% driven by 69bps 
yield softening, following a strong 31.9% 
increase in values during the prior year. 
The value of our leisure assets was down 
17.7% reflecting concerns around the largest 
tenant, Cineworld, although the news of 
its recapitalisation post the year-end is 
a clear positive.

1. Rental value change excludes units materially altered during the period.
2. Excluding developments

Looking ahead, whilst yields appear to 
have started to stabilise in recent months, 
investment activity in reality remains thin 
across most sectors. Investor demand is 
selective, so combined with the volatility 
in interest rates and tightening of credit 

conditions the outlook remains uncertain, 
although we expect values for prime assets 
to stabilise and return to growth well before 
secondary. We also expect high yields in 
major retail destinations to offer more 
resilience than lower yielding sectors. 

Reflecting the strong demand for high-
quality space and limited supply, we expect 
ERVs in London and major retail to grow by 
a further low to mid single digit percentage 
this year.

Leasing and operational 
performance
Central London
Despite the recent disruption from 
transport strikes, London continues to 
get busier and office utilisation continues 
to gradually increase. We continue to see 
a growing bifurcation in demand, with 
customers focusing on flexibility, the 
best quality space in areas with the right 
amenities to attract key talent, and 
sustainability. Across the London market, 
office take-up slowed in the second half, 
ending the year at 11.8m sq ft – up 7% vs 
last year and just 4% below the 10-year 
average. Space under offer reduced to 
3.2m sq ft vs a 10-year average of 3.4m 
sq ft and vacancy in the City remains high 
at 11.7%. Conversely, vacancy in the West 
End, where c. 70% of our assets are located 
is just 3.6% and down 70bps YoY. Overall, 
67% of available space is second-hand, 
as Grade A vacancy remains low at 1.7%.

Reflecting the strong demand for the best 
quality space, we signed 44 lettings and 
renewals, totalling £43m of rent, on 
average 3% ahead of valuers’ assumptions, 
with a further £6m in solicitors’ hands, 
19% above valuers’ estimates. This included 
an upsized, new 17.5-year lease with Taylor 
Wessing at New Street Square, in a deal 
where we are temporarily relocating them 
to a different building on the estate where 
we are drawing up plans for medium-term 
redevelopment, whilst we decarbonise 
their existing building. In line with our 
guidance, occupancy increased 110bps to 
95.9%, with our West End offices effectively 
full, at 99.5% occupancy. We continue to 
see strong demand for our Myo flexible 
offer, with 123 Victoria Street 100% let 
and Dashwood 85% let, vs 98% and 64% 
a year ago. We plan to open three new 
Myo locations in autumn, totalling 
138,000 sq ft, with a further location 
to open next summer.

Looking forward, we have been clear in 
our expectation that more flexible ways of 
working would reduce overall demand for 
office space in the UK. However, we have 
also consistently said that the impact of 

this will not be evenly spread, with large 
HQ type space and areas which lack the 
amenities that offer people a reason to 
want to spend time there expected to see 
a much bigger impact. This has started 
to play out and we expect this will continue. 
Across London space marketed for subletting 
increased to 5.1m sq ft over the year, but 
75% of this is in the City, City Fringe and 
Docklands. In the West End and Southwark, 
where assets are smaller and occupiers 
more diversified, demand remains strong 
and Grade A supply is low. This continues 
to drive ERV growth for the best assets, 
which continues to benefit our portfolio. 

Consumer behaviour continues to gradually 
revert back to pre-Covid trends, with online 
sales down and in-store sales up over the 
past year. For most leading brands, online 
and physical channels are now firmly 
interconnected, and a number of key 
brands such as Next and Inditex indicated 
recently that online is no longer expected 
to grow as quickly as previously anticipated. 
The increase in cost of capital and cost of 
doing business online has also led many 
online pure-play retail models to shift their 
focus from growing market share to 
growing profitability, increasing the cost 
for consumers to buy online. 

Major retail destinations
Customer demand for retail space in 
the best locations continues to grow. 
Underlining the value of our major retail 
destinations for brands and consumers, 
total retail sales across our portfolio 
grew 6.9% YoY and like-for-like sales were 
4.4% above 2019 levels. Footfall across 
our shopping centres increased 12% and 
is now at 90% of pre-pandemic levels, 
compared to 83% for the UK market and 
80% a year ago.

Whilst we expect brands to continue to 
rationalise their overall store footprints, 
their focus on ‘fewer, bigger, better’ stores 
continues to drive growth in demand for 
space in our assets, as they upsize existing 
stores or open new stores as they move 
from nearby locations to benefit from 
higher footfall in a ‘flight to prime’. 
Reflecting this, we completed 218 lettings 
totalling £27m, up 35% vs the prior year, on 
average 8% above ERV. Close to 70% of the 
leases we signed during the year had some

turnover element was only 10% of the total 
rent. Overall, 53% of our leases now have 
some turnover component, with turnover 
rent making up 12% of our total retail 
income. This turnover data provides us with 
valuable insights and a unique competitive 
advantage in underwriting income levels.

three shopping centres in London and 
Glasgow. This income is managed on a 
short-term basis to maximise our flexibility 
for future development. This will eventually 
erode and be replaced by our new schemes, 
but in the near term it compensates for the 
holding costs of these sites as we prepare 
them for future development.

As a result, occupancy increased 110bps 
during the year to 94.3%. We continue 
to monitor credit risks, but units in 
administration remain low at 0.4%, vs 0.5% 
a year ago. There have been no CVAs and 
minimal insolvencies, as the most 
challenged businesses already folded during 
the pandemic. Whilst Cineworld (less than 
1% of annual rent in major retail destinations), 
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
the US during the year, it continues to trade 
and pay rent and agreed a recapitalisation 
shortly after the year-end.

Looking forward, despite the cost of living 
challenges consumers are faced with, we 
continue to see few signs of any let-up in 
demand from brands, with £11m of lettings 
in solicitors’ hands, up 28% vs this time 
last year, on average 11% above ERV. 
With sales in our shopping centres close 
to pre-pandemic levels and rents having 
reset c. 35% during the pandemic, 
operational profitability for brands further 
improved due to the c. 30% reduction in 
business rates last month. With the last 
large over-rented historical leases expected 
to reset this year, this is expected to 
underpin solid like-for-like income growth 
from next year. 

Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods 
Our completed investment assets in 
mixed-use at present solely comprise our 
investment in MediaCity, where occupancy 
increased 1.8% to 97.8%, with lettings well 
ahead of ERV. The bulk of the income in our 
mixed-use development assets relate to our 

Committed development pipeline

Subscale sectors
Across our subscale portfolio, operational 
performance remained robust. We completed 
£7m of retail park and leisure lettings, 10% 
above valuers’ assumptions, with a further 
£1m of rent in solicitors’ hands, 5% above 
valuers’ assumptions, and overall occupancy 
increased 30bps. Our hotels, which are fully 
let to Accor, saw occupancy rise to 94% 
of pre-Covid levels, up from 67% last year, 
driving a substantial increase in RevPAR.

Development pipeline
Central London
Demand for the best quality space remains 
strong. Our two on-site West End schemes, 
n2 in Victoria and Lucent behind Piccadilly 
Lights, are set to complete shortly and are 
73% and 71% pre-let or in solicitors’ hands 
respectively, with rents agreed over the 
last 12 months on average 11% ahead of 
ERV. At the end of March, we completed 
The Forge, in Southwark. Our Myo flexible 
offering will operate 35% of this space and 
is set to open in autumn, and we are now 
in solicitors’ hands on 11% of the remaining 
space. Combined, these three projects are 
expected to generate an ERV of £39m once 
fully let, which will support our near-term 
income growth. 

During the year, we sold our development 
at 21 Moorfields in the City, which we fully 
pre-let to Deutsche Bank, for £809m, 
ahead of its completion. This crystallised 
a 25% profit on cost and 11% IRR since our 
acquisition of the site in 2012.

As expected, we are seeing a slowdown 
in new development starts across the 
London market, reflecting the increase 
in construction and finance costs, but 
also the decline in available development 
finance. In previous periods of economic 
uncertainty, new development starts ended 
up c. 30-90% below originally expected 
levels and we believe this is likely to repeat 
this time. As demand for the best, most 
sustainable space remains strong, this 
creates an attractive window for us to 
deliver new space in 2025, when Grade A 
supply is expected to be very low.

Last autumn, we decided to commit to the 
early works for the refurbishment of 
Portland House, SW1 and Timber Square, 
SE1. At a cost of £55m, this allowed us to 
maintain our programme for a delivery in 
late 2025, whilst keeping flexibility on the 
residual c. £400m of capex at a time of high 
financial and political uncertainty. Returns 
on both projects remain attractive, with 
gross yields on cost of 7.4% and a yield on 
capex of 12%+, so supported by the strong 
leasing success in our current pipeline, 
with recent lettings 11% ahead of ERV, we 
therefore plan to commit to the full works 
on both imminently. 

We also continue to progress our future 
pipeline, as we received planning consent 
for Red Lion Court, SE1 in March; are 
currently seeking to enhance our existing 
consent at Liberty of Southwark, SE1; and 
unlocked a future opportunity at Southwark 
Bridge Road, SE1 adjacent to The Forge, 
through a lease surrender we agreed in the 
second half of the year. This further adds 
to the potential to create a unique cluster 
of highly sustainable offices in Southwark, 
which is one of the most attractive areas of 
London in terms of amenities. All combined, 
this provides us with a 2.0m sq ft future 
pipeline, of which 1.1m sq ft is now 
consented.

Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods
Consumer expectations on how we live, 
work and spend our leisure time continue 
to evolve and demands on sustainability 
continue to grow, which means there is 
a structural need to remodel many parts 
of the built environment, to make sure 
they are fit for future needs. Located in 
attractive locations with strong transport 
links in some of the fastest growing 
urban areas in the UK, our pipeline is well 
placed to cater for this. The combination 
of U+I’s placemaking skills and Landsec’s 
sustainability and development expertise 
means we now have the platform to both 
deliver and curate thriving mixed-use places 
and realise the long-term sustainable 
value from the future opportunities we 
have created. 

Our 10m sq ft mixed-use pipeline in London, 
Glasgow and Manchester has a total 
development cost of c. £5bn, with a mix 
of residential, office and leisure space 
deliverable across multiple phases over 
the next 10-15 years. The current book value 
of these sites is modest compared to its 
potential upside, at c. £330m, and given the 
c. 5% income yield on the current use of the 
existing assets, its holding cost is modest. 

With unlevered IRR targets in the low to 
mid-teens, this offers valuable optionality 
for growth.

We have made excellent progress during 
the year at our two most advanced 
projects, which provides optionality to 
potentially start first works on site over 
the next 12 months. At Mayfield, next to 
Manchester’s main train station, the new 
6.5-acre public park opened in September 
and we agreed terms with our JV partners 
for a drawdown of land for the first phases 
of development. This allows us to develop 
100% of the first phase, covering around 
one-third of the overall project, ourselves 
and therefore paves the way for a potential 
start on site with the first two office 
buildings totalling 320,000 sq ft later this 
year. The expected investment for this is 
c. £150m, with an expected gross yield on 
cost of c. 8%.

At Finchley Road, in zone two, London, 
we secured a resolution to grant planning 
consent at the end of March for our 
masterplan to develop 1,800 new homes. 
Subject to further planning and land 
assembly workstreams being satisfactorily 
progressed, this could allow us to start on 

site with enabling works for our first major 
residential scheme later this year. 

In Glasgow, we intend to submit the 
planning application for our mixed-use 
masterplan shortly, which we expect to 
be determined in the first half of 2024. 
In Lewisham, south-east London, we 
maintain positive engagement with the 
Council on our new residential-led 
masterplan, for which we are preparing 
to submit a planning application later 
this year. At MediaCity, we are working 
with our partner Peel on establishing 
the long-term vision for this site, ahead 
of the future phases of its development. 

Our good progress during the year has 
further added to the valuable opportunity 
to build an attractive balance of income, 
development upside and medium-term 
growth potential our pipeline provides. 
The mixed-use nature, ability to phase 
capex, geographic spread of the pipeline, 
and the flexibility to adapt to changes in 
demand all add to the balanced risk-profile 
of this part of our business.

Delivering sustainably
During the year, we delivered a 16.6% 
reduction in energy intensity compared 
to 2019/20. This was up 0.9% year-on-year, 
although this largely reflected particularly 
low utilisation in the prior year in the early 
months of emergence from the pandemic. 
At current levels, it is 33.2% below 2013/14 
levels and therefore remains on track vs 
our target to reduce energy intensity by 
45% from this baseline by 2030. 

At the start of this year, we updated our 
carbon reduction targets to align with the 
Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) new 
Net-Zero Standard. Landsec was amongst 
the first companies worldwide to have our 
science-based targets validated under the 
Net-Zero Standard, which is the world’s first 
framework for corporate net-zero target 
setting. In response to the new SBTi standard, 
and in recognition of progress to date, we 
have committed to a near-term target of 
reducing direct and indirect greenhouse 
gas emissions by 47% by 2030 from a 2020 
base year and have committed to reach 
net zero by 2040 from the same base year. 
This significantly increases the scope of our 
targets, as it now includes emissions from all 
sources, including all of our scope 3 emissions 
such as the emissions from our development 
pipeline, supply chain and customers.

In late 2021 we were the first UK property 
company to launch our fully costed net zero 
carbon transition plan. This plan will see us 
deliver our science-based target and meet 
the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard 
of EPC B by 2030, with the expected cost 
for this already reflected in our current 
portfolio valuation. 36% of our portfolio is 
already rated B or higher, including 38% of 
our office portfolio. The latter is down from 
44% last year, partly reflecting the sale of 
One New Street Square. We expect this to 
increase to 44% in the coming months once 
our current pipeline completes and this will 
increase further from 2025 onwards, as the 
benefits from our net zero transition 
investment kicks in.

   Bluewater, Kent

We remain on track with this plan and have 
now completed air source heat pump 
feasibility studies for six offices, with four 
progressing to concept design and two to 
detailed design. We have also completed 
the optimisation of building management 
systems for 11 offices, and will be 
completing this for two of our shopping 
centres this year. In addition, we have 
expanded our energy audits from 15 to 25 
of our largest customers, which combined 
cover 19% of the energy use in our office 
portfolio. This identified potential annual 
carbon and costs savings of 10-15% per 
customer and we plan to expand this to 
the next 12 customers this year.

We continue to work on driving down 
upfront embodied carbon and during the 
year we announced a target to reduce this 
by 50% vs a typical development by 2030, 
to below 500kgCO2e/m2 for offices and 
400kgCO2e/m2 for residential. We are 
already tracking an average 36% reduction 
in upfront embodied carbon across our 
future pipeline, which equates to an 
average upfront embodied carbon intensity 
of 640kgCO2e/m2 on our offices and 
535kgCO2e/m2 for residential. To help us 
achieve our longer-term targets, during the 
year we signed up to the ConcreteZero 
Initiative where we commit to using 100% 
net zero concrete by 2050 with ambitious 
interim targets. This complements our 
existing membership of the SteelZero 
Initiative and sends a clear signal of our 
commitment to net zero to our supply chain. 

Near-term, at Timber Square, SE1 our plans 
show upfront embodied carbon intensity 
of 535kgCO2e/m2, reflecting the retention 
of part of the existing structure, a highly 

optimised design and the use of low carbon 
cross-laminated timber. At Portland House, 
SW1, retaining the existing structure and 
upgrading the existing façade has resulted 
in upfront embodied carbon intensity of 
395kgCO2e/m2. At Red Lion Court, SE1 we 
expect an upfront embodied carbon intensity 
of c. 600kgCO2e/m2, reflecting the retention 
of 35-40% of the existing basement and piles 
and the use of a highly flexible concrete 
structural solution with demountable 
timber infills. The Forge, SE1, which recently 
completed, is the first building in the UK 
to be designed, constructed and aspiring to 
operate in line with the UK Green Building 
Council framework definition of a net zero 
carbon building.

Building on our strong track record of 
investing in our local communities, we have 
enhanced our approach to community 
investment by launching the Landsec 
Futures fund last month. This is aimed at 
improving social mobility in the real estate 
industry and will see us invest £20m over 

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023027

  One New Change, EC4

  The Forge, SE1

the next ten years, to empower 30,000 
people towards the world of work and 
create £200m in social value. This includes 
a bursary programme that provides 
financial support to underrepresented 
young adults studying for a placemaking 
career, internships within Landsec and a 
small grants programme for local charities 
and community organisations in the areas 
we operate.

Creating the right culture and 
investing in our platforms
Our strong operational performance 
and continued progress on executing our 
strategy over the past year clearly reflects 
the capability and dedication of the 
substantial talent within Landsec. We 
continue to work on creating the right 
culture and a more diverse organisation, 
which is key in getting the most out of 
the valuable skills and expertise our teams 
harbour and in successfully delivering our 
strategy over time.

With this in mind, we initiated an 
organisational review early last year aimed 
at reducing internal complexity and 
becoming more agile, customer-orientated 
and outward focused. This work built on 
previous changes in our retail team, where 
we brought in significant experience and 
capabilities from international retailer 
backgrounds to focus more on growing 
brand relationships and guest experience, 
and our focus on retaining the unique 
placemaking and design capability of 
U+I during its successful integration over 
the past 12 months. 

As a result of this organisational review, 
we made several changes, including to 
our leadership team. We also reduced the 
number of layers in our organisation and 
increased management reporting spans. 
This has improved our efficiency and freed 
up resource to focus more on activities 
which drive value for our customers, rather 
than on internal processes. In a sector 

which is rapidly becoming more operational, 
this further underpins the value of our 
operating platforms and their future 
growth potential.

Despite high inflation, this also meant 
we managed to keep overhead costs flat 
over the past 12 months and although 
inflationary pressures remain elevated, 
we expect overhead cost to be down 
slightly for the current year. In early 2022 
we also initiated significant investments in 
upgrading our systems and data capability. 
We incurred £6m of cost for this during the 
year and expect a broadly similar cost in 
the current year, but this is set to drive 
further efficiency improvements for the 
year to March 2025 onwards.

Financial review
Financial review

Presentation of financial 
information
The condensed consolidated 
preliminary financial information 
is prepared under UK adopted 
international accounting standards 
(IFRSs and IFRICs) where the Group’s 
interests in joint ventures are shown 
collectively in the income statement 
and balance sheet, and all subsidiaries 
are consolidated at 100%. Internally, 
management reviews the Group’s 
results on a basis that adjusts for 
these forms of ownership to present 
a proportionate share. The Combined 
Portfolio, with assets totalling £10.2bn, 
is an example of this approach, 
reflecting our economic interest in 
our properties regardless of our 
ownership structure. 

Our key measure of underlying earnings 
performance is EPRA earnings, which 
represents the underlying financial 
performance of the Group’s property 
rental business, which is our core 
operating activity. A full definition of 
EPRA earnings is given in the Glossary. 
This measure is based on the Best 
Practices Recommendations of the 
European Public Real Estate Association 
(EPRA) which are metrics widely used 
across the industry to aid comparability 
and includes our proportionate share of 
joint ventures’ earnings. Similarly, EPRA 
Net Tangible Assets per share is our 
primary measure of net asset value.

Measures presented on a proportionate 
basis are alternative performance 
measures as they are not defined 
under IFRS. This presentation provides 
additional information to stakeholders 
on the activities and performance of 
the Group, as it aggregates the results 
of all the Group’s property interests 
which under IFRS are required to be 
presented across a number of line items 
in the statutory financial statements. 
For further details see table 70 in the 
Business analysis section.

Overview
Global economic and financial market 
conditions have changed considerably over 
the past year. The volatility this caused has, 
unsurprisingly, affected the valuation of 
property and other asset classes across the 
globe, but we have continued to focus on 
driving operational performance and 
executing our strategy. Our success in this 
during the year has further strengthened our 
strong balance sheet and quality of earnings 
and underpins our confidence in our ability 
to grow earnings and dividend over time.

EPRA earnings for the year were up 10.7% 
to £393m, partly due to an increase in 
surrender premiums received, which were 
up £22m vs the prior year. The two main 
surrenders unlocked the opportunity for a 
major 17.5-year lease regear elsewhere in our 
estate and two medium term developments. 
Like-for-like gross rental income excluding 
these surrender premiums was up 6.0%, 
or 5.8% on a net rental income basis. 
This reflects our strong leasing, growth in 
turnover income in major retail destinations, 
higher variable income and continued 
growth in income across our hotel portfolio. 

Despite our significant disposals, underlying 
EPRA EPS, which excludes the 3.0 pence 
impact of the increase in surrender 
premiums, rose 4.4% to 50.1 pence, towards 
the high end of our guidance for low to mid 
single digit percentage growth. In line with 
growth in underlying earnings, our 38.6 pence 
dividend for the year is up 4.3% vs the prior 
year. This reflects a dividend cover of 1.30x, 
in line with our policy to have dividends 
annually covered 1.2 to 1.3 times. 

Although our successful leasing activity drove 
growth in occupancy and ERVs, the value of 
our portfolio was down £848m as a result of 
an increase in valuation yields, reflecting the 
rise in bond yields during the year. Despite our 
growth in EPRA earnings, this resulted in an 
overall loss before tax of £622m and basic 
EPS of -83.6 pence, compared to a profit of 
£875m in the prior year. As a result, EPRA NTA 
per share reduced 11.9% to 936 pence, which 
including dividends paid, resulted in a total 
return on equity of -8.3%.

Vanessa Simms reports on 
our financial performance

Despite this, our decisive action during 
the year further strengthened our strong 
capital base. We reduced net debt by 
£0.9bn to £3.3bn, so despite the reduction 
in value of our portfolio, our LTV is down 
from 34.4% to 31.7%. This is an imperfect 
measure to judge leverage, particularly 
so when investment activity is low and 
the approach to valuations varies widely in 
different markets, which is why in times like 
this we focus more on net debt/EBITDA as 
a cash-on-cash measure. This stood at 7.0x 

at the end of March, down from 9.7x a year 
ago, or 8.0x on a weighted average net 
debt basis, down from 8.6x twelve months 
ago. We increased our average debt 
maturity to 10.3 years and with £2.4bn 
of undrawn facilities, we have no need to 
refinance any maturing debt until 2026, 
so our balance sheet is in excellent shape.

Income statement
Our successful leasing activity and the high 
quality of our portfolio is clearly reflected in 

the growth in income we have delivered. 
Compared to the prior year, when the 
UK was just emerging out of lockdown 
at the start of the period, this growth 
has been most prevalent in our major 
retail destinations; our mixed-use assets, 
where some of our future projects have an 
existing retail use; and our subscale sectors, 
which include our retail parks, leisure and 
hotels, as trading in these areas returned 
to normal.

1. Including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint ventures, as explained in the Presentation of financial information above.
2. Includes finance lease interest, after rents payable.

Net rental income
Overall gross rental income increased by 
£61m to £647m, which includes the benefit 
of a £22m increase in surrender premiums 
received compared to the prior year. This 
increase reflects a lease surrender we 
agreed at Southwark Bridge Road to create 
optionality for a new redevelopment, 
adjacent to our recent scheme at The Forge, 
and the lease restructuring with Deloitte at 
New Street Square we agreed at the start 
of the year. 

The space this freed up paved the way 
for another lease regear with a different 
major customer at the estate and the 
successful disposal of One New Street 
Square in January. 

Excluding the increase in surrender premiums, 
like-for-like gross rental income was up £29m, 
or 6.0%. This included a £19m increase in 
variable rent, which comprises income from 
hotels, Piccadilly Lights, parking and retail 
turnover rent, as trading normalised relative 
to the pandemic effects in the prior year.

Overall net rental income for the year 
increased by £51m to £561m. The reversal of 
our bad and doubtful debt provisions was 
£3m, compared to £12m in the prior year. 
Direct property expenditure increased by 
£1m, which reflects a £7m increase due to 
acquisitions, offset by a £6m decrease in 
direct property costs elsewhere in the 
portfolio. This reflects the benefit of 
increased occupancy and our focus on 
costs. Net service charge expenditure was 
stable compared to the prior year. 

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023030

Financial review 
continued

The full year impact of our acquisitions in 
late 2021 more than offset the impact from 
disposals during the past 12 months, so 
overall the impact of investment activity 
on net rental income for the year was £8m. 

As a result, our gross to net margin was 
86.7%. We expect this to improve on a 
like-for-like basis, as void and letting costs 
reduce as occupancy continues to grow. 

However, we expect the overall margin 
to reduce slightly this year, reflecting the 
start-up cost of opening three new Myo 
locations and the initial lease-up cost of 
our three London office developments 
which will be completed by this summer. 

Rent collections remain strong and are 
currently in line with this time last year 
and pre-Covid levels. We have seen minimal 

insolvencies and no CVAs during the period, 
although Cineworld, which makes up 2.0% 
of our annual rent, entered Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection in the US. We have 
taken appropriate provisions during the 
year and its recently announced 
recapitalisation now provides a positive 
step forward, whilst all units in our portfolio 
continue to trade and the company 
continues to pay rent.

1.  Including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint ventures, as explained in the Presentation of financial information above.
2.  Gross rental income on a like-for-like basis and the impact of developments, acquisitions and disposals exclude surrender premiums received.

Net administrative expenses
Despite the surge in UK inflation, our net 
administrative expenses were stable vs 
the prior year at £84m, in line with our 
guidance. This includes the full absorption 
of the additional administrative cost of 
the U+I acquisition at the end of 2021 and 
reflects our continued focus on making 
sure our cost base is right. This also includes 
£6m of costs reflecting an investment in 
upgrading our systems and data capability, 
which based on updated IFRIC accounting 
guidance is now expensed instead of 
capitalised. This is expected to reduce from 
the year to March 2025, as this investment 
programme completes during that year.

Although high wage inflation and general 
cost inflation continue to put upward 
pressure on costs, we expect administrative 
expenses for this year to be down slightly. 
This reflects the efficiency benefits of the 
organisational review we undertook last 
year. We have identified clear opportunities 
to reduce costs the years after, partly 
driven by our investments in technology, 
so we remain on track to reduce our EPRA 
cost ratio towards the low 20’s over time, 
compared to 25.2% last year and 26.4% 
in the prior year. 

Net finance expenses 
Net interest costs increased £13m to £84m, 
principally due to higher gross borrowings 
in the first half of the year, ahead of 
disposals during the year, plus an increase 
in variable interest rates. At the start of last 
year, 70% of our borrowings were fixed or 
hedged but following our disposals, we are 
now fully hedged. We expect net interest 
costs to increase slightly in the current year, 
reflecting a small increase in average 
borrowing costs.

Non-cash finance income, which includes 
the fair value movements on derivatives, 
caps and hedging and which is not included 
in EPRA earnings, increased from a net 
income of £16m in the prior year to a net 
income of £23m over the past year. This 
is predominantly due to the fair value 
movements of our interest-rate swaps as 
a result of the increase in interest rates 
over the period. 

Valuation of investment properties 
and loss on disposals
The independent external valuation of 
our Combined Portfolio showed a £848m 
value reduction. Whilst the strong leasing 
evidence we created drove 3.6% ERV 

growth and we delivered further profits 
on our current development pipeline, the 
upside of this was more than offset by a 
market-wide softening of yields due to the 
sharp rise in bond yields. 

minimal. Reflecting the increase in EPRA 
earnings, offset by the valuation shortfall, 
IFRS loss after tax for the period was 
£622m, compared to a profit of £875m 
in the prior period. 

We recognised a £144m loss on disposals, 
mostly reflecting the discounts to historical 
book value on the sale of 21 Moorfields and 
One New Street Square, partly offset by the 
premiums to book value of the sale of 32-50 
Strand and a leisure asset in north London. 

IFRS loss after tax
Substantially all our activity during the year 
was covered by UK REIT legislation, which 
means our tax charge for the year remained 

Net assets and return on equity
EPRA Net Tangible Assets, which principally 
reflects the value of our Combined Portfolio 
less adjusted net debt, reduced to £6,967m, 
or 936 pence per share, marking a 11.9% 
reduction for the year on a per share basis. 
Including dividends paid, this means our 
total return on equity for the year was -8.3%.

Financial review 
continued

Net debt and leverage
Adjusted net debt, which includes our 
share of JV borrowings, reduced by £892m 
to £3,287m during the year. This was 
principally driven by our £1.4bn of disposals 
in London. We spent £120m on acquisitions, 
including the debt secured against St David’s 
in Cardiff. Capital expenditure on our 
portfolio was £340m, reflecting our 
London office development programme, 
the preparation of future developments 
and the investment in our existing assets. 
We only have £90m committed capex left 
to spend, although we anticipate this will 
increase in the coming months as we 
commit to the full refurbishment of 
Portland House and our new development 
at Timber Square. 

The other key elements behind the 
decrease in net debt are set out in our 
statement of cash flows and note 13 to 
the financial statements, with the main 
movements in adjusted net debt shown 
below. A reconciliation between net debt 
and adjusted net debt is shown in note 21 
of the financial statements.

Due to the reduction in borrowings, our 
net debt/EBITDA reduced to 7.0x based on 
our net debt at the end of March, or 8.0x 
based on our weighted-average net debt 
for the year. We target net debt/EBITDA 
to remain below 9x over time. Group LTV 
which includes our share of JVs, reduced 
from 34.4% to 31.7%. This remains well 
within our target range of 25% to 40% 
and in line with the low 30’s level we said 
we expected for the foreseeable future.

Financing
Our gross borrowings of £3,358m are 
diversified across various sources, including 
£2,736m Medium Term Notes, £310m 
syndicated and bilateral bank loans and 
£312m of commercial paper. Our MTN and 
bank loans form part of our Security Group, 
which provide security on a floating pool 
of assets currently valued at £9.6bn. This 
provides flexibility to include or exclude assets 
and an attractive cost of funding, with our 
MTN currently rated AA and AA- with a 
stable outlook respectively by S&P and Fitch.

The Security Group structure has a number 
of tiered covenants. Below 65% LTV, these 
involve very limited operational restrictions, 
whilst a default only occurs when LTV is more 
than 100% or the ICR falls below 1.0 times. 

With a Security Group LTV of 33.0%, down 
from 36.4% in March, our portfolio could 
withstand a c. 50% fall in value before 
we reach the 65% hurdle and 67% before 
reaching 100%, whilst our EBITDA could fall 
78% before we reach 1.0x ICR.

We have £2.4bn of undrawn facilities, which 
provides substantial flexibility. The amount 
of borrowings which is fixed or hedged 
increased from 70% to 100%, as we used 
the proceeds from our significant disposals 
during the period to repay part of our 
floating debt, as planned. We expect this 
figure to come down slightly as we repay 
some of our near-term maturities and 
continue to target a medium-term range 
of c. 80-90% to keep some flexibility for 
potential divestments.

In March, we issued our first Green bond, 
which is earmarked for the investment in 
our near-term London pipeline. This raised 
£400m with a 9.5 year maturity at a margin 
of 133bps, representing an all-in cost of 
4.875%. Combined with the reduced 
utilisation of our revolving credit facilities, this 
increased our average maturity of debt from 
9.1 to 10.3 years, even though our average 
cost of debt only rose slightly, to 2.7%.

We have £733m of debt maturing in the next 
two and a half years, but all of this is more 
than covered by existing undrawn facilities, 
which means we have no refinancing 
requirements until 2026.

Outlook 
Looking ahead, our strong capital base 
puts us in an excellent position to take 
advantage of opportunities which will no 
doubt arise as the world continues to adjust 
to the new reality of higher interest rates 
and tighter credit conditions. Our strong 
credit profile and long 10.3-year average 
debt maturity therefore provide clear 
visibility and underpin the resilience of 
our attractive earnings profile. 

We now target to deliver an 8-10% annual 
return on equity over time, driven by a 
combination of growing income returns 
and capital growth from rental value growth 
and development upside. Short term 
changes in valuation yields remain beyond 

our control, which means we will not land 
precisely in this range every single year, 
but our high-quality portfolio and the clear 
competitive advantages of our operating 
platforms mean we are well placed to 
deliver this over time. For the current year, 
we expect continued customer demand to 
drive low to mid single digit growth in ERVs 
in London and major retail destinations. 

We expect EPRA EPS for the current year to 
be broadly stable vs last year’s 50.1 pence 
underlying EPS. This reflects the fact that 
we expect the positive impact from 
continued strong operational performance 
and like-for-like rental growth to be more 
or less offset by the fact that we have been 
– and in the near term will likely remain –  

a net seller of assets. It also fully absorbs 
c. £10m of impact from the last over-rented 
retail leases resetting, Myo start-up 
costs and IT systems investment this year. 
As such, we expect EPRA EPS to return 
to growth the year after. As our current 
dividend cover is at the high end of our 
1.2-1.3x target range, we expect dividends 
to grow by a low single digit percentage 
p.a. over these two years.

Our people and culture

At Landsec, we aim to create a high-performance 
environment where each of our circa 600 colleagues 
can see clearly how they contribute to, and benefit 
from, Landsec’s success. 

 “The Circl Leadership Programme has 
opened my eyes to inclusive leadership, 
using the power of coaching to build 
stronger, more effective relationships. 
The skills that I have gained from the 
programme are helping me and my fellow 
Circl graduates to create a culture where 
everyone is empowered to take action 
and deliver results. It’s great that 
Landsec offers this programme which is 
delivered by an engaging, creative team.”

Beth Howell, Retail Manager at Landsec graduating 
from the Circl Leadership programme

Our approach ensures everyone is clear 
about what we expect of them, through 
frequent communication and feedback. 
This constantly raises performance 
expectations as people are accountable for 
what they do, and know how to contribute 
to our success and how that will link to the 
rewards they then receive. 

Our leadership behaviour sets the cultural 
tone, with an emphasis on achievement 
through partnership, collaboration, self-
management and building an inclusive 
environment being central to success.

Recognising and celebrating one another, 
being open about and learning from our 
mistakes, and creating time for innovation 
and creativity, lay the foundations of 
realising our ambitions in the Landsec way.

We aim to build a workforce that is skilled, 
adaptable and future-focused, to enable 
our business to grow and thrive in the ever- 
changing environment it operates in. We 
know that if we take care of our people, our 
people will take care of our customers and 
our business. We want to be an employer 
of choice everywhere we operate, so we 
can attract, recruit and retain the best 
people. We build our business on strong 

foundations, with our purpose – Sustainable 
Places, Connecting Communities, Realising 
Potential – being firmly at the heart of 
everything we do and every decision we 
make. We are vocal in our commitment to 
equal opportunities, diversity and inclusion. 
We invest in learning and development for 
all, and support wellbeing, and healthy and 
safe workplaces. 

We aim to pay fairly and competitively, and 
recognise and reward high performance. 
We expect the best from all our people, 
providing the support needed for every 
individual to flourish and demonstrate their 
inherent talent and capability.

Transforming our business for success
Responding to uncertainty and turning 
challenges into opportunities has become 
standard, so we are constantly looking to 
develop even more ways to support our 
colleagues to adapt and thrive. 

We have taken decisive steps to transform 
our business, ensuring we are in the optimum 
position to best support our customers 
in achieving their goals. Alongside this 
transformation, we’ve created a suite of 
development products designed to hone 
the skills, capabilities and experiences 
that will set our people apart, and equip 
us for growth.

Listening to our people 
We know it is critical to listen to every 
employee’s voice, and use that feedback 
to continually improve our business. We 
launched a new employee survey, where 
we are able to benchmark our results with 
other organisations based on size or sector. 
This has given us some clear insights that 
will allow us to identify areas of strength 
and areas for improvement. Questions 
focused on the key employee viewpoints 
that underpin engagement and allowed 
us to explore our culture. 

75% of our colleagues responded, with an 
overall engagement score of 77% across 
the business (see chart 16). This puts us 
on par with organisations of a similar 
size and provides us with a target to reach 
to compare to the highest-performing 

organisations. The survey identified 
strengths in our clear purpose and the 
quality of our portfolio as well as strong 
interpersonal relationships. Each business 
area has created a plan detailing what they 
will do to address the points where we can 
improve performance. 

Developing our talent
We know great leadership is central to our 
success, so, alongside our key Leadership 
Development programmes – Stepping into 
Leadership, Leading with Purpose and 
Circl Leadership Programme – we have 
curated learning mapped to our leadership 
expectations, targeting ‘courageous’ 
conversations, performance, development 
and careers. 

We are incentivising the demonstration 
of excellent leadership, with a proportion 
of leaders’ performance-related pay (PRP) 
taken into consideration.

Highlighting achievements
 • As a signal of our commitment to 

improving leadership and management 
effectiveness – 77 managers and leaders 
have attained an Institute of Management 
and Leadership accreditation, having 
participated in our cornerstone leadership 
programmes, while 36 more are currently 
working on the accreditation. 

 • Demonstrating a self-driven appetite 
for development – our people have 
completed 9.2 hours of learning each on 
average, and completed 6,442 courses.

 • Supporting our commitment to diversity 
and inclusion (D&I) – 28 women have 
completed our female-focused 
development programme Thrive, with 
a further 14 having just started a new 
programme. 

 • Developing deeper relationships more 

effectively both internally and externally 
is underlying to our ongoing success – 
97% of our workforce has completed the 
Strengths Deployment Inventory (SDI), 
which supports meaningful and effective 
relationship-building.

Developing our approach to diversity 
and inclusion
This year, we revised our approach to D&I, 
launching our new strategy: Diverse Talent, 
Inclusive Culture, Inclusive Places. 

We created our new framework with 
colleagues across the business, and it is 
endorsed by our Executive Leadership Team 
and Board. We have developed a shared 
vision that articulates why D&I is important 
to Landsec, and what we want to achieve:

“We design, develop and manage more 
inclusive, commercially successful places 
through attracting and nurturing diverse 
talent within a culture that enables 
everyone to reach their full potential.”

We will achieve this vision through actions 
grouped under three pillars, nine D&I 
themes and foundations that support the 
overall delivery:

Our D&I strategy

Our purpose — Sustainable places, connecting communities, realising potential

Our vision — We design, develop and manage more inclusive, commercially successful places through attracting and nurturing  
diverse talent within a culture that enables everyone to reach their full potential

Diverse talent
We will recruit, retain and progress a diverse 
workforce at all levels and nurture and 
support diverse talent into the wider real 
estate industry.

Inclusive culture
We will create a workplace culture where all 
colleagues are respected, supported and 
empowered to realise their potential.

Inclusive places
We will design, build and manage places that 
meet the needs of the communities we serve 
and use our position in industry to create 
positive D&I change.

Our people and culture  
continued

Since the launch of the strategy, we are 
already taking action as highlighted below.

Diverse talent

 • To support greater leadership diversity, 
we have introduced a new inclusive 
recruitment process for senior-leader level 
and above. This will involve de-biasing 
role descriptions, mandating ethnic and 
gender diversity on shortlists, and 
including an employee panel in the 
assessment process. 

 • We launched the Landsec Futures 
internship programme to enhance 
social mobility within our business and, 
more broadly, within the wider real 
estate industry.

Inclusive culture

 • Our affinity networks continue to have 
an important voice in our business in 
advising how we shape our culture, 
and this year played a part in improving 
support for colleagues through some 
of the most challenging life milestones. 

Inclusive places

 • We are implementing a D&I procurement 
and supply chain strategy with three core 
objectives, increasing the diversity of our 
supply chain, improving D&I practices 
within our supply chain, and working 
with suppliers who can support us in 
delivering our strategy. We have included 
specific D&I training requirements in 
contractual specifications, made the 
latest guidance on designing for 
neurodiversity part of our design brief 
for a major wayfinding contract, and 
worked with our supply chain partners 
to develop a diversity plan for our Timber 
Square development. 

Foundations

 • Our revised commitments and actions 
are led by data and evidence of what 
works. We have introduced improved 
dashboards, helping us to know 
workforce diversity by business unit and 
level, but also to understand recruitment, 
promotion and turnover trends, to inform 

where we need to change. This has led to 
a greater focus on diversity at leader level 
and above, in our targets and priorities, 
which are proving to make a difference, 
like including multiple women in shortlists 
for leadership positions. 

 • We will be transparent about our work, 

publishing annually our progress towards 
our targets. To support accountability 
for this, our Executive Leadership Team 
members have annual diversity targets 
in their performance plans, linked to their 
bonuses. These targets focus on diversity 
at leadership, with KPIs relating to 
increasing diversity in succession plans 
and talent development programmes, 
and for reducing senior leavers we would 
wish to retain. 

Affinity networks
In support of our D&I objectives, we want 
to hear all voices across the Company, and 
so we continue to work closely with our four 
affinity networks to ensure we get feedback 
from all perspectives. They have achieved a 
huge amount this year, including:

Landsec Women
 • Celebrating International Women’s Day 

with a highly successful event on Allyship.

 • Continued external networking in the 

wider property industry to enhance the 
profile of Landsec Women. 

Hand in Hand 
 • Running another hugely successful Purple 

Tuesday event across Landsec assets 
to support improving accessibility and 
inclusivity for disabled people, and to 

raise the profile of improving the 
customer experience for disabled people 
and their families. 

 • Working with our partners to deliver 

education programmes to our workforce, 
to provide support and education 
on topics such as the menopause, 
neurodiversity and maintaining a 
healthy lifestyle. 

Landsec Pride 
 • Celebrating LGBTQ+ History Month 
in February with our British Queer 
History exhibition at our head office. 
The exhibition allowed our workforce to 
learn more about the LGBTQ+ movement 
in the UK, highlighting the progress made 
to date but also raising awareness of the 
work still to do.

 • We hosted Oxford Pride at Westgate – 
opening the doors of our centre for 
the celebrations of the local LGBTQ+ 
community.

Diaspora Network
 • Led a series of events during Black History 
Month, including hosting black business 
owners’ pop-up markets across a 
number of Landsec sites and facilitating 
an event with our partners to celebrate 
black art and culture and showcase 
black excellence in music, poetry, 
comedy, art and food. 

 • Ran a three-day event with Somerset 

Multicultural Association, Clarks 
and UNTHNKBLE to celebrate Black 
History Month.

Our people and culture  
continued

Pay gap 
We are committed to reducing our pay 
gaps through improving the representation 
of women and ethnic minority staff at all 
levels of the business. 

Please note these are our 2022 pay gap 
figures. We plan to report our 2023 pay 
gap figures later this year. While we made 
progress in some areas in 2022 – notably 
in reducing our gender pay gap – we went 
backwards on our ethnicity pay gaps. 
Pay gap reporting not only supports 
transparency, it also helps us to identify 
the actions we need to take to address 
these gaps. Further details of our actions 
are available at Landsec.com.

Our mean gender pay gap reduced from 
36.6% to 30.8% in 2022 and our median 
gender pay gap reduced from 29.3% to 
28.7% over the same period. This reduction 
in the gender pay gap is primarily due to 
increases in the representation of women in 
the upper middle pay quartile (1.7 percentage 
point increase) and upper pay quartile 
(2.9 percentage point increase) over the 
past 12 months. This is a result of a higher 
number of male leavers in the upper pay 
quartile than joiners and an increase in 
female representation at executive level. 

Our mean ethnicity pay gap increased 
from 32.7% to 36.5% in 2022 and our 
median ethnicity pay gap increased 
from 27.6% to 37.6% in the same period. 

Our ethnicity pay gaps have increased 
because the representation of ethnic 
minority staff has increased in the lowest 
pay quartile and decreased in all other pay 
quartiles. This is due to a high proportion 
of ethnic minority new starters at our 
more junior levels – 50-70% of new starters 
at these levels over the past 12 months are 
from ethnic minority backgrounds. 

During the same period, we had a higher 
proportion of ethnic minority staff leave 
the business at manager level and this 
decreased ethnic minority representation 
within these more senior roles. This points 
to the importance of our affinity networks 
and the need for us to increase our focus 
on retention.

Wellbeing 
Just as we provide places that support the 
wellbeing of our customers and guests, we 
also ensure we protect the wellbeing of our 
own people. This year, we have continued to 
build on the broad range of benefits offered 
for social, financial, mental and physical 
wellbeing, by arranging sessions such as 
healthy lifestyle webinars and creating a 
financial wellbeing partnership to provide 
financial education and financial peace 
of mind. 

We continue to respect and encourage 
the need for balance in all aspects of life, 
by supporting initiatives such our first 
Work Life Balance group, created by 
our Regeneration Development Team to 
gauge thoughts and feelings, and gather 
suggestions of things we could do to create 
the most effective work-life balance. 

In recognition of supporting families better 
during their most challenging periods, we 
have created a new policy for colleagues 
going through pregnancy loss, with paid 
time off, and improved our policy on 
compassionate leave, which recognises 
the importance of close relationships 
outside of immediate family. We also 
created comprehensive guidelines on 
how to support colleagues through loss 
or bereavement, to equip our workforce 
to do this in the best way.

Recruitment and retention 
Despite some challenging considerations 
over the last 12 months, turnover has 
remained stable and consistent with the 
last financial year. We have undergone 
only very marginal changes in voluntary 
and involuntary turnover, in line with our 
expectations, which is a positive outcome 
when viewed in the context of challenging 
macro factors presenting significant 
economic and cultural challenges. 

We are now looking to the future as 
we continue to seek out talented and 
passionate individuals to join our team. 
This year, we have focused particularly on 
building future talent through the launch 
of our Internship scheme, Landsec Futures, 
which aims to provide opportunities in the 
real estate industry to those from diverse 
backgrounds. This scheme received 
overwhelming interest, with 75 applicants, 
and introduced some fantastic talent to 
opportunities within our sector. This year, 
we will welcome seven individuals into 
our business, creating aspirations and 
opportunities for fresh new talent. Read 
more about this on page 44 of this report. 

We have also continued to focus in a big 
way on developing our own internal pipeline 
of talent with great skills, behaviour and 
capabilities. This has resulted in 35 internal 
promotions, 21 of whom were female 
appointments.

Our approach to sustainability

Our sustainability vision is to design, develop 
and manage our places to enhance the health 
of our environment and improve the quality of 
life for our people, customers and communities, 
now and for future generations.

We recognise the strong link between the 
planet and society, and the importance 
of maintaining strong sustainability 
performance as a key value driver to our 
business. As the war in Europe continues to 
disrupt livelihoods and global supply chains, 
including energy, and the fact that 2022 
was the fifth-hottest year on record, The 
World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report 
20231 has identified the cost-of-living crisis 
and failure to mitigate and adapt to 
climate change as two of the major global 
risks for the next decade. Addressing these 
risks requires action from government, 
non-governmental organisations, media, 
individuals and purpose-led businesses 
like Landsec. In addition, our customers 
are also increasingly aware of these issues, 
and demanding an exemplary approach 
to sustainability. 

It is therefore critical that we continue to 
focus on achieving our vision, embedding 
our Build well, Live well, Act well (BWLWAW) 
framework across our organisation – to help 
balance the needs of our stakeholders with 
positive environmental and social impact. 
This year, we’ve maintained our focus on:
 • driving down operational carbon 

emissions through our net zero transition 
investment plan and striving to meet our 
ambitious embodied carbon targets
 • maintaining our prudent approach to 
energy procurement to protect our 
customers from rising energy costs

 • supporting the needs of our communities, 

specifically those groups who are 
disproportionately affected by rising 
living costs.

In addition, 36% of our portfolio, 38% 
of offices and 34% of retail, are already 
meeting the proposed MEES of EPC B. 
With the sale of 1 New Street Square, 
which had an EPC B rating, the proportion 
of our portfolio meeting EPC B has reduced, 
however we are confident that as we 
continue with our NZTIP we will meet the 
proposed MEES.

We expect the plan to remove 24,000 
tonnes of carbon emissions from 
Landsec’s operations. 

We are making excellent progress with our 
plan, spending over £2m in 2022/23 on the 
following initiatives: 
 • Moving to cleaner sources of energy, 

replacing gas-fired boilers with air source 
heat pumps.

 • Optimising building management 
systems, ensuring they operate in 
accordance with the way buildings are 
occupied. We’re testing predictive and 

Decarbonising our portfolio 
and transitioning to net zero

Our net zero transition 
investment plan
In November 2021, we published our £135m 
net zero transition investment plan (NZTIP). 
It will ensure we meet our near-term carbon-
reduction target and the proposed Minimum 
Energy Efficiency Standard (MEES) of EPC B 
by 2030.

Our portfolio is now 100% compliant with 
the 2023 MEES EPC E or above requirements.

this will contribute to energy reductions 
of up to 10%.

 • Increasing the capacity of onsite renewable 
energy, installing solar panels at eight of 
our retail sites. This year we carried out six 
air source heat pump feasibility studies and 
seven renewable energy feasibility studies. 
 • Replacing all fluorescent lighting with LEDs.

Reducing emissions from  
our construction activities
Approximately a third of carbon emissions 
from commercial buildings are produced 
before a building is even occupied1. For 
Landsec, 40% of our total emissions comes 
from capital goods which include our 
construction activities. We expect this 
proportion to increase as we decarbonise 
our buildings, the grid decarbonises, our 
development pipeline expands and our 
occupiers employ more sustainable 
working practices. 

To address this, we’ve set ambitious targets 
to reduce emissions from our construction 
activities, targeting a 50% reduction in 
average upfront embodied carbon compared 
with a typical building by 2030. Achieving 
this target won’t be easy and we know 
we’re going to have to do things differently 
– making changes throughout our supply 
chain to transform the way we design and 
develop buildings, ensuring we consider 
carbon from the outset of a scheme.

We’re investing in low-carbon construction 
materials such as cross-laminated timber 
and Concretene, which we hope will build 
confidence in these products and pave 
the way for the industry to accelerate the 
transition to net zero. To further increase 
industry demand for low-carbon steel 
and concrete, we’re signatory members 
of SteelZero and ConcreteZero.

Build well  
continued

Understanding that a substantial amount 
of material often sits below the ground in 
basements and structural foundations, our 
starting point is to consider repurposing 
existing buildings rather than demolishing 
and replacing them, to reduce the upfront 
embodied carbon of a scheme. If we 
conclude that a retention scheme would 
result in a significantly sub-optimal product 
for our customers or communities by 
limiting the public benefits we can provide, 
we will look into a replacement scheme 
that maintains a focus on positive 
environmental outcomes, for example, 
by reusing and upcycling demolition waste.

This year we completed The Forge, SE1, our 
first net zero carbon office development 
to be constructed and operated in line 
with the UK Green Building Council’s 
(UKGBC) framework definition of net zero 
carbon buildings. 

In addition to its net zero credentials, 
The Forge has the following sustainability 
features: 
 • Approximately 36% reduction in overall 
upfront embodied carbon compared 
to traditional construction methods.
 • It is an all-electric building that uses 

heat pumps to provide heating, cooling 
and hot water.

 • Powered by 100% renewable electricity.
 • 5-star NABERS UK design-stage rating.
 • Roof top solar PV panels, green roof 
areas and rainwater harvesting – all 
contributing to an Excellent BREEAM 
rating.

 • 18.4% reduction in primary steelworks 
compared to traditional steel frame.

 • 13% less concrete compared with 

traditional benchmarks.

 • 50% ground granulated blast-furnace 
slag (GGBS) content in substructure 
concrete and 40% GGBS content in 
Platform Design for Manufacture and 
Assembly (P-DfMA) floor slabs.

 • All remaining upfront embodied carbon 
has been offset using Gold Standard 
carbon credits.

Taking a prudent approach to 
energy procurement
Landsec has a flexible-procurement 
framework in place to manage wholesale 
energy risk across our portfolio. The 
strategy is to spread risk as much as 
possible by forward-hedging three years 
in advance in six-month trading windows 
to minimise our exposure to market 
conditions, which is to be fully hedged by 
financial year end. We review our usage 
across our assets every quarter to ensure 
we make accurate purchasing decisions 
that meet expected consumption. We have 
again procured 100% renewable electricity 
as part of our ongoing commitment to 
RE100; a global group of large companies 
that will use only 100% renewable power. 

We continue to reduce our exposure to 
the wholesale markets by buying into 
longer-term, fixed-rate renewable 
contracts. We will be aiming to introduce 
Corporate Power Purchasing Agreements 
into Landsec’s fuel mix by 2025. 

Updating our carbon-reduction 
targets, committing to net zero  
by 2040
Our current science-based carbon-
reduction target is to reduce our 
operational carbon emissions by 70% 
by 2030, from a 2013/14 baseline year. 

In October 2021, due to the scale and 
urgency of the climate emergency, the 
Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) 
published the Net-Zero Standard, which 
provides the world’s first credible, 
independent assessment of corporate 
net zero targets. We’ve therefore increased 
our ambition this year in response to this 
standard, updating our science-based 
targets to cover emissions from all sources, 
including all of our reported scope 3 
emissions such as emissions from our 
development pipeline, supply chain and 
customers. We have updated our baseline 
from 2013/14 to 2020 and have committed 
to reach net zero by 2040, ensuring we will 
meet the requirements set out by the SBTi.

—  Overall net-zero target: We’ve 
committed to reaching net zero 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across 
the value chain by 2040 from a 2020 
base year. 

—  Near-term target: We’ve committed 
to reducing absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 
greenhouse gas emissions 47% by 2030 
from a 2020 base year. 

—  Long-term target: We’ve committed to 
reducing absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG 
emissions 90% by 2040 from a 2020 
base year.

To achieve our near-term target, we must 
continue to execute our net zero transition 
investment plan (NZTIP) as detailed 
above. In addition, we must achieve 
our embodied-carbon target by 2030, to 
reduce average upfront embodied carbon 
by 50% compared with a typical building, 
aiming for 500 kgCO2e/m2 for offices and 
400 kgCO2e/m2 for residential.
To achieve our long-term target, we must 
continue to reduce carbon emissions from 
our operational and construction activities. 
This will require us to focus on: targeting 
suppliers with lower carbon impacts, 
investing in and demanding low-carbon 
construction materials, removing fossil fuels 
from our operations, investing in on-site 
renewable-electricity capacity, and working 
with occupiers to promote sustainable 
working practices.

Enhancing nature and green spaces

Nature plays an important role in the built 
environment – nature’s capacity to store 
carbon and support resilient societies is 
linked with the fight against climate change, 
and access to green spaces supports the 
health and wellbeing of those who use 
our places.

We will enhance nature and biodiversity 
across our portfolio, targeting a 25% 
biodiversity net gain across our operational 
sites that currently offer the greatest 
potential, and effectively targeting 15% 
biodiversity net gain at all of our new

Using innovative 
materials at 
Mayfield

Production of cement for use in 
concrete creates approximately 8% 
of total global carbon emissions. 
At our Mayfield regeneration 
scheme, we’ve therefore tested 
Concretene, a pioneering low-
carbon material that has the 
potential to transform the global 
construction sector by providing 
an alternative to traditional 
cement. Concretene uses a product 
called graphene to significantly 
improve the mechanical 
performance of concrete, allowing 
for reductions in the amount of 
material used and the need for 
steel reinforcement. We were 
the first developer to employ 
Concretene on a commercial 
scheme and have used it to create 
a 54x14m mezzanine floor.

developments. Across our retail sites 
we have replaced hedgerows with native 
species at White Rose, Leeds, planted trees 
as part of the Queen’s Green Canopy at 
Gunwharf Quays, and introduced a bee 
hive with 35,000 honey bees at Lewisham 
Shopping Centre. 

This year, we’re investigating how our 
business activities depend on and affect 
nature, so we can integrate nature into 
decision making across our operational 
and development activities. The work will 
consider the draft recommendations of 
the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial 
Disclosures (TNFD) and build upon our 
current commitments, as well as provide 
biodiversity toolkits to support the whole 
business in considering how we can best 
enhance nature and biodiversity through 
our activities.

Using resources efficiently

Water
Over the last year, we have undertaken 
water management assessments across 
assets under our operational control, to 
help shape our water strategy for both 
our office and retail portfolios. 

Actions taken include a programme of work 
to install automatic meter reading (AMR) 
across our portfolio, testing technology 
to obtain increased detail of where water 
is consumed within our buildings and to 
identify potential leaks, and developing 
a water standard for the taps, toilets and 
showers we use across our facilities. 

To raise awareness of the importance of 
saving water, on World Water Day in March 
2023 we communicated our approach to 
water management and reduction across 
the business and encouraged our colleagues 
to take action. We are in the process of 
setting a new water target using 2022/23 
as our baseline year, due to launch later 
this year. 

Waste
In 2022/23 we continued to divert  
100% of waste from landfill and recycled  
68% of operational waste (2021/22: 71%).

Materials 
To use more sustainable materials and  
to use these resources efficiently, we 
encourage reuse and recycling where 
possible, promoting the principles of a 
circular economy. On our development 
schemes, we work closely with our supply 
chain, including carbon consultants in the 
design team from the very start to guide 
decisions on the most carbon-efficient 
solutions. Additionally, our Materials Brief 
sets out the requirements for common 
materials used across our schemes, 
considering health impacts, responsible 
sourcing, carbon and resource efficiency. 
We continue to source all our construction 
materials from ethical sources (materials 
with a responsible sourcing certification).

   We’ve used an innovative alternative to cement 

at Mayfield, Manchester – Concretene.

Creating opportunities 
and tackling local issues

Supporting our communities 
through the cost-of-living crisis
Over the last ten years, we have worked 
hard to support our local communities and 
charities. Our site teams across the UK 
continue to work with community 
organisations to support people affected by 
the cost-of-living crisis, providing support to 
some of the most vulnerable in society.  
This includes:

•  the White Rose team supporting the work 
of the Leeds South and Rethink Food Bank 

•  creating warm spaces for vulnerable 

people at W12 Centre and the O2 Centre

•  introducing the CommUNITY Space at 
Lewisham Shopping Centre, providing 
a warm space for those who need it

•  providing promotional support for The 
Felix Project at Piccadilly Lights, while 
supporting their work at Lewisham 
Shopping Centre.

Our new social-mobility fund, Landsec 
Futures, will enhance this work in our local 
communities, ensuring we have a long-term 
approach to investing in our communities 
over the next ten years. 

Launching Landsec Futures: a fund 
to maximise the potential of people, 
places and communities
In May 2022, we announced our 
commitment to enhance social mobility 
in the real estate industry and the places 
where we invest, committing £20m from 
2023/24 – 2033/34. To achieve this, in April 
2023 we launched Landsec Futures, which 
will provide support through industry and 
local programmes.

This commitment enables us to focus our 
approach to community investment on 
a clear purpose, which is to enhance 
social mobility in the real estate industry 
by creating pathways for people from 
under-represented backgrounds in our 
communities to enter careers in our sector. 

Additionally, we recognise that the 
communities where we create, curate and 
sustain places all face a wide range of local 
issues, from fuel poverty to homelessness, 
and if these issues are not addressed, our 
places won’t thrive. We’re therefore also 
focused on tackling issues local to our 
assets and developments.

We will support people from lower socio-
economic backgrounds who meet key 
metrics outlined by the UK Social Mobility 
Commission, in entering the real estate 
industry, and we will support charities 
that tackle issues local to our assets 
and developments. 

Improving wellbeing

Creating healthy buildings
To ensure we continue to maximise the 
wellbeing of those who occupy our 
buildings, in April 2023 we submitted 
evidence for WELL Portfolio certification 
for four assets; 80-100 Victoria Street, 
Dashwood House, Zig Zag Building and 
One New Change. We are also targeting 
WELL Equity certification for the managed 
offices portfolio. Additionally, across our 
development schemes, we’re targeting 
WELL Core Gold or above for offices and 
the Home Quality Mark or equivalent for 
residential properties.

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023Doing the basics brilliantly

Sustainable procurement
51% of our emissions emanate from our 
supply chain, therefore it is important we 
work with suppliers that share our values 
and help us achieve the highest standards 
in our supply chain, while achieving wider 
social, economic and environmental 
benefits. In June 2022, we published our 
Supply Chain Commitment, which sets 
out how we do business, the commitments 
we’ve set ourselves, and the minimum 
requirements we expect of all those we 
work with. 100% of our strategic partners 
align with our sustainability requirements 
and are working with us for a sustainable 
future, with 93% signing up to our 
commitment to date. Complementing our 
Supply Chain Commitment, we’ve also 
published our Sustainable Procurement 
Guide – a document that provides us with 
the knowledge to make the right decisions 
when buying consumables or business 
services, and to spend money wisely and 
effectively while supporting our corporate 
and sustainability commitments.

To support our supply chain in meeting 
Our Supply Chain Commitments, we’ve 
joined the Supply Chain Sustainability 
School – an online platform that shares 
knowledge and resources to build the 
skills required to achieve a sustainable 
built environment.

Creating healthy, safe and 
secure spaces 
This year we have maintained our ISO 45001 
certification, with independent auditors 
reporting no non-conformances or 
improvement recommendations. A full 
re-certification audit to this standard will 
take place in FY23/24.

We continued to focus our safety 
improvements on areas where we 
know we could have the biggest impact, 
including reducing the risk of significant 
occupational-safety hazards, such as 
working at height, fire safety, and working 
near electromagnetic fields. We have also 
continued to work with other leading 
property companies to establish consistency 
in measuring and reporting health and 
safety data, to enable performance 
benchmarking with our peer group.

Fire safety
We continue to enhance fire safety across 
the business, and ensure we meet new 
government initiatives and legislation. In 
2022, we achieved certification to BS 9997 
for our fire safety management system, 
which we have maintained this year. 
All high-rise residential buildings above 
11 metres in our portfolio have been 
examined by independent fire engineers 
to ensure they remain safe for occupation 
and meet stringent new building 
regulations, with design principles aligned 
with requirements of the Building Safety 
Act mandated on all future schemes. 
We have accepted responsibility under 
the Developers’ Pledge to remediate 
at our expense any life-safety-critical 
defects in any building we developed 
or substantially renovated, going back 
30 years. We will complete any remedial 
works as quickly as possible, with no cost 
and minimum disruption to tenants and 
local communities.

Embedding sustainability  
across our business

Our sustainability framework, Build well, 
Live well, Act well (BWLWAW) is run 
business-wide, as well as at portfolio and 
asset level, helping us embed sustainability 
throughout the business. 

Across our operational portfolio, every asset 
has its own BWLWAW plan that identifies the 
ESG themes relevant to the site, and what it 
will do to support achieving our corporate 
sustainability commitments and targets. 

This year, we published our Sustainable 
Development Toolkit, which provides a 
comprehensive guide for our development 
teams and external partners to ensure we 
design and develop our new schemes and 
refurbishments in line with our sustainability 
vision, corporate commitments and 
targets. It sets out a systematic approach 
for us to achieve sustainable development, 
culminating in a scheme-specific 
sustainability strategy and social value 
strategy being developed. 

Ensuring every colleague takes responsibility 
for achieving our sustainability vision, we link 
a proportion of our remuneration to achieving 
our energy and carbon targets, and we ask 
100% of our colleagues to set an annual 
objective demonstrating how they contribute 
to our sustainability commitments.

This year we also launched our Introduction to 
Sustainability training, to build sustainability 
capability and knowledge across our business. 
The course is mandatory for all colleagues.

Advocating for a sustainable future

We share our experience and challenges 
in aiming for a sustainable future through 
being members of industry bodies such 
as the UK Green Building Council (UKGBC), 
Better Buildings Partnership (BBP) and 
British Property Federation (BPF); by 
responding to public consultations on 
emerging policy; by raising awareness 
with our customers and investors, and 
by contributing to the debate on various 
sustainability topics.

This year, we published our Carbon 
Manifesto, outlining what we are doing to 
reduce our emissions across our portfolio 
and development pipeline and our 
commitment as a partner for government. 
We are calling for action from the 
government: to introduce a performance-
based energy rating scheme; to mandate 
for whole-life carbon assessments for all 
new developments; and to lead by example 
by setting a standard for sustainable 
development through their procurement.

Identifying and responding to 
ESG risks and opportunities

Our approach to sustainability is 
determined by shifting global challenges 
and the ESG issues our stakeholders think 
are most critical for us to address and 
influence through our business activity. 
Our sustainability strategy, targets and 
activity, demonstrate how we are 
responding to these issues and where we 
know we can have the biggest impact. 
Our materiality matrix sets out our high- 
priority issues landsec.com/sustainability/
our-material-issues. 

As the climate crisis becomes more of a 
reality, with increased severe weather, 
tightening legislation, and growing pressure 
from investors and occupiers – we’ve 
identified climate change as a principal risk 
and, as such, govern and manage it in line 
with our risk management and control 
framework. This framework enables us 
to identify, assess and manage climate-
related risks effectively – evaluating the 
potential impact, the consequences, 

allocation of risk owner, description of 
controls and control owners, and finally 
providing an evaluation of any residual risks.

 — You can find more detail about our 

climate change risks and opportunities, 
our mitigation and adaptation strategy, 
and metrics and targets, in our TCFD 
Disclosure Statement on pages 47-53

Additionally, to comply with relevant 
environmental legislation and industry 
standards, we maintain a legal register 
as part of our environmental and energy 
management systems, which are certified 
to ISO 14001 and ISO 50001. We review 
this register quarterly to ensure we 
consider new legislation or regulatory 
changes, and take any necessary action 
to maintain compliance.

Future plans

We have already made great progress with 
our sustainability targets, but with a new 
year comes a fresh opportunity to turn our 
vision and ambition into tangible action. 
We recognise there will be challenges in 
achieving these plans, and we don’t have all 
the answers, but we believe that by being 
explicit in our targets we can incentivise 
and support action across our industry. 

Key to this will be our ongoing collaboration 
with our peers, customers and government 
to ensure we have a united approach that 
achieves the progress and outcomes 
required to create a greener, fairer society 
for all. 

Our priorities for the year ahead:
 • Continue to follow our NZTIP, moving 
our portfolio to net zero and meeting 
the impending Minimum Energy 
Efficiency Standard of EPC B by 2030.

 • Continue to account for carbon at 

the outset of every development and 
refurbishment scheme, striving to 
meet our embodied-carbon targets 
by engaging early with our supply 
chain to secure sustainable construction 
materials, and encouraging our design 
teams and contractors to prioritise 
retention and reposition where possible.

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) statement

047

Landsec has a strong record of leadership on climate 
action and reporting, where we recognise the risks and 
opportunities posed by climate change in our business 
model and strategy.

In 2016, we were the first property company 
in the world to have its carbon emissions 
target approved by the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi). Since then, we 
have reduced emissions, and achieved our 
original science-based target (SBT) in 2019, 
11 years ahead of our 2030 target date. 
In 2019, we increased the ambition of our 
SBT in line with a 1.5ºC global warming 
scenario, which formed the foundation 
of our transition to net zero. Over the last 
year, we have updated our SBT and net zero 
commitment, which SBTi has now approved 
to be in line with their Net-Zero Standard. 
We have also committed to all new 
developments being net zero carbon 
both in construction and operation.

In 2017, we were one of the first companies 
to report our approach to the recommended 
disclosures of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and 
we introduced climate change as a principal 
risk in 2020. Over the last year, we have 
continued to evolve our approach to 
identifying and assessing the risks of climate 
change, by forming a Climate Transition 
Disclosure Working Group and aligning 
our statement with the recommendations 
of the UK Government’s Transition Plan 
Taskforce.

This statement is consistent with the 
requirements of the London Stock Exchange 
(LSE) Listing Rule 9.8.6 R and all 11 TCFD 
Recommendations and Recommended 
Disclosures, and we can confirm we have 
made climate-related financial disclosures 
for the year ended 31 March 2023 in relation 
to governance, strategy, risk management 
and metrics and targets.

Governance
Board oversight and reporting
The Board is responsible for overseeing 
our approach to climate-related risks and 
opportunities affecting the business, with 
our CEO having overall responsibility.

The Board receives reports on our 
sustainability and climate-related 
performance twice per calendar year, 
and this year has focused on the progress 
of our transition plans, embedding our new 
sustainability framework across the business 
and monitoring performance of our SBT 
and embodied-carbon commitments.

As we consider climate change a principal 
risk, the Board considers the impact of 
climate risks when discussing Landsec 
strategy and long-term success, including 
significant investment decisions.

We continue to progress our net zero 
transition investment plan and are on track 
with what we need to do to meet our 
science-based carbon reduction target, 
and have incorporated this into our 
financial statements.

Roles, responsibilities and accountability
The Audit Committee supports the Board 
in managing risk, and is responsible for 
reviewing our principal risk register, and 
the effectiveness of our risk management 
and internal control processes.

Ongoing responsibility and management 
of climate-related risks is carried out by the 
Executive Leadership Team (ELT), chaired 
by our CEO and supported by our CFO and 
Managing Directors. The ELT is responsible

Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) statement continued

We’ve considered these over the short 
(<1 year), medium (until 2030) and 
long-term (beyond 2030) against two 
science-based scenarios – below 2ºC 
(aligned with Shared Socioeconomic 
Pathways (SSPs) SSP1-2.6) and exceeding 
4ºC (aligned with SSP5-8.5).

We summarise the output of our scenario 
analysis below, where we have used MSCI’s 
Climate Value at Risk (VaR) methodology 
to assess our portfolio exposure to climate 
risks. Physical risks are assessed based on 
the geolocation of assets and their exposure 
to individual hazards as a consequence of 
climate change. Transitional risks are assessed 
based on alignment of assets to relevant 
regulations (e.g. Minimum Energy Efficiency 
Standards (MEES)) and market demand.

Assessing impact of climate-related risks 
and opportunities on our strategy
Based on the risks identified in our scenario 
analysis and following our group risk 
management framework and methodology, 
we have assessed these against likelihood 
(1 being very unlikely; 5 being very likely) 
and potential financial impact (1 being 
insignificant (< £75m); 5 being very significant 
(> £500m)) across all areas of our business 
including investments, divestments, 
development and operations to determine 
both inherent risk (before mitigating actions) 
and residual risk (after mitigating actions).

Culture
We’re working towards a culture centred 
on trust, empowerment and accountability. 
Our culture comes from the values we share. 
These values guide the way we interact with 
others and help us make the right decisions. 

Sustainability, which includes our focus 
on climate-related risks, has long been a 
strategic priority for Landsec and as such, 
is embedded within our culture. Every 
colleague is empowered to contribute to 
our purpose with consideration for the 
environmental, social and economic issues 
relevant to our business and stakeholders – 
our Employee Code of Conduct provides 
guidance on how to do this and highlights 
key policies, including our Sustainability 
Policy that all colleagues must follow. 

To hold colleagues accountable, every 
colleague is encouraged to set an annual 
objective demonstrating how they will 
contribute to achieving our sustainability 
vision and commitments. Achievement 
of this objective is assessed annually and 
forms part of our performance-related pay.

Over the last year, we launched our 
Landsec Spotlight Awards to recognise 
individuals, projects and teams who 
demonstrate bringing our purpose to life, 
whereby celebrating our achievements 
is an important part of our culture.

To support our strategy and further 
establish sustainability throughout the 
business, we have created our Green 
Financing Framework, enabling us to issue 
green bonds. It describes the types of 
projects eligible, the process for selecting 
and allocating projects, management 
of proceeds and reporting in support of 
our climate transition aims. It has been 
third-party assured and aligns with the 
Green Bond Principles 2021 and Green 
Loans Principles 2021 administered by 
ICMA and LMA, respectively.

The framework can be accessed on our 
website: landsec.com/investorsdebt-
investors/green-bonds

Incentives and remuneration
Our commitment to addressing climate 
risk runs throughout the business, with 
climate-related targets linked to a 
proportion of our bonus remuneration, 
including our science-based carbon 
reduction target, energy efficiency and 
embodied carbon from new developments. 

Skills, competencies and training
Over the last year, as we continue to 
mitigate the risks of climate change and 
transition our portfolio to net zero, we’ve 
focused on increasing Board and executive 
leadership level awareness and knowledge 
on our science-based carbon reduction 
targets and the actions that we need to 
take to meet them, including executing 
our net-zero transition investment plan 
(NZTIP) and our ambitious embodied 
carbon targets.

Further, we are ensuring everyone across 
our business undertakes sustainability 
training, which includes information on 
our sustainability strategy and approach 
to climate change – demonstrating how 
everyone can play a part in reducing our 
contribution to climate change and 
preparing for inevitable changes in climate. 
Additionally, we’ve joined the Supply Chain 
Sustainability School which provides an 
online platform to share knowledge and 
resources to build the skills required to 
deliver a sustainable built environment.

Strategy
Identifying climate-related risks and 
opportunities
In accordance with TCFD recommendations, 
we’ve identified climate risks and 
opportunities against (1) transition risks: 
related to the transition to a low carbon 
economy and (2) physical risks: related 
to the physical impacts of climate change.

Time horizons

How Landsec defines

Short (<1 year)

Our immediate business planning and budgeting for each asset occurs annually, so it is important that appropriate resource for 
mitigating and adapting to climate change is identified each year and included in annual budgets.

Medium (until 2030)

We are taking action now until 2030 to meet our near-term science-based carbon reduction target.

Long (beyond 2030)

Many of our assets have a design lifespan of over 60 years – therefore, identifying long-term risks beyond 2030 is important for our 
investment and development decisions, to ensure our portfolio remains resilient in the long term.

Short term (< 1 year)

Medium term (until 2030)

Long term (beyond 2030)

< 2ºC scenario
Proactive and sustained 
action to halve emissions by 
2030 and reach net zero by 
2050 – rapid investment and 
adoption of low-carbon 
technology and sustainable 
business and lifestyle practices.

UK climate is marginally higher 
temperatures all year round, 
lower precipitation in summer; 
flooding and windstorms 
within current variability.

Low physical risks as only a small proportion of 
our portfolio (2.5% VaR) is exposed to aggregated 
physical risk (extreme cold, extreme heat, flooding, 
windstorms and wildfire). The most significant 
physical risk to our portfolio is from coastal 
flooding (1.8% VaR).

Medium transitional risks associated with existing 
regulations, for example, Minimum Energy Efficiency 
Standards (MEES) requiring all non-domestic 
properties to meet a minimum EPC E by 1 April 2023 
and local planning requirements favouring low 
embodied carbon development schemes.

In addition, there is increasing occupier and investor 
demand for assets with high sustainability 
credentials, as more of these stakeholders set net 
zero commitments and are required to report on 
the sustainability outcomes of their investments.

Low physical risks as only a small proportion of 
our portfolio (5.4% VaR) is exposed to aggregated 
physical risk. The most significant physical risk to 
our portfolio is from coastal flooding (4.1% VaR).

Low transitional risks due to no mitigation 
actions or policies in place to reduce emissions.

> 4ºC scenario
Limited actions are taken to 
mitigate climate change – 
there is a push for economic 
and social development at 
whatever costs.

UK climate will experience 
an increase in severe weather 
events (flash flooding); 
increased summer and 
winter temperatures; drier 
summers and wetter winters.

Physical risks remain the same 
as the short term.

High transitional risks 
associated with:
 • Emerging regulations, for 

example, MEES requiring all 
non-domestic properties to 
meet a minimum of EPC B 
by 2030.

 • Carbon tax – potential for the 

built environment to be 
included in UK Emissions 
Trading Scheme.

 • Operational and embodied 
carbon obligations for our 
development schemes – some 
planning requirements need 
projected operational energy 
emission shortfalls to be 
offset – Greater London 
Authority recommends a price 
of £95t/CO2e.

Additionally, our commitment 
to develop net zero buildings 
requires the residual embodied 
carbon to be offset via the 
Voluntary Carbon Market, where 
prices vary significantly based on 
quality of credit.
 • Continued increase in occupier 
and investor demand for ESG.

Physical and transitional 
risks remain the same as the 
short term.

Slight increase in physical risks 
but no significant change to 
overall portfolio exposure to 
climate risks. For instance, slightly 
warmer summers are expected 
but these don’t pose significant 
risk of heat stress.

Transition risks remain high 
as further mitigation actions and 
legislative changes are expected 
to continue driving reductions in 
carbon emissions.

Significant increase in physical 
risks from hotter, drier summers; 
warmer, wetter winters and more 
frequent severe weather events. 
Sea level rise puts additional 
strain on the Thames Barrier and 
increase in river peak flows has 
potential for flood defence failures 
across the UK, leading to higher 
portfolio exposure.

Significant increase in 
transitional risks as adaptation 
measures are adopted to cope 
with changes in climate and 
associated physical risks.

Addressing our climate-related risks and 
opportunities across our business model
Our assessment concluded that our current 
portfolio is not highly exposed to physical 
risks given the location of our assets, and 
the impact of physical risks to our portfolio 
will only become more relevant in the long 
term, under a > 4ºC scenario. Conversely, 
transition risks are material in the short 
and medium term as we expect increasing 
mitigation actions to be taken to reduce 
emissions, such as policy and regulation 
changes, as well as changes in customer 
and investor preference.

We are addressing these risks and 
opportunities through three priorities, 
all of which are critical elements of our 
approach to sustainability – Build well, 
Live well, Act well:
 • Decarbonising our portfolio
 • Developing net zero carbon buildings
 • Building resilience to a changing climate

Decarbonising our portfolio 
In an effort to reduce our contribution 
to climate change, we need to reduce 
our operational carbon emissions from 
the assets that we own and manage. 
This year, we’ve increased the ambition 
of our carbon reduction target to align 

with the SBTi Net-Zero Standard and have 
continued to progress our £135m Net Zero 
Transition Investment Plan (NZTIP).

The Net-Zero Standard sets out a consistent 
definition of net zero and the science-based 
requirements of achieving it. To meet the 
standard, and demonstrate the business 
is moving towards net zero, we must set 
two reduction targets; a near-term target 
(5-10 years) and a long-term target (2050 
at the latest). The near-term target must 
cover 95% of scope 1 and 2 emissions and 
67% of scope 3 emissions. The long-term 
target must increase scope 3 coverage to 
90%. Both targets must align with a 1.5ºC 
ambition level of limiting temperature rise.

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023 
051

Our near-term carbon reduction target
We commit to an absolute reduction in 
all emissions of 47% by 2030, from a 2020 
baseline year. 

We commit to reduce absolute scope 1 
and 2 GHG emissions by 60% by 2030, 
from a 2020 baseline year. We also 
commit to reducing absolute scope 3 
GHG emissions from all reported sources 
by 45% within the same timeframe.

Our long-term carbon reduction target
We commit to reaching net-zero GHG 
emissions across the value chain by 2040.

We commit to reducing absolute scopes 1, 
2 and 3 GHG emissions 90% by 2040, 
from a 2020 base year.

To meet our near-term science-based 
target and stay ahead of impending 
2030 MEES requirements of minimum 
EPC B, we’ve continued to progress our 
£135m NZTIP:
 • Optimising building management 

systems across our portfolio, deploying 
innovative technologies such as artificial 
intelligence to reduce operational 
energy consumption.

 • Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, 

replacing gas-fired boilers with electric 
systems such as air source heat 
pumps (ASHP).

 • Increasing on-site renewable electricity 
generation by installing solar panels 
across our retail assets.

 • Engaging and collaborating with our 

customers on energy efficiency to reduce 
consumption within their spaces.

 — We provide further details on the 
progress of our NZTIP on page 41

We continue to operate our buildings 
in accordance with our Company-wide 
environmental and energy management 
system, which is certified to ISO 14001 and 
ISO 50001, having energy-reduction plans 
(ERPs) and action plans for all our assets, 
which outline how we will reduce the 
energy use and carbon emissions of each 
asset effectively. The ERPs form part of 
the operational financial planning for 
each asset.

As we continue to build relationships 
with our suppliers, the climate-related 
information they provide (such as carbon 
emissions, energy consumption and 
relevant climate-related targets) allows 
us to better understand their operations 
and prioritise future engagement activity.

Research shows buildings that have high sustainability credentials attract 
higher average rents, improving leasing and occupancy rates. Improved 
energy efficiency should also improve service charges payable by tenants.

Conversely, older, less sustainable assets will ultimately see longer voids 
for retrofits and a loss of rental income where they do not meet the 
minimum EPC requirements.

To achieve our targets, we developed our £135m NZTIP. The focus of this 
is capital spending to electrify energy across the portfolio, improving the 
capital value of the affected assets, which have shown more resilience 
to yield pressures than assets without a clear ESG strategy. The cost of 
our NZTIP will fluctuate over the next seven years as we account for changes 
in inflation. 

Developing net zero carbon buildings
A credible net zero claim for a building 
must address both upfront embodied 
carbon and operational carbon, and align 
with industry best practice – currently this 
is the UK Green Building Council (UKGBC) 
framework definition of net zero. The 
framework requires embodied carbon to be 
minimised and offset at practical completion, 
and reductions in energy demand and 
consumption to be prioritised over all other 
measures. There should be no reliance on 
fossil fuels and on-site renewables should 
be prioritised, and any remaining carbon 
should be offset using a recognised 
offsetting framework.

Our commitment to creating net zero 
carbon buildings
We are committed to designing and 
building net zero buildings in accordance 
with the UKGBC framework definition 
and have set a target to reduce upfront 
embodied carbon by 50% compared 
with a typical building by 2020, seeking 
to achieve <500kgCO2e/m2 for office 
developments and <400kgCO2e/m2 for 
residential ones.

The commitment forms a key part of 
our Sustainable Development Toolkit – a 
comprehensive guide for our development 
teams and external partners to ensure that 
sustainability is considered throughout the 
life-cycle of our schemes.

We engage carbon consultants on each 
of our developments. These become part 
of our design team from the very onset 
of the process. Alongside the guidance 
from our internal teams, their role is to 
guide decision making towards the most 
carbon-efficient solution, balancing 
upfront carbon with whole-life carbon, 
to ensure our design decisions do not 
affect the longer-term carbon impacts 
of our assets negatively.

All whole-life carbon models align with 
the RICS guidance Whole life carbon 
assessment for the built environment 
first edition, November 2017. 

To reduce upfront embodied carbon, we 
look at a number of different interventions:
 • Structural retention and material reuse 

to avoid using virgin material.

 • Building as lean as possible to use less 
material and put less pressure on the 
foundations beneath the building.

 • Using low-carbon materials like timber or 
concrete with high cement replacement.
 • Prioritising local procurement to minimise 

transport emissions.

We track embodied carbon throughout the 
design evolution of a building and during 
construction, and we receive twice-yearly 
updates to the model based on actual 
material quantities brought to site and 
emissions from site. At the end of a project, 
we receive an ‘as-built’ model, which 
represents the actual upfront carbon 
emissions of the project. We then purchase 
high-quality carbon offsets that comply with 
the UKGBC’s eight principles of offsetting.

Strong and increasing market demand for net zero properties, especially 
in the office market, is outstripping supply, which will likely lead to rent 
and value premia for these assets.

Increased demand for low-carbon materials, many of which are still 
nascent markets, could increase the construction costs of our 
development pipeline.

Increased demand for low-carbon materials could delay completion dates, 
increasing construction costs in our development pipeline.

Building resilience to a changing climate
Although we assessed that our current 
portfolio is not highly exposed to physical 
risks given the location of our assets, we still 
take action to mitigate these risks through 
physical measures, insurance and business-
continuity planning.

In our development pipeline, we’re 
designing and constructing high-quality 
buildings and spaces capable of achieving 
operational resilience over their lifetime, 
considering how the UK’s climate will 
change in the coming decades. We manage 
the impact of physical risks, such as higher 
cooling costs and lower heating demand, 

by adapting building services design, 
reducing heating capacity and maintaining 
summer cooling capacity to cope with 
heatwaves. The performance of our 
facades and fabric materials is designed to 
address the expected higher temperatures 
by minimising energy demand, as well as to 
be able to withstand extreme temperatures 
and increased wind speeds, to avoid 
maintenance issues or damage to buildings 
in future. We target operational energy 
intensities in line with industry net zero 
carbon benchmarks, wherever available. 
Our drainage strategies are designed to 
mitigate foreseen rain levels and flood risks 
using physical and nature-based solutions.

Across our operational portfolio, assets in 
areas highly exposed to physical risks have 
developed plans to ensure that adequate 
protection and mitigation are in place, 
including business-continuity and 
emergency-response plans.

Our Responsible Property Investment 
Policy details how we assess climate risks 
during the sale and acquisition of assets. 
We conduct thorough due diligence, 
understanding the asset’s performance 
metrics including energy consumption, EPCs 
and other sustainability credentials, assessing 
flood risk and embodied carbon, and work 
with MSCI to use their Climate Risk Due 
Diligence Analysis platform for acquisitions.

Increased capital investment to maintain compliance with legal requirements, 
such as improving EPC ratings across the portfolio, and also to protect our 
assets at risk from physical climate change. Failure to do so would affect the 
long-term capital values of these assets negatively.

Resilience of our strategy 
and business model
Our analysis gives us confidence in the 
resilience of our strategy, as we’re 
supporting the transition to a low-carbon 
world whilst managing the impact of 
climate-related risks to our portfolio. 
We recognise our strategy and adaptation 
measures may need to evolve in the long 
term, particularly under a > 4ºC scenario.

Under a > 4ºC scenario, our analysis 
demonstrates that changes to our strategy 
and financial planning will be required. 
This will likely include divestment of assets 
which are less resilient to extreme heat and 
rainfall, or investment into infrastructure 
to limit the impact of flooding and coastal 
surge. This scenario could also result in 
changes to our customers’ and supply chain 

partners’ businesses, including business 
failures, or supply chain disruption. 
Increased due diligence in supply chain 
selection will be required, particularly 
considering the sourcing of construction 
materials which may be processed or 
manufactured in countries where the 
effects of climate change are more extreme.

Through the implementation of our 
mitigation strategies we have assessed our 
residual risks to be minor as detailed in the 
Assessing impact of climate-related risks 
and opportunities on our strategy section.

Engagement
We are committed to leading the way 
to a lower-carbon economy and aim to 
redefine what it is to be a modern landlord. 
We recognise that we don’t have all the 

answers, but are ready and willing to 
engage with others to address the 
emissions challenge.

Over the last year, we have continued to 
engage across the value chain, from our 
customer engagement programme to 
reduce energy consumption within their 
spaces, to launching our new Supply Chain 
Commitment and becoming members of 
the Supply Chain Sustainability School. 
We are active participants of industry 
groups, including the Better Buildings 
Partnership, British Property Federation 
and UKGBC and work with members to 
accelerate change. 

To further drive industry demand for low- 
carbon steel and concrete, we’re signatory 
members of SteelZero and ConcreteZero.

Risk management
Climate change is identified as one of 
Landsec’s ten principal risks, and is therefore 
governed and managed in line with our risk 
management and control framework. 

We identify, assess and manage climate-
related risks through the framework – with 
the risks clearly defined and owned, with 
their potential impacts and consequences 
noted. Risks are scored, as described in the 
Managing Risks and Principal Risks sections 
on page 54, on a gross and net basis, 
following evaluation of the mitigating 
controls in place. Furthermore, Landsec has 
defined its appetite for each risk, including 
climate-related risks, and this is overlaid 
when considering any residual risks. 

As part of its overall responsibility for 
risk, the Board undertakes an annual 
assessment, taking account of risks that 
would threaten our business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity, as well 
as the Group’s strategic objectives. We use 
scenario modelling, including the climate 
scenario analysis described above, to better 
understand the impact of these risks on our 
business model when placed under varying 
degrees of stress, enabling us to consider 
interdependencies and test plausible 
mitigation plans.

The primary responsibility for, and 
management of, each risk is assigned 
to a specific member of the ELT, who is 
accountable for ensuring the operating 
effectiveness of the internal control systems 
and for implementing key risk mitigation 
plans. Risks are also assigned a secondary 
owner – usually at the Senior Leader level – 
who is responsible for ensuring we mitigate 
the risk appropriately.

Our Corporate Affairs Director has primary 
responsibility for climate risk, with the Head 
of ESG and Sustainability having secondary 
responsibility. Our climate change principal 
risk includes both transition and physical 
climate risks as detailed above, and is 
monitored quarterly using a series of key 
risk indicators as detailed in the Metrics 
and targets section.

 — Our risk management process to 
address our principal risks and 
uncertainties, including climate change, 
is detailed further on page 56 

Metrics and targets
Targets
To address climate change risks, we have set ambitious climate-related targets within our sustainability framework, Build well, Live well, 
Act well – the headlines of which are summarised below:

Decarbonising our portfolio

Near-term target: reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 47% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline

Long-term target: reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 90% by 2040 from a 2020 baseline

Developing net zero carbon buildings

Reducing upfront embodied carbon across our developments by 50% compared with a typical building by 2030

Ensure 100% of assets located in areas highly exposed to climate risks have adaption measures in place

Building resilience to a changing climate

 — Performance against these are detailed in our Sustainability Performance and Data Report: landsec.com/sustainability/reports-

Managing risk

Risk management is embedded throughout Landsec; 
from annual business planning to the day-to-day 
operational management of our assets. 

Our key successes in 2022/2023

 • Alignment of the risk management 

framework with the business 
structure and development of 
business area risk registers and 
associated governance structures
 • Development of risk registers for key 
support functions, reinforcing roles 
and responsibilities for risk ownership 
between functions and business areas

 • Assessment and application of 
risk appetite across all risks, 
underpinning business decision 
making and planning 

 • New risk waterfall implemented 
overlaying risk appetite to clearly 
identify where risks are inside or 
outside of tolerance.

Our key priorities in 2023/2024

 • Continued embedding of risk review 
governance structures and cadence 
– strengthening linkages between 
risk, appetite and business planning
 • Further development and definition 
of key risk indicator thresholds and 
formalised reporting mechanisms
 • Revisiting and refreshing the Board 

risk appetite statement

 • Embedding risk acceptance process 
as part of maturing understanding 
of appetite and governance of risk.

Risk management framework 
and governance
We have an established risk management 
and control framework, which is embedded 
throughout the Company. This framework 
enables us to identify, evaluate and 
manage our principal and emerging risks 
effectively. Our approach is not to eliminate 
risk, but to manage it within our appetite. 
Key elements of the framework are: 
 • The Board has overall responsibility for 
overseeing risk and for maintaining a 
robust risk management and internal 
control system. 

 • The Audit Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control system 
during the year.

 • The Executive Leadership Team is 

responsible for day-to-day monitoring 
and management of Group-wide risks, 
emerging risks and key risk indicators (KRIs). 

 • Business area leadership teams monitor 
and manage risks and emerging risks 
relevant to their business areas.

 • The Risk and Assurance function oversees 

the framework, providing support, 
challenge and insight to business areas 
and support functions. 

 • The Group Insurance team sits within 

the overall Risk and Assurance function, 
enabling collaboration between 
Insurance and Risk teams and detailed 
consideration of risk treatment planning, 
residual risk and transference to the 
insurance market, where appropriate.

Identifying and evaluating risks 
As part of annual business planning, the 
Board undertakes an assessment of the 
risks that would threaten the Group’s 
strategic objectives, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. We use scenario 
modelling to better understand the impact 
of these risks on our business model when 
placed under varying degrees of stress, 
enabling us to consider interdependencies 
and test plausible mitigation plans. Senior 
management and teams across the 
business identify the strategic, operational, 
and legal and compliance risks, facing each 
area of our business. Risks are reviewed in 
detail with their respective owners, typically 
an ELT member or key business leader. 

We use a risk scoring matrix to consider the 
likelihood and impact of each risk at regular 
points throughout the year. We evaluate 
risks on an inherent (before mitigating 
actions) and residual (after mitigating 
actions and controls) basis. From this, we 
identify principal risks (current risks with 
relatively high impact and certainty) and 
emerging risks (risks where the extent and 
implications are not yet fully understood). 

These are included on our Group Risk 
Register, which the Executive Leadership 
Team challenges and validates. The Audit 
Committee reviews our principal risks 
before presenting them to the Board.

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023055

Risk appetite
The Board is responsible for defining the 
level of risk the Group is willing to take 
and ensuring it remains in line with our 
strategy. Risk appetite is a forward-looking 
view, and is informed by Landsec’s current 
and future risk management philosophy. 
Comparing the residual score to appetite 
helps to determine how risks or opportunities 
are managed. To embed risk appetite 
effectively in the business we have established 
key risk indicators associated with each risk, 
defining limits that are aligned to our 
appetite. Scenario planning assists in 
setting these thresholds.

Management and assurance of risks
Day-to-day ownership and management 
of key risks is assigned to members of 
the Executive Leadership Team. They are 
responsible for ensuring the effectiveness 
of controls and for implementing risk 
mitigation plans, where necessary. Business 
area leadership teams review their risks 
quarterly and the ELT reviews the Group 

Risk Register bi-annually. The Board reviews 
principal and emerging risks bi-annually, 
with principal risks presented for review 
at each Audit Committee meeting. 

The principal operational risks, including 
health and safety, and information 
security and cyber threat are managed 
by dedicated second-line functions that 
define and implement policy and mitigating 
controls, and undertake assurance activities. 
Risk deep-dives are completed throughout 
the year for specific risks, evaluating the 
current risk level and risk appetite, and 
agreeing any further actions. 

Landsec has an Internal Audit function that 
provides independent assurance over key 
controls and processes to management and 
the Audit Committee. We identify where 
the impact of controls is greatest i.e. where 
there is a relatively high inherent risk and 
relatively low residual risk, and this helps to 
focus the work of Internal Audit and other 
assurance providers.

 — See page 88 for more information 

in the Report of the Audit Committee

In addition, the Risk and Assurance team 
manages Landsec’s Key Controls Toolkit. 
The Toolkit is a set of clearly defined 
controls that are self-certified by control 
owners within the business on a quarterly 
basis, providing ongoing assurance and 
coverage of key risk areas. The Audit 
Committee monitors the results of this 
process. The Audit Committee also reviews 
our risk management framework at least 
twice a year as well as our Assurance Map, 
which sets out the key controls and assurance 
activities for each risk. This supports the 
Committee’s evaluation of the control 
environment and the adequacy of 
assurance activity. The Committee also 
receives a summary report at each 
meeting, describing key second and 
third-line assurance activities, including 
internal audits, actions agreed and the 
status of open risk mitigation actions.

Principal risks and uncertainties

Effectively understanding and managing Landsec’s 
principal risks and uncertainties allows our business 
leaders and the Board to make informed decisions.

Our principal risks consist of the ten most 
significant group risks, including seven 
strategic and three operational risks. The 
strategic risks relate to the macroeconomic 
environment; our key markets – office and 
retail; capital allocation; development; 
climate change; and people and skills. 
The operational risks are health and safety; 
and information security and cyber-attack. 
‘Change projects fail to deliver’ is a new 
operational principal risk this year.

The risk waterfall below sets out Landsec’s 
principal risks in columns from left to right 
ordered according to the level of residual 
risk. The colour of the header box indicates 
whether the risk is strategic (light blue) 
or operational (dark blue). Risk scores are 
generated by the multiplication of the 

impact and likelihood of a risk incident 
occurring using a five-by-five scale. The 
yellow arrows indicate the inherent risk 
score before mitigating controls and blue 
arrows show residual risk scores after 
taking account of controls, as determined 
at year end. 

Our appetite range for each risk is reflected 
by the white box. The lower down the 
column the box is, the lower our appetite. 
The appetite range is a future looking view 
as opposed to risk scores, which are stated 
as at the year end. For risks that have 
been mitigated to within our appetite, 
the blue residual arrow is within the box. 
The appetite for each risk, when compared 
to the residual score, helps to determine 
business priorities and mitigation activities 
in the future. 

Appetite ranges are: ‘Open’ (where we 
are focused on maximising opportunities); 
‘Flexible’ (willing to consider all options); 
‘Cautious’ (where we are willing to tolerate 
a degree of risk); ‘Minimalist’ (preferring 
options with low inherent risk); and ‘Averse’ 
(where we avoid risk and uncertainty). 
Risk appetite is a continuum and the range 
for some risks extend over more than one 
of these categories.

At present, there are no residual risk scores 
above appetite, though some are below, 
indicating an opportunity for greater risk 
to be taken in delivering business activities. 
The tables on the following pages describe 
each principal risk in detail, including 
mitigating controls, KRIs and changes 
in the year.

1 Macroeconomic outlook

Executive responsible | Mark Allan 

Appetite: Flexible/Cautious

Changes in the macroeconomic 
environment result in reduced 
demand for space or deferral 
of decisions by retail and office 
occupiers. Due to the length 
of build projects, the prevailing 
economic climate at initiation 
may be different from that 
at completion.

Example KRIs
 • UK Gross Domestic Product
 • UK household spending levels
 • Inflation rate

 • Interest rates
 • Business confidence
 • Employment intentions
 • Our loan to value ratio

Mitigation
 • KRIs monitored
 • Scenario-based modelling of 

plausible economic trajectories
 • Research team prepares reports 

for ELT and area leadership teams 
on macroeconomic and internal 
risk metrics

 • Twice-yearly Cycle Watch produced 
by our Research team, analysing 
macroeconomic, political and 
market-risk factors – which is also 
used for budget and forecasting 
assumptions

 • Business portfolios prepare 

quarterly reporting to review sector 
and market risks 

CHANGE IN YEAR | INCREASING

The UK economy has endured a 
tumultuous 2022/23 with inflation, 

interest rate rises and high energy 
prices leading to a slow-down in the 
UK market – and potential for 
recession. The risk increased in the 
first-half of the year and has softened 
in 2023, with inflation appearing to 
have peaked and energy prices falling. 

Overall, the risk has increased over 
the course of the year. The net risk 
remains in line with our ‘Flexible/
Cautious’ appetite.

2 Office occupier market

Executive responsible | Marcus Geddes 

Appetite: Flexible

Structural changes in customer 
expectations leading to changing 
demand for office space and the 
consequent impact on income 
and asset values. Further, the risk 
includes the inability to identify 
or adapt to changing markets 
in a timely manner.

Example KRIs
 • Office usage percentages
 • Percentage of lease expiries over 

our five-year plan

 • Like-for-like rental income metrics
 • Customer and space churn

 • Forward-looking market intelligence 

reviewed regularly

Mitigation
 • Customer relationship and 
customer base monitoring
 • KRIs monitored and reviewed 

monthly by Office leadership team

 • ESG programme to decarbonise 
office portfolio and strengthen 
prime property portfolio by 
meeting changing occupier needs 
 • Customer satisfaction measured 

 • Market-led demand and customer 
expectations for environmentally 
sustainable office space closely 
monitored

 • Strict credit policy and process, 

including regular review of 
customers at risk

 • Future of Work forum hosted by our 
Insight team, examining disruption 
themes and megatrends in ways 
of working

 • Void rates across our portfolio

regularly

CHANGE IN YEAR | DECREASING

The risk has reduced, as businesses 
have defined and implemented new 
working practices, office occupancy 
has settled and demand for prime 
space has strengthened.

Residual risk at year end was below 
our ‘Flexible’ appetite – reflecting our 
view of the office occupier market 
outlook and opportunities for stronger 
leasing terms in the coming year.

3 Retail and hospitality occupier market

Executive responsible | Bruce Findlay 

Appetite: Flexible

Structural changes in consumer 
expectations leading to changes 
in demand for retail or hospitality 
space and the consequent impact 
on income and asset values.

Example KRIs
 • Asset guest numbers
 • UK net retail openings and 

asset-vacancy rates
 • Portfolio void rates 

 • Percentage of lease expiries over 

 • Brand Account, Asset Management 

five years

 • Customer credit risk and tenant 

counterparty risk

Mitigation
 • KRIs monitored and reviewed 

monthly by Retail leadership team

 • Brand partner relationship and 
guest experience monitoring
 • Data-led development of asset 

and sector strategies, promoting 
proactive leasing

and Guest Experiences teams 
established

 • Customer satisfaction surveys
 • Strict credit policy and process, 

including regular review of 
customers at risk 

CHANGE IN YEAR | NO CHANGE

This risk has remained consistent as 
the impacts of the pandemic have 

levelled – with online penetration 
falling from lockdown levels and 
growing omni-channel business 
models. With the potential for 
recession, we continue to monitor 
the risk.

Residual risk at year end was below 
our ‘Flexible’ appetite – reflecting 
our view of the retail and hospitality 
market outlook and opportunities 
for stronger leasing terms in the 
coming year.

4

Information security and cyber threat

Executive responsible | Mark Lockton-Goddard 

Appetite: Cautious

Data loss or disruption to 
business processes, corporate 
systems or building-management 
systems resulting in a negative 
reputational, operational, 
regulatory or financial impact.

Example KRIs
 • Speed of threat and vulnerability 

detection (against agreed Pen test/
External Assurance Schedule)
 • Speed of threat and vulnerability 

resolution

 • Number of major cyber incidents 

or data-loss events

 • Incident Response and Recovery 

Plan reviewed and tested

 • Completion rates on cyber security 

and data-protection training
 • Number of critical, strategic or 

infosec partners without current 
cyber-security diligence

Mitigation
 • IT security policies set out our 
standards for security and 
penetration testing, vulnerability 
and patch management, data 
disposal and access control
 • A specific Cyber Security team 
and Data Protection Officer
 • Quarterly assessment of key 

IT controls

 • Monitored mandatory cyber 
security and GDPR training

 • Third-party IT providers subject 
to information-security vendor 
assessment

 • Close working with IT service 
partners to manage risk and 
improve technical standards
 • Defined technical IT standards 

for all building systems

 • Extensive use of cloud-based 

systems

 • Business resilience, crisis 

management and IT disaster-
recovery plans in place for all 
assets, including regular testing
 • Regular penetration testing across 

our IT estate and vulnerability-
management system

 • Corporate environment cyber 

insurance in place including access 
to instant support and external 
expertise and resources

CHANGE IN YEAR | DECREASING

The risk has reduced in the year, 
largely due to significant investment 
in, and development of, our cyber 
capability – as validated by an 
independent review.

We continue to develop and invest 
in the wider information security 
and cyber-control environment, and 
remain vigilant as the cyber threat 
landscape continues to evolve.

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023058

Principal risks and uncertainties 
continued

5 Change projects

Landsec is engaging in a number 
of important internal change 
programmes aiming to deliver 
operational and cultural benefits. 
There is a risk that these projects 
fail to deliver the identified 
benefits in a timely manner 
and to budget.

Example KRIs
 • Key project milestones missed
 • Projects operating without 
appropriate governance
 • Success criteria achieved at 

post-implementation reviews 
and audits

Mitigation
 • ELT sponsorship, with ELT and 

Board oversight

6 Capital allocation

Capital allocated to specific 
assets, sectors or locations does 
not yield the expected returns 
i.e. we are not effective in placing 
capital or recycling.

Specifically:
 • Mixed-use urban neighbourhood 

developments do not yield 
expected returns

 • Development of assets not 

matched to expected demand
 • Retaining assets with low yields 

that should be recycled

Example KRIs
 • Committed development pipeline 

10% GDV

 • Portfolio liquidity
 • Loan to value
 • Headroom over development 

capital expenditure

 • Speculative development, 

pre-development and trading 
property risk exposure

 • Group hedging
 • Net debt

Mitigation
 • Monthly monitoring of capital 

disciplines and KRIs by business 
area boards, ELT and PLC Board

 • Detailed market and product 
analysis to enable optimal 
investment decisions

Executive responsible | ELT 

Appetite: Cautious

 • Project governance methodology
 • Qualified project managers used 

on all large projects

 • Documented and approved 

benefits cases

 • Company-wide communication 
supported by Senior Leadership 
Team engagement

 • Regular progress reporting to 

project boards

CHANGE IN YEAR | NEW RISK

The number and impact of active 
change projects at Landsec has 
resulted in increased risk associated 
with programmes not achieving 
identified outcomes.

Cultural change is a key element of 
the wider change portfolio, making 
it of particular importance.

Executive responsible | Mark Allan 

Appetite: Flexible/Cautious

 • Rigorous and established 

governance and approval processes 
through the business area 
leadership, ELT and Board

 • Investment Appraisal Guidelines 

define the key investment criteria, 
the risk assessment process, key 
stakeholders and the delegations 
of authority

 • Stress-testing of scenarios as part 

of decision making

CHANGE IN YEAR | NO CHANGE

We have a clear view of the scale 
of the opportunity in each sector 
and relative returns achievable 
across Central London, major retail 

destinations and mixed-use urban 
neighbourhoods. 

The macroeconomic backdrop has 
put upward pressure on this risk and 
our appetite in the last year was 
lower. We responded by de-risking 
our balance sheet, with the sale of 
21 Moorfields and other assets, a more 
flexible approach to development 
commitments and the recent issue 
of Landsec’s Green bond. 

Over the course of the coming year, 
we expect the risk to increase 
towards our desired appetite range, 
as we commit to developments and 
potentially deploy capital into new 
capital opportunities.

7 Development strategy

Executive responsible | Mike Hood 

Appetite: Flexible/Cautious

We may be unable to generate 
expected returns as a result of 
changes in the occupier market 
for a given asset during the course 
of the development, or cost or 
time overruns on the scheme.

Example KRIs
 • Take-up level for offices
 • Tender-price inflation
 • Monitor build-to-sell and build-to-
rent ratios to determine phasing 
approach of developments

Mitigation
 • Development strategy addresses 
risks that could adversely affect 
underlying income and capital 
performance

 • A detailed appraisal is undertaken 
by business area leadership and 
Board before committing to 
a scheme

 • Financial modelling and 

scenario planning to determine 
expected yields

 • Tested project-management 

approach and highly experienced 
development team

 • Control processes over key risk 

areas including: project 
organisation and reporting; 
financial management; quality; 
schedule; change; risk and 
contingency management; health 
and safety; and project objectives

 • Each project is supported by 

internal stakeholders in Operations, 
Sustainability and Tech, as 
evidenced through key monitoring 
reviews and gateway sign-offs
 • Strong community involvement 
in the design process for our 
developments

 • Early engagement and strong 
relationships with planning 
authorities

CHANGE IN YEAR | NO CHANGE

The external factors that influence 
this risk, such as market conditions 
and inflation, have increased. 

However, this is offset as three 
major development schemes are 
close to completion.

Over the course of the coming year, 
we expect the risk to increase towards 
our desired appetite range, as we 
commit to new developments.

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023059

8 Health and safety

Failure to identify, mitigate or 
react effectively to major health 
or safety incidents, leading to:
 • Serious injury, illness or loss of life
 • Criminal or civil proceedings
 • Loss of stakeholder confidence
 • Delays to building projects and 

access restrictions to our properties, 
resulting in loss of income

 • Inadequate response to regulatory 

changes

 • Reputational impact

9 People and skills

Inability to attract, retain and 
develop the right people and skills 
to meet our strategic objectives, 
grow enterprise value and meet 
shareholder expectations.

Example KRIs
 • Employee turnover levels
 • High-potential employee turnover
 • Employee engagement score
 • Succession planning up to date
 • Time to hire

Executive responsible | Mark Allan 

Appetite: Cautious/Minimalist

Example KRIs
 • Number of reportable health and 

safety incidents

 • Health and safety training 

completion

 • Control reviews and follow up 

to completion

Mitigation
 • Regular reviews by Health, Safety 
and Security Committee, (Chaired 
by the CEO), ELT and Board
 • Health & Safety management 
system accredited to ISO 45001 
standard

 • Fire-safety management system 

accredited to the BS 9997 standard

 • Accelerated asset integration 
assessment process for new 
acquisitions (e.g. U+I and MediaCity)

 • H&S audits by Internal Audit, plus 

annual programme of data-led and 
second-line audits by H&S team
 • Legal and best practice compliance 

monitored in real time

 • Strict H&S standards applied to the 

selection of key service and 
construction partners; assessed by 
KPIs and regular reviews

CHANGE IN YEAR | NO CHANGE

The likelihood of a major health 
and safety incident has remained 
constant throughout the year, with 
U+I and MediaCity properties now 
falling under the wider Health and 
Safety regime following integration.

Executive responsible | Kate Seller 

Appetite: Cautious

Mitigation
 • Executive remuneration and 

long-term incentive plans in place, 
benchmarked and overseen by the 
Remuneration Committee and 
aligned to the Group and individual 
performance

 • Regular review of succession plans 

for senior and critical roles 

 • Remuneration plans for other key 
roles are benchmarked annually 

 • The talent management 

programme identifies high-
potential individuals

 • Clear employee objectives and 

development plans 

 • Health and Wellbeing Statement 

of Practice 

 • Regular employee engagement 

surveys 

CHANGE IN YEAR | INCREASE

The risk has increased due to a 
combination of voluntary and forced 
attrition due to ongoing 
transformation programmes.

Further, the continuation of a 
buoyant post-pandemic employment 
market has created an employee and 
candidate-led market with high levels 
of wage inflation.

10 Climate change transition

Executive responsible | Chris Hogwood 

Appetite: Cautious/Minimalist

Example KRIs
 • Energy intensity
 • Renewable electricity
 • EPC ratings
 • Operational carbon emissions
 • Embodied carbon for new 

developments

 • Portfolio natural disaster risk
 • Portfolio ESG credentials
 • Energy efficiency measures

Climate change risk has 
two elements:
➊  Our commitment to reducing 
Landsec’s near and long-term 
carbon reduction targets by 
2030 and 2040 is not met in 
time or achieved at a 
significantly higher cost than 
expected, leading to 
regulatory, reputational and 
commercial impact.
➋  Failure to ensure all new 

developments are net zero in 
construction and operation, 
as defined by the emerging 
net zero standard for assets, 
leads to an inability to service 
market demand for high-
quality assets that meet the 
highest environmental and 
wellbeing standards.

Mitigation
 • Climate risks and opportunities 

for potential acquisitions assessed 
against our Responsible Property 
Investment Policy and ESG 
Acquisition Appraisal Framework

 • Developments designed to be 

resilient to climate change and 
net zero – both in construction 
and operation

 • All properties comply with ISO 
14001 and ISO 50001 Energy 
Management System

 • Continued monitoring of portfolio 
exposure to physical climate risks, 
and review of mitigation actions 
for sites located in high-risk areas

 • Early supply chain engagement 

for procurement of air source heat 
pumps and solar PVs – ensuring 
appropriate due diligence 

CHANGE IN YEAR | DECREASE

The transitional risks of climate 
change have continued to reduce 
as we have reviewed and updated 
our fully costed net zero transition 
investment plan for the effects of 
inflation and have begun portfolio 
decarbonisation planning.

Going concern and viability

The Directors outline their assessment of the 
Group’s ability to operate as a going concern 
and its long-term viability, taking into account 
the impact of the Group’s principal risks.

Going concern
The Directors confirm they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least 12 months 
from the date of signing these financial 
statements. This confirmation is made after 
having reviewed assumptions about future 
trading performance, valuation projections, 
capital expenditure, asset sales and debt 
requirements contained within the period 
ending 30 September 2024 from the Group’s 
budget and long-term strategic plan. The 
Directors also considered potential risks and 
uncertainties in the business, credit, market 
and liquidity risks, including the availability 
and repayment profile of bank facilities, 
as well as forecast covenant compliance. 
Further stress testing has been carried out 
to ensure the Group has sufficient cash 
resources to continue in operation for at 
least the next 16 months to 30 September 
2024 with materially reduced levels of cash 
receipts. Based on the above, together 
with available market information and the 
Directors’ knowledge and experience of the 
Group’s property portfolio and markets, 
the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts 
for the year ended 31 March 2023. Refer 
to note 1 of the financial statements for 
further information.

Viability statement
The viability assessment period 
The Directors have assessed the viability of 
the Group over a five-year period to March 
2028, taking account of the Group’s current 
financial position and the potential impact 
of our principal risks.

Process
Our financial planning process comprises 
a budget for one financial year and the 
strategic plan. Generally, the budget has 
a greater level of certainty and is used to 
set near-term targets across the Group. 
The strategic plan is less certain than the 
budget, but provides a longer-term outlook 
against which strategic decisions can 
be made.

The financial planning process considers 
the Group’s profitability, capital values, 
gearing, cash flows and other key financial 
metrics over the plan period. These metrics 
are subject to sensitivity analysis, in 
which a number of the main underlying 
assumptions are flexed and tested to 
consider alternative macroeconomic 
environments. Additionally, the Group also 
considers the impact of potential structural 
changes to the business in light of varying 

economic conditions, such as significant 
additional sales and acquisitions or 
refinancing. These assumptions are then 
adapted further to assess the impact 
of considerably worse macroeconomic 
conditions than are currently expected, 
which forms the basis of the Group’s 
‘Viability scenario’.

Given the recent unfavourable macro-
economic conditions in which the Group 
has been operating, additional stress-
testing has been carried out on the Group’s 
ability to continue in operation under 
extremely unfavourable operating 
conditions. While the assumptions we have 
applied in these scenarios are possible, they 
do not represent our view of the likely 
outturn. The Directors have also considered 
reverse stress-test scenarios including one 
in which we are unable to collect any rent 
for an extended period of time. The results 
of these tests help to inform the Directors’ 
assessment of the viability of the Group.

Strategic ReportLandsec Annual Report 2023061

Impact on key metrics 
We have assessed the impact of these 
assumptions on the Group’s key financial 
metrics over the assessment period, including 
profitability, net debt, loan-to-value ratios 
and available financial headroom.

The viability scenario represents a 
contraction in the size of the business over 
the five-year period considered, with the 
Security Group LTV at 48.0% in March 2028, 
its highest point in the assessment period. 
The Group maintains a positive financial 
headroom from March 2023 through to 
March 2025. From March 2026 the Group will 
be required to secure new funding as existing 
facilities expire. This drives the negative 
available financial headroom in the viability 
scenario at March 2028. The Directors expect 
the Group to be able to secure new funding, 
or exercise extension options, given the 
Group’s expected loan-to-value ratio, the 
flexibility of the financing structure in place, 
and positive engagement with providers of 
funds to date.

Confirmation of viability
Based on this assessment the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to March 2028.

Key risks
The table below sets out those of the 
Group’s principal risks (see pages 56-59 for 
full details of the Group’s principal risks) 

that could impact its ability to remain in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due and how we have taken these into 
consideration when making our assessment 
of the Group’s viability.

Principal Risk

Viability scenario assumption

Macroeconomic outlook 
Changes in the macroeconomic environment 
results in reduced demand for space or deferral 
of decisions by retail and office occupiers. 

Due to the length of build projects, the prevailing 
economic climate at initiation may be different 
from that at completion.

 • Declines in capital values and outward yield 

movements across all assets within the portfolio

 • Additional impact of a higher inflationary 

market captured within costs

 • No issuance of additional fixed term bonds 

through the assessment period

 • Additional impact of increased interest rates on 

servicing debt

Office occupier market
Structural changes in customer expectations 
leading to changing demand for office space and 
the consequent impact on income and asset values.

 • Reduced demand leads to increased void 

periods, negative valuation movements and 
downward pressure on rental values over the 
whole assessment period

Retail and hospitality occupier market
Structural changes in customer expectations 
leading to changes in demand for retail or 
hospitality space and the consequent impact on 
income and asset values. 

Capital allocation
Capital allocated to specific assets, sectors or 
locations does not yield the expected returns i.e. 
we are not effective in placing capital or recycling.

Development strategy
We may be unable to generate expected returns 
as a result of changes in the occupier market for 
a given asset during the course of the development, 
or cost or time overruns on the scheme.

 • Increased customer failures lead to increased 
void periods, negative valuation movements 
and downward pressure on rental values over 
the period

 • Capital that is accretive to the portfolio but not 

essential has been removed 

 • Any uncommitted budgeted acquisitions, 

disposals and developments do not take place 
due to reduced liquidity

We considered our other Principal Risks, including climate change transition, and their 
possible impact on our assessment of the Group’s viability. We concluded that as we have 
fully costed and committed to invest £135m to achieve our science-based net zero target 
by 2030, this mitigated the climate change transition risk sufficiently. 

 • A reduction in recognised development profits 

for committed schemes that will continue to be 
advanced over the viability assessment period

The EU taxonomy 
The EU taxonomy has been developed to support the transformation 
of the EU economy to meet its European Green Deal objectives, 
helping to redirect capital flows towards a more sustainable 
economy. It aims to set a common language and clear definition 
to help companies, investors and policymakers understand whether 
an economic activity is environmentally sustainable.

The EU taxonomy is a classification system, establishing a list of 
sustainable economic activities that substantially contribute to 
the EU’s six environmental objectives:

1. Climate change mitigation

2. Climate change adaptation

3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources

4. The transition to a circular economy

5. Pollution prevention and control

6. The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems

To date, details for only the first two environmental objectives were 
released: climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.

reason, we have started working towards voluntarily disclosing 
information that can help investors to assess the alignment of our 
activities with the EU taxonomy.

The UK has established a Green Technical Advisory Group who have 
issued its initial recommendations to the UK Government on UK 
Green Taxonomy, which builds on the EU taxonomy and net zero in 
the UK context. Taking steps to understand the requirements from 
the EU taxonomy, helps us to prepare Landsec for the incoming 
implementation of the UK Green Taxonomy.

In the Build well section on pages 41-43, we provide information on 
how we are investing across our portfolio to transition to net zero, 
its current EPC ratings, and approach to new developments.

We provide further information on our portfolio EPC ratings 
and building certifications in our Sustainability Performance 
and Data Report. 

This Strategic Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 
15 May 2023 and signed on its behalf by:

As a UK company, Landsec is not in scope of the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation. However, we recognise the importance of providing 
our investors and stakeholders with information about the 
sustainability of our activities and portfolio of assets. For that

Introduction to the Corporate  
Governance Report from the Chairman

During the year we have actively engaged 
with two search consultancies to ensure the 
Board has the necessary skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity to deliver superior 
performance and enhance the success of 
the Company. As a result, we appointed 
Miles Roberts and Sir Ian Cheshire. 

We remain committed to having a Board 
that is diverse in all respects. As at the date 
of this report and throughout this financial 
year we have complied with the Listing Rules 
requirements relating to diversity: (i) at least 
40% of the Board are women (also meeting 
the FTSE Women Leaders target); (ii) at least 
one of the senior board positions are women 
(both Chair and CFO); and (iii) at least one 
individual on the Board is from a minority 
ethnic background (also meeting the Parker 
Review target). The Board and new Chair 
are aware that on my retirement our gender 
diversity will dip below 40%, and this will 
be taken into account in our near-term 
succession planning. 

Importantly, across the wider business, 
we have refreshed our diversity and 
inclusion strategy during the year and 
agreed new targets (see pages 35-38).

Stakeholder engagement
Landsec’s success is dependent on the 
Board taking decisions for the benefit of 
our shareholders and in doing so having 
regard to all our stakeholders. Throughout 
the year, the Board received institutional 
investor updates and our Committee 
Chairs and Senior Independent Director 
have made themselves available to 
investors for meetings. 

Our 2022 AGM was held at our 
headquarters in London and shareholders 
were able to submit questions in advance 
for consideration by the Board.

This year we continued with our workforce 
engagement activities, including receiving 
a full briefing on the annual employee 
engagement survey results and Directors 
meeting directly with employees. 
Christophe Evain also engaged with our 
Employee Forum to answer questions on 
executive remuneration. The Board is 

committed to understanding the views of 
all of Landsec’s stakeholders to inform the 
decisions that we make.

Culture
The Board understands the importance 
of culture and setting the tone of the 
organisation from the top and embedding 
it throughout Landsec. Our culture is a key 
component for continuing to make progress 
with our strategic plans. The aim of our 
people strategy is to create a high-
performing and inclusive culture. During 
the year the Board monitored our culture 
with regular updates on our people, our 
organisational transformation programme, 
our culture, talent, diversity and inclusion 
activities and engagement survey, and 
direct engagement with the workforce.

Board evaluation
This year our Board evaluation was carried 
out internally. The Board was satisfied 
with its own performance, with all Board 
members rating performance as good or 
excellent. The composition of the Board was 
considered appropriate with the impact of 
recent changes noted. 

Conclusion
I would like to conclude by thanking 
members of the Board for their continued 
support and commitment over the past 
year and throughout my time as Chairman. 
I have much enjoyed my tenure at Landsec, 
especially the last five years as Chairman. 
I know I will be leaving the Company in a 
robust position with Sir Ian Cheshire, our 
experienced Board members, the leadership 
team and the wider workforce.

I would also like to extend my personal 
thank you to our colleagues, as I step down 
from the Board, for all their hard work and 
commitment to the business. I wish 
everyone at Landsec all the best for the 
future. 

Cressida Hogg
Chairman

Dear shareholder
I am pleased to introduce 
the governance section of 
this year’s Annual Report. 

This section of the report gives more detail 
on the governance structures that we have 
in place, and how we comply with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.

The Board takes seriously its responsibility 
for the long-term sustainable success of 
the Company, generating value for our 
shareholders and contributing more widely 
to society.

The year in review
The business has maintained momentum 
in delivering against its strategic plan, 
notwithstanding the challenging economic 
backdrop this year. Effective governance 
together with the strength of leadership 
of our Board has continued to provide 
structure and stability in times of uncertainty. 

I am grateful to my fellow Directors, 
the Executive Leadership Team and our 
colleagues for their continued support 
and dedication during the year.

Board succession and diversity
This year, the Board, together with the 
Nomination Committee has continued to 
focus on succession planning and Board 
composition.

Our governance structure  
continued

How we make decisions
Decisions that can only be made by 
the Board, together with the terms of 
reference for our Committees, can be 
found on the corporate governance 
section of our website.

Decision making on investments, 
commercial agreements, including the 
acquisition, disposal and development 
of assets, is delegated according to 
financial values.

Our Delegation of Authorities framework 
sets out levels of authority for decision 
making throughout the business.

During the year, in light of the changing 
environment a review of the organisation 
structure was undertaken to ensure 
Landsec was well positioned for the future. 
The result was the identification of a 
number of differentiators and a change 
to the internal operating model. 

The governance for this model is focused 
around the two different business areas 
primarily based on Landsec’s customers’ 
needs. Workplace covers office activity 
(currently mainly Central London but 
could expand in the future to other regions) 
and Lifestyle which covers retail and the 
mixed-use business. 

Under the new operating model the Board 
continues to oversee governance and 
assurance, supported by the Executive 
Leadership Team, which is responsible for 
Group strategy and co-ordination alongside 
the Workplace and Lifestyle Boards who 
are responsible for strategic planning. 

The Workplace and Lifestyle Boards are 
supported by executive committees 
which are responsible for developing 
and executing business plans, managing 
operational matters day to day and 
delivering financial performance.

Conflicts of interest and external 
appointments
The Board has a policy to identify and 
manage Directors’ conflicts or potential 
conflicts of interest and has delegated 
authority to the Nomination Committee 
to (i) approve or otherwise any such 
disclosed conflicts, and (ii) determine any 
mitigating actions deemed appropriate 
to ensure that all Board meetings and 
decisions are conducted solely with a 
view to promoting the success of Landsec.

Directors’ conflicts of interest (which 
extend beyond third-party directorships 
and include close family) are reviewed by 
the Nomination Committee annually, with 
new conflicts arising between meetings 
dealt with at the time between the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary.

Potential conflicts of interest and how we have managed them

During the year, Madeleine Cosgrave 
declared two appointments, which were 
ultimately not deemed to be of concern 
from a time commitment or conflicts 
perspective (senior advisor to ICG Real 
Estate and independent member of the 
CBRE IM EMEA Investment Committee). 

We follow the Institutional Shareholder 
Services (ISS) proxy voting guidelines on 
overboarding and accordingly deem all 
our Non-executive Directors to be within 
these guidelines.

We appreciate that other proxy bodies 
and institutional investors impose more 
stringent guidelines than ISS and that 
each individual’s portfolio of appointments 
must be considered on a case-by-case 
basis, which the Board duly does before 
approving any appointments and then, 
on an annual basis, assesses whether each 
member of the Board is able to continue 
contributing effectively.

Sir Ian Cheshire is currently Chair of 
Channel 4, Spire Healthcare Group Plc, 
UK investment trust Menhaden Resource 
Efficiency Plc and serves as Non-executive 
Director at BT Group Plc. He is stepping 
down from the Chair position (remaining 
as Non-executive Director) at Menhaden 
Resource Efficiency Plc on 16 May 2023 
and will retire from BT Group Plc at its AGM 
in July 2023 to ensure he has sufficient 
capacity to act as Chair of Landsec. 

The Board was not asked to approve any 
additional external appointments for any 
of our Directors during the year.

Decisions on investing in Landsec securities 
conflicting with role on Landsec Board.

As Menhaden Resource Efficiency invests primarily in US and European 
markets, investing in businesses and opportunities delivering or benefitting 
from the efficient use of energy and resources, investment in Land 
Securities Group PLC securities is unlikely and in any event Sir Ian Cheshire 
does not participate directly in investment decisions at Menhaden and has 
agreed to never participate in investment decisions concerning the shares 
of Land Securities Group PLC at Menhaden.

Induction
Our induction plan is delivered over the 
first year of appointment. The aim is to 
enable a new Director to assume their 
responsibilities as quickly as possible and 
feel able to contribute to business and 
strategy discussions, with sufficient 
knowledge to provide effective challenge.

An induction plan was put in place for Miles 
Roberts upon joining as a Non-executive 
Director in September 2022. The aim of his 
induction was to support his understanding 
of Landsec’s business and financial position, 
strategy, culture, risks and opportunities, 
Board governance and dynamics. The plan 
assisted him to form relationships with the 
Chairman, the Board, the Executive 
Leadership Team and key external advisers, 
in addition to a number of site visits. Sir Ian 
Cheshire is currently undertaking a similar 
induction plan.

 — More information on their inductions 

can be found on page 85.

the Listing Rules requirements relating to 
diversity: (i) at least 40% of the Board are 
women (also meeting the FTSE Women 
Leaders target); (ii) at least one of the senior 
board positions are women (both Chair and 
CFO); and (iii) at least one individual on the 
Board is from a minority ethnic background 
(also meeting the Parker Review target). The 
Board and new Chair are aware that on the 
retirement of Cressida Hogg, our gender 
diversity will dip below 40%, and this will 
be taken into account in our near term 
succession planning. See table 33 below.

Training and development 
Directors received regular updates in their 
Board papers, facilitating greater 
awareness and understanding of the 
Group’s business and in particular the 
emerging strategy. 

The Board also received presentations on 
the flexible office market and the future 
of office assets acquired as part of the 
U+I Group and MediaCity acquisitions. 

Board diversity
As at the date of this report and throughout 
this financial year we have complied with 

In June 2022, the Board had a deep dive 
into the Southwark area of London, 
where Landsec has assembled a pipeline 

of c.1m sq ft. In addition, the Board received 
a teach-in session on embodied carbon 
from the Landsec sustainability team 
which included case studies on The Forge, 
Red Lion Court, Timber Square and 
Liberty of Southwark and discussed the 
implications for n2 whilst the Board visited 
the development. 

In December 2022, the Board received a 
detailed briefing on embodied carbon in 
development and Landsec’s objective to 
reduce embodied carbon. The Board also 
received a briefing and site visit of the n2 
development on the same day. 

In February 2023, the Board held its 
strategy away day at our Myo offices at 
Dashwood House in London with a tour 
of 21 Moorfields, a complex development 
nearing completion that showcased 
Landsec’s deep development expertise 
during the life of the project.

Finally, the Board were also provided with 
a market disclosure briefing to reinforce 
their knowledge of the Market Abuse 
Regulation including recent developments 
and case studies.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance074

The Board in action

Decisions of the Board this year have been 
considered in the context of a challenging macro-
economic environment and whilst considering the 
changes, risks and opportunities that such an 
environment can bring. 

Board meetings
Board members attend eight scheduled 
meetings a year and meet as required 
for additional discussions. 

All members of the Board attended all 
Board and Committee meetings during 
their tenure and membership, with the 
exception of Christophe Evain who missed 
the Board, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee meetings held in March 2023 
due to a family bereavement.

If the Board needs to make decisions in 
between meetings, it can do so by 
unanimous approval by email but will only 
do so in such situations where the matter 
has been discussed at previous meetings 
so that Directors are fully appraised, have 
had the opportunity to ask questions and 
are therefore in a position to make a fully 
informed decision.

The Board met for four dinners throughout 
the year at which a number of matters were 
discussed including the macro-economic 
climate, areas of risk, culture and talent 
retention. These opportunities allow the 
Board to develop and solidify relationships 
and further discuss matters impacting the 
business in an informal manner without the 
inevitable time restrictions of Board and 
Committee meetings. 

The Non-executive Directors also met without 
the Executive Directors being present.

Execution of strategy
This year, the Board has continued to 
consider the Group’s strategy and the 
execution of strategy, particularly in 
the context of the uncertain macro-
economic and political environments. 
In addition, the alignment of culture 
and the internal governance framework 
and strategy has been a focus of the Board. 
All of Landsec’s stakeholder interests 
remain at the heart of strategy decisions 
especially in uncertain climates.

 — There is further information about the 

Board and our stakeholders on 
pages 76-79 and the Board and our 
Culture on pages 80-81 

The Board considered a number of strategic 
areas during the year, which included 
reviews of the retail strategy, the residential 
strategy and the alignment with urban 
mixed-use. In addition, the Board considered 
the future of the office and flex office. More 
details on the strategic (and other matters) 
considered by the Board can be found on 
page 75. As part of these strategic reviews 
the Board had a tour and deep dive review 
of our developments in the Southwark area 
of London.

In addition, the Board benefited from 
a session with some of the sustainability 
team on embodied carbon followed by 
a tour of the n2 development site, which 
brought to life some of the matters that 
had been discussed in the session. 

Board’s tour  
of Southwark

The June meeting of the Board took 
place in Southwark and allowed the 
Board to benefit from a walking tour 
of the area led by the Executive 
Directors and members of the 
Central London office team. 

The Board were initially given a 
presentation on why the Southbank 
was considered an important area 
and how in particular the Southwark 
area fitted into this growing part 
of London. 

During the tour the Board were able 
to see our four existing (or potential) 
development sites in the area – 
Timber Square, The Forge, Liberty of 
Southwark and Red Lion Court, and 
the thriving neighbourhoods in which 
they are located. 

The tour allowed the Board to ask 
questions on the area, its heritage, 
development progress, and 
sustainability credentials. The Board 
welcomed the additional insight 
into the developments, the location 
and the impact on Landsec’s 
growth strategy.

The Board and our stakeholders

Our purpose – sustainable places, connecting 
communities, realising potential – puts all our 
stakeholders at the forefront of the Board’s  
decision making.

This is our Section 172 Statement.

The Board is pleased to provide a 
statement that supports Section 172(1) 
of the Companies Act 2006. This requires 
that Directors promote the success of 
the Company for the benefit of the 
members, having regard to the interest 
of stakeholders in their decision making. 
Over the next few pages, we provide 
examples of how the Board engages with 
stakeholders and takes into account their 
interests when making decisions.

 — An introduction to our stakeholders 
can be found in our Strategic Report 
on page 11

Stakeholders and Board  
decision making
Our stakeholders’ interests and priorities 
continue to change, and affect the way 
we work, shop and engage with each 
other. Effective communication with our 
stakeholders is critical to keeping pace with 
their evolving needs, which is so important 
for our long-term success. The Board’s 
engagement with stakeholders is both 
direct and by management reporting up 
to the Board on stakeholder engagement, 
the importance of which is embedded 
throughout our business.

Our customers
We have made good progress with growing 
our customer relationships which has been 
a key feature of our strategy for two years. 
The Board receives regular updates on 
our customers. 

During the year, the Board received a 
detailed briefing on our retail, office and 
mixed-use strategies including customer 
insights, as well as regular updates on 
customers as part of the business update 
at every meeting. This has helped to 
understand the changing requirements 
of office customers since the pandemic, 
including changing space requirements 
and the increased demand for ‘healthy 
buildings’. As a business we have listened 
to office occupiers regarding their needs, 
resulting in us providing greater flexibility 
of office leases.

The Board reviewed the retail strategy 
update in September. The Reimagine 
Retail change programme has been 
implemented and is based on three main 
strategies: the future asset, brand partners 
and guest experience. We have developed 
clear plans for each of our assets to make 
sure they deliver the physical experience, 
which continues to attract the right visitors 
for brands. 

Each location will see a more distinct 
identity, more closely representing the 
narrative of the area in which it is located, 
although there are some key themes that 
reach across all locations. The Board noted 
the good progress that had been made in 
recognising and understanding consumer 
behaviour and its impact on investment 
decisions, the importance of improving 
data insights and direct relationship 
management, but also ensuring that 
downside scenarios were considered.

The Board also received a residential 
strategy update from the Chief Strategy 
and Investment Officer and Head of 
Lifestyle Investment. The Board supported 
the view that residential should be part of 
our strategy.

One New  
Street Square

In January 2023 the Board approved the 
sale of One New Street Square, EC4 to 
Chinachem Group, a property developer 
based in Hong Kong.

The total consideration for the sale amounts 
to £349.5m. The sale price compares to 
a September 2022 valuation of £362.8m 
and crystallises a total return on capital 
averaging 10% per annum since Landsec’s 
acquisition of the site in June 2005 and 
subsequent redevelopment in 2016.

One New Street Square is fully let to 
Deloitte, with a 14-year unexpired lease 
term remaining and a current annual net 
rent of £16.8m. With limited opportunities 
to add further value, the disposal was in line 
with Landsec’s strategy to recycle capital 
out of mature London offices.

The Board considered the sale to be in 
line with the strategic review conducted 
in late 2020, when Landsec announced its 
intention to sell c.£2.5bn of mature London 
offices over the medium term. With the 
inclusion of One New Street Square, the 
Company has now sold £2.1bn of offices, 
representing an average yield of 4.4%.

The disposal proceeds will initially be used 
to repay debt and, on a pro-forma basis, 
would reduce Landsec’s long-term value from 
31.1% to 28.9% based on September 2022 
valuations. Its strong balance sheet provides 
Landsec with significant optionality for future 
reinvestment in higher-return opportunities 
which are expected to emerge as markets 
continue to adjust to a new reality.

Our communities
To understand in more detail some of the 
communities our assets are located within, 
the Board visited certain assets during the 
year, including Southwark. The Board 
received a presentation on the Southwark 
area which highlighted the rich culture 
and heritage of this community, along with 
the good transport links, young population 
and amenities. 

The assets owned by Landsec in the area 
were highlighted, including Red Lion Court, 
the Forge, the Liberty of Southwark and 
Timber Square. This was then followed by 
a walking tour of the area. Our Capital 
Markets Day event in September also 
focused on Southwark and provided 
investors with an operational update and 
tour of the area.

The Board visited the n2 development in 
December to see first hand one of our sites 
under construction.

The Board had a tour of 21 Moorfields as 
part of their strategy day in February which 
was held at our Myo flexible office space in 
Dashwood House. The Board were impressed 
with the engineering challenges overcome 
at 21 Moorfields and thought the business 
should be proud of their achievement with 
this complex development.

 — You can read more about our 

community support on page 44

Our partners
The Board received updates during the year 
on fire safety. The political and legislative 
landscape had evolved since the last review, 
including the introduction of the Developers’ 
Pledge that required developers to rectify or 
fund remediation of critical fire safety works 
in certain circumstances. Landsec committed 
to the pledge in July 2022 and signed the 
associated contract in March 2023. 

The Board were updated by our Managing 
Director of Corporate Affairs during the 
year on local and national Government 
issues impacting the business. The Board 
also discussed the output of Landsec’s local 
and national Government engagement.

The Board and our stakeholders  
continued

Our employees
Employee Forum meetings were held 
monthly throughout the year, with four 
quarterly meetings held which Mark Allan, 
CEO, attends to answer any questions 
and get an indication of topical issues 
of importance to employees.

The Employee Forum sends out a list of 
summary topics for employees to vote 
on at the start of every financial year. 
The Employee Forum will then report 
back to constituents on topics throughout 
the year. 

Christophe Evain met with the Employee 
Forum separately to answer questions on 
executive remuneration. 

We continued with our employee 
engagement sessions with two Non-
executive Directors meeting a small group 
of employees from the Lifestyle area of the 
business. A range of matters were discussed 
including culture change, communications 
and business strategy. Manjiry Tamhane 
also joined a session of our Women’s 
Network. The feedback from those sessions 
is passed back into the boardroom. 

The Board also received a full briefing on 
the employee engagement survey which 
was undertaken in Summer 2022 which also 
gave them a good insight into employee 
sentiment. Read more about our 
engagement survey results on page 34.

During the year there have been a number 
of drop in lunches held with members of 
our Executive Leadership Team, including 
our CEO and CFO.

We are also planning to hold another 
‘Meet the NEDs’ event for employees 
immediately after our Annual General 
Meeting in July and further engagement 
events with smaller groups of employees 
from the other areas of our business in 
September and December. This will be a 
great opportunity for the Board to engage 
further with employees.

Themes raised at the employee engagement events included

  the cost of living

  retention of talent

  U&I integration

  the reorganisation and 
changes to the internal 
operating model

  office environment  
and culture

  diversity and inclusion

  business strategy

  managing change

  career development

  change communications

  employee wellbeing  
and benefits

Feedback from employee engagement events

 “We met with Christophe on behalf of the Employee 
Forum to discuss Executive Remuneration and raise 
queries on behalf of the business. It was really great 
to meet Christophe and we really valued the open 
discussions we had with him. We were given a clear 
insight into Board life and dealing with shareholders, 
he elaborated on his role and discussed the recent 
recruitment process for our new Chairman which 
was really interesting.”

 “I thoroughly enjoy the monthly ELT lunch sessions, 
they are great opportunities to have conversations 
and build relationships with our leadership team. 
To me, it shows how committed our Executive team 
are to listen to and engage with colleagues across 
the business.”

 “I was lucky enough to meet Sir Ian Cheshire to discuss 

the Employee Forum’s role and how it represents 
Landsec employees. We had a really open and 
wide-ranging conversation where Ian wanted to 
hear all about Landsec, the culture and what 
employees really cared about. We discussed the cost 
of living crisis, our focus on improving diversity and 
employee satisfaction drivers in a post-covid world 
– all issues that Ian is clearly engaged with and keen 
to help drive forward. We look forward to working 
with him and the wider Board more closely to make 
Landsec the best possible place to work.”

Our investors

We want to create sustainable value for our three types of investors: institutional, private and debt.

It is important to us that our investors understand our strategy and our equity story so they can support the execution  
of our strategy and our capital recycling.

Institutional investors

Private investors

Debt investors

Institutional investors
Our Executive Directors once again held 
meetings with investors representing more 
than half the share register by value.

Our private investors are encouraged to 
give feedback and communicate with the 
Directors via the Company Secretary 
throughout the year. 

We were delighted to return to a full 
programme of in-person investor events 
during the last year. Whilst some investor 
meetings were conducted online for the sake 
of convenience, the vast majority of our 
investor engagement has been face-to-face.

2022 Annual General Meeting 
We continued to hold our AGM as a 
hybrid meeting in 2022. We invited 
shareholders to ask questions and vote 
on the resolutions online or they could 
join the meeting physically.

All resolutions put to the meeting received 
overwhelming support of investors. The 
results of the voting at all general meetings 
are published on our website: landsec.com/
investors/regulatory-news. 

Five-year private investor plan
We have a rolling five-year private investor 
plan, the intention of which is to maintain 
an efficient share register, limited paper 
distributions, effective communications 
and the provision of best-in-class service 
to our investors. 

Private investors queries
We work closely with our registrar Equiniti 
to address all queries that we receive 
from our private shareholders throughout 
the year.

In September 2022, we held a Capital 
Markets Day in Southwark in London for 
institutional investors. This event provided 
an overview of the Southwark region and 
detail on the existing and potential 
development schemes Landsec has in this 
area of London. In addition, we explained 
our plans to reduce the embodied carbon 
within our developments through a 
combination of efficient use of materials, 
design and construction methods. The 
event also included a tour of Southwark to 
view our four major committed/potential 
development sites.

We engaged with investors throughout the 
year on all aspects of environmental, social 
and governance matters. In February 2023, 
we conducted a sustainability roadshow 
in the Netherlands, meeting with fund 
managers and sustainability analysts from 
major institutional investors.

Industry conferences
Industry conferences provide Executive 
Directors with a chance to meet a large 
number of investors on a formal and 
informal basis. Conferences attended this 
year included the UBS Global Property 
conference in London, the Kempen 
conference in Amsterdam, the Bank of 
America conference in New York, the Citi 
conference in Florida, Barclays’ real estate 
conference in London and Morgan 
Stanley’s real estate conference in London. 
All conferences were in-person events.

Credit side institutional investors 
and analysts
In March 2023, as part of the marketing 
process for the Green bond issuance, we 
held a series of debt investor meetings. 
A combination of the physical and virtual 
meetings, including a Group lunch and a 
recorded presentation, was well received 
by the investors and allowed us to provide 
a comprehensive update on our strategy 
as well as to present the recently updated 
Green Financing Framework.

Banks
Regular dialogue is maintained with our 
key relationship banks, including regular 
meetings and calls with our treasury team.

Credit rating agencies
During the year, business and financial 
updates were provided by our treasury 
team and senior managers to Standard 
& Poor’s, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s. 
Further information for our debt 
investors can be found on our website:

The Board and our culture

This year has seen the Board focus on supporting 
management to design and embed a more agile, 
efficient culture, with less internal complexity  
and more external and customer focus. 

A year of progress
In previous years we have outlined how 
an appropriate governance framework 
and an environment of trust, respect and 
accountability were all fundamental to 
our culture, and that the Board played an 
important role in monitoring and assessing 
our culture and the governance framework. 
This year we have made significant progress 
on a journey that had already commenced, 
but which has now been considered in 
detail by the Board and is being embedded 
throughout the Group. The key components 
of that journey are outlined here. 

In order to ensure that our growth 
strategy was not hindered by legacy ways 
of working, a cultural change programme 
was initiated during the year which resulted 
in a change to the operating model and a 
new internal governance framework led by 
the Board and supported by the Executive 
Leadership Team.

 — More detail on this revised framework 

can be found on pages 69-70

Embedding 
cultural change 
through a new 
operating model

The new operating model and governance 
structure ultimately flows up to the 
Board and is designed to facilitate and 
encourage clear reporting, decision making, 
empowerment, accountability, employee 
input and stakeholder feedback, and 
enable a focus on our customers, leading  
to growth. 

The Board have been regularly updated  
and inputted as this programme has 
evolved and are now supporting 
management in embedding this across 
the organisation through organisational 
design, business planning, leadership 
effectiveness and behaviours, reward and 
incentivisation and diversity and inclusion. 
More details on each of these areas are 
set out on the opposite page. 

In shaping this framework, feedback  
from an externally facilitated employee 
engagement survey undertaken during  
the year was also taken into account. 
The Board were appraised of the key themes 
arising from the survey and challenged 
management as to how they address the 
areas where the need for improvement 
was identified. Positive changes are already 
underway and employee engagement 
surveys will be undertaken on a regular basis, 
which will assist in allowing the Board to 
assess progress. 

In addition, as the Board have greatly 
benefited from first hand engagement 
with employees at Non-executive Director 
engagement sessions, similar meetings are 
continuing and a further series is planned 
throughout the coming year.

 — Further information on employee 

engagement can be found on page 34

Introduction from the  
Chairman of the Nomination Committee

Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the 
report from the Nomination 
Committee for the year.

The Committee has continued to assess 
the composition, succession plan and skills 
of the Board and its Committees and 
promote diversity.

Board and Committee changes 
Following a comprehensive selection 
process, in January we announced the 
appointment of Sir Ian Cheshire as Non-
executive Director and Chair Designate. 
Sir Ian joined the Board at the end of March 
and will succeed me as Chair on 16 May. 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
be welcoming someone of Sir Ian Cheshire’s 
calibre as Chair.

We also appointed Miles Roberts as 
Non-executive Director in September 2022. 
Miles, who originally trained as a structural 
engineer, brings significant experience as 
a serving chief executive and has held a 
number of non-executive roles. You can 
read about the Committee’s appointment 
process for both Sir Ian and Miles on 
page 84. 

Colette O’Shea stepped down from the 
Board in September and as Chief Operating 
Officer in March. Colette joined Landsec 
in 2003 and was appointed to the Board in 
2018. The Committee is extremely grateful 
to Colette for her significant contribution 
to the Board and the business during her 
time at Landsec.

Board evolution 
A balanced and diverse Board with a mix 
of skills, expertise, background and tenure 
is critical to the success of the Company. 
The composition of the Board underpins 
the quality of debate and challenge 
during discussions.

The process for Board appointments is 
led by the Nomination Committee which 
makes recommendations to the Board 
for its approval. It is the Nomination 
Committee’s responsibility to keep Board 
composition under review, including 
reviewing director independence and 
tenure. During the year the Committee 
reviewed the composition and skills of 
the Board, and developed an ongoing plan 
for Board succession, taking into account 
recent and likely future Board changes.

The Board is mindful that Edward Bonham 
Carter has been a Director in excess of nine 
years and so the Committee reviewed his 
independence and role and was completely 
satisfied that Edward continues to bring 
independent judgement to the Board. 
As such, the Nomination Committee was 
satisfied that Edward can continue to fulfill 
the role of Senior Independent Director.

The Committee also has responsibility for 
oversight of Executive Leadership Team and 
senior management succession. This is also 
discussed by the Board as a whole, with 
a focus on diversity and inclusion and 
developing and maintaining the internal 
talent pipeline.

Internal Board evaluation
This year our Board evaluation was carried 
out internally with the Committee’s 
effectiveness assessed as part of the internal 
review. The Committee was satisfied with its 
own effectiveness as a whole and pleased 
with the outcome of the Non-executive 
succession planning and processes, including 
the Chair selection process, which had been a 
main focus during the year. With a new Chair 
and Executive Leadership Team in place it is 
appropriate to reset the Committee’s 
priorities to focus more on wider Board 
succession, while continuing to cover all areas 
of the Committee’s remit including ongoing 
management succession planning.

 — Further details on the internal Board 

evaluation can be found on pages 86-87

Corporate governance
During the year, the Committee has 
overseen the corporate governance agenda 
on behalf of the Board. I am pleased to 
confirm that Landsec has complied with 
and applied all of the principles of the 
2018 UK Corporate Governance Code for 
the financial year ended 31 March 2023. 
The Code is published by the Financial 
Reporting Council and is available from 
frc.org.uk.

Cressida Hogg
Chairman, Nomination Committee 

Diversity
The Board believes that diversity at Board 
level sets the tone for diversity throughout 
the business. We promote diversity in the 
broadest sense, not just gender or ethnicity 
but also experience, skills, professional 
background and tenure. The Nomination 
Committee monitors our talent pipeline 
to ensure we have a diverse pool of talent 
being developed at all levels of the business. 
Maintaining a diverse workforce is as 
important as diverse recruitment and 
we continue to assess and promote this. 
During the year, we have refreshed the 
overall diversity and inclusion strategy for 
the Group, including setting new targets.

I am pleased to report that during this 
financial year we met the Listing Rule 
requirements targets for diversity. 40% 
of our Board members are women, our 
Chair and CFO positions have been held 
by women, and we have one member 
of the Board from an ethnic minority 
background. The Committee is aware that 
as a result of the change of Chair in May 
2023, the Board’s gender diversity will dip 
below 40%, and this will be taken into 
consideration in Board composition and 
succession planning.

I am pleased to report that following 
the recruitment of Marina Thomas as 
Head of Governance and Company 
Secretary and Kate Seller as Chief People 
Officer during the year, one third of the 
Executive Leadership Team are women 
(which will increase to 40% when our 
new Chief Data & Technology Officer joins 
us in June 2023). We acknowledge that 
ongoing work is needed to increase diversity 
of our Executive Leadership Team and its 
direct reports whilst ensuring that 
appointments and succession plans are 
based on merit and objective criteria and 
the Committee, and the Board will continue 
to monitor progress.

Report of the  
Nomination Committee

Executive Director changes
During the year, Colette O’Shea stepped 
down from the Board on 30 September 
2022 and as Chief Operating Officer on 
31 March 2023.

Non-executive Director changes 
Cressida Hogg will step down as Chairman 
on 16 May 2023, having served over five 
years as Chairman and nine years on 
the Board. 

As the Chairman succession process 
began, it was agreed that Edward Bonham 
Carter would lead the process as Senior 
Independent Director, joined by the other 
members of the Committee, excluding 
Cressida Hogg (the Chairman, Succession 
Committee). Hedley May, an independent 
executive search firm and with no connection 
to Landsec, was appointed to conduct the 
search for a Chairman with experience in 
retail and customer-focused businesses. 
A diverse shortlist of candidates was put 
forward by Hedley May and the candidates 
met with members of the Chairman 
Succession Committee and the CEO, CFO 
and the other Non-executive Directors. 
The Chairman Succession Committee 
concluded that Sir Ian Cheshire would be 
an excellent addition to the Board bringing 
a wealth of experience across customer-
focused businesses in executive and 
non-executive positions in listed companies.

In 2022, the Nomination Committee 
appointed Russell Reynolds, an independent 
executive search firm with no connection 
to Landsec to conduct a search for a 
Non-executive Director. Members of the 
Committee and the CEO met with a shortlist 
of candidates put forward by Russell Reynolds. 
The Committee concluded that Miles Roberts 
with his experience as a serving chief 
executive and in non-executive roles would 
be a positive addition to the Board.

Diversity
The Board’s policy on diversity establishes 
the importance of diversity in the broadest 
sense, not just gender or ethnicity but also 
experience, skills, professional background, 
tenure and also other differentials between 

directors such as cognitive and personal 
strengths. The Board believes that diversity 
is crucial to creating a high-performing, 
effective Board, to provide a breadth of 
perspective and debate that aids decision 
making and which supports and directs the 
business more effectively.

The Nomination Committee works with 
executive search consultants to ensure 
they support our approach to diversity in 
providing a diverse selection of candidates 
for Board appointments and the selection 
can then be based upon merit and 
objective criteria.

Diversity at Board level sets the tone for 
diversity throughout the business. The 
Nomination Committee monitors our 
talent pipeline to ensure we have a diverse 
succession pool of talent being developed 
and maintained at all levels of the business. 
Maintaining a diverse workforce is as 
important as diverse recruitment and 
we continue to assess this.

Diversity is also addressed at the 
Remuneration Committee, particularly 
in the context of gender pay gap, and 
discussed at the main Board in light of 
its increased focus on the promotion 
and maintenance of diversity at all levels 
of talent throughout our business.

 — Further information on diversity at 

Landsec can be found on pages 35-38

Independence and re-election 
to the Board
The independence, effectiveness and 
commitment of each of the Non-executive 
Directors has been reviewed by the 
Committee. The Committee is satisfied 
with the contributions and time 
commitment of all the Non-executive 
Directors during the year.

The Committee will always discuss the 
additional commitments of all directors 
(including the Chairman) before 
recommending their approval to the Board. 
It also considers potential conflict issues as 
part of that assessment. The Committee 
is mindful that Edward Bonham Carter has 

been a director of the Board in excess of 
nine years and has reviewed his 
independence and role and is completely 
satisfied that Edward continues to bring 
independent judgement to the Board. 
As such the Committee is satisfied that 
Edward can continue to fulfill the role 
of Senior Independent Director. The 
Committee is confident that each of 
the Non-executive Directors remains 
independent and will be in a position to 
discharge their duties and responsibilities 
in the coming year. From a governance 
perspective, the Board as a whole is 
independent.

Sir Ian Cheshire and Miles Roberts are 
standing for initial election by shareholders 
at the AGM, with all other Directors 
standing for re-election at the AGM in 
July 2023 with the support of the Board 
(with the exception of Cressida Hogg 
who is stepping down from the Board 
on 16 May 2023).

Internal evaluation of the 
effectiveness of the Nomination 
Committee
Following a busy few years of Executive 
and Non-executive appointments, the 
internal review of the performance of the 
Nomination Committee included a review 
of the Chair succession process and 
considering the Committee’s priority for the 
year ahead to include role profile planning 
for future non-executive recruitment and 
continued detailed reporting back to the 
main Board.

financial position and our five-year plan, 
budget and in-depth financial review. 

Miles met with members of the Executive 
Leadership Team to gain a deeper 
understanding of their areas of the business 
and get an understanding of the individual 
priorities and challenges that they face. 
Another key focus was meetings with 
the Managing Director of People and 
Corporate Services for a deep dive into 
our people and culture. 

Additionally, Miles spent time with other 
Non-executive Directors, including those 
that he had not met as part of the

shorter and longer term. The 
Board would like more agenda 
time on culture and business 
transformation.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance087

Conclusions of evaluation

The overall conclusion of the Board evaluation this year is 
that the Landsec Board and its Committees continue to 
operate in a collaborative and open way and work effectively. 

The priorities for the incoming Chair include strategic 
development and capital allocation, cultural and 
organisational change and succession planning. A priority 
for the Board as a whole is to provide support to the new 
Chair. The Board agenda and topics have the right focus on 
key areas, however there were some preferences for more time 
to be allowed for discussions during meetings or informally. 

The Board felt it added value in developing and implementing 
strategy and supporting the disposal programme, with the 
Board feeling they are appropriately agile to adjust to the 
changing environment. 

Nomination Committee evaluation
The Committee looked at its own effectiveness. Overall, the 
Committee was satisfied with its own effectiveness and that 
of the Non-executive Director and Chair succession processes. 
The Committee will keep Board succession planning and 
diversity as a key area of focus.

Our performance 2022/23

Output of 2022/23 Board evaluation: 
areas of focus for the year ahead

The composition of the Board 
was considered appropriate 
with good progress made 
during the year with the 
recruitment of two Directors 
to the Board, including the 
Chair Designate.

Members of the Executive 
Leadership Team and their 
direct line reports have 
spent time over the year 
on asset visits and providing 
presentations to the Board. 
However, the Board have 
requested continued increased 
visibility of the Executive 
Leadership Team and senior 
leaders in the year ahead. 

Progress has been made 
against the strategic 
objectives of the Company 
and regular reporting to the 
Board in this area was noted. 

During the year, the Board 
has spent more time focused 
on culture and business 
transformation including 
regular updates on 
organisational and digital 
transformation programmes, 
as well as sessions with the 
leadership team on 
engagement and diversity 
and inclusion. The Board 
have noted that the pace 
of change continues to 
accelerate across the business.

The Board has monitored 
progress with data and 
technology through sessions 
with the executives during the 
year and was pleased to note 
significant improvements in 
progress with our technology 
strategy, as well as the 
appointment of a Chief 
Data and Technology Officer 
who will join the Executive 
Leadership Team in June 2023.

   Strategic 
development
Continued progress with 
strategic developments. 
The Board would like to 
continue to build on their 
understanding of customer 
needs through enhanced 
access to customer data as 
part of the strategy process. 

   Capital  
allocation

Continued focus on capital 
allocation and investment.

   Culture and 
organisational change 

Progress already made on 
culture change within the 
business should continue, 
monitored by the Board 
through sessions with the 
executive and engagement 
survey results.

   Succession  
planning

An area of focus for the 
Board is succession planning 
and talent development.

   Support to  
new Chair 

A key focus for the Board is 
in supporting the new Chair 
to develop relationships 
across the Board.

   Board papers  
and Executive 
Leadership Team

Continued improvement 
of Board papers with a focus 
to move towards more 
executive summaries to 
allow more time for debate 
at Board meetings.

The Board would like 
to focus on more 
exposure to the Executive 
Leadership Team and other 
senior leaders.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance088

Introduction from the  
Chairman of the Audit Committee

Dear shareholder
During the financial year the 
Committee has continued 
to fulfil its oversight 
responsibilities on the 
financial statements, the 
integrity of the reporting 
process and the Company’s 
system of internal controls 
and risk management, the 
audit and valuation processes 
and the procedures for 
ensuring compliance with 
laws, regulations and ethical 
codes of practice.

Risk focus
Risk management is a primary responsibility 
of the Committee on behalf of the Board 
and is consistently monitored throughout 
the year. Information security and cyber 
threat remains a key operational risk and 
the Committee has had regular oversight 
of the significant work undertaken to 
mitigate against this risk and will continue 
to consider updates and monitor progress 
of the programme to improve cyber resilience. 

The macroeconomic outlook is currently the 
most significant risk. The risk management 
strategy in place to mitigate against this 
risk includes the regular monitoring of key 
risk indicators and scenario-based 
modelling of plausible economic 
trajectories. No emerging risks have been 
identified through the risk management 
process.

Climate reporting
The Committee has updates from the 
sustainability team on how Landsec is 
implementing the requirements of the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure (TCFD), the evolving reporting 
landscape for climate risks and our 
approach to climate risk identification, 
assessment and strategy. 

We have continued to make disclosures 
that are consistent with the TCFD 
recommendations and will continue to 
monitor these. Our TCFD disclosures can 
be found on pages 47 to 53.

Fire safety remediation 
Following the introduction of the Building 
Safety Act 2022, the Committee has been 
updated on work to assess our liability for 
fire remediation works on residential buildings 
developed by Group over the last 30 years. 
The Committee has regularly considered, 
alongside the external auditor, the level of 
the provision required, how the provision is 
determined and the associated disclosures.

Financial statements
The Group’s financial statements are of 
critical importance to investors and the 
Committee monitors the integrity of the 
Group’s reporting process and financial 
management. It scrutinises the full and 
half-yearly financial statements before 
proposing them to the Board for approval. 
The Committee reviews in detail the work 
of the external auditor and external valuers 
and any significant financial judgements 
and estimates made by management to 
ensure that it is satisfied with the outcome.

I am pleased to say that the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) included some 
disclosures from our 2022 Annual Report 
in its publication “What Makes a Good 
Annual Report and Accounts”, as they 
were considered examples of best practice.

Asset valuation
The valuation of our assets is an important 
constituent of our financial results and 
measurement of our performance. For a 
number of years CBRE has been the principal 
valuer of our entire portfolio, however in 
order to increase market insight and future 
flexibility, Jones Lang LaSalle Limited (JLL) 
has been appointed to value a large 
proportion of Landsec’s retail portfolio with 
effect from 31 March 2023. CBRE will continue 
to value the office portfolio and some of 
the retail portfolio. Both CBRE and JLL are 
industry-leading agencies with extensive 
expertise and appropriate knowledge who

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance089

provide us with an external valuation of our 
portfolio twice a year, in accordance with 
the relevant industry standards.

The valuation process requires the valuers 
to evaluate the likely future financial 
performance of each individual asset 
and apply recent, relevant transactional 
evidence in the market to determine 
an appropriate value at the period end. 
The Committee analyses, challenges 
and debates the valuations prepared 
by the valuers who attend Committee 
meetings for this purpose at the half and 
full year-end. The external valuation process 
and the values ascribed to specific assets 
are also reviewed independently by our 
auditor, EY, as part of its audit scope.

Acquisitions and disposals 
During the year, Landsec progressed 
with its strategy to accelerate growth 
through recycling capital into higher 
return opportunities through a number 
of significant disposals of 32-50 Strand, 
21 Moorfields and One New Street Square, 
and securing 100% ownership of St David’s 
shopping centre in Cardiff via the 
acquisition of the remaining 50% interest. 
The Committee considered the accounting 
treatment and disclosures of these material 
transactions and concluded that they 
were appropriate. 

Provisions for bad debt
The Committee has continued to closely 
monitor the cash collections of rents across 
the whole portfolio. The rent collection 
statistics are strong and although there 
remains bad debt provisions in respect of 
some occupiers who have been or may be 
unable to satisfy their rent obligations, the 
provisions have decreased from last year. 
Continual monitoring of the provisions is 
undertaken by the Committee particularly 
in light of the uncertain macro-environment. 

Internal audit
Until mid-summer 2022, the internal audit 
function was an in-house team which sat 
within the Risk and Assurance team and 
although this was operating effectively, 
it was considered an appropriate time to 

appoint an external third party which 
would increase flexibility over audits and 
improve the quality of the audits as a 
result of access to current best practice 
and subject matter expertise. Following 
a tender process, KPMG were selected 
as the preferred provider and since their 
appointment have undertaken stakeholder 
interviews to understand Landsec’s key 
risks, reviewed the internal audit plan 
and agreed an internal audit charter. 
They have completed audits on Turnover 
Rents, Car Park Income and Investment 
Appraisal. Eleven further audits are planned 
for the year ended 31 March 2024 and will 
include, amongst others, Treasury and 
Cash Management, U+I Post integration, 
Risk Management and ESG. 

Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee considered the Company’s 
2023 Annual Report in the round and 
concluded and recommended to the Board 
that, taken as a whole the 2023 Annual 
Report is fair, balanced and understandable. 

Going concern and viability statement
We continue to focus on the 
appropriateness of adopting the going 
concern assumption in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2023 particularly in light of the 
uncertain macroeconomic environment. 
The going concern statement is set out 
on pages 60 and 61, along with the viability 
statement and the rationale behind the 
chosen five-year time horizon. 

Audit tender
As highlighted last year, we were required 
to tender our audit as EY were approaching 
being in office for ten years having 
performed their first audit for Landsec for 
the year end 31 March 2014. A competitive 
and thorough tender process was 
undertaken during the year and following 
in depth consideration, the Committee and 
the Board concluded that EY remained the 
appropriate auditor for Landsec. EY would 
ensure continued independence through 
a change in partner with effect from 
July 2022. The appointment is subject to 
shareholder approval at the 2023 Annual 
General Meeting. 

UK Corporate Governance Code/ 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
Guidance on Audit Committees 
The Committee considered its compliance 
with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the FRC Guidance on Audit 
Committees and continues to believe that 
we have addressed both the spirit and the 
requirements of each. In addition, the 
Committee has been regularly monitoring 
the potential changes to the new corporate 
governance regime and preparing for its 
implementation, including reviewing a draft 
audit and assurance policy.

Committee effectiveness
During the first half of the year the 
Committee requested that a specific 
effectiveness survey was undertaken to 
supplement and support the Board and 
Committee annual evaluations. This 
in-depth review was undertaken by internal 
audit and concluded that the Committee 
is operating well and should maintain many 
of its existing practices. The internal Board 
evaluation was undertaken later in the year, 
which also highlighted the high standards 
of the Committee. 

The Committee welcomed Miles Roberts 
who joined as a member of the Committee 
in September 2022, replacing Christophe 
Evain. Myself and the Committee would 
like to thank Christophe for his valued 
contributions. 

I continue to appreciate the valuable input 
from the other members of the Audit 
Committee, management and the key 
advisers EY, KPMG, CBRE and JLL and would 
like to thank them for their support during 
the year.

Structure and operations
The Audit Committee’s structure and 
operations are governed by terms of 
reference, which are reviewed annually 
and approved by the Board. These were 
last approved in March 2023. The terms 
of reference are available on our website: 
landsec.com/aboutcorporate-
governance/board-committees.

To maintain effective communication 
between all relevant parties, and in support 
of its activities, the Chairman of the Board, 
Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, 
Company Secretary, Director of Risk and 
Assurance, the partner and representatives 
of our external auditor, EY, the partner and 
representatives of our internal auditor, KPMG 
and other members of the senior finance 
team regularly attend Committee meetings.

All directors are invited to attend meetings 
when the Group’s external valuers, CBRE, 
and JLL, present their full year and half-
year property valuation.

The Committee has private and informal 
sessions with the EY audit team and the 
CBRE and JLL valuation teams to ensure 
that open lines of communication exist, 
in case they wish to raise any concerns 
outside of formal meetings.

The Committee members are all 
independent Non-executive Directors and 
collectively have a broad range of financial, 
commercial and property sector expertise 
that enables them to provide oversight of 
both financial and risk matters, and to 
advise the Board accordingly. The Board 
has determined that Nicholas Cadbury, 
as Chairman of the Committee, has recent 
and relevant financial experience for the 
purposes of satisfying the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Details of the experience 
of all members of the Committee can be 
found on pages 66 and 67.

The Committee works to a structured 
programme of activities and meetings 
to coincide with key events around our 
financial calendar and, on behalf of the 
Board, to provide oversight of the Group’s 
risk management process. Following each 

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance 
 
091

meeting, the Committee Chairman reports 
on the main discussion points and findings 
to the Board.

Risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk 
management framework and risk appetite 
and is supported by the Committee 
through its monitoring and reviewing of 
the effectiveness of risk management and 
internal control processes during the year. 

An overview of Landsec’s approach to risk 
management, its risk management 
framework and governance, risk appetite, 
management and assurance of risks and 
principal risks and uncertainties are 
described on pages 54-59. The risk 
management framework includes the 
Board’s strategic overview, the Executive 
Leadership Team’s detailed review of the 
business risks, controls and mitigation 
strategies, and the assessment of the 
effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal controls system by the Audit 
Committee. A risk waterfall uses indicators 
to highlight whether each risk is within our 
appetite. This allows the Committee to 
consider whether principal risks are 
changing and whether the risk appetite 
remains appropriate. In response to changes 
in Landsec’s organisational structure, the risk 
management framework has been redefined 
in order to ensure clarity on roles and 
responsibilities at all levels and to embed 
risk management within the business.

Primary responsibility for the operation 
of the Company’s internal control and 
risk management systems, which extend 
to include financial, operational and 
compliance controls (and accord with the 
FRC’s 2014 ‘Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting’), has been delegated 
to management. 

These systems have been designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk 
of failure to achieve the Group’s business 
goals and can provide only reasonable, 
not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.

Risk assurance and internal control
Under the overall supervision of the 
Committee, there are several sub-
committees and working groups that give 
assurance over risks being managed within 
the business. The Group has a Director of 
Risk and Assurance (with a direct reporting 
line to the Audit Committee Chairman) who 
provides regular oversight of risk matters, 
evaluates emerging risks and monitors 
compliance to ensure that any mitigating 
actions are properly managed and 
completed. During the year the Committee 
benefited from regular updates from the 
technology team who provided detailed 
information on the progress of the projects 
to improve information security, cyber 
threat and processes to assist with financial 
controls. In addition, the EY team now 
includes a partner with expertise on 
technology and cyber.

Internal audits are carried out in accordance 
with an agreed annual assurance plan and 
reviewed by the Committee throughout the 
year. This plan was previously undertaken 
by the in-house internal audit team and is 
now the responsibility of KPMG who were 
appointed as internal auditor during the year 
following a tender process. It was considered 
appropriate to appoint a third party in order 
to increase flexibility over the audits and 
improve the quality of the audits due to 
access to current best practice and subject 
matter expertise.

Both the in-house team and KPMG have 
provided assurance to the Committee on 
key controls and programme assurance 
and identified improvements in key 
financial processes.

The key elements of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems 
are as follows:

 • an established organisational structure 

with clear lines of responsibility, approval 
levels and delegated authorities
 • a disciplined internal governance 
structure which facilitates regular 
performance review and decision making

 • a comprehensive strategic and business 

planning review

 • a robust budgeting, forecasting and 

financial reporting process

 • various policies, procedures and 

guidelines underpinning the development, 
asset management and financing 
operations of the business

 • a compliance certification process 

conducted in relation to the half-yearly 
and full year results, and business 
activities generally

 • a quarterly key controls self-certification 

by management

 • an internal audit function provided by 

KPMG whose work spans the whole Group

 • a focused post-acquisition review and 
integration programme to ensure the 
Group’s governance, procedures, 
standards and control environment are 
implemented effectively and on time
 • a financial and property information 

management system

 • a whistleblowing process that enables 
concerns to be reported confidentially 
and on an anonymous basis and for those 
concerns to be investigated.

Additionally, the Committee discusses on 
a quarterly basis:
 • the Group’s significant and emerging 

risks, and how exposures have changed 
during the period

 • the effectiveness of internal controls and 

processes at mitigating those risks

 • internal audit reports, summary reports 
of findings and recommendations from 
completion of the internal audit plan
 • progress against completion of agreed 
actions from the internal audit reports.

The Committee was satisfied that the 
system of risk management and internal 
controls has been effective throughout 
the year.

Report of the Audit Committee  
continued

External auditor
EY are Landsec’s external auditor and are 
engaged to conduct a statutory audit and 
express an opinion on the Company’s and 
the Group’s financial statements.

Their audit scope includes a review of the 
property valuation process and methodology 
using its own chartered surveyors (more 
details below), to the extent necessary to 
express an audit opinion.

When carrying out its statutory audit 
work, EY also has access to a broader range 
of employees and different parts of the 
business. If it picks up any information as 
part of this process, it would report to the 
Audit Committee anything that it believes 
the Committee should know in order to 
fulfil its duties and responsibilities. As audit 
partner, Julie Carlyle is authorised to 
contact the Committee Chairman directly 
at any time to raise any matter of concern.

Audit plan
EY presented its proposed audit plan 
(reviewed by senior management and the 
Director of Risk and Assurance), to the 
Committee for discussion. The objective 
was to ensure that the focus of its work 
remained aligned to the Group’s structure 
and strategy.

The Committee is keen to ensure that 
its auditor feels able to challenge 
management and is afforded all the access 
it requires to report on matters that may 
not be part of the statutory audit but 
which, in the opinion of the auditor, should 
be brought to the attention of the Audit 
Committee. These matters may be financial 
or non-financial and may be based on fact 
or opinion (including any concern over 
culture or behaviour). An example may be 
the use or adequacy of any controls used 
by the Company to detect any fraud or 
improper behaviour.

EY is afforded such access through 
attendance at each Committee meeting, 
supported by other meetings held during the 
year with the Committee or the Committee 
Chairman without management being 

present and the knowledge that it can raise 
any matter of concern to the Committee 
Chairman at any time without going 
through management. These regular 
discussions were useful to the Committee 
but no matters of concern emerged. 

Independence and objectivity
The Committee is responsible for 
monitoring and reviewing the objectivity 
and independence of the external auditor. 
In undertaking its annual assessment, the 
Committee took into account the UK 
Ethical Independence Standards introduced 
by the FRC in December 2019 and effective 
from 15 March 2020.

The Committee reviewed:
 • the confirmation from EY that it 
maintains appropriate internal 
safeguards in line with applicable 
professional standards, together with an 
explanation of the due diligence process 
followed to provide such a confirmation
 • the mitigation actions we take in seeking 
to safeguard EY’s independent status, 
including the operation of policies 
designed to regulate the amount of 
non-audit services provided by EY and 
the employment of former EY employees

 • the tenure of the audit engagement 
partner (not being greater than five 
years); Julie Carlyle was appointed as 
EY audit partner to the Group in July 2022

 • the internal performance and 

effectiveness review of EY referred 
to above.

No Committee member has any 
connection with the current auditor.

Taking the above review into account, the 
Committee concluded that EY remained 
objective and independent in its role as 
external auditor.

Effectiveness of the external audit
Following the issue of our Annual Report 
each year, the Director of Risk and 
Assurance conducts a performance 
evaluation and effectiveness review of the 
external audit. This is conducted against 

structured guidelines in consultation with 
the Executive Directors and members of the 
senior finance team and members of the 
Audit Committee to whom they report. 
The Committee Chairman met privately 
with the audit engagement partner before 
the Committee meeting to consider the 
results of the effectiveness review. The 
Committee’s preliminary view is that EY 
has continued to perform its audit services 
effectively and to a high standard, and this 
is consistent with performance each year 
since appointment in 2013. Areas identified 
for development will be shared with EY for 
inclusion in its audit and service delivery 
plans going forward.

Audit tendering
EY was first appointed to the office 
of auditor in respect of the 2013/14 
financial year.

Under current regulations, we were required 
to re-tender the audit by no later than the 
2023/24 financial year and therefore a 
competitive audit tender process was 
undertaken during the year which concluded 
that EY remained the appropriate auditor 
for Landsec, as recommended by the Audit 
Committee and approved by the Board. 
The evaluation criteria used during the 
tender process included the capability and 
competence of the audit partner, team 
and firm, the audit approach and service, 
cultural fit, quality of deliverables and 
presentation, and fees. EY were selected 
because the proposed team would provide a 
mix of continuity and embedded knowledge 
with the comfort of independence via a new 
partner, their ability to provide a partner 
with technology expertise embedded within 
the team, a strong commitment on audit 
approach and service, and a driven and 
enthusiastic outlook. 

The decision on the appointment was made 
by the Board without any influence by a 
third party, and without any contractual 
term of the kind mentioned in Article 16(6) 
of the Audit Regulation being imposed on 
the Company. 

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance093

EY will be appointed for the 31 March 2024 
financial year at this year’s Annual General 
Meeting, subject to shareholder approval.

The Company has complied with the 
Statutory Audit Services Order 2014 for 
the year under review.

Audit fee
The audit fees payable to EY for 2022/23 
(including the audit of the Group’s joint 
ventures) are £1.8m (2021/22: £1.8m). 
This fee takes into account a reduction in 
the number of Group subsidiaries that will 
be audited as they have taken advantage 
of the exemption from having accounts 
audited under s479A-479C of the 
Companies Act 2006.

Non-audit services
To help safeguard EY’s objectivity and 
independence, we operate a non-audit 
services policy that sets out the 
circumstances and financial limits within 
which EY may be permitted to provide 
certain non-audit services.

EY was engaged during the year to provide 
non-audit services to the Group relating 
to the Company’s half-yearly review, the 
assurance statement on sustainability, 
non-statutory audit of the Security Group, 
work in relation to the update of the 
bond programme documentation and the 
issuance of the Green bond. It was decided 
that it would be in the interest of the 
Company to use EY for these services, 
recognising that the use of audit firms for 
non-audit work should generally be kept to a 
minimum. Total fees for non-audit services, 
amounted to £359,000. Details of the fees 
charged by EY during the year can be found 
in note 8 to the financial statements.

No non-audit fees were approved or paid 
on a contingent basis.

External valuations and valuers
The valuation of the Group’s property 
portfolio, including properties held within 
the development programme and in joint 
arrangements, is undertaken by external 
valuers. The Group provides input, such 
as source data, and support to the 
valuation process. CBRE has been the 
Company’s principal valuer since 2015 
and Jones Lang LaSalle Limited (JLL) was 
appointed as joint valuer to undertake 
the valuation of a large part of the retail 
portfolio whilst CBRE will retain the 
valuation of the office portfolio and some 
of the retail portfolio. This change was 
implemented to increase market insight 
and future flexibility, and therefore the 
overall quality of the valuations.

The valuation helps to determine a 
significant part of the Group’s total 
property return and net asset value, which 
have consequential implications for the 
Group’s reported performance and the level 
of variable remuneration received by senior 
management through bonus and long-term 
incentive schemes. Accordingly, the scrutiny 
of each valuation and the valuer’s 
objectivity and effectiveness represent an 
important part of the Committee’s work.

Valuations for the half-year results were 
presented to the Committee by CBRE, and 
by CBRE and JLL for the full-year results. 
These were reviewed and challenged by the 
Committee, with reference to each valuer’s 
approach, methodology, valuation basis 
and underlying property and market 
assumptions. Other Non-executive 
Directors attended the full and half-year 
presentations. The Committee Chairman 
and other members of the Committee also 
had separate meetings with the valuer’s 
as part of this process to provide an 
opportunity to test and challenge the 
valuation outcomes and the principles 
and evidence used in the determination.

Additionally, CBRE and JLL met with EY 
and exchanged information independently 
of management. EY has experienced 
chartered surveyors on its team who 
consider the valuer’s qualifications and 
assess and challenge the valuation 
approach, assumptions and judgements 
made by them. Their audit procedures are 
targeted at addressing the risks in respect 
of the valuations and the potential for any 
undue management influence in arriving 
at them. This year 41 properties (comprising 
78% of the portfolio) were identified for 
substantive review by its valuation experts 
primarily on the basis of their value, type, 
risk profile, commitments to ESG and 
location. The Committee reviewed the 
auditor’s findings.

An internal evaluation of the valuers’ 
performance and effectiveness will be 
conducted after the year-end results 
are finalised, with the results reported 
to the Committee.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance094

Report of the Audit Committee  
continued

The Committee considered the independence 
of the valuers and has noted that CBRE and 
JLL check for conflicts of interest and seek 
approval for non-valuation activity and this 
process has been effective during the year. 
CBRE and JLL have also confirmed that 
their valuation departments operate 
separately from other advisory activity, 
and their valuation remuneration is not 
linked to other non-valuation work that 
they undertake.

A fixed-fee arrangement (subject to 
adjustment for acquisitions and disposals) 
is in place with the valuers for the valuation 
of the Group’s properties and, given the 
importance of their work, we have disclosed 
the fees paid to them in note 9 to the 
financial statements. These fees reflect 
the valuers work on the year-end and 
half-yearly valuations as well as other work 
on agency services including investment 
activity. The total valuation fees paid by the 
Company to CBRE and JLL during the year 
represented less than 5% of their total fee 
income for the year.

Significant financial matters 
The Committee reviewed four significant 
financial matters in connection with the 
financial statements, namely the valuation 
of the Group’s property portfolio, revenue 
recognition, fire safety remediation 
provisions and significant acquisitions and 
disposals. Further details are set out in the 
table on page 95.

These items were considered to be 
significant taking into account the level of 
materiality and the degree of judgement 
exercised by management and, in respect 
of the valuation, the external valuers. 

upgrades and improvements), going 
concern, and other specific areas of 
individual property and audit focus.

The Committee was satisfied that all issues 
had been fully and adequately addressed 
and that the judgements made were 
reasonable and appropriate and had been 
reviewed and debated with the external 
auditor who concurred with the approach 
taken by management.

Non-financial matters
The Committee understands the level of 
reliance that is placed by shareholders on 
the statutory audit and the report of the 
external auditor. 

We report on alternative performance 
measures on page 199. The Committee 
debated and discussed these measures 
and agreed that they were appropriate 
for the business.

Fair, balanced and understandable 
The Committee applied the same due 
diligence approach adopted in previous 
years in order to assess whether the 
Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable, one of the key UK 
Corporate Governance Code requirements. 
The Committee received assurance from 
the verification process carried out on 
the content of the Annual Report by the 
Executive Leadership Team to ensure 
consistent reporting and the existence of 
appropriate links between key messages 
and relevant sections of the Annual Report. 
Particular attention has been given this 
year to the consistency of the narrative 
disclosures around climate risks, our 
strategy and the financial statements.

In addition, the Committee considered, 
and made onward recommendations to the 
Board, as appropriate, in respect of other 
key matters including impairment of trade 
receivables, including lease incentive 
balances, development contracts, pensions 
buy-in, maintenance of the Group’s REIT 
status, financial systems transformation 
(including controls, processes and system 

Taking the above into account, together 
with the views expressed by EY, the 
Committee recommended, and in turn 
the Board confirmed, that the 2023 Annual 
Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
necessary information for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.

Whistleblowing policy
The Audit Committee provides a regular 
whistleblowing update to the Board, which 
has overall responsibility for whistleblowing. 
The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s 
Speak up policy which allows employees 
and third parties to report concerns about 
suspected impropriety or wrongdoing 
(whether financial or otherwise) on a 
confidential basis, and anonymously if 
preferred. This includes an independent 
third-party reporting facility comprising 
a telephone hotline and an alternative 
online process. Any matters reported are 
investigated by the Company Secretary, 
Chief People Officer and the Director of 
Risk and Assurance and escalated to the 
Committee, as appropriate. During the year 
two whistleblowing incidents were reported. 
One matter was investigated and no 
concerns or action were required following 
conclusion of the investigation. The second 
matter, which was reported close to the 
year-end is being fully investigated. 

We monitor whistleblowing awareness and 
remind employees that a dedicated hotline 
exists should they ever need to ‘blow the 
whistle’. The arrangements also form part 
of the induction programme for new 
employees. Details of the whistleblowing 
hotline are included in our Supply Chain 
Commitment, Sustainability Toolkit, 
procurement tender documentation, 
on our website, and at our assets and 
development sites.

Significant financial matters 

Significant financial matters – what is the risk?

How the Committee addressed the matters

Valuation of the Group’s property portfolio 
(including investment properties, investment properties 
held in joint ventures)
The valuation of the Group’s property portfolio is a major 
determinant of the Group’s performance and drives an element 
of the variable remuneration for senior management. Although the 
portfolio valuation is conducted by an external valuer, the nature 
of the valuation estimates is inherently subjective and requires 
significant judgements to be made by management and the valuer.

Significant assumptions and judgements made by the valuer in 
determining valuations may include the appropriate yield (based on 
recent market evidence), changes to market rents (ERVs), what will 
occur at the end of each lease, the level of non-recoverable costs 
and alternative uses. Development valuations also include 
assumptions around costs to complete the development, the level 
of letting at completion, incentives, lease terms and the length of 
time space remains void.

Revenue recognition (including the timing of revenue 
recognition and the treatment of lease incentives)
Certain transactions require management to make judgements 
as to whether and to what extent they should be recognised as 
revenue in the year. Market expectations and EPRA earnings targets 
may place pressure on management to distort revenue recognition. 
This may result in overstatement or deferral of revenues to assist in 
meeting current or future targets or expectations, including through 
incorrect treatment of lease incentives.

Completeness of provisions for fire safety remediation works

Following the Grenfell Tower disaster, a series of new fire safety 
regulations were introduced which impact the Group’s residential 
portfolio. Additionally, the Building Safety Act was enacted on 
28 April 2022, with the related leaseholder protections coming 
into force on 28 June 2022. 

These require companies to assess whether their properties are 
safe to use and perform remedial building works where they are 
not, including properties which are no longer owned. Management 
have therefore undertaken a review of which properties, in both 
the current portfolio and previously owned, are impacted by this 
legislation and which require remediation works. There is a risk that 
management do not identify all properties where fire remediation 
works are required.

Significant acquisitions and disposals 

Certain transactions require management to make judgements 
on accounting treatment, including how a profit or loss is 
recognised and calculated, and how a contract is interpreted. 

There is a risk that profits and losses on disposals are overstated or 
understated respectively, or asset ownership is incorrectly recorded.

The Audit Committee adopts a formal approach by which the valuation process, 
methodology, assumptions and outcomes are reviewed and robustly challenged. 
This includes separate review and scrutiny by management, the Committee 
Chairman and the Committee itself. The Group uses CBRE and JLL, both leading 
firms in the UK property market, as its principal valuers. It also involves EY as the 
external auditor which is assisted by its own specialist team of chartered surveyors 
who are familiar with the valuation approach and the UK property market.

EY met with the valuers separately from management and its remit extends to 
confirming that no undue influence has been exerted by management in relation 
to the valuers arriving at their valuations.

CBRE and JLL submit their valuation reports to the Committee as part of the 
half-yearly (CBRE only as JLL were not yet appointed as principal valuer) and full 
year results process. Both valuers were asked to attend and present their reports 
to the Board and to highlight any significant judgements made or disagreements 
which existed between them and management.

CBRE and JLL proposed changes to the values of our properties and developments 
during the year, which were discussed by the Committee in detail and accepted.

Based on the degree of oversight and challenge applied to the valuation process, the 
Committee concluded that the valuations had each been conducted appropriately, 
objectively and in accordance with the valuer’s professional standards.

The Committee and EY considered the main areas of judgement exercised by 
management in accounting for matters related to revenue recognition, including 
timing and treatment of rents, incentives, surrender premiums and other 
property-related revenue.

In its assessment, the Committee considered all relevant facts, challenged the 
recoverability of occupier incentives, the options that management had in terms 
of accounting treatment and the appropriateness of the judgements made by 
management. These matters had themselves been the subject of prior discussion 
between EY and management.

The Committee, having considered the views of EY, concurred with the 
judgements made by management and was satisfied that the revenue reported 
for the year had been appropriately recognised.

The Committee has been briefed throughout the year on the changes to the 
regulations and legislation, and management have provided detail on the process 
for identifying properties that are in scope for remediation assessment and the 
amount of any provisions required. 

The Audit Committee has discussed the fire remediation works provisions in detail 
at its meetings throughout the year and has heard from EY on their procedures 
for understanding the completeness of management’s review. The Committee 
has concluded that the procedures for identifying in scope properties, the 
assessment of fire remediation works and the level of the provision is appropriate.

The Audit Committee has considered the accounting treatment of a number 
of complex sale and acquisition contracts during the year, particularly those for 
21 Moorfields, One New Street Square and the remaining interest of St David’s. 

These transactions and the proposed accounting treatment were explained 
by management and the Committee thoroughly reviewed the appropriate 
treatment. 

The Committee was satisfied, based on its review and having considered the 
views of EY, that the accounting treatment was appropriate.

The above description of the significant financial matters should be read in conjunction with the Independent Auditor’s Report on pages 121 
to 128 and the significant accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

Directors’ Remuneration Report –  
Chairman’s Annual Statement

Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present, 
on behalf of the Board, 
the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 
31 March 2023.

late 2020, creating balance sheet resilience 
and optionality for future growth. 

We are a purpose-led business and aim 
to create value for all stakeholders. Our 
strategy for the coming year continues 
to focus on shaping Central London offices, 
major retail destinations and mixed-use 
urban neighbourhoods.

This year, the Executive Team has delivered 
strong operational results and continued to 
pro-actively execute the strategy, despite 
increased macroeconomic uncertainty. 
Our performance has been underpinned by 
a strong balance sheet, creating significant 
optionality for future growth.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
We have continued to operate under 
the Remuneration Policy approved by 
shareholders at our 2021 AGM. The 
Committee believes that the Policy provides 
strong alignment with our ambitious 
strategy whilst following best practice in 
corporate governance and providing an 
appropriate level of flexibility. We are next 
due to put forward an updated Policy for 
approval at the 2024 AGM and the 
Committee will start the process to 
review the Policy this summer.

Performance for the 2022/23 
financial year
During the course of the year, executive 
management has continued to drive the 
business strategy forward. In Central 
London we delivered continued strong 
leasing results as well as the disposal of 
£1.4bn of mature offices. In retail we 
delivered strong leasing momentum via 
our differentiated brand focused platform 
capitalising on the ‘flight to prime’, with 
6.9% year on year sales growth. In mixed-
use we have secured planning consent 
for our major Finchley Road project and 
signed a drawdown agreement for the 
first phase of land at Mayfield, progressing 
preparations for our 11m sq ft pipeline. 
Despite the general macro challenges, 
our performance highlights the high quality 
of the Landsec platform and portfolio and 
strong progress on executing strategy since 

For the year ended 31 March 2023, 
whilst asset values decreased by 7.7% 
in aggregate owing to wider economic 
conditions, EPRA earnings were up 10.7% 
and net debt has reduced by £0.9bn, 
reducing LTV by 2.7% to 31.7% in line 
with our LTV target range of 25% to 40% 
and net debt/EBITDA from 9.7x to 7.0x. 
Our current development pipeline is 60% 
pre-let or under offer. In Central London, 
£48m of lettings were completed or in 
solicitors’ hands, 5% ahead of valuers’ 
assumptions, and occupancy up 110bps 
to 95.9%. In Major retail destinations, 
£38m of lettings were completed or in 
solicitors’ hands, 9% ahead of ERV with 
occupancy up 110bps to 94.3%. These 
results are clearly reflected in the variable 
pay awarded to the Executive Directors. 

Annual bonus performance
The performance of the Executive Team 
has been both focused and decisive, with 
progress made in all areas of the strategic 
plan that was set out at the start of the 
year. This performance was achieved 
despite increased macroeconomic 
uncertainties including inflation tensions 
owing to geopolitical issues and the energy 
crisis leading to increased interest rates. 
Significant achievements include completing 
on key transactions at attractive prices 
including the sale of 21 Moorfields and 
One New Street Square. We further 
strengthened our sector-leading balance 
sheet with the issue of our inaugural 
£400m Green bond in challenging bond 
market conditions. We also carried out 
an organisational restructure enabling 
us to hold overhead costs stable year on 
year despite rising inflation. This leaves 
the Group well placed to pursue growth 
opportunities. The acquisition of the

remaining 50% of the St David’s shopping 
centre in Cardiff at an implied property 
yield of 9.7% demonstrates management 
focus on decisive capital allocation, 
reinvesting capital back into the business 
at attractive returns to generate growth. 
The Committee has carefully considered the 
performance against the targets, business 
outcomes and the wider stakeholder 
context and believes that it is appropriate 
for the Executive Directors to receive annual 
bonuses for 2022/23. The assessment 
against the targets resulted in overall bonus 
outcomes of 50% of maximum (equating 
to 75.04% of salary), which is considered 
to be appropriate in the context of the 
performance of the business.

Long-Term Incentive Plan 
performance
Vesting of the 2020 LTIP in 2023 was 
determined by performance against two 
equally weighted measures of Total 
Property Return (TPR) and Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) relative to FTSE 350 real estate 
companies. Performance under the TPR 
measure was below threshold while TSR 
was between threshold and maximum over 
the three years to 31 March 2023. As such, 
and after consideration of the value of the 
shares expected to vest, 37.69% of the 
2020 LTIP awards will vest. 

In addition, the 2021 buyout award granted 
to Vanessa Simms was determined by 
performance measured against the same 
targets as the 2021 LTIP award, albeit over 
two years to 31 March 2023. Performance 
against the Total Accounting Return (TAR) 
measure (now called Total Return on Equity 
(TRE)) was below threshold, TSR was upper 
quartile and ESG (reduction in carbon 
emissions) was above maximum over the 
two years to 31 March 2023. As such, 60% 
of the 2021 buyout award will vest.

Executive Director change
Colette O’Shea left the Board on 
30 September 2022 and stepped down 
from her role as Chief Operating Officer 
with effect from 31 March 2023 after a 
transitional period. 

Discretion
No positive discretion was exercised in 
the year ended 31 March 2023. Negative 
discretion has been used to reduce the 
value of an unbudgeted surrender premium 
received from EPRA earnings prior to 
calculating the annual bonus outcome. 
This was recommended by management 
and agreed by the Committee given that 
the surrender premium was unbudgeted 
and was not therefore factored into the 
original earnings targets.

Executive remuneration 2023/24
1. Base salary
From 1 June 2023, Executive Director 
salaries will increase by 4%. The payrise 
across the wider workforce was 6.75% 
(5% of which was accelerated and paid 
from 1 January 2023 to assist employees 
with the cost of living crisis). This was in 
addition to a one-off award of £1,000 paid 
to all employees earning below £40,000 p.a. 

2. Pension and benefits
Consistent with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, Executive Director 
pension contributions are aligned to the 
wider workforce at 10.5% of salary. No 
changes will be made to benefit provision 
other than a switch from a car to a travel 
allowance for Vanessa Simms.

3. Annual bonus
For the year ending 31 March 2024, Executive 
Directors will be eligible for an annual bonus 
of up to 150% of salary. Our bonus scheme, 
which remains aligned to our strategy, 
combines stretching targets for earnings, 
Total Return on Equity (TRE) (previously 
known as Total Accounting Return (TAR)) 
and ESG for the year ending 31 March 2024. 
Personal objectives will continue to apply 
for a minority of the award.

4. Long-Term Incentive Plan
We intend to grant awards under the 
LTIP in June 2023 which will be subject 
to performance conditions measured 
over a three-year performance period. 
Performance targets will continue to be 
based on TRE (previously known as TAR), 
relative TSR, and carbon reduction. Any 
awards which vest will be subject to a 
two-year post-vesting holding period.

Remuneration across the Company 
The Committee oversees all remuneration 
policies and practices across the organisation, 
and is regularly briefed by the Chief People 
Officer in this regard. The Committee takes 
account of the interests of all internal and 
external stakeholders when making any 
decisions on remuneration matters. During 
the year ended 31 March 2023, we continued 
to grant LTIP awards below the Executive 
Leadership Team, more closely aligning those 
who execute our strategy on a daily basis 
with the interests of our shareholders.

Employee voice
In April 2023, I took the opportunity to 
meet with members of our Employee Forum 
(which represents the wider Landsec 
workforce). This is an important activity 
and I was pleased to answer a number of 
questions posed by the forum on pay ratios, 
pay structures, LTIPs, base salary and 
investor views on remuneration. 

Effectiveness
During the year the Committee reviewed 
its own effectiveness and the effectiveness 
of FIT as advisers to the Committee. 
Overall, the Committee was satisfied with 
the effectiveness of both. Follow-up actions 
included streamlining Committee processes 
and ensuring proactive responses to issues 
and advice.

Conclusion
Despite increased macroeconomic 
uncertainty, Landsec’s Executive Team 
continue to lead the business to deliver 
strong operational results and active 
execution on strategy. I am grateful for the 
engagement and support provided by our 
shareholders and welcome your feedback.

Annual Report  
on Remuneration continued

1.2 Payments to former directors
As announced on 9 September 2022, following almost 20 years at Landsec, Colette O’Shea ceased to be a director of the Company on 
30 September 2022 and stepped down from her role as Chief Operating Officer with effect from 31 March 2023 after a transitional period. 
In respect of her remuneration arrangements, she:
 • received £281,906 in respect of her salary and normal benefits between 1 October 2022 and 31 March 2023 after leaving the Board. 

She will continue to be an employee until the end of her 12-month notice period on 8 September 2023 and will continue to receive her 
salary and normal benefits during the remainder of her employment

 • was eligible to receive an annual bonus in respect of the 2023 financial year to reflect her time served as Chief Operating Officer, subject 
to the satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria and determined on the normal timetable in line with the shareholder approved 
Remuneration Policy 

 • will not be eligible to receive an annual bonus in respect of the 2024 financial year
 • was treated as a good leaver in respect of her outstanding:

 — deferred bonus awards, which will continue and vest on the normal vesting dates

 — LTIP awards which will vest on their normal vesting dates, subject to the satisfaction of applicable performance conditions and time 
pro-rating. A two year post-vesting holding period will apply as normal. To the extent that awards vest, dividend equivalents may be 
credited where applicable

 — options under the Company’s Sharesave plan, which will be exercisable (to the extent of her savings as at the date of exercise) within 

six months after she ceases to be an employee

 • will receive a statutory redundancy payment of £15,417 calculated in accordance with applicable legislation and will be paid in lieu of any 
accrued holiday that cannot be taken. She will also receive a contribution of up to £14,500 (excluding VAT) in respect of legal fees and up 
to £70,000 (excluding VAT) in respect of outplacement support

 • will comply with the Company’s post-cessation shareholding requirements.

Other than the amounts disclosed above, Colette will not be eligible for any remuneration payments or payments for loss of office.

1.3 Annual bonus outturn
In the year under review, Executive Directors had the potential to receive a maximum annual bonus of up to 150% of base salary. Of this, 
120% of salary was dependent on meeting Group targets and 30% of salary was dependent on meeting personal objectives. All targets 
were set at the beginning of the year. The following table confirms the targets and their respective outcomes.

Major disposals were successfully executed (including the disposal of £1.4bn of mature offices). 
The London development pipeline was progressed, while preserving optionality and 100% 
of St David’s in Cardiff was secured. Combined, this activity accounted for c.46% of all 
investment activity in the City and c.24% of central London overall across the year, resulting 
in one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and the retention of Landsec’s strong 
investment grade rating.

Following effective Board and Senior Leader engagement, the strategy was refreshed 
successfully in the context of the current/expected market conditions, our future office 
proposition, a longer-term view of the future of retail, the residential strategy and the 
acceleration of growth.

New business planning cycle and streamlined organisation design launched, resulting in 
a reduction to overhead costs despite inflationary pressures.

Following the publication of Landsec’s refreshed Green Financing Framework, Landsec launched 
its first Green bond to enhance Landsec’s financial capacity and flexibility and leave it well 
placed to continue to deliver against the strategy.

While steps were taken to refresh Landsec’s D&I strategy, with greater focus on leadership 
accountability and data driven action, there is still progress to be made in respect of delivering 
the D&I strategy. As such, this target was considered to be partially met.

The CEO and CFO sponsored the core business systems change programme, ensuring that it 
remained on track with important decisions being made in a timely manner. 

During 2022/23, the CFO championed a detailed review of cyber security, the conclusions of 
which led to substantial and rapid improvements.

The personal objectives were considered by the Committee to have been largely met. On assessment, they delivered an outcome of 17% 
out of 20% against the CEO’s personal and shared targets and 17% out of 20% against the CFO’s personal and shared targets. These 
results (i.e. 85% of maximum against both sets of targets) are consistent with the strong operational performance delivered in 2022/23.

3. The difference between the value of the shares under awards vesting (£6.69 per share) and the value of the shares at grant (£5.47 per share). 

The Committee reviewed the estimated LTIP vesting values set out above (this is the first LTIP vesting since 2017) and concluded that the 
vesting values do not represent unjustified windfall gains, noting Landsec’s:
 • strong operational performance over the three years to 31 March 2023
 • proactive execution of the strategy (which includes a number of material asset disposals), notwithstanding the challenging market conditions
 • balance sheet strength (one of the strongest in the sector)
 • strong relative share price performance over the three years to 31 March 2023.

In addition, Vanessa Simms was granted a buyout award on 18 May 2021 in respect of LTIP awards forfeited from her previous employer.

2.1 Total shareholding (Audited)
Details of the Directors’ interests, including those of their immediate families and connected persons, in the issued share capital of the 
Company at the beginning and end of the year, together with their required shareholding, are set out in the table below.

Executive Directors are expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within five years of appointment to the Board. 
Where the minimum level is not met, or where the value of shareholding falls below the required level due to movements in the share price, 
the Executive Director is expected to retain 100% of the shares acquired, net of tax, under any share plan awarded by the Company.

Non-executive Directors are expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within three years of appointment to the Board. 
The shareholding requirements are considered met once the Non-executive Director has obtained the required holding value and, provided 
those shares are retained, no adjustment is required due to movements in the share price.

2.3 Share awards granted in the year ended 31 March 2023
Awards were granted under the LTIP in June 2022, subject to three performance conditions measured over a three-year performance 
period, as set out below. No awards will vest if the threshold performance targets are not met. In the performance period from 1 April 2022 
to 31 March 2025, the performance conditions are 40% TSR relative to the FTSE 350 Real Estate Super Sector, 40% Total Accounting 
Return performance based on the percentage change in EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share over the performance period and 20% 
ESG performance, measuring the reduction in carbon emissions. Full details of the performance targets are set out on page 121 of the 
2022 Annual Report. Awards may normally be exercised between 24 June 2025 and 23 June 2032 and a two-year post-vesting holding 
period applies.

3.3 Performance targets for the coming year
Performance metrics and weightings in respect of the annual bonus, which will continue to be capped at 150% of salary, are set out below. 
To reflect the importance of delivering growth in like-for-like earnings in line with Landsec’s strategic aims notwithstanding the challenging 
market conditions, the EPRA earnings measure will be split equally between the existing EPRA earnings measured against budget and a 
like-for-like EPRA earnings growth measure in respect of the year ending 31 March 2024. Challenging sliding scale targets will operate and 
the Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to ensure any payouts against the targets reflect the underlying performance of the 
Company. Performance targets are considered to be commercially sensitive although will be disclosed in full, together with the performance 
and the resulting bonus awards, in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance110

Annual Report  
on Remuneration continued

The approach for the 2023 LTIP awards reflects both Landsec’s focus on delivering returns to shareholders combined with our approach 
to sustainability and our ambition to be a net zero carbon business. Relative TSR is based on an unweighted, median to upper quartile 
vesting schedule and TRE (previously called TAR) targets deliver a close alignment to strategy and a clear line of sight for management. 
The widening of the TRE targets from the prior year awards reflects elevated volatility levels in the market. The 2% to 10% p.a. TRE target 
range compares with a 4% to 10% p.a. range set for the 2021 LTIPs and a 6% to 11% p.a. range set for the 2022 LTIPs. However, reflecting 
the lower threshold for the 2023 LTIP award, the level of vesting for this part of the award has been reduced from the 20% normally 
operated to 0%, with a pro-rata vesting between threshold and maximum.

The 2023 LTIP award will be set at up to 300% of salary for the CEO and CFO.

4. Total Shareholder Return and Chief Executive pay
The following graphs illustrate the performance of the Company measured by TSR (share price growth plus dividends paid) against 
a ‘broad equity market index’. In addition to the ten-year period required by the disclosure regulations, a five-year period has also been 
presented to demonstrate Landsec’s performance more recently. As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index, 
this is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark for the purposes of the graphs. An additional line to illustrate the Company’s 
performance compared with the FTSE 100 Index over the previous five and ten years is also included.

This graph shows the value, by 31 March 2023, of £100 invested in Landsec on 31 March 2018, compared with the value of £100 invested 
in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 350 Real Estate Indices on the same date.

5. The context of pay at Landsec
5.1 Pay across the Group
a. Senior management
For the year under review, performance-related pay for our 37 most senior employees (excluding the Executive Directors) ranged from 
27% to 72% of salary (2022: 33% to 87%), equating to 45% to 60% of the maximum potential. The average bonus was 33.9% of salary 
(2022: 51.4%), equating to 49% of the maximum potential.

b. All other employees
Executive Directors’ base salaries were increased by 3% in 2022, which was below the workforce average increase of 5%. From 1 June 2023, 
Executive Director salaries will increase by 4%. The pay rise across the wider workforce was 6.75% (5% of which was accelerated and paid 
from 1 January 2023 to assist employees with the cost of living crisis).

In addition, in autumn 2022, we made a one-off payment of £1,000 to employees earning below £40,000.

As at 31 March 2023, the ratio of the base salary of the Chief Executive to the average base salary across the Group (excluding Executive 
Directors) was 10:1 (£82,948: £824,000).

c. Percentage change in remuneration between Directors and employees
The table below shows the year on year percentage change in salary, benefits and annual bonus earned for all current Directors compared 
to all employees. As noted above, 5% of the employee pay rise for 2023/24 was accelerated and paid in 2022/23, but this acceleration did 
not apply to Directors or members of the Executive Leadership Team. This will impact comparative numbers in both years.

1. Vanessa Simms joined the Board during 2021/22.
2. Colette O’Shea stepped down from the Board on 30 September 2022 therefore comparing part-year (FY22/23) with full year prior. 
3. Sir Ian Cheshire was appointed on 23 March 2023.
4. Miles Roberts was appointed on 19 September 2022.

d. CEO pay ratio
The tables below show how pay for the CEO compares to employees at the lower, median and upper quartiles (calculated on a full-time 
equivalent basis). The ratios have been calculated in accordance with Option A of The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 
2018, which uses the total pay and benefits for all employees, and is the same methodology that is used to calculate the CEO’s single figure 
of remuneration table on page 101. Figures are calculated by reference to 31 March 2023 using actual pay data from April 2022 to March 2023. 
Excluded from our analysis are joiners, leavers and long-term absentees from the Company during the year. As the CEO has a larger 
proportion of his total remuneration linked to business performance than other employees in the UK workforce, the ratio has increased 
versus last year primarily as a result of the partial vesting of the 2020 LTIP (the 2019 LTIP did not vest last year) more than offsetting the 
reduced bonus award for the year ended 31 March 2023. Given the alignment of incentive arrangements cascaded below Board level, 
the Remuneration Committee believes the pay ratios are consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for the Group’s UK 
employees taken as a whole.

1. Including base salaries for all employees, bonus and share-based payments.
2. Dividend paid represents dividends declared for the year. See note 11 to the financial statements.

6. Dilution
Awards granted under the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements (LTIP, Deferred Share Bonus Plan, Restricted Share Plan and the 
ESOP) are satisfied through the funding of an Employee Benefit Trust (administered by an external trustee) which acquires existing Land 
Securities Group PLC shares in the market. The Employee Benefit Trust held 781,456 ordinary shares (2022: 888,400) and 3,049,943 treasury 
shares (2022: 3,049,943) at 31 March 2023.

The exercise of share options under the Land Securities Group PLC Sharesave, which is open to all employees who have completed more 
than one month’s service with the Group, can be satisfied by the allotment of newly issued shares. At 31 March 2023, the total number 
of shares which could be allotted under this Scheme was 565,439 shares (2022: 635,473), which represents less than 0.08% (2022: 0.09%) 
of the issued share capital of the Company.

7. Remuneration Committee meetings
The Committee met for three scheduled meetings and one unscheduled meeting over the course of the year. All members attended all 
the scheduled meetings with the exception of one meeting which Christophe Evain could not attend owing to a family bereavement. The 
Committee meetings were normally also attended by the Chief Executive, the Chief People Officer and Company Secretary who acted 
as the Committee’s Secretary.

The Committee received advice on remuneration and ancillary share plan matters from FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP. FIT is a member 
of the Remuneration Consultants Group and is a signatory to its Code of Conduct, which requires their advice to be impartial. The 
Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and objective. Aside from some support in benchmarking remuneration 
for roles below the Board, FIT has no other connection with the Group. For the financial year under review, FIT received fees of £75,676 
(FY2022: £66,610) in connection with advice provided to the Committee.

Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy Summary

A summary of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy is set out below. The policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2021 AGM, will 
be reviewed during FY2024 in advance of seeking shareholder approval for a new policy at the 2024 AGM. The full policy can be found in 
the 2021 Annual Report.

1. Executive Directors

Base salary

Purpose and link 
to strategy

 • To aid the recruitment, retention and motivation of high-performing Executive Directors
 • To reflect the value of their experience, skills and knowledge, and importance to the business

Operation

Opportunity

Normally reviewed annually, with effect from 1 June, and reflects:
 • Increases throughout the rest of the business
 • Market benchmarking exercises undertaken periodically to ensure salaries are set at around the median of the market 

competitive level for people in comparable roles with similar levels of experience, performance and contribution

 • Changes in the scope of an Executive Director’s role

The maximum annual salary increase will not normally exceed the average increase across the rest of the workforce.
Higher increases will be exceptional, and may be made in specific circumstances, including:
 • Where there is an increase in responsibilities or scope of the role
 • To apply salary progression for a newly appointed Executive Director
 • Where the Executive Director’s salary has fallen below the market positioning

Performance measures

 • Individual and Company performance is taken into account when determining appropriate salary increases

Benefits 

Purpose and link 
to strategy

Operation

 • To provide protection and market competitive benefits to aid recruitment and retention of high-performing  

Executive Directors

Typical benefits include, but are not limited to:
 • Car allowance
 • Private medical insurance
 • Life assurance
 • Ill health income protection
 • Holiday and sick pay
 • Eligibility to participate in all-employee share incentive plans
 • Professional advice in connection with their directorship
 • Travel, subsistence and accommodation as necessary
 • Occasional gifts, for example appropriate long service or leaving gifts

Opportunity

 • The value of benefits may vary from year to year depending on the cost to the Company

Performance measures

 • n/a

Pension 

Purpose and link 
to strategy

 • To help recruit and retain high performing Executive Directors
 • To reward continued contribution to the business by enabling Executive Directors to build retirement benefits

Operation

 • Participation into a defined contribution pension scheme or cash equivalent

Opportunity

 • 10.5% of salary, in line with the maximum employer contribution for all employees in the Company’s Group Personal Pension Plan

Performance measures

 • n/a

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance115

Annual bonus 

Purpose and link 
to strategy

 • Incentivise Executive Directors and senior management to achieve specific, predetermined goals during a one-year period, or less
 • Reward financial and individual performance linked to the Company’s strategy
 • Deferred proportion of bonus, awarded in shares, provides a retention element and additional alignment of interest 

with shareholders

Operation

 • The annual bonus operates by reference to financial and personal performance measures normally set and assessed over one year
 • Any bonus payment is determined by the Committee after the year end, based on performance against challenging targets which 

are reviewed annually

 • The achievement of on-target performance should normally result in a payment of up to 50% of the maximum opportunity
 • Bonuses up to 50% of salary are normally paid in cash. Any amounts in excess of 50% of salary are deferred into shares for one 

year. Any amounts in excess of 100% of salary are deferred into shares for two years

 • Deferred shares are potentially forfeitable if the individual leaves prior to the share release date
 • Dividend equivalents may be awarded on deferred shares between grant and vesting to the extent that awards vest
 • Bonus payments are not pensionable
 • Malus and clawback provisions apply
 • The level of payout at threshold performance for each performance measure is set annually, but will typically be no more than 

25% of maximum

 • The Committee retains discretion to amend the payout level (up or down) where it considers it to be appropriate, but not so as 

to exceed the maximum bonus potential and will fully disclose the exercise of any discretion in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
that follows such exercise of discretion

Opportunity

 • 150% of salary

Performance measures

 • The performance measures applied may be financial, non-financial, or individual, and in such proportions as the Remuneration 

Committee considers appropriate, although individual measures will form a minority of the potential

 • Performance measures will be aligned to the Company’s strategy. The Committee reserves the right to change measures 

(and their weightings) for each financial year to ensure the metrics chosen are appropriate means of assessing the performance 
of the Executive Directors

 • Once set, performance measures and targets will generally remain unchanged for the year; exceptionally targets may be 
adjusted by the Committee to take account of significant transactions such as acquisitions and/or disposals or in other 
exceptional circumstances such as timing of transactions that have a material impact on the business plan

Long-term incentive

Purpose and link 
to strategy

 • Incentivises value creation over the long term
 • Rewards execution of our strategy
 • Aligns the long-term interests of Executive Directors and shareholders
 • Promotes retention

Operation

 • The Committee may make an annual award of shares under the LTIP
 • Vesting is determined on the basis of the Group’s achievements against stretching performance targets, normally over 

a three-year period and continued employment

 • The Committee reviews the measures, their relative weightings and targets prior to each award
 • For each measure, no awards vest for performance below threshold
 • Up to 20% of an award may vest for threshold performance
 • Each measure is capped at 100% vesting, which represents a stretching target
 • Executive Directors are required to hold vested awards (net of tax/NI where relevant) for a further two years 

(including post-cessation) following the three-year vesting period expiry

 • Dividend equivalents may be awarded between grant and the expiry of any holding period to the extent that the award 

vests Malus and clawback provisions apply

Opportunity

 • 300% of salary

Performance measures

 • The performance measures applied may be financial, non-financial, corporate or strategic and in such proportions as the 

Remuneration Committee considers appropriate

 • The measures may be based on a mixture of relative and absolute financial performance as well as one or more measures 

to recognise the Company’s broader strategic ESG commitment

Notes to Policy table:
Performance measures and target setting
Full details of the performance conditions and targets applying for each award will be disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Where targets are considered to be too sensitive to disclose in advance for commercial reasons, full disclosure of the original targets, and the 
extent to which they have been achieved, will be provided on a retrospective basis at the end of the relevant performance period.

policy that all Directors are required to 
stand for re-election at each AGM.

Shareholders’ authority to empower the 
Directors to make market purchases of up 
to 10% of its own ordinary shares is sought 
at the AGM each year. The Articles can only 
be amended, or new Articles adopted, by a 
resolution passed by shareholders in general 
meeting and being approved by at least 
three quarters of the votes cast.

shares held by Treasury and the Employee 
Benefit Trust. This transfer has not affected 
total number of voting rights. No shares 
were bought back during the year. Further 
details relating to share capital, including 
movements during the year, are set out 
in note 36 to the financial statements.

Employee benefit trust
Equiniti Trust (Jersey) Limited continues 
as trustee (Trustee) of Landsec’s Employee 
Benefit Trust (EBT). The EBT is used to 
purchase Land Securities Group PLC

Landsec’s various employee share plans.

The EBT did not purchase any shares in 
the market during the year (2022: nil). 
On 3 June 2021, 3,049,943 Treasury shares 
were transferred to the EBT. The EBT released 
106,944 shares during the year to satisfy 
vested share plan awards. At 31 March 2023, 
the EBT held 781,456 ordinary shares 
purchased on the market and 3,049,943 
ordinary shares previously held in treasury 
in Land Securities Group PLC.

A dividend waiver is in place from the 
Trustee in respect of all dividends payable 
by Landsec on shares which the EBT holds. 
Further details regarding the EBT, and of 
shares issued pursuant to Landsec’s various 
employee share plans during the year, are

shareholders. These authorities will expire 
at the 2023 AGM and a renewal of that 
authority will be sought.

The Company received no other DTR 
notifications by way of change to the 
information in the substantial shareholders 
table during the period from 1 April to

Directors’ interests
Save as disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, none of the 
Directors, nor any person connected with 
them, has any interest in the share or loan 
capital of Landsec or any of its subsidiaries. 
At no time during the year ended 31 March 
2023 did any Director hold a material 
interest, directly or indirectly, in any 
contract of significance with Landsec or 
any subsidiary other than the Executive 
Directors in relation to their Service 
Agreements.

Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
Landsec has agreed to indemnify each 
Director against any liability incurred in 
relation to acts or omissions arising in 
the ordinary course of their duties. The 
indemnity applies only to the extent 
permitted by law. A copy of the deed of 
indemnity is available for inspection at 
Landsec’s registered office. Landsec has 
appropriate Directors’ & Officers’ Liability 
insurance cover in respect of potential 
legal action against its Directors.

Share capital
Landsec has a single class of share capital 
which is divided into ordinary shares of 
nominal value 102/3p each ranking pari 
passu. No other securities have been issued 
by the Company. At 31 March 2023, there 
were 751,381,219 ordinary shares in issue 
and fully paid. To satisfy future awards 
under the Company’s shareholder approved 
employee share plans, on 3 June 2021, of 
the 9,839,179 existing shares held by the 
Company in Treasury, 3,049,943 were 
transferred to the Company’s Employee 
Benefit Trust, leaving, 6,789,236 shares held 
in Treasury. The voting rights and dividend 

Landsec Annual Report 2023GovernanceShareholder voting rights and 
restrictions on transfer of shares 
All the issued and outstanding ordinary 
shares of Landsec have equal voting rights 
with one vote per share. There are no 
special control rights attaching to them 
save that the control rights of ordinary 
shares held in the EBT can be directed 
by the Company to satisfy the vesting 
of outstanding awards under its various 
employee share plans.

In relation to the EBT, the Trustee has 
agreed not to vote any shares held in the 
EBT at any general meeting. If any offer 
is made to all shareholders to acquire their 
shares in Landsec, the Trustee will not be 
obliged to accept or reject the offer in 
respect of any shares which are at the 
time subject to subsisting awards, but will 
have regard to the interests of the award 
holders and will have power to consult 
them to obtain their views on the offer. 
Subject to the above, the Trustee may 
take such action with respect to an offer 
as it thinks fit.

Landsec is not aware of any agreements or 
control rights between existing shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights. 
The rights, including full details relating to 
voting of shareholders and any restrictions 
on transfer relating to Landsec’s ordinary 
shares, are set out in the Articles and in 
the explanatory notes that accompany the 
Notice of the 2023 AGM. These documents 
are available on Landsec’s website at: 
landsec.com/agm.

Change of control
There are a number of agreements that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the Company 
following a takeover. None of these are 
considered significant. The Company’s 
share plans contain provisions that take 
effect in such an event but do not entitle 
participants to a greater interest in the 
shares of the Company than created by 
the initial grant or award under the relevant 
plan. There are no agreements between the 
Company and its Directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of office 
or employment or otherwise that occurs 
specifically because of a takeover.

Human rights and equal 
opportunities
Landsec operates a Human Rights Policy 
which aims to recognise and safeguard the 
human rights of all citizens in the business 
areas under our control. We support the 
principles set out within both the UN 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the International Labour Organization’s 
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work. Our Policy is built on these 
foundations including, without limitation, 
the principles of equal opportunities, 
collective bargaining, freedom of 
association and protection from forced 
or child labour.

The Policy takes account of the Modern 
Slavery Act that came into force in October 
2015 and requires Landsec to report 
annually on its workforce and supply chain, 
specifically to confirm that workers are 
not enslaved or trafficked. Landsec’s latest 
Modern Slavery Statement was approved 
by the Board on 8 September 2022 and 
posted on our website the same day.

Landsec is an equal opportunities employer 
and our range of employment policies and 
guidelines reflects legal and employment 
requirements in the UK and safeguards the 
interests of employees, potential employees 
and other workers. We do not condone 
unfair treatment of any kind and offer 
equal opportunities in all aspects of 
employment and advancement regardless 
of race, nationality, gender, age, marital 
status, sexual orientation, disability, religious 
or political beliefs. Landsec recognises that 
it has clear obligations towards all its 
employees and the community at large to 
ensure that disabled people are afforded 
equal opportunities to enter employment 
and progress. Landsec has therefore 
established procedures designed to provide 
fair consideration and selection of disabled 
applicants and to satisfy their training and 
career development needs. If an employee 
becomes disabled, wherever possible 
Landsec takes steps to provide reasonable 
adjustments to their existing employment 
arrangements, or by redeployment and 
providing appropriate retraining to enable 
continued employment in the Group.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities

The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and the Company 
financial statements in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Under the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules and Company law, group financial 
statements are required to be prepared in 
accordance with UK adopted international 
accounting standards (IFRSs and IFRICs). 
Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit and loss of the Group and 
the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies in 

accordance with IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors’ and then apply them consistently;

 • make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;

 • present information, including accounting 

policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 • in respect of the Group financial 

statements, state whether international 
accounting standards in conformity with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 (and UK adopted international 
accounting standards) have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements;

 • in respect of the Company financial 

statements, state whether international 
accounting standards in conformity with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;

 • provide additional disclosures when 

compliance with the specific 
requirements of UK adopted international 
accounting standards is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the Group’s and Company’s 
financial position and performance; and

 • prepare the Group’s and Company’s 

financial statements on a going concern 
basis, unless it is inappropriate to do so.

The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
and Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and the 
Company, and to enable them to ensure 
that the Annual Report complies with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Directors’ responsibility statement 
under the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions appear below, confirm to the 
best of their knowledge:
 • the Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
international accounting standards in 
conformity with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (and UK adopted 
international accounting standards) 
give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position, performance 
and cash flows of the Company and 
Group as a whole; and

 • the Strategic Report contained in the 
Annual Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
Group and the Company, together 
with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties faced by the Group 
and Company.

Directors’ statement under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code
Each of the Directors confirm that to the 
best of their knowledge the Annual Report 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s and Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.

A copy of the financial statements of the 
Group is placed on the Company’s website. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of statutory 
and audited information on the Company’s 
website at landsec.com. Information 
published on the internet is accessible in 
many countries with different legal 
requirements. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Land Securities Group PLC

Opinion
In our opinion:
 • Land Securities Group PLC’s Group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) 

give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2023 and of the Group’s loss 
for the year then ended;

 • the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards; 
 • the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting 

standards as applied in accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006; and

 • the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements of Land Securities Group PLC (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for 
the year ended 31 March 2023 which comprise:

Group

Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2023

Related notes 1 to 41 to the financial statements including 
a summary of significant accounting policies 

Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended

Related notes 1 to 41 to the financial statements, including a summary 
of significant accounting policies

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK adopted international accounting 
standards and as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We are independent of the Group and Parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

The Non-Audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain 
independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.

Conclusions relating to going concern 
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation 
of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group and Parent Company’s ability to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:
 • assessing the risk around going concern in planning our audit, at the interim and again at the year-end phase.
 • confirming our understanding of the Group’s going concern assessment process and reviewing management’s related Board papers.
 • assessing and challenging the appropriateness of the duration of the going concern review period to end of September 2024 and 

considering whether there are any known events or conditions that will occur in the short-term following the going concern period which 
would impact our considerations. 

 • challenging the modelled scenarios, which included challenging the key assumptions used by management by comparing to corroborative 

evidence and searching out independent contradictory evidence. We assessed management’s consideration of downside sensitivity analysis 
taking into account current events and market conditions. We have also challenged the impact of the historic impact on events such as 
covid-19 on the performance of the Group and the valuation of investment properties. We also applied further sensitivities on income and 
expense cash flows and forecast valuation movements where appropriate to stress test the impact on both liquidity and covenants. As part 
of our sensitivity testing, we considered the perspective of our chartered surveyors on forecast valuation movements.

Independent Auditor’s Report
continued

 • checking the integrity of the models developed by management for the base case cash flow and liquidity forecasts and covenant 

calculations covering the going concern review period to September 2024 and the additional downside scenarios.

 • checking that the terms and conditions of the debt agreements with lenders had been appropriately incorporated into the going concern 
scenarios and modelling, including the maturity profile of the Group’s borrowings, the impact of the Security Group structure (as defined 
in the Glossary on page 215) and the tiered operating covenant regime.

 • performed testing to evaluate whether the covenant requirements of the debt facilities would be breached under either the base case 
or the downside scenarios through the going concern period. We performed reverse stress testing on key assumptions and considered 
the likelihood of outcomes including controllable mitigating actions over and above the scenarios modelled. 

 • further challenging the cash flow forecasts with reference to historical trends and assessing the outcome of management’s previous 

forecasts.

 • reviewing the disclosures in the financial statements relating to going concern with a view to confirming that they appropriately disclose 

the risk, the impact on the Group’s operations and results and potential mitigating actions. 

The results of the severe but plausible downside scenarios modelled by management indicate that the Group would maintain available 
facility and covenant headroom to be able to withstand the impact of plausible downside sensitivities throughout the period of the going 
concern assessment to 30 September 2024.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually 
or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period to 
30 September 2024. 

In relation to the Group and Parent Company’s reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this 
report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.

Overview of our audit approach

Audit scope

 • The Group operates in the United Kingdom through four segments: Central London, Major retail, Mixed-use urban and Subscale sectors. 
 • We have identified the entire Group as one component and perform full procedures across the entire Group. The Group audit team

matters

Materiality

also performed audit procedures on joint venture balances included within the Group financial statements. 
 • The valuation of property, including investment properties and investment properties held in joint ventures.
 • Revenue recognition, including the timing of revenue recognition and the treatment of lease incentives. 
 • Overall Group materiality of £99m which represents 0.9% of total assets in the Group balance sheet at 31 March 2023. Overall 

materiality is applied to account balances related to investment properties, trading properties (either wholly owned or held within 
joint ventures) and related loans and borrowings. 

 • Specific materiality of £19m, which represents 5% of EPRA Earnings before tax. Specific materiality is applied to account balances 
not related to any of the following balances; investment properties, trading properties (either wholly owned or held within joint 
ventures) and loans and borrowing.

 • Parent Company materiality of £56m, which represents 0.9% of total assets in the Parent Company balance sheet. Parent 

Company materiality is applied to all balances within the Parent Company.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Financial statements123

An overview of the scope of the Parent Company and Group audits 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk 
profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment, the potential impact 
of climate change and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed.

Changes from the prior year 
In the prior year, U and I Group Plc (U+I) was identified as a separate component for the purpose of scoping the audit and designated 
a specific scope. U+I has subsequently been integrated within the Group during the current financial year and has not been identified 
as a separate component for the purpose of our audit this year.

Climate change 
Stakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact Land Securities Group PLC. The Group has determined that 
the most significant future impacts from climate change on their operations will be from failure to meet their 2030 carbon reduction 
target leading to regulatory, reputational and commercial impact and failure to mitigate physical impact on Landsec assets. These are 
explained in the required Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures and on pages 56 to 59 in the principal risks and uncertainties. 
They have also explained their climate commitments on pages 40 to 46. All of these disclosures form part of the “Other information,” 
rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering 
whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise 
appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on “Other information”. 

In planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the Group’s business and any consequential 
material impact on its financial statements. 

The Group has explained in the basis of preparation note within the financial statements how they have reflected the impact of climate 
change in their financial statements including how this aligns with their commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. Significant 
judgements and estimates relating to climate change are included in note 2. 

Our audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating management’s 
assessment of the impact of climate risk, physical and transition, their climate commitments, the effects of material climate risks 
disclosed on pages 56 to 59 and the significant judgements and estimates disclosed in note 2 and whether these have been appropriately 
reflected in the valuation of the investment properties, investment properties held in joint ventures and trading properties or have any 
other material impact on the financial statements. As part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, supported by our 
climate change internal specialists, to determine the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements from climate change 
which needed to be considered in our audit. 

We also challenged the Directors’ considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated 
disclosures. Where considerations of climate change were relevant to our assessment of going concern, these are described above. 

Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to impact 
a key audit matter. 

Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Risk

Our response to the risk

The valuation of property, 
including investment properties 
and investment properties held 
in joint ventures
2023: £9,658m in investment 
properties and £601m (the 
Group’s share) in investment 
properties held in joint ventures 
(2022: £11,207m in investment 
properties and £771m share in 
investment properties held in 
joint ventures) 
Refer to the Report of the Audit 
Committee (pages 90-95); 
Accounting policies (pages 
149-150); Note 14 & 16 of the 
Financial statements (pages 
151-160).
The valuation of property, 
including investment properties 
and investment properties held in 
joint ventures, requires significant 
judgement and estimation by 
management and their external 
valuers. This also includes 
considering the impact of climate 
change on the investment 
properties. Inaccuracies in inputs 
or unreasonable bases used in 
these judgements (namely in 
respect of estimated rental value 
and yield profile applied) could 
result in a material misstatement 
of the income statement and 
balance sheet. 
There is also a risk that 
management may influence 
the significant judgements 
and estimates in respect of 
property valuations in order to 
meet market expectations or 
bonus targets. 

Our audit procedures over the valuation of property included:
We obtained an understanding of the Group’s processes and controls around the 
valuation of properties.
We evaluated the competence of the Group’s external valuers, CBRE and JLL which 
included consideration of their qualifications and expertise.
We attended meetings between management and CBRE and management and 
JLL to assess for evidence of undue management influence and we obtained 
confirmation from CBRE and JLL that they had not been subject to undue influence 
from management.
We met with CBRE and JLL to challenge their valuation approach and the judgements 
they made in assessing the property valuation. Such judgements included the 
estimated rental value, yield profile and other assumptions that impact the value. 
We assessed and challenged these judgements made by CBRE and JLL in light of the 
continued turbulence in the retail sector, lack of comparable market evidence from 
transactions and costs associated with climate change. 
We selected a sample of investment properties based on a number of factors 
including size, risk, representation across asset classes and segments and including 
a further random selection which in total comprised 78% of the market value of 
investment properties (including investment properties held in joint ventures). 
For this sample of properties, we tested source documentation provided by the 
Group to CBRE and JLL. This included agreeing a sample back to underlying lease 
data and vouching costs incurred to date in respect of development properties. 
We included chartered surveyors on our audit team who reviewed and challenged 
the valuation approach and assumptions for the same sample of properties. 
Our chartered surveyors compared the yields applied to each property to an 
expected range of yields taking into account available market data and asset 
specific considerations. They challenged whether the other assumptions applied 
by the external valuers, such as the estimated rental values, voids, tenant incentives 
and development costs to complete were supported by available data. They also 
challenged whether other market transactions contradict the assumptions used 
in the valuation.
Together with our chartered surveyors, we met with the external valuers to further 
discuss the findings from our audit work described above and to seek further 
explanations as required.
We challenged whether sustainability costs identified by management have been 
appropriately considered within the valuation.
We conducted analytical procedures on the properties not included in the sample 
reviewed in detail by our chartered surveyors by comparing assumptions and the 
value of those properties by reference to our understanding of the UK real estate 
market, external market data and asset specific considerations to evaluate the 
appropriateness of the valuations adopted by the Group. Where values or assumptions 
were not in line with our expectations, we challenged these further by discussing 
with management, CBRE, JLL and our chartered surveyors and, where appropriate, 
obtaining further evidence to support the movement in values.
We performed 5 site visits. Where properties are under development, this enabled us 
to test existence of the property and challenge whether the status of the development 
was consistent with what we were told by management. We challenged development 
directors and project managers for major properties in the development programme 
on the project costs, progress of development and leasing status. We challenged 
the reasonableness of forecast costs to complete included in the valuations as well 
as the identified contingencies and the exposure to remaining risks, by comparing 
the total forecast costs to contractual arrangements and other supporting 
evidence. We challenged forecast cost and cost to complete for evidence of 
overruns through risks identified during our development meetings, review of 
meeting minutes and other supporting information. We corroborated the 
information provided by the development directors and the project managers 
through our review of cost analysis as well as the valuation outcome. 
We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures of estimates and valuation assumptions 
in note 14 that were made in accordance with IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
Scope of our procedures 
We performed full scope audit procedures over the valuation of properties, 
including investment properties and investment properties held in joint ventures.

Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee 

We have tested the 
inputs, assumptions 
and methodology 
used by CBRE and 
JLL. We have 
concluded that the 
methodology applied 
is reasonable and 
that the external 
valuations are a 
reasonable 
assessment of the 
market value of 
investment properties 
at 31 March 2023.
We concluded that 
the sample of 
properties reviewed 
by our chartered 
surveyors was within 
the reasonable range 
of values as assessed 
by them. We 
concluded that 
climate change has 
been appropriately 
considered within the 
valuations where 
appropriate.
We consider that 
management 
provided an 
appropriate level of 
review and challenge 
over the valuations, 
and we did not 
identify evidence of 
undue management 
influence.
We have reviewed 
the disclosures in the 
financial statements 
including the 
significant accounting 
estimates and 
sensitivities and 
consider them to 
be appropriate.

Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee 

Based upon the  
audit procedures 
performed, we 
concluded that 
revenue has been 
recognised on an 
appropriate basis 
in the year.

Risk

Our response to the risk

Revenue recognition, including 
the timing of revenue 
recognition and the treatment 
of lease incentives 
2023: £612m rental income 
(2022: £537m rental income)
2023: £91m service charge income 
(2022: £78m service charge 
income)
Refer to the Report of the Audit 
Committee (pages 90-95); 
Accounting policies (pages 
140-141); Note 6 of the Financial 
statements (pages 140-141).
Market expectations and EPRA 
earnings-based targets may place 
pressure on management to 
distort revenue recognition. This 
may result in overstatement or 
deferral of revenues to assist in 
meeting current or future targets 
or expectations, including through 
the incorrect treatment of lease 
incentives.

Our audit procedures over revenue recognition included:
We tested certain manual controls governing approvals and changes to lease terms 
and the upload of this information to the Group’s property information 
management system (PIMS). We also performed testing of certain manual controls 
over the billings process.
We selected a sample of new, existing and amended lease agreements in the year 
and agreed the key lease terms input into PIMS, including lease incentive clauses.
We performed data analytics procedures to recalculate rental income across the 
whole population of leases in the Group’s portfolio; this also covers the straight-
lining rent adjustment for lease incentives. 
We obtained the schedules used to calculate straight-lining of revenue in 
accordance with IFRS 16 Leases. We tested the arithmetical accuracy of these 
schedules and that the straight-lining was calculated in accordance with the 
guidance. For a sample of leases we agreed the lease information per the schedules 
back to lease agreements.
We have performed testing in relation to service charge income. This has included 
vouching a sample of income recognised to both invoice and cash collection, and 
performing an analytical review to challenge unexpected or unusual variances. 
We have also performed testing on the service charge expense in the year, including 
the accrual at year-end to test cut-off. 
We performed audit procedures specifically designed to address the risk of 
management override of controls including consolidation adjustments and 
journal entry testing, which included a particular focus on journal entries which 
impact revenue.
Scope of our procedures 
The Group was subject to full scope audit procedures over revenue.

In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to the accounting for the acquisition of U+I. In the current year, 
there are no such similar transactions. 

Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the 
audit and in forming our audit opinion. 

Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.

The table below sets out the materiality, performance materiality and threshold for reporting audit differences applied on our audit:

Overall

to investment properties, trading 
properties (either wholly owned or 
held within joint ventures) or loans 
and borrowing

£56m 
(2022: £55m)

£42m 
(2022: £42m)

£3m 
(2022: £3m)

When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be material 
for the financial statements as a whole. We determined that an asset-based measure would be the most appropriate basis for determining 
overall materiality given that key users of the Group’s financial statements are primarily focused on the valuation of the Group’s assets. 
Based on this, we determined that it is appropriate to set the overall materiality at 0.9% of total assets (2022: 0.9% of total assets). We applied 
overall materiality to the investment property and trading property balances, including those in joint ventures, and other directly related 
balance sheet items such as the value of loans and borrowings which are secured against the Group’s investment properties. 

This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of 
material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Financial statements126

Independent Auditor’s Report
continued

We determined that for other account balances not related to investment properties, trading properties (either wholly owned or held 
within joint ventures) or loans and borrowings, a misstatement of less than overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole 
could influence the economic decisions of users. We believe that it is most appropriate to use a profit-based measure as profit is also 
a focus of users of the financial statements.

We determined that materiality for these areas should be based upon 5% of EPRA earnings before tax. EPRA earnings is considered 
an important performance metric and aligned with industry earnings measures. 

During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality which has not resulted in a change from our planning materiality. 

Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.

On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of the respective materiality. We have set performance materiality at this percentage 
due to our past experience of the audit that indicates a lower risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected. 

Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £5m (2022: £6m), as well 
as audit differences in excess of £1m (2022: £1m) that relate to our specific testing of the other account balances not related to investment 
properties or loans and borrowings, which are set at 5% of their respective planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 

We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, including the Strategic Report and Governance section 
set out on pages 1-119, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other 
information contained within the annual report. 

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such 
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement 
in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the 
other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 • the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements and those reports have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements;

 • the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital 

structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 in the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules sourcebook made by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA Rules), is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements; and

 • information about the Company’s corporate governance statement and practices and about its administrative, management and 

supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the FCA Rules.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Financial statements127

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in:
 • the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report; or
 • the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital 

structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the FCA Rules

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 

branches not visited by us; or

 • the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 

the accounting records and returns; or

 • certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 • a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the Company.

Corporate Governance Statement
We have reviewed the Directors’ Statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the Group and Company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our 
review by the Listing Rules.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance 
Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:
 • Directors’ Statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 

uncertainties identified set out on pages 60-61 and 120;

 • Directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the Company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is 

appropriate set out on pages 60-61;

 • Director’s Statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meets its 

liabilities set out on page 120;

 • Directors’ Statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 120;
 • Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on pages 56-59;
 • The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on 

pages 54-59; and

 • The section describing the work of the Audit Committee set out on pages 88-95.

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 120, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud 
is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or 
intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including 
fraud is detailed below.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Financial statements128

Independent Auditor’s Report
continued

However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the 
Company and management. 
 • We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most 
significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK adopted international accounting standards, the Companies Act 2006 
and UK Corporate Governance Code), the relevant tax regulations in the United Kingdom, including the UK REIT regulations, the UK 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health & Safety Regulations and the Bribery Act. There are no significant industry specific 
laws or regulations that we considered in determining our approach. 

 • We understood how Land Securities Group PLC is complying with those frameworks by through enquiry with management, and by 

identifying the Group’s policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. We also identified those members of 
management who have the primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, and for reporting any known 
instances of non-compliance to those charged with governance. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and 
papers provided to the Board and the Audit Committee, as well as consideration of the results of our audit procedures across the Group 
to either corroborate or provide contrary evidence which was then followed up. Our assessment included the tone from the top and the 
emphasis on a culture of honest and ethical behaviour.

 • We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by 

reviewing the Company’s risk register and enquiry with management and the Audit Committee during the planning and execution 
phases of our audit. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that 
otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how management monitors those programmes and controls.

 • Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our 

procedures involved:
 — Enquiry of management, and when appropriate, those charged with governance regarding their knowledge of any non-compliance 

or potential non-compliance with laws and regulations that could affect the financial statements;

 — Reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;
 — Reading of internal audit reports;
 — Obtaining electronic confirmations from the Group’s banking providers to vouch the existence of cash balances and completeness 

of loans, borrowings and other treasury positions such as derivatives;

 — Obtaining and reading correspondence from legal and regulatory bodies, including the FRC and HMRC; and
 — Journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our 

understanding the business. 

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Other matters we are required to address 
 • Following the recommendation from the Audit Committee we were appointed by the Company on 18 July 2013 to audit the financial 

statements for the year ending 31 March 2014 and subsequent financial periods. 

 • The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 10 years, covering the years ending 

31 March 2014 to 31 March 2023.

 • The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2023

Section 1 – General
This section contains a description of the Group’s significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. 
A description of accounting policies specific to individual areas (e.g. investment properties) is included within the relevant note to the 
financial statements.

This section also includes a summary of new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations that have been applied in the year 
and those not yet adopted, and their actual or expected impact on the reported results of the Group.

1 › Basis of preparation and consolidation
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with UK adopted international accounting 
standards (IFRSs and IFRICs), and as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared in Pounds Sterling (rounded to the nearest one million), which 
is the presentation currency of the Group (Land Securities Group PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings), and under the historical cost 
convention as modified by the revaluation of investment property, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
(without recycling), derivative financial instruments and pension assets. As applied by the Group and the Company, there are no material 
differences between UK adopted international accounting standards and EU IFRS.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge 
of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. 

Land Securities Group PLC (the Company) has not presented its own statement of comprehensive income (and separate income 
statement), as permitted by Section 408 of Companies Act 2006. The Merger reserve arose on 6 September 2002 when the Company 
acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Land Securities PLC. The Merger reserve represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over 
the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company to acquire Land Securities PLC. The Merger reserve does not represent a realised 
or distributable profit. Other reserves includes the Capital redemption reserve, which represents the nominal value of cancelled shares, 
the Share-based payment reserve and Own shares held by the Group.

Going concern
The impact of international and domestic political and economic events over the course of the year has resulted in the UK facing a prolonged 
recessionary period and therefore the Directors have continued to place additional focus on the appropriateness of adopting the going 
concern assumption in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023. The Group’s going concern assessment considers 
changes in the Group’s principal risks (see pages 56-59) and is dependent on a number of factors, including our financial performance and 
continued access to borrowing facilities. Access to our borrowing facilities is dependent on our ability to continue to operate the Group’s 
secured debt structure within its financial covenants, which are described in note 22. 

In order to satisfy themselves that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future, the Directors 
have reviewed base case, downside and reverse stress test models, as well as a cash flow model which considers the impact of pessimistic 
assumptions on the Group’s operating environment (the ‘mitigated downside scenario’). This mitigated downside scenario reflects 
unfavourable macro-economic conditions, a deterioration in our ability to collect rent and service charge from our customers and removes 
uncommitted acquisitions, disposals and developments. 

The Group’s key metrics from the mitigated downside scenario as at the end of the going concern assessment period, which covers the 
16 months to 30 September 2024, are shown below alongside the actual position at 31 March 2023.

1 › Basis of preparation and consolidation continued
In our mitigated downside scenario, the Group has sufficient cash reserves, with our Security Group LTV ratio remaining less than 65% and 
interest cover above 1.45x, for a period of at least 16 months from the date of authorisation of these financial statements. The value of our 
assets would need to fall from 31 March 2023 values by approximately a further 50% for LTV to reach 65%. The Directors consider the 
likelihood of this occurring over the going concern assessment period to be remote. 

The Security Group requires earnings of at least £150m in the year ending 31 March 2024 for interest cover to remain above 1.45x in the 
mitigated downside scenario, which would ensure compliance with the Group’s covenant through to the end of the going concern 
assessment period. Security Group earnings are well above the level required to meet the interest cover covenant, and would need to fall 
from 31 March 2023 values by over £300m for interest cover to reach 1.45x. Therefore, the Directors do not anticipate a reduction in Security 
Group earnings over the period ending 30 September 2024 to a level that would result in a breach of the interest cover covenant. 

The Directors have also considered a reverse stress-test scenario which assumes no further rent will be received, to determine when our 
available cash resources would be exhausted. Even under this extreme scenario, although breaching the interest cover covenant, the Group 
continues to have sufficient cash reserves to continue in operation throughout the going concern assessment period.

Based on these considerations, together with available market information and the Directors’ knowledge and experience of the Group’s 
property portfolio and markets, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2023.

Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023 incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its 
subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Company. Control exists where an entity is exposed 
to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition 
or to the effective date of disposal. Accounting policies of subsidiaries and joint ventures which differ from Group accounting policies are 
adjusted on consolidation.

Where instruments in a subsidiary held by third parties are redeemable at the option of the holder, these interests are classified as a 
financial liability, called the redemption liability. The liability is carried at fair value; the value is reassessed at the balance sheet date and 
movements are recognised in the income statement.

Where equity in a subsidiary is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the shareholders of the parent, this is classified as a non-controlling 
interest. Total comprehensive income or loss and the total equity of the Group are attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the 
non-controlling interests according to their respective ownership percentages.

Joint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. Interests in 
joint arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture 
when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. 
Interests in joint ventures are equity accounted. The equity method requires the Group’s share of the joint venture’s post-tax profit or loss for 
the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group’s share of the joint venture’s net assets to be presented separately 
in the balance sheet. A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control 
of the arrangement, have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Joint operations are accounted for 
by including the Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis.

Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
joint venture concerned. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

2 › Significant accounting judgements and estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group‘s 
accounting policies. The areas where the Group considers the judgements to be most significant involve assumptions or key estimates 
in respect of future events, where actual results may differ from these estimates. These key estimates are deemed to have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Other sources of 
estimation uncertainties identified below are estimates deemed to have a lower risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

Judgements
 • Recognising revenue where property management activities are performed by a third party (note 6)
 • Compliance with the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation regime and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities (note 12)
 • Accounting for certain property acquisitions and disposals (note 14)

Key estimates
 • Valuation of investment properties (note 14)

Other sources of estimation uncertainties
 • Valuation of trading properties (note 15) 
 • Impairment of trade receivables (note 27)

In preparing the financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate change, taking into account the relevant disclosures in 
the Strategic Report, including those made in accordance with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate related Financial Disclosure. 
These considerations included the limited exposure in terms of our investment properties, as we fully costed and committed to invest £135m 
to achieve our science-based net zero target by 2030 (note this cost will fluctuate year on year to account for changes in inflation). On this 
basis, the Group has concluded that climate change did not have a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates, 
consistent with the assessment that this is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s going concern or viability assessment.

3 › Changes in accounting policies and standards 
The accounting policies used in these financial statements are consistent with those applied in the last annual financial statements, as 
amended where relevant to reflect the adoption of new standards, amendments and interpretations which became effective in the year. 

Following clarification by IFRIC on the classification of monies held in restricted accounts, monies that are restricted by use only are 
classified at 31 March 2023 as ‘Cash and cash equivalents’, whereas monies to which access is restricted remain classified as ‘Monies held 
in restricted accounts and deposits’. The comparative balances have been restated where applicable to reflect this change in classification. 
As a result, £18m of monies held in restricted accounts has been reclassified to Cash and cash equivalents in the Group balance sheet 
as at 31 March 2022 which increased the Cash and cash equivalent from £128m to £146m and decreased the restricted accounts from 
£22m to £4m. Within the Group cash flow statement for the year ended 31 March 2022, this reclassification also resulted in the overall 
net movement in Cash and cash equivalent from £128m to £136m, as well as the movements in monies held in restricted accounts being 
classified as cash flows from investing activities rather than financing activities as in prior year, based on the nature of the accounts. 
As at 1 April 2021, the total value of the reclassification is £10m which increased the Cash and cash equivalent from £nil to £10m and 
decreased the restricted accounts from £10m to £nil. This prior year restatement did not have any impact on the reported net assets, 
net current assets or net profit or loss. 

Additionally, £2m of monies held in restricted accounts has been reclassified to Cash and cash equivalents in the Company balance sheet 
as at 31 March 2022 which increased the Cash and cash equivalent from £nil to £2m and decreased the restricted accounts from £2m to 
£nil. Within the Company cash flow statement for the year ended 31 March 2022, this reclassification did not result in a net movement of 
Cash and cash equivalents. As at 1 April 2021, the total value of the reclassification is £3m which increased the Cash and cash equivalent 
from £nil to £3m and decreased the restricted accounts from £3m to £nil. This prior year restatement did not have any impact on the 
reported net assets, net current assets or net profit or loss.

There has been no material impact on the financial statements of adopting any other new standards, amendments and interpretations.

Amendments to IFRS
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective for the Group. 
The application of these new standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s 
income statement or balance sheet.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Financial statements136

Section 2 – Performance
This section focuses on the performance of the Group for the year, including segmental information, earnings per share and net assets 
per share, together with further details on specific components of the income statement and dividends paid.

Our property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and 
properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. Internally, management review the results of the 
Group on a basis that adjusts for these different forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets 
totalling £10.2bn, is an example of this approach, reflecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership 
structure. The Combined Portfolio comprises the investment properties of the Group’s subsidiaries, on a proportionately consolidated 
basis when not wholly owned, together with our share of investment properties held in our joint ventures (see note 14). We consider this 
presentation provides further understanding to stakeholders of the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results 
of all of the Group’s property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory 
financial statements.

The same principle is applied to many of the other measures we discuss and, accordingly, a number of our financial measures include the 
results of our joint ventures and subsidiaries on a proportionate basis. Measures that are described as being presented on a proportionate 
basis include the Group’s share of joint ventures on a line-by-line basis and are adjusted to exclude the non-owned elements of our 
subsidiaries. This is in contrast to the Group’s statutory financial statements, where the Group’s interest in joint ventures is presented as 
one line on the income statement and balance sheet, and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% with any non-owned element being 
adjusted as a non-controlling interest or redemption liability, as appropriate. Our joint operations are presented on a proportionate basis 
in all financial measures.

EPRA earnings is an alternative performance measure and is the Group’s alternative measure of the underlying pre-tax profit of the 
property rental business. EPRA earnings excludes all items of a capital nature, such as valuation movements and profits and losses on the 
disposal of investment properties, as well as exceptional items. The Group believes that EPRA earnings provides additional understanding 
of the Group’s operational performance to shareholders and other stakeholder groups. A full definition of EPRA earnings is given in the 
Glossary. The components of EPRA earnings are presented on a proportionate basis in note 4. 

Our income statement has two key components: the income we generate from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs 
(including interest expense), which we refer to as EPRA earnings, and items not directly related to the underlying rental business, principally 
valuation changes, profits or losses on the disposal of properties, refinancing activity and exceptional items, which we refer to as Capital 
and other items. Our income statement is presented in a columnar format, split into those items that relate to EPRA earnings and Capital 
and other items. The total column represents the Group’s results presented in accordance with IFRS; the other columns provide additional 
information. We believe EPRA earnings provides further understanding of the results of the Group’s operational performance to 
stakeholders as it focuses on the rental income performance of the business and excludes Capital and other items which can vary 
significantly from year to year. 

4 › Segmental information
The Group’s operations are all in the UK and are managed across four operating segments, being Central London, Major retail destinations 
(Major retail), Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods (Mixed-use urban) and Subscale sectors. 

The Central London segment includes all assets geographically located within central London. Major retail destinations includes all regional 
shopping centres and shops outside London and our outlets. The Mixed-use urban segment includes those assets where we see the most 
potential for capital investment. Subscale sectors mainly includes assets that will not be a focus for capital investment and consists of leisure 
and hotel assets and retail parks. There has been no change to the classification of these segments during the year to 31 March 2023.

Management has determined the Group’s operating segments based on the information reviewed by Senior Management to make 
strategic decisions. The chief operating decision maker is the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), comprising the Executive Directors and 
the Managing Directors. The information presented to ELT includes reports from all functions of the business as well as strategy, financial 
planning, succession planning, organisational development and Group-wide policies.

The Group’s primary measure of underlying profit before tax is EPRA earnings. However, Segment net rental income is the lowest level to which 
the profit arising from the ongoing operations of the Group is analysed between the four segments. The administrative costs, which are 
predominantly staff costs for centralised functions, are all treated as administrative expenses and are not allocated to individual segments. 

Notes to the financial statementsfor the year ended 31 March 2023 continuedLandsec Annual Report 2023Financial statements137

The Group manages its financing structure, with the exception of joint ventures, on a pooled basis. Individual joint ventures may have 
specific financing arrangements in place. Debt facilities and finance expenses, including those of joint ventures, are managed centrally and 
are therefore not attributed to a particular segment. Unallocated income and expenses are items incurred centrally which are not directly 
attributable to one of the segments.

All items in the segmental information note are presented on a proportionate basis.

1. Reallocation of the share of post-tax loss from joint ventures reported in the Group income statement to the individual line items reported in the segmental results table.
2. Removal of the non-wholly owned share of results of the Group’s subsidiaries. The non-wholly owned subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% in the Group’s income statement, 

but only the Group’s share is included in EPRA earnings reported in the segmental results table. The non-owned element of the Group’s subsidiaries are included in the 
‘Capital and other items’ column presented in the Group’s income statement, together with items not directly related to the underlying rental business such as investment 
properties valuation changes, profits or losses on the disposal of investment properties, the proceeds from, and costs of, the sale of trading properties, income from and costs 
associated with development contracts, amortisation and impairment of intangibles, and other attributable costs, arising on business combinations.

3. Included in the loss on disposal of investment properties is a £9m charge related to the provision for fire safety remediation works on properties no longer owned by the Group 

but for which the Group is responsible for remediating under the Building Safety Act 2022.

5 › Performance measures
In the tables below, we present earnings per share attributable to shareholders of the parent, calculated in accordance with IFRS, and 
net assets per share attributable to shareholders of the parent together with certain measures defined by the European Public Real Estate 
Association (EPRA), which have been included to assist comparison between European property companies. Three of the Group’s key 
financial performance measures are EPRA earnings per share, EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share and total return on equity, which was 
previously referred to as total accounting return. There has been no change to the calculation of this measure other than the change of 
name during the year to 31 March 2023. Refer to Table 70 in the Business Analysis section for further details on these alternative 
performance measures.

EPRA earnings, which is a tax adjusted measure of underlying earnings, is the basis for the calculation of EPRA earnings per share. 
We believe EPRA earnings and EPRA earnings per share provide further insight into the results of the Group’s operational performance 
to stakeholders as they focus on the rental income performance of the business and exclude Capital and other items which can vary 
significantly from year to year.

Total return on equity is calculated as the cash dividends per share paid in the year plus the change in EPRA NTA per share, divided by the 
opening EPRA NTA per share. We consider this to be a useful measure for shareholders as it gives an indication of the total return on equity 
over the year.

Rental income, including fixed rental uplifts, is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives being offered to occupiers to enter into a lease, such as an initial rent-free period or a cash contribution to fit out or similar 
costs, are an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore recognised on the same straight-line 
basis. Where the total consideration due under a lease is modified, for example, where a concession is granted to a tenant prior to the date 
the conceded rent falls due, the revised total amount due under the lease is recognised on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of 
the lease. 

Contingent rents, being lease payments that are not fixed at the inception of a lease, for example turnover rents, are variable consideration 
and are recorded as income in the year in which they are earned. Where a single payment is received from a tenant to cover both rent and 
service charge, the service charge component is separated and reported as service charge income.

The Group’s revenue from contracts with customers, as defined in IFRS 15, includes service charge income, other property related income, 
trading property sales proceeds and development contract income.

Service charge income and management fees are recorded as income over time in the year in which the services are rendered. Revenue is 
recognised over time because the tenants benefit from the services as soon as they are rendered by the Group. The actual service provided 
during each reporting period is determined using cost incurred as the input method.

Other property related income includes development and asset management fees. These fees are recognised over time, using time elapsed 
as the input method which measures the benefit simultaneously received and consumed by the customer, over the period the development 
or asset management services are provided.

Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised when control of the property transfers to the buyer, i.e. the buyer 
has the ability to direct the use of the property and the right to the cash inflows and outflows generated by it. This generally occurs on 
unconditional exchange or on completion. If completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange or if the Group has significant 
outstanding obligations between exchange and completion, the Group assesses whether there are multiple performance obligations in 
the contract and recognises revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.

Notes to the financial statementsfor the year ended 31 March 2023 continuedLandsec Annual Report 2023Financial statements141

When property is let under a finance lease, the Group recognises a receivable equal to the net investment in the lease at inception of the 
lease. Rentals received are accounted for as repayments of principal and finance income as appropriate. Finance income is allocated to 
each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining net investment in the finance 
lease and is recognised within revenue.

Revenue on development contracts is recognised over time over the period of the contract as the Group creates or enhances an asset that 
the customer controls. Progress towards completion of the development, by reference to the value of work completed using the costs incurred 
to date as a proportion of total costs expected to be incurred over the term of the contract is used as the input method.

S  Significant accounting judgement

For those properties where the property management activities are performed by a third party, the Group considers the third party to be the 
principal delivering the service. The key factors considered by the Group when making this judgement include the following responsibilities of 
the third party:
 • selecting suppliers and ensuring all services are delivered
 • establishing prices and seeking efficiencies
 • risk management and compliance

In addition, the residual rights residing with the Group are generally protective in nature.

All revenue is classified within the ‘EPRA earnings’ column of the income statement, with the exception of proceeds from the sale of trading 
properties, income from development contracts and the non-owned element of the Group’s subsidiaries which are presented in the 
‘Capital and other items’ column.

7 › Costs

A   Accounting policy

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than investment properties, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use is determined as 
the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount after the reversal does not exceed the amount that would have been determined, net of applicable depreciation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.

Rents payable reflect amounts due under head leases. Where rents payable are variable, and do not depend on an index or rate, the 
payments are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Where these rents are fixed, or in-substance fixed, at the inception of the 
agreement, or become fixed or in-substance fixed at some point over the life of the agreement, an asset representing the right to use the 
underlying land and a corresponding liability for the present value of the minimum future lease payments are recognised on the Group’s 
balance sheet within Investment properties and borrowings respectively.

All costs are classified within the ‘EPRA earnings’ column of the income statement, with the exception of the cost of sale of trading 
properties, costs arising on development contracts, amortisation and impairments of intangible assets, and other attributable costs, 
arising on business combinations and the non-owned element of the Group’s subsidiaries which are presented in the ‘Capital and other 
items’ column.

11 › Dividends continued
The third quarterly interim dividend of 9.0p per ordinary share, or £67m in total (2022: 8.5p or £63m in total), was paid on 6 April 2023 as 
a Property Income Distribution (PID). The Board has recommended a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2023 of 12.0p per ordinary 
share (2022: 13.0p) to be paid as a PID. This final dividend will result in a further estimated distribution of £90m (2022: £96m). Subject to 
shareholders’ approval at the Annual General Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 21 July 2023 to shareholders registered at the close 
of business on 16 June 2023. 

The total dividend paid and recommended in respect of the year ended 31 March 2023 is 38.6p per ordinary share (2022: 37.0p) resulting 
in a total estimated distribution of £288m (2022: £274m). 

The first quarterly dividend for the year ending 31 March 2024 will be paid in October 2023 and will be announced in due course.

A Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) has been available in respect of all dividends paid during the year. The last day for DRIP elections 
for the final dividend is close of business on 30 June 2023.

12 › Income tax

A   Accounting policy

Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income 
for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method on 
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date 
and are expected to apply when the asset is realised, or the liability is settled.

No provision is made for temporary differences (i) arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than on a business combination, 
that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and (ii) relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.

S  Significant accounting judgement

The Group is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). As a result, the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on its profits and gains from 
the qualifying rental business in the UK. Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal. 
In order to maintain group REIT status, certain ongoing criteria must be met. The main criteria are as follows:
 • at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Group’s assets;
 • at least 75% of the Group’s total profits must arise from the tax exempt business; and
 • at least 90% of the notional taxable profit of the property rental business must be distributed.

The Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer 
recognised on temporary differences relating to the property rental business.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts, if any, to be recognised. In particular, 
judgement is required when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, taking into account the expected 
timing and level of future taxable income. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when management believes it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

There is no income tax charge in the income statement (2022: none). There is a deferred tax credit of £3m (2022: £5m charge) included 
within Other comprehensive income.

Section 3 – Properties
This section focuses on the property assets which form the core of the Group’s business. It includes details of investment properties, 
investments in joint ventures and trading properties.

Our property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and 
properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. In the Group’s IFRS balance sheet, wholly owned 
properties and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest are presented as either ‘Investment 
properties’ or ‘Trading properties’. The Group applies equity accounting to its investments in joint ventures, which requires the Group’s 
share of properties held by joint ventures to be presented within ‘Investments in joint ventures’.

Internally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these forms of ownership to present a proportionate 
share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling £10.2bn, is an example of this proportionate share, reflecting the economic interest 
we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure. We consider this presentation provides further insight to stakeholders 
about the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Group’s property interests which under IFRS 
are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory financial statements.

The Group’s investment properties are carried at fair value and trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Both of these values are determined by the Group’s external valuers. The combined value of the Group’s total investment property portfolio 
(including the Group’s share of investment properties held through joint ventures) is shown as a reconciliation in note 14.

A   Accounting policy

Investment properties
Investment properties are properties, either owned or leased by the Group, that are held either to earn rental income or for capital 
appreciation, or both. Investment properties are measured initially at cost including related transaction costs, and subsequently at fair 
value. Fair value is based on market value, as determined by a professional external valuer at each reporting date. The difference between 
the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included in the income 
statement as a valuation surplus or deficit. Investment properties are presented on the balance sheet within non-current assets.

Some of the Group’s investment properties are owned through long-leasehold arrangements, as opposed to the Group owning the freehold. 
Where the Group is a lessee, a right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of the lease and accounted for as investment 
property. Initially, the cost of investment properties held under leases includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs 
incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The investment properties held 
under leases are subsequently carried at their fair value. A corresponding liability is recorded within borrowings. Each lease payment is 
allocated between repayment of the liability and a finance charge to achieve a constant interest rate on the outstanding liability.

Trading properties
Trading properties are those properties held for sale, or those being developed with a view to sell. Trading properties are recorded at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value of a trading property is determined by a professional external valuer at 
each reporting date. If the net realisable value of a trading property is lower than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the 
income statement. If, in subsequent periods, the net realisable value of a trading property that was previously impaired increases above its 
carrying value, the impairment is reversed to align the carrying value of the property with the net realisable value. Trading properties are 
presented on the balance sheet within current assets.

Acquisition of properties
Properties are treated as acquired when the Group assumes control of the property. 

Capital expenditure and capitalisation of borrowing costs
Capital expenditure on properties consists of costs of a capital nature, including costs associated with developments and refurbishments. 
Where a property is being developed or undergoing major refurbishment, interest costs associated with direct expenditure on the property 
are capitalised. The interest capitalised is calculated using the Group’s weighted average cost of borrowings. Interest is capitalised from 
the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion. Certain internal staff and associated costs directly 
attributable to the management of major schemes are also capitalised. The total staff and associated costs are capitalised based on the 
proportion of time spent on the relevant scheme. Internal staff costs are capitalised from the date the Group determines it is probable that 
the development will progress until the date of practical completion.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Financial statements150

Transfers between investment properties and trading properties
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property 
continues to be held as an investment property. When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sell, 
the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset. The property is re-measured to fair value as at the date of 
the transfer with any gain or loss being taken to the income statement. The re-measured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the 
property is then carried in trading properties.

Disposal of properties
Properties are treated as disposed when control of the property is transferred to the buyer. Typically, this will either occur on unconditional 
exchange or on completion. Where completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange, or where the Group continues to have 
significant outstanding obligations after exchange, the control will not usually transfer to the buyer until completion. 

The profit on disposal is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the beginning 
of the accounting period plus capital expenditure to the date of disposal. The profit on disposal of investment properties is presented 
separately on the face of the income statement. Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised within Revenue, and 
the carrying value at the date of disposal is recognised within Costs.

S  Significant accounting judgement

Acquisition and disposal of properties
Property transactions can be complex in nature and material to the financial statements. To determine when an acquisition or disposal 
should be recognised, management consider whether the Group assumes or relinquishes control of the property, and the point at which 
this is obtained or relinquished. Consideration is given to the terms of the acquisition or disposal contracts and any conditions that must 
be satisfied before the contract is fulfilled. In the case of an acquisition, management must also consider whether the transaction 
represents an asset acquisition or business combination. 

Key accounting estimates and other sources of estimation uncertainty
Valuation of the Group’s properties
The valuation of the Group’s property portfolio has been undertaken by independent valuers in accordance with the Royal Institution 
of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation – Global Standards and UK Supplement (together the “Red Book”). Real estate by its nature is 
a complex asset class with value determined by a range of factors overlaid by interpretation and judgemental assessment of market data; 
as such it is classified as a ‘Level 3 asset’ within IFRS. Factors affecting valuation are on an individual property level and include the 
property type, location, tenure and tenancy characteristics, quality of the asset and prospects for future rental revenue. 

The Group’s investment property valuation has been undertaken by valuers interpreting market evidence as available in reaching their 
conclusions on fair value, reflecting asset specific data provided by management, making assumptions that tenure, tenancies, town 
planning and condition of buildings are as provided. As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to 
a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility 
or low transaction volume in the property market. 

The estimation of the net realisable value of the Group’s trading properties, in particular the development land and infrastructure 
programmes, is inherently subjective due to a number of factors, including their complexity, unusually large size, the substantial 
expenditure required and long timescales to completion. In addition, as a result of these timescales to completion, the plans associated 
with these programmes could be subject to significant market variation over the course of development. As a result, and similar to the 
valuation of investment properties, the net realisable values of the Group’s trading properties are subject to a degree of uncertainty and 
are determined on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate.

If the assumptions upon which the external valuer has based its valuations prove to be inaccurate, this may have an impact on the value 
of the Group’s investment and trading properties, which could in turn have an effect on the Group’s financial position and results.

1. Refer to note 14 for a breakdown of this amount by entity.

The net book value of leasehold properties where head leases have been capitalised is £1,723m (2022: £2,908m).

Investment properties include capitalised interest of £271m (2022: £249m). The average rate of interest capitalisation for the year is 3.0% 
(2022: 2.5%). The gross historical cost of investment properties is £8,280m (2022: £8,604m). 

Valuation process
The fair value of investment properties at 31 March 2023 was determined by the Group’s external valuers, CBRE and JLL. The valuations are 
in accordance with RICS standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of transactions for similar properties. The valuations 
performed by the valuers are reviewed internally by Senior Management and other relevant people within the business. This process includes 
discussions of the assumptions used by the valuers, as well as a review of the resulting valuations. Discussions of the valuation process and 
results are held between Senior Management, the Audit Committee and the valuers on a half-yearly basis.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Financial statements152

14 › Investment properties continued
The valuers’ opinion of fair value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arm’s length terms and using 
appropriate valuation techniques. The fair value of investment properties is determined using the income capitalisation approach. 
Under this approach, forecast net cash flows, based upon current market derived estimated rental values (market rents) together with 
estimated costs, are discounted at market derived capitalisation rates to produce the valuers’ opinion of fair value. The average discount 
rate, which, if applied to all cash flows would produce the fair value, is described as the equivalent yield. 

Properties in the development programme are typically valued using a residual valuation method. Under this methodology, the valuer 
assesses the completed development value using income and yield assumptions. Deductions are then made for estimated costs to 
complete, including finance and developer’s profit, to arrive at the valuation. Costs include future estimated costs associated with 
refurbishment or development (excluding finance costs), together with an estimate of cash incentives to be paid to tenants. As the 
development approaches completion, the valuer may consider the income capitalisation approach to be more appropriate.

The Group considers all of its investment properties to fall within ‘Level 3’, as defined by IFRS 13 and as explained in note 26(iii). 
Accordingly, there have been no transfers of properties within the fair value hierarchy in the financial year.

16 › Joint arrangements

A   Accounting policy

Joint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. Interests 
in joint arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. The treatment as either a joint venture or a joint 
operation will depend on whether the Group has rights to the net assets, or a direct interest in the assets and liabilities of the arrangement.

A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the 
arrangement, has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method 
of accounting. The equity method requires the Group’s share of the joint venture’s post-tax profit or loss for the year to be presented 
separately in the income statement and the Group’s share of the joint venture’s net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet. 
Where a joint venture is in a net liability position, the Group’s share of accumulated losses of a joint venture interest are recognised as net 
liabilities where there is an obligation to provide for these losses.

A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the 
arrangement, has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. The Group’s share of jointly controlled 
assets, related liabilities, income and expenses are combined with the equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis.

The Group’s principal joint arrangements are described below:

1. Refer to Additional information pages 205-209 for the full list of the Group’s related undertakings.
2. Investments under joint arrangements are not always represented by an equal percentage holding by each partner. In a number of joint ventures that are not considered 
principal joint ventures and therefore not included in the table above, the Group holds a majority shareholding but has joint control and therefore the arrangement is 
accounted for as a joint venture. 

3. The year end date shown is the accounting reference date of the joint arrangement. In all cases, the Group’s accounting is performed using financial information for the 

Group’s own reporting year and reporting date.

4. During the year to 31 March 2023, Wind Farms are no longer classified as a joint venture and are consolidated together with other subsidiary undertakings. Wind Farms 

includes DS Renewables LLP, Hendy Wind Farm Limited and Rhoscrowther Wind Farm Limited.

5. On 24 March 2023 the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in St David’s Limited Partnership. From that date, the results of the operations from St David’s 

are consolidated together with other subsidiary undertakings. Results from its operations prior to that date are included as share of profit or loss from joint ventures. 
For further details on the acquisition refer to note 14. 

6. Nova, Victoria includes the Nova Limited Partnership, Nova Residential Limited Partnership, Nova GP Limited, Nova Business Manager Limited, Nova Residential (GP) Limited, 

Nova Residential Intermediate Limited, Nova Estate Management Company Limited, Nova Nominee 1 Limited and Nova Nominee 2 Limited.

17 › Investments in associates

A   Accounting policy

Associates are those entities over whose financial and operating policy decisions the Group has significant influence, established by 
contractual agreement, but over which the Group does not have control or joint control over those policies. Interests in associates are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The equity method requires the Group’s share of the associate’s post-tax profit or 
loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group’s share of the associate’s net assets to be presented 
separately in the balance sheet. 

The Group’s principal interests in associates, acquired as part of the purchase of the share capital of U+I Group PLC in the prior year, are 
described below:

19 › Net investment in finance leases

A   Accounting policy

Where the Group’s leases transfer the significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the tenant, the lease 
is accounted for as a finance lease. At the outset of the lease the fair value of the asset is de-recognised from investment property and 
recognised as a finance lease receivable. The finance lease receivable is derecognised in the event that the lease is terminated. Lease income 
is recognised over the period of the lease, reflecting a constant rate of return. The difference between the gross receivable and the present 
value of the receivable is recognised as finance income within Revenue over the lease term.

The Group has leased out several investment properties under finance leases, which range from 20 to 40 years in duration from the 
inception of the lease. During the year to 31 March 2023, the surrender of a tenant lease resulted in the derecognition of the related net 
investment in finance lease of £50m.

20 › Intangible assets

A   Accounting policy

Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets arising on business combinations and software used internally within the 
business. Intangible assets arising on business combinations are initially recognised at fair value. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested 
at least annually for impairment. Other intangible assets arising on business combinations are amortised to the income statement over 
their expected useful lives. Software assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful economic lives, normally three to five years.

The other intangible asset relates to the Group’s acquisition of its interest in Bluewater, Kent in 2014 and represents the estimated fair value 
of the management rights for the centre. The fair value at the date of acquisition was £30m and the asset is being amortised over a period 
of 20 years. On recognition of the intangible asset, the Group recognised a deferred tax liability of £6m, and corresponding goodwill of the 
same amount. The deferred tax liability is being released to the income statement as the intangible asset is amortised or impaired, and the 
corresponding element of the goodwill is being tested for impairment.

In the year ended 31 March 2023, the intangible asset has been impaired by £nil (2022: £nil). The recoverable amount of the intangible asset 
has been based on its value in use, using a discount rate of 7.0% (2022: 4.0%).

Section 4 – Capital structure and financing
This section focuses on the Group’s financing structure, including borrowings and financial risk management.

The total capital of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity and net debt. The Group’s strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt 
to total equity ratio (gearing) and loan-to-value ratio (LTV) to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns 
for shareholders while maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles. 
The table in note 21 details a number of the Group’s key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure.

A key element of the Group’s capital structure is that the majority of our borrowings are secured against a large pool of our assets 
(the Security Group). This enables us to raise long-term debt in the bond market, as well as shorter-term flexible bank facilities, both 
at competitive rates. In general, we follow a secured debt strategy as we believe this gives the Group better access to borrowings at 
a lower cost. 

In addition, the Group holds a number of assets outside the Security Group structure (in the Non-restricted Group). By having both the 
Security Group and the Non-restricted Group, and considerable flexibility to move assets between the two, we are able to raise the most 
appropriate finance for each specific asset or joint venture.

1. EPRA LTV is a new measure introduced by EPRA in the current year. The EPRA measure differs from the Group LTV as it includes net payables and receivables, and includes 

trading properties at fair value and debt instruments at nominal value rather than book value. EPRA LTV was not presented in the financial statements as at 31 March 2022 
as the measure had not yet been introduced. EPRA LTV would have been presented as 35.5% at 31 March 2022.

2. The weighted average cost of debt is calculated based on historical average rates of gross debt for the period. The weighted average cost of debt as at 31 March 2022 has 

been restated to reflect average rates of gross debt for the period, rather than average rates of net debt used in the calculation in previous periods.

3. Cash and cash equivalents and monies held in restricted accounts and deposits have been restated as at 31 March 2022 following a clarification by IFRIC on classification 

of funds with externally imposed restrictions. There was no impact on computed net debt, adjusted net debt, gearing, adjusted gearing, Group LTV and Security Group LTV.

22 › Borrowings

A   Accounting policy

Borrowings, other than bank overdrafts, are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption 
value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest method.

When debt refinancing exercises are carried out, existing liabilities will be treated as being extinguished when the new liability is substantially 
different from the existing liability. In making this assessment, the Group will consider the transaction as a whole, taking into account both 
qualitative and quantitative characteristics.

Medium term notes 
The MTNs are secured on the fixed and floating pool of assets of the Security Group. The Security Group includes investment properties, 
development properties, the X-Leisure fund, and the Group’s investment in Westgate Oxford Alliance Limited Partnership, Nova, Victoria and 
Southside Limited Partnership, in total valued at £9.6bn at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: £11.2bn). The secured debt structure has a tiered 
operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial flexibility when the loan-to-value and interest cover in the Security Group are 
less than 65% and more than 1.45x respectively. If these limits are exceeded, the operating environment becomes more restrictive with 
provisions to encourage a reduction in gearing. The interest rate of each MTN is fixed until the expected maturity, being two years before the 
legal maturity date of the MTN. The interest rate for the last two years may either become floating on a SONIA basis plus an increased margin 
(relative to that at the time of issue), or subject to a fixed coupon uplift, depending on the terms and conditions of the specific notes. 

The effective interest rate is based on the coupon paid and includes the amortisation of issue costs. The MTNs are listed on the Irish Stock 
Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices. 

During the year, the Group did not purchase any MTNs (2022: none).

At 31 March 2023, the Group’s committed facilities totalled £3,007m (31 March 2022: £3,022m).

All syndicated and bilateral facilities are committed and secured on the assets of the Security Group, with the exception of facilities 
secured on the assets at MediaCity (of which £292m was drawn at 31 March 2023 and £294m drawn at 31 March 2022). During the year 
ended 31 March 2023, the amounts drawn under the Group’s facilities decreased by £1,177m.

The terms of the Security Group funding arrangements require undrawn facilities to be reserved where syndicated and bilateral facilities 
mature within one year, or when commercial paper is issued. The total amount of cash and available undrawn facilities, net of commercial 
paper, at 31 March 2023 was £2,353m (31 March 2022: £1,109m, restated following the IFRIC clarification on the classification of funds with 
externally imposed restrictions during the year).

cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are 
deducted from cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

25 › Derivative financial instruments

A   Accounting policy

The Group uses interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps and forwards to manage its market risk. In accordance with its treasury policy, 
the Group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.

All derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps is based on 
counterparty or market quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms 
and maturity of each contract and using market rates for similar instruments at the measurement date. The gain or loss on derivatives are 
recognised immediately in the income statement, within net finance expense.

26 › Financial risk management
Introduction
A review of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in ’Managing risk’ and ’Our principal 
risks and uncertainties’ (pages 54 to 59). This note provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative 
information on specific financial risks.

The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risks (principally interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s 
overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects of these on the Group’s financial performance and 
includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.

Financial risk management is carried out by the Group’s treasury function under policies approved by the Board of Directors, except where 
the relevant arrangements have been put in place by an individual subsidiary or a joint venture level prior to acquisition.

The Group assesses whether it intends to hold its financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows, or whether it intends to sell them 
before maturity and classifies its financial instruments into the appropriate categories. The following table summarises the Group’s 
financial assets and liabilities into the categories required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures:

1. Cash and cash equivalents and monies held in restricted accounts and deposits, and the impacted categories in the table above, have been restated as at 31 March 2022 

following a clarification by IFRIC on classification of funds with externally imposed restrictions.

Financial risk factors
(i) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, net investment in finance leases and 
amounts due from joint ventures. Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that specifically relates 
to each type of asset.

Bank and financial institutions
The principal credit risks of the Group arise from financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions. In line 
with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, where the Group manages the deposit, only independently rated banks and financial 
institutions with a minimum rating of A- are accepted. For UK banks and financial institutions with which the Group has a committed 
lending relationship, the minimum rating is lowered to BBB+. The Group’s treasury function currently performs regular reviews of the credit 
ratings of all financial institution counterparties. Furthermore, the treasury function ensures that funds deposited with a single financial 
institution remain within the Group’s policy limits.

Trade receivables
Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables. The Group assesses on a forward-looking 
basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade receivables. A provision for impairment is made for the lifetime expected credit 
losses on initial recognition of the receivable. In determining the expected credit losses the Group takes into account any recent payment 
behaviours and future expectations of likely default events (i.e. not making payment on the due date) based on individual customer credit 
ratings, actual or expected insolvency filings or company voluntary arrangements, likely deferrals of payments due, agreed rent concessions 
and market expectations and trends in the wider macro-economic environment in which our customers operate. These assessments are 
made on a customer by customer basis.

To limit the Group’s exposure to credit risk on trade receivables, a credit report is usually obtained from an independent rating agency 
prior to the inception of a lease with a new counterparty. This report, alongside the Group’s internal assessment of credit risk, is used to 
determine the size of the deposit that is required, if any, from the tenant at inception. In general, these deposits represent between three 
and six months’ rent.

26 › Financial risk management continued
Net investment in finance leases 
This balance relates to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant finance leases. This is not considered a significant credit risk 
as the tenants are generally of good financial standing.

(ii) Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of notes with final maturities between 2025 and 2059, commercial paper and medium-term 
committed bank facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for its operations and its committed 
capital expenditure programme.

a clarification by IFRIC on classification of funds with externally imposed restrictions.

The Group’s core financing structure is in the Security Group, although the Non-restricted Group may also secure independent funding.

Security Group
The Group’s principal financing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets (the Security Group) that 
comprises the majority of the Group’s investment property portfolio and certain investments in joint ventures. These arrangements 
operate in ‘tiers’ determined by LTV and interest cover ratio (ICR). This structure is most flexible at lower tiers (with a lower LTV and a 
higher ICR) and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom. In higher tiers, the requirements 
become more prescriptive. No financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0x.

As at 31 March 2023, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 33.0% (2022: 36.4%), meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 
and benefited from maximum operational flexibility.

Management monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis or semi-annual basis, depending on the 
covenant, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.

Non-restricted Group
The Non-restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity 
and external bank debt. Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-restricted Group and joint ventures, 
usually on a limited-recourse basis.

(iii) Market risk
The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, availability of credit and foreign exchange movements.

Interest rates
The Group uses derivative products to manage its interest rate exposure and has a hedging policy that generally requires at least 70% 
of its existing debt plus increases in debt associated with net committed capital expenditure to be at fixed interest rates for the coming 
three years and at least 50% for years four and five. Due to a combination of factors, including the degree of certainty required under 
IFRS 9 Financial instruments, the Group does not apply hedge accounting to hedging instruments used in this context. Specific interest-rate 
hedges are also used from time to time to fix the interest rate exposure on our debt. Where specific hedges are used to fix the interest 
exposure on floating rate debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting.

At 31 March 2023, the Group (including the Group’s share of joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries) had pay-fixed and receive-
floating interest-rate swaps in place with a nominal value of £619m (2022: £619m) and forward starting pay-fixed interest-rate swaps of 
£940m (2022: £275m). The Group’s net debt (including the Group’s share of joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries) was 100.6% 
fixed (2022: 70.0%) and based on the Group’s debt balances at 31 March 2023, a 1% increase/(decrease) in interest rates would increase/
(decrease) the annual net finance expense in the income statement and reduce/(increase) equity by £1m (2022: £9m). The sensitivity has 
been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the floating rate components of borrowings, interest rate swaps as well as cash 
and cash equivalents.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Financial statements172

26 › Financial risk management continued
Foreign exchange
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that 
is not the Group’s functional currency.

As it is UK based, the Group’s foreign exchange risk is low. The vast majority of the Group’s foreign currency transactions relate to foreign 
currency borrowing under the Group’s commercial paper programme. It is the Group’s policy to hedge 100% of this exposure. At 31 March 
2023, the Group had issued €190m (2022: €255m) and $180m (2022: $185m) of commercial paper, fully hedged through foreign exchange 
swaps. A 10% weakening or strengthening of Sterling would therefore have £nil (2022: £nil) impact in the income statement and equity 
arising from foreign currency borrowings.

Where additional foreign exchange risk is identified (not linked to commercial paper borrowing), it is the Group’s policy to assess the 
likelihood of the risk crystallising and if deemed appropriate use derivatives to hedge some or all of the risk. At 31 March 2023, the Group 
had no foreign currency exposures being managed using foreign currency derivative contracts (2022: €6m exposure, which were entered 
into in order to economically hedge our exposure to movements in foreign currencies). A 10% weakening or strengthening of Sterling would 
therefore have no impact on the profit before tax and/or total equity (2022: £1m impact).

Valuation hierarchy
Derivative financial instruments and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (other investments) are the only 
financial instruments which are carried at fair value. For financial instruments other than borrowings disclosed in note 22, the carrying 
value in the balance sheet approximates their fair values. The table below shows the aggregate assets and liabilities carried at fair value 
by valuation method:

Note:
Level 1: valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2: valued using techniques based on information that can be obtained from observable market data.
Level 3: valued using techniques incorporating information other than observable market data.

The fair value of the amounts payable under the Group’s lease obligations, using a discount rate of 2.7% (31 March 2022: 2.2%), is £145m 
(31 March 2022: £164m). The fair value of the Group’s net investment in tenant finance leases, calculated by the Group’s external valuer 
by applying a weighted average equivalent yield of 7.9% (31 March 2022: 4.9%), is £16m (31 March 2022: £66m).

The fair values of any floating rate financial liabilities are assumed to be equal to their nominal value. The fair values of the MTNs fall within 
Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, the syndicated and bilateral facilities, commercial paper, interest-rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps 
fall within Level 2, and the amounts payable and receivable under leases fall within Level 3. 

The fair values of the financial instruments have been determined by reference to relevant market prices, where available. The fair values 
of the Group’s outstanding interest-rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate 
market discount rates. These valuation techniques fall within Level 2.

The fair value of the other investments is calculated by reference to the net assets of the underlying entity. The valuation is not based on 
observable market data and therefore the other investments are considered to fall within Level 3.

Section 5 – Working capital
This section focuses on our working capital balances, including trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and provisions.

27 › Trade and other receivables

A   Accounting policy

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, subsequently at amortised cost and, where relevant, adjusted for the time 
value of money. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade receivables. A provision 
for impairment is made for the lifetime expected credit losses on initial recognition of the receivable. If collection is expected in more than 
one year, the balance is presented within non-current assets.

In determining the expected credit losses the Group takes into account any recent payment behaviours and future expectations of likely 
default events (i.e. not making payment on the due date) based on individual customer credit ratings, actual or expected insolvency 
filings or company voluntary arrangements and market expectations and trends in the wider macro-economic environment in which 
our customers operate. Where a concession is agreed with a customer after the due date for the rent, this amount is recognised as an 
impairment of the related trade receivable.

Trade and other receivables are written off once all avenues to recover the balances are exhausted and the lease has ended. Receivables 
written off are no longer subject to any enforcement activity. 

S  Source of estimation uncertainty

Impairment of trade receivables
The Group’s assessment of expected credit losses is inherently subjective due to the forward-looking nature of the assessments. As a result, 
the value of the provisions for impairment of the Group’s trade receivables are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the 
basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate. See note 26 for further details of the Group’s assessment of the credit risk 
associated with trade receivables.

The accounting for lease incentives is set out in note 6. The value of the tenant lease incentive, included in current trade and other 
receivables, is spread over the lease term.

The non-current amounts due from joint ventures have maturity dates ranging from April 2028 to the dissolution of the joint venture. 
Interest is charged at rates ranging from 4% to 5% (2022: 4% to 5%).

Capital accruals represent amounts due for work completed on investment properties but not paid for at the year end. Deferred income principally 
relates to rents received in advance.

The Loans from Group undertakings are repayable on demand with no fixed repayment date. Interest is charged at 4.3% per annum (2022: 3.7%).

Section 6 – Other required disclosures
This section gives further disclosure in respect of other areas of the financial statements, together with mandatory disclosures required 
in accordance with IFRS.

29 › Investments in subsidiary undertakings 

A   Accounting policy

Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost in the Company’s balance sheet, less any provision for impairment in value.

In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments the equity settled share-based payment charge for the employees of the Company’s 
subsidiaries is treated as an increase in the cost of investment in the subsidiaries, with a corresponding increase in the Company’s equity.

34 › Net pension surplus

A   Accounting policy

Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.

The pension obligations arising under the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme are measured at discounted present value. The scheme 
assets are measured at fair value, except annuities which are valued to match the liability or benefit value. The operating and financing 
costs of the scheme are recognised separately in the income statement. Service costs are spread using the projected unit credit method. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement in the period in which they are identified. Net financing costs are 
recognised in the period in which they arise, calculated with reference to the discount rate, and are included in finance income or expense 
on a net basis. Re-measurement gains and losses arising from either experience differing from previous actuarial assumptions, or changes 
to those assumptions, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.

Defined contribution schemes
The charge to operating profit for the year in respect of defined contribution schemes was £3m (2022: £3m).

Defined benefit scheme
The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies (the Scheme) is a registered defined benefit final salary 
scheme subject to the UK regulatory framework for pensions, including the Scheme Specific Funding requirements. The Scheme is operated 
under trust and as such, the Trustees of the Scheme are responsible for operating the Scheme and they have a statutory responsibility to 
act in accordance with the Scheme’s Trust Deed and Rules, in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the Scheme and UK legislation 
(including trust law). The Trustees and the Group have the joint power to set the contributions that are paid to the Scheme.

In setting contributions to the Scheme, the Trustees and the Group are guided by the advice of a qualified independent actuary on the 
basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method. The Scheme is closed to new members (and was closed to future 
accrual on 31 October 2019). A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2021 by the independent actuaries, 
Hymans Robertson LLP. This valuation was updated to 31 March 2023 using, where required, assumptions prescribed by IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits. The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2024.

There have been no employer or employee contributions following the closure of the Scheme to future accrual on 31 October 2019. Prior to 
this, the employer contribution rate was 43.1% of pensionable salary to cover the costs of accruing benefits and the employee contributions 
were at 8% of monthly pensionable salary. It was also agreed that no further deficit contributions were required from the Group. Employee 
contributions were paid by salary sacrifice, and therefore appeared as Group contributions. The Group does not expect to make any 
employee or employer contributions to the Scheme in the year to 31 March 2024 (2023: £nil).

All death-in-service and incapacity benefits arising during employment are wholly insured. No post-retirement benefits other than pensions 
are made available to employees of the Group.

In the year ended 31 March 2023, £9m (2022: £9m) of benefits were paid to members.

During the year, the Scheme purchased a buy-in policy with Just Retirement for £79m. This insurance contract is valued as an asset using 
the same IAS 19 assumptions. Insurance contracts are annuities which are unquoted assets. All other Scheme assets have quoted prices in 
active markets. The Scheme assets do not include any directly owned financial instruments issued by the Group. Indirectly owned financial 
instruments had a fair value of £nil (2022: £nil).

In the most recent triennial valuation, the defined benefit scheme liabilities were split nil% (2022: nil%) in respect of active scheme 
participants, 26% (2022: 31%) in respect of deferred scheme participants, and 74% (2022: 69%) in respect of retirees. As the scheme is now 
closed to future accrual, there are no longer any active scheme participants. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit scheme 
liabilities at 31 March 2023 is 12.0 years (2022: 14.6 years).

34 › Net pension surplus continued
The assumptions agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme for the triennial valuation at 30 June 2021 have been restated to the assumptions 
described by IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The major assumptions used in the valuation were (in nominal terms):

Rate of increase in pensionable salaries

Rate of increase in pensions with no cap

Rate of increase in pensions with 5% cap

Discount rate

Inflation – Retail Price Index

– Consumer Price Index

The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were:

Life expectancy at age 60 for current pensioners – Men

 – Women

Life expectancy at age 60 for future pensioners (current age 40) – Men

 – Women

The above sensitivities show the impact on liabilities only and do not reflect the hedging the Scheme has in place. In December 2022, 
the Scheme transacted a buy-in policy for £79m covering all remaining uninsured members. As a result the Group no longer bears any 
longevity, interest rate or inflation risk in respect of the pension scheme. The buy-in policy is an investment asset of the Scheme.

The Company did not operate any defined contribution schemes or defined benefit schemes during the financial years ended 31 March 2023 
or 31 March 2022.

35 › Share-based payments

A   Accounting policy

The cost of granting shares, options over shares and other share-based remuneration to employees and Executive Directors is recognised 
through the income statement. All awards are equity settled and therefore the fair value is measured at the grant date. Where the awards 
have non-market related performance criteria, the Group uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to establish the relevant fair 
values. Where the awards have Total Shareholder Return (TSR) market related performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo 
simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values. The resulting values are amortised through the income statement over 
the vesting period of the awards. For awards with non-market related criteria, the charge is reversed if it appears probable that the 
performance or service criteria will not be met.

The following table analyses the total cost recognised in the income statement for the year between each plan, together with the number 
of options outstanding.

A summary of the main features of each type of plan is given below. The plans have been split into two categories: Executive plans and 
Other plans. For further details on the Executive plans, see the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 100 to 113.

Executive plans:
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP is open to Executive Directors, Executive Leadership Team members and senior management members with awards made at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee. In addition, other than for Executive Directors, an award of ‘matching shares’ could be made 
where the individual acquired shares in Land Securities Group PLC and pledged to hold them for a period of three years. The awards are 
issued at nil consideration, subject to performance and vesting conditions being met. Awards of LTIP shares and matching shares are 
subject to the same performance criteria and normally vest after three years. Awards are satisfied by the transfer of existing shares held 
by the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). There were no awards exercised during the year (2022: the weighted average share price at the date 
of vesting during the year was 752p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was £7m (2022: £7m).

Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP)
The Executive Directors’ annual bonus is structured in two distinct parts made up of an initial payment and deferred shares. The shares are 
usually deferred for one or two years and are not subject to additional performance criteria. Awards are satisfied by the transfer of existing 
shares held by the EBT at nil consideration. The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 615p (2022: 703p). 
The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was £2m (2022: £1m).

35 › Share-based payments continued
Other plans:
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
The 2005 ESOS was previously open to managers not eligible to participate in the LTIP, but was largely replaced by the new Restricted Share 
Plan in the year ended 31 March 2020. Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market 
price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant. Awards normally vest after three years and are not subject to 
performance conditions. Awards are satisfied by the transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse ten years after the date of grant. There were 
no awards exercised during the year (2022: none). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was £nil 
(2022: £nil).

Sharesave Plan
Under the Sharesave Plan, Executive Directors and other eligible employees are invited to make regular monthly contributions into a 
Sharesave plan operated by Equiniti. On completion of the three or five year contract period, ordinary shares in the Company may be 
purchased at a price based upon the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of invitation less 20% 
discount. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for awards exercised during the year was 717p (2022: 764p). The 
estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was £1m (2022: £1m).

Restricted Share plan (RSP)
The RSP started in the year ended 31 March 2020. It is open to qualifying management level employees with awards granted as nil cost 
options. Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market price on the day immediately 
preceding date of grant. Awards normally vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. Awards are satisfied by the 
transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse ten years after the date of grant. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for 
awards exercised during the year was 697p (2022: 787p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was 
£6m (2022: £2m).

Expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous ten years. The expected 
life used in the model has been determined based upon management’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, vesting/exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations. The risk-free rate is the yield at the date of the grant of an award on a gilt-edged stock with 
a redemption date equal to the anticipated vesting of that award.

Fair value inputs for awards with market performance conditions
Fair values are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model for awards with market performance conditions. 
Awards made under the 2005 LTIP which were granted after 31 March 2009 include a TSR condition, which is a market-based condition. 
The weighted average inputs into this model for the scheme are as follows:

36 › Ordinary share capital 

A   Accounting policy

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction 
from the proceeds.

The consideration paid by any Group entity to acquire the Company’s equity share capital, including any directly attributable incremental 
costs, is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or sold. Where own shares are sold or reissued, the net consideration 
received is included in equity.

The number of options over ordinary shares from Executive plans that were outstanding at 31 March 2023 was 5,223,270 (2022: 3,278,372). 
If all the options were exercisable at that date then 5,223,270 (2022: 3,278,372) shares would be required to be transferred from the 
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). The number of options over ordinary shares from Other plans that were outstanding at 31 March 2023 
was 1,636,828 (2022: 1,768,677). If all the options were exercisable at that date then 565,439 new ordinary shares (2022: 635,473) would 
be issued and 1,071,389 shares would be required to be transferred from the EBT (2022: 1,133,204).

Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting have previously authorised the acquisition of shares by the Company representing up to 10% 
of its share capital, to be held as treasury shares. There were no treasury shares transferred to the EBT during the year ended 31 March 2023 
(2022: 3,049,943) to satisfy future awards under employee share plans. At 31 March 2023, the Group held 6,789,236 ordinary shares 
(2022: 6,789,236) with a market value of £42m (2022: £53m) in treasury. The Company’s voting rights and dividends in respect of the 
treasury shares, including those own shares which the EBT holds, continue to be waived.

Own shares consist of shares in Land Securities Group PLC held by the EBT in respect of the Group’s commitment to a number of its employee 
share option schemes (note 35). 

The number of shares held by the EBT at 31 March 2023 was 3,831,399 (2022: 3,938,343). The market value of these shares at 31 March 2023 
was £24m (2022: £31m).

38 › Contingencies
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims, tax queries, contractor claims, guarantees and warranties arising in the 
ordinary course of business, as well as contingent liabilities for fire safety remediation arising from the Building Safety Act 2022, for which 
it is not yet possible to quantify any potential future liability. 

The Group has received queries from tax authorities relating to historical transactions which may result in additional tax liabilities. Based 
on an assessment of the relevant tax rules, in addition to advice received from external parties, the Group does not believe that any tax 
is due and has written to the authorities explaining that position. It is not possible to accurately state the timing of any potential outflow, 
as the Group awaits further correspondence from the tax authorities. The Group has not disclosed an estimate of the financial effect as 
it is considered this could be prejudicial to its position. 

It is not anticipated that any material liabilities will arise from the contingent liabilities.

The Group earns rental income by leasing its properties to tenants under non-cancellable operating leases. Leases in which substantially all 
risks and rewards incidental to ownership of investment properties are retained by the Group as the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments, including prepayments, received under operating leases (net of any incentives paid) are charged to the income statement on 
a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

At the balance sheet date, the Group had contracted with tenants to receive the following undiscounted future minimum lease payments:

Not later than one year

Later than one year, but not more than two years

1. In the year ended 31 March 2023, share options are excluded from the weighted average diluted number of shares when calculating EPRA diluted earnings per share 

because they are not dilutive, based on IFRS loss for the year. 

2. EPRA LTV is a new measure introduced by EPRA in the current year. The EPRA measure differs from the Group LTV presented in note 21 as it includes net payables and 
receivables, and includes trading properties at fair value and debt instruments at nominal value rather than book value. EPRA LTV was not presented in the financial 
statements as at 31 March 2022 as the measure had not yet been introduced. EPRA LTV would have been presented as 35.5% at 31 March 2022.

3. This measure reflects voids in the Combined Portfolio excluding only properties under development.
4. This measure relates to the Combined Portfolio, excluding properties currently under development, calculated by our external valuer and includes certain developments 

that currently generate income from meanwhile use. Excluding all developments, the EPRA NIY is 5.4% and the EPRA topped up NIY is 5.9%, refer to Table 4 in the Operating 
and portfolio review for further details. Topped-up NIY reflects adjustments of £39m for rent free periods and other incentives.

5. This measure is calculated based on gross rental income after rents payable and excluding costs recovered through rents but not separately invoiced of £9m.

EPRA vacancy rate
The EPRA vacancy rate is based on the ratio of the estimated market rent for vacant properties versus total estimated market rent, for the 
Combined Portfolio excluding properties under development. There are no significant distorting factors influencing the EPRA vacancy rate.

As a REIT, our income and capital gains from qualifying activities are exempt from corporation tax. 90% of this income must be distributed 
as a Property Income Distribution and is taxed at the shareholder level to give a similar tax position to direct property ownership. Non-
qualifying activities, such as sales of trading properties, are subject to corporation tax. This year, there was no net tax charge (2022: £nil).

The table above provides a reconciliation of the Group’s loss before tax to its estimated tax exempt income, 90% of which the Company 
is required to distribute as a PID to comply with REIT regulations.

The Company has 12 months after the year end to make the minimum distribution. Accordingly, PID dividends paid in the year may relate 
to the distribution requirements of previous periods. The table below sets out the dividend allocation for the years ended 31 March 2023 and  
31 March 2022:

The Group has met all the REIT requirements, including the payment by 31 March 2023 of the minimum Property Income Distribution (PID) 
for the year ended 31 March 2022. The forecast minimum PID for the year ended 31 March 2023 is £197m, which must be paid by 31 March 
2024. The Group has already made PID dividends relating to 31 March 2023 of £158m, leaving £39m to be paid in the coming year.

Our latest tax strategy can be found on our corporate website. In the year, the total taxes we incurred and collected were £134m (2022: £154m), 
of which £38m (2022: £57m) was directly borne by the Group including environmental taxes, business rates and stamp duty land tax. The Group 
has a low tax risk rating from HMRC.

REIT Balance of Business 
To retain the Group’s REIT status, it must meet conditions from the REIT legislation. At least 75% of the Group’s assets and 75% of the Group’s 
income must relate to qualifying activities. The results of these tests at the balance sheet date are below:

Profit before tax (£m)1

Sustainability performance

Greenhouse gas reporting 
In line with requirements set out in the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013 and the Companies 
(Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018, and in accordance with the Streamlined 
Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR), this statement reports our GHG emissions for financial year ending 31 March 2023. 

Streamlined energy and carbon reporting (SECR)
Methodology
Our streamlined energy and carbon reporting figures include energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with all properties 
under our operational control (i.e. absolute portfolio). Energy consumption is reported as kWh and no normalisation technique is applied. 
Carbon emissions are reported as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). We report our full greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually 
in accordance to the WRI Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, including scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.

At Landsec, scope 1 comprises emissions from natural gas and refrigerant gases. Scope 2 emissions are from electricity, heating and 
cooling purchased for common areas and shared services. All material sources of scope 1 and 2 emissions are reported. As the remaining 
sources (e.g. diesel used in generator testing) represent such a small proportion of total emissions, we do not report them.

Scope 2 emissions are reported using both the “location-based” and “market-based” accounting methods. Location-based emissions are 
reported using the UK Government’s ‘Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2022’. Scope 2 market-based emissions are reported 
using the conversion factor associated with each individual electricity, heating and cooling supply, either obtained directly from the 
supplier or from their official company website. 

Scope 3 emissions are those that are a consequence of our business activities, but which occur at sources we do not own or control and which 
are not classified as scope 2 emissions. The GHG Protocol identifies 15 categories of which 8 are directly relevant for Landsec. Our scope 3 
reporting methodology is detailed in our Sustainability Performance and Data Report on landsec.com/sustainability/reports-benchmarking.

Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions using location-based emission factors 
have decreased by 8% compared with the previous reporting year, 
despite an increase in occupancy levels. The decrease has been 
largely due to changes in emissions factors and actions taken to 
drive energy efficiency across our assets. 

The detailed breakdown of main factors driving the change in 
our scope 1 and scope 2 can be seen in chart 84 Landsec Scope 1 
and 2 emissions – year on year driving factors. In terms of 
market-based emissions, we have seen a small increase (5%) due 
to the inclusion of two assets that have come under our operational 
control from 2022.

Table 85 shows the absolute energy consumption with a breakdown by landlord and tenant consumption. This year, absolute energy 
intensity has slightly decreased by 1% compared with the previous year, largely due to energy efficiencies achieved from our active energy 
management programme and Net Zero Transition Investment Plan. Initiatives have included for example, lighting upgrades, further 
software modifications in our building management systems (BMS) to optimise the operation of our central plant services and a targeted 
customer engagement programme with our office occupiers.

Table 86 provides a breakdown of our entire emissions inventory, including indirect emissions from our value chain activities (i.e. scope 3 
emissions). Our scope 3 reporting allows us to identify the most significant categories in our value chain that contribute to our carbon 
footprint – Capital goods and Downstream leased assets, make up over 76% of our total emissions.

Capital goods include the emissions associated with the manufacture and transport of materials used within our development activities 
and portfolio projects. Downstream leased assets are those emissions associated with energy consumed by our customers within our assets.

The emissions from our development activities have decreased by 25% due to the fact that the four projects on-site are nearing 
completion and the materials delivered during this phase are much less carbon intensive than in the earlier phases of structural works. 
In table 87, we provide the amount of embodied carbon emissions reported for each development in 2022/23. 

In relation to Downstream leased assets, we continue engaging our customers (specifically those in our retail assets) to increase the share 
of primary tenant energy usage data (now at 63% – a 6% increase compared with last year), thereby increasing data accuracy. There’s 
a 2% reduction in carbon emissions as compared with last year for this category which can be explained by the increase of actual data 
included in the calculation. 

Because both categories represent a significant proportion of our total carbon footprint, we are committed to understanding the source 
of these emissions and taking action to reduce them. As such, for all our development and refurbishment schemes, we undertake life-cycle 
assessments, following the RICS guidance document ‘Whole life carbon assessment for the built environment’ 1st Edition and BS EN 15978. 
We will adopt the latest RICS guidance document once adopted. The assessment considers both the upfront embodied carbon emissions 
from our supply chain and construction activities (stages A1 to A5), as well as anticipated emissions from a building’s operations and 
embodied carbon associated with maintenance and repairs over the lifetime of the building (stages B1 to C4). To minimise our construction 
impacts, we set targets on the upfront embodied carbon emissions from supply chain (A1-A5) on a project-by-project basis and track 
these through to the completion of our buildings. We also track the carbon emissions from Modules B and C to ensure that the decisions 
we make for upfront embodied carbon do not lead to negative consequences in the long term, for example higher replacement rates. 
Once all reduction opportunities have been achieved, we offset the remainder of the upfront embodied carbon emissions of our buildings 
at practical completion, in alignment with the UK Green Building Council guidelines. We also carefully design our buildings to minimise the 
energy demand of our operations and meet this demand through renewable electricity contracts.

Electronic communications
We encourage shareholders to consider receiving their communications 
from the Company electronically. This will enable you to receive

environmentally friendly and cost-effective manner. Registration 
for electronic communications is available via our website on the 
investor page or on shareview.co.uk.

UK Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation and 
status on payment of dividends
As a UK REIT, Landsec does not pay corporation tax on Qualifying 
Activities, which are rental profits and chargeable gains relating to 
its property rental business.

At least 90% of income derived from Qualifying Activities must 
be distributed as Property Income Distributions (PIDs). For most 
shareholders, PIDs will be paid after deducting withholding tax 
at 20%. However, certain categories of shareholder may be able 
to receive PIDs gross, (i.e. without deduction of withholding tax).

These categories are principally UK companies, charities, local 
authorities, UK pension schemes and managers of ISAs, PEPs and 
Child Trust Funds.

A REIT may additionally pay ordinary dividends which will be 
treated in the same way as dividends from non-REIT companies.

Further information on UK REITs and the forms required to be 
completed to apply for PIDs to be paid gross are available on 
the Landsec website or from the Registrar: landsec.com/
investorsshareholders-equity-investors/uk-reit-regime- 
and-dividends.

Payment of dividends to UK resident shareholders 
Dividend payments by cheque ceased from October 2020 and all 
shareholders are now required to have their dividends paid directly 
into their personal bank or building society account or alternatively 
sign up to our Dividend Reinvestment Plan (see below). Under this 
arrangement, dividend confirmations are still sent to your 
registered address.

Receiving dividends directly into a nominated account has a 
number of advantages, including the crediting of cleared funds 
on the actual dividend payment date.

Shareholders who have not already done so should contact the 
Registrar (Equiniti) or complete a mandate instruction available 
on our website landsec.com/investorsshareholders-equity-
investors/dividend-information and return it to the Registrar. 
Alternatively, these details can be sent via their Equiniti Shareview 
online account, which is available on our website on the investors 
page under shareholders or directly at Equiniti: shareview.co.uk.

Payment of dividends to non-UK resident shareholders 
As applicable to UK resident shareholders, dividend payments by 
cheque ceased from October 2020 and all shareholders are now 
required to have their dividends paid directly into their personal 
bank or building society account. Payments to overseas accounts 
are made a few days after the Company’s dividend payment date.

Shareholders who have not already done so are encouraged to 
contact the Registrar (Equiniti) on +44 (0)371 384 20301 or 
download an application form online at shareview.co.uk or provide 
these details via their Equiniti Shareview online account.

This service is available in over 90 countries worldwide.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)
The DRIP provides shareholders with the opportunity to use cash 
dividends to increase their shareholding in Landsec. It is a 
convenient and cost-effective facility provided by Equiniti Financial 
Services Limited. Under the DRIP, cash dividends are automatically 
used to purchase shares in the market as soon as possible after the 
dividend payment. Any residual cash will be carried forward to the 
next dividend payment.

Details of the DRIP, including terms and conditions and 
participation election forms, are available on our website in the 
investor section under shareholders.

These are also available by post from:

with an easy to access and simple-to-use share dealing facility 
for buying and selling Landsec shares online, by telephone, or post. 
The online and telephone dealing service allows shareholders to

the time they give their instruction.

For telephone dealing, call +44 (0)345 603 7037¹ between 8.00am 
and 4.30pm, Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays in

rate and will vary by provider. Calls outside the UK will be charged 
at the applicable international rate. For online dealing, access is 
available at Equiniti’s website: shareview.co.uk/dealing. For postal 
dealing, call +44 (0)371 384 2030¹ to request full details and a 
dealing instruction form. Existing shareholders will need to provide

similar share dealing facilities.

Capital Gains Tax
For the purpose of Capital Gains Tax, the price of a Landsec share at 
31 March 1982, adjusted for the capitalisation issue in November 1983 
and the Scheme of Arrangement in September 2002, was 203p. 
On the assumption that the 5 for 8 Rights Issue in March 2009 was 
taken up in full and there were no fractional shares in the 2017 share 
consolidation, the adjusted price, post consolidation, for Capital 
Gains Tax purposes would be 229p per share. Further details on UK 
tax on gains on a sale of Landsec shares can be found on our website

Unclaimed assets register
The Experian Unclaimed Asset Register (UAR) was decommissioned. 
You can continue to uncover lost and dormant assets with 
Estatesearch (estatesearch.co.uk).

Unsolicited mail
The Company is obliged by law to make its share register available 
on request to other organisations which may result in shareholders 
receiving unsolicited mail. To limit the receipt of unsolicited mail, 
shareholders may register for free with the Mailing Preference 
Service, an independent organisation by visiting mpsonline.org.uk, 
or by telephone on: +44 (0)20 7291 3310.

Shareholder security
In the past, some of our shareholders have received unsolicited 
telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters 
from organisations or persons claiming or implying that they 
have some connection with the Company. These are typically 
from purported ‘brokers’ who offer to buy shares at a price often

Adjusted net cash inflow from operating activities
Net cash inflow from operating activities including the 
Group’s share of our joint ventures’ net cash inflow from 
operating activities. 

Adjusted net debt
Net debt excluding cumulative fair value movements 
on interest-rate swaps and amounts payable under 
head leases. It generally includes the net debt of 
subsidiaries and joint ventures on a proportionate basis.

Book value
The amount at which assets and liabilities are reported 
in the financial statements.

Combined Portfolio
The Combined Portfolio comprises the investment 
properties of the Group’s subsidiaries, on a 
proportionately consolidated basis when not wholly 
owned, together with our share of investment 
properties held in our joint ventures. 

Development pipeline
The development programme together with future 
developments.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)
The DRIP provides shareholders with the opportunity 
to use cash dividends received to purchase additional 
ordinary shares in the Company immediately after the 
relevant dividend payment date. Full details appear on 
the Company’s website.

EPRA
European Public Real Estate Association.

EPRA earnings
Profit before tax, excluding profits on the sale of 
non-current assets and trading properties, profits on 
development contracts, valuation movements, fair 
value movements on interest-rate swaps and similar 
instruments used for hedging purposes, debt 
restructuring charges, and any other items of an 
exceptional nature.

EPRA loan-to-value (LTV)
Ratio of adjusted net debt, including net payables, to 
the sum of the net assets, including net receivables, of 
the Group, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, all on a 
proportionate basis, expressed as a percentage. The 
calculation includes trading properties at fair value and 
debt at nominal value.

EPRA net disposal value (NDV) per share
Diluted net assets per share adjusted to remove the 
impact of goodwill arising as a result of deferred tax, 
and to include the difference between the fair value 
and the book value of the net investment in tenant 
finance leases and fixed interest rate debt. 

EPRA net initial yield
EPRA net initial yield is defined within EPRA’s Best 
Practice Recommendations as the annualised rental 
income based on the cash rents passing at the balance 
sheet date, less non-recoverable property operating 
expenses, divided by the gross market value of the 
property. It is consistent with the net initial yield 
calculated by the Group’s external valuer.

EPRA Net Reinstatement Value (NRV) per share
Diluted net assets per share adjusted to remove the 
cumulative fair value movements on interest-rate 
swaps and similar instruments, the carrying value of 
deferred tax on intangible assets and to include the 
difference between the fair value and the book value 
of the net investment in tenant finance leases and add 
back purchasers’ costs.

EPRA Net Tangible Assets (NTA) per share
Diluted net assets per share adjusted to remove the 
cumulative fair value movements on interest-rate 
swaps and similar instruments, the carrying value of 
goodwill arising as a result of deferred tax and other 
intangible assets, deferred tax on intangible assets 
and to include the difference between the fair value 
and the book value of the net investment in tenant 
finance leases.

Equivalent yield
Calculated by the Group’s external valuer, equivalent 
yield is the internal rate of return from an investment 
property, based on the gross outlays for the purchase 
of a property (including purchase costs), reflecting 
reversions to current market rent and such items as 
voids and non-recoverable expenditure but ignoring 
future changes in capital value. The calculation 
assumes rent is received annually in arrears. 

ERV – Gross estimated rental value
The estimated market rental value of lettable space as 
determined biannually by the Group’s external valuer. 
For investment properties in the development 
programme, which have not yet reached practical 
completion, the ERV represents management’s view 
of market rents.

Fair value movement
An accounting adjustment to change the book value 
of an asset or liability to its market value (see also 
mark-to-market adjustment).

Finance lease
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership from the Group as lessor to 
the lessee.

Gearing
Total borrowings, including bank overdrafts, less 
short-term deposits, corporate bonds and cash, at 
book value, plus cumulative fair value movements 
on financial derivatives as a percentage of total equity. 
For adjusted gearing, see note 21.

Gross market value
Market value plus assumed usual purchaser’s costs at 
the reporting date.

Head lease
A lease under which the Group holds an investment 
property.

Interest Cover Ratio (ICR)
A calculation of a company’s ability to meet its interest 
payments on outstanding debt. It is calculated using 
EPRA earnings before interest, divided by net interest 
(excluding the mark-to-market movement on 
interest-rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps, 
capitalised interest and interest on the pension 
scheme assets and liabilities). The calculation excludes 
joint ventures. 

Interest-rate swap
A financial instrument where two parties agree to 
exchange an interest rate obligation for a 
predetermined amount of time. These are generally 
used by the Group to convert floating-rate debt or 
investments to fixed rates.

Investment portfolio
The investment portfolio comprises the investment 
properties of the Group’s subsidiaries on a 
proportionately consolidated basis where not 
wholly owned.

Lease incentives
Any incentive offered to occupiers to enter into a lease. 
Typically, the incentive will be an initial rent-free period, 
or a cash contribution to fit-out or similar costs. For 
accounting purposes, the value of the incentive is 
spread over the non-cancellable life of the lease.

Like-for-like portfolio
The like-for-like portfolio includes all properties which 
have been in the portfolio since 1 April 2021 but 
excluding those which are acquired or sold since that 
date. Properties in the development pipeline and 
completed developments are also excluded.

Loan-to-value (LTV) 
Group LTV is the ratio of adjusted net debt, including 
subsidiaries and joint ventures, to the sum of the 
market value of investment properties and the book 
value of trading properties of the Group, its subsidiaries 
and joint ventures, all on a proportionate basis, 
expressed as a percentage. For the Security Group, 
LTV is the ratio of net debt lent to the Security Group 
divided by the value of secured assets.

Market value
Market value is determined by the Group’s external 
valuer, in accordance with the RICS Valuation 
Standards, as an opinion of the estimated amount 
for which a property should exchange on the date of 
valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller 
in an arm’s-length transaction after proper marketing. 

Net assets per share
Equity attributable to owners divided by the number 
of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the year. Net 
assets per share is also commonly known as net asset 
value per share (NAV per share).

Net initial yield
Net initial yield is a calculation by the Group’s external 
valuer of the yield that would be received by a 
purchaser, based on the Estimated Net Rental Income 
expressed as a percentage of the acquisition cost, 
being the market value plus assumed usual purchasers’ 
costs at the reporting date. The calculation is in line 
with EPRA guidance. Estimated Net Rental Income 
is determined by the valuer and is based on the 
passing cash rent less rent payable at the balance 
sheet date, estimated non-recoverable outgoings 
and void costs including service charges, insurance 
costs and void rates.

Net rental income
Net rental income is the net operational income arising 
from properties, on an accruals basis, including rental 
income, finance lease interest, rents payable, service 
charge income and expense, other property related 
income, direct property expenditure and bad debts. 
Net rental income is presented on a proportionate 
basis.

Net zero carbon building
A building for which an overall balance has been 
achieved between carbon emissions produced and 
those taken out of the atmosphere, including via offset 
arrangements. This relates to operational emissions 
for all buildings while, for a new building, it also 
includes supply-chain emissions associated with 
its construction. 

Passing rent
The estimated annual rent receivable as at the 
reporting date which includes estimates of turnover 
rent and estimates of rent to be agreed in respect of 
outstanding rent review or lease renewal negotiations. 
Passing rent may be more or less than the ERV 
(see over-rented, reversionary and ERV). Passing 
rent excludes annual rent receivable from units in 
administration save to the extent that rents are 
expected to be received. Void units at the reporting 
date are deemed to have no passing rent. Although 
temporary lets of less than 12 months are treated 
as void, income from temporary lets is included in 
passing rents.

Property Income Distribution (PID)
A PID is a distribution by a REIT to its shareholders paid 
out of qualifying profits. A REIT is required to distribute 
at least 90% of its qualifying profits as a PID to its 
shareholders.

Qualifying activities/Qualifying assets
The ownership (activity) of property (assets) which is 
held to earn rental income and qualifies for tax-exempt 
treatment (income and capital gains) under UK REIT 
legislation.

Rental income
Rental income is as reported in the income statement, 
on an accruals basis, and adjusted for the spreading 
of lease incentives over the term certain of the lease in 
accordance with IFRS 16 (previously, SIC-15). It is stated 
gross, prior to the deduction of ground rents and 
without deduction for operational outgoings on 
car park and commercialisation activities.

Voids
Voids are expressed as a percentage of ERV and 
represent all unlet space, including voids where 
refurbishment work is being carried out and voids in 
respect of pre-development properties. Temporary 
lettings for a period of one year or less are also treated 
as voids. The screen at Piccadilly Lights, W1 is excluded 
from the void calculation as it will always carry 
advertising although the number and duration of 
our agreements with advertisers will vary. 
Commercialisation lettings are also excluded from 
the void calculation.

Weighted average unexpired lease term
The weighted average of the unexpired term of all 
leases other than short-term lettings such as car 
parks and advertising hoardings, temporary lettings 
of less than one year, residential leases and long ground 
leases.

Yield shift
A movement (negative or positive) in the equivalent 
yield of a property asset.

Reversionary or under-rented
Space where the passing rent is below the ERV.

Reversionary yield
The anticipated yield to which the initial yield will rise 
(or fall) once the rent reaches the ERV.

Security Group
Security Group is the principal funding vehicle for the 
Group and properties held in the Security Group are 
mortgaged for the benefit of lenders. It has the 
flexibility to raise a variety of different forms of finance.

SONIA
The Sterling Overnight Index Average reflects the 
average overnight interest rate paid by banks for 
unsecured sterling transactions with a range of 
institutional investors. It is calculated based on actual 
transactions and is often used as a reference rate in 
bank facilities.

Topped-up net initial yield
Topped-up net initial yield is a calculation by the 
Group’s external valuer. It is calculated by making 
an adjustment to net initial yield in respect of the 
annualised cash rent foregone through unexpired 
rent-free periods and other lease incentives. 
The calculation is in line with EPRA guidance.

Total return on equity
Dividend paid per share in the year plus the change 
in EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share, divided by 
EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share at the beginning 
of the year. 

Total cost ratio
Total cost ratio represents all costs included within 
EPRA earnings, other than rents payable, financing 
costs and provisions for bad and doubtful debts, 
expressed as a percentage of gross rental income 
before rents payable adjusted for costs recovered 
through rents but not separately invoiced. 

Total development cost (TDC)
Total development cost refers to the book value of 
the site at the commencement of the project, the 
estimated capital expenditure required to develop 
the scheme from the start of the financial year in which 
the property is added to our development programme, 
together with capitalised interest, being the Group’s 
borrowing costs associated with direct expenditure on 
the property under development. Interest is also 
capitalised on the purchase cost of land or property 
where it is acquired specifically for redevelopment. 
The TDC for trading property development schemes 
excludes any estimated tax on disposal.

Trading properties
Properties held for trading purposes and shown as 
current assets in the balance sheet.

Turnover rent
Rental income which is related to an occupier’s 
turnover.

Vacancy rates
Vacancy rates are expressed as a percentage of 
ERV and represent all unlet space, including vacant 
properties where refurbishment work is being carried 
out and vacancy in respect of pre-development 
properties, unless the scale of refurbishment is such 
that the property is not deemed lettable. The screen at 
Piccadilly Lights, W1 is excluded from the vacancy rate 
calculation as it will always carry advertising although 
the number and duration of our agreements with 
advertisers will vary. 

Valuation surplus/deficit
The valuation surplus/deficit represents the increase 
or decrease in the market value of the Combined 
Portfolio, adjusted for net investment and the effect of 
accounting for lease incentives under IFRS 16 (previously 
SIC-15). The market value of the Combined Portfolio 
is determined by the Group’s external valuer.

affect the Group; changes in accounting practices and interpretation 
of accounting standards under IFRS, and changes in interest and 
exchange rates.
