The role of our Non-executive Directors

agreed strategy within the risk management 
framework set by the Board.

Our Non-executive Directors have a diverse skill set 
and background including property, investment, 
asset management, retail and hospitality, and 
data and analytics. This expertise enables the 
Board to constructively challenge management 
and encourages diversity of thought in the decision 
making process.

Director on 30 September 2022 having joined the 
Board in 2018, and stepped down from her role as

Our governance structure  
continued

How we make decisions
Decisions that can only be made by 
the Board, together with the terms of 
reference for our Committees, can be 
found on the corporate governance 
section of our website.

Decision making on investments, 
commercial agreements, including the 
acquisition, disposal and development 
of assets, is delegated according to 
financial values.

Our Delegation of Authorities framework 
sets out levels of authority for decision 
making throughout the business.

During the year, in light of the changing 
environment a review of the organisation 
structure was undertaken to ensure 
Landsec was well positioned for the future. 
The result was the identification of a 
number of differentiators and a change 
to the internal operating model. 

The governance for this model is focused 
around the two different business areas 
primarily based on Landsec’s customers’ 
needs. Workplace covers office activity 
(currently mainly Central London but 
could expand in the future to other regions) 
and Lifestyle which covers retail and the 
mixed-use business. 

Under the new operating model the Board 
continues to oversee governance and 
assurance, supported by the Executive 
Leadership Team, which is responsible for 
Group strategy and co-ordination alongside 
the Workplace and Lifestyle Boards who 
are responsible for strategic planning. 

The Workplace and Lifestyle Boards are 
supported by executive committees 
which are responsible for developing 
and executing business plans, managing 
operational matters day to day and 
delivering financial performance.

Conflicts of interest and external 
appointments
The Board has a policy to identify and 
manage Directors’ conflicts or potential 
conflicts of interest and has delegated 
authority to the Nomination Committee 
to (i) approve or otherwise any such 
disclosed conflicts, and (ii) determine any 
mitigating actions deemed appropriate 
to ensure that all Board meetings and 
decisions are conducted solely with a 
view to promoting the success of Landsec.

Directors’ conflicts of interest (which 
extend beyond third-party directorships 
and include close family) are reviewed by 
the Nomination Committee annually, with 
new conflicts arising between meetings 
dealt with at the time between the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary.

Potential conflicts of interest and how we have managed them

During the year, Madeleine Cosgrave 
declared two appointments, which were 
ultimately not deemed to be of concern 
from a time commitment or conflicts 
perspective (senior advisor to ICG Real 
Estate and independent member of the 
CBRE IM EMEA Investment Committee). 

We follow the Institutional Shareholder 
Services (ISS) proxy voting guidelines on 
overboarding and accordingly deem all 
our Non-executive Directors to be within 
these guidelines.

We appreciate that other proxy bodies 
and institutional investors impose more 
stringent guidelines than ISS and that 
each individual’s portfolio of appointments 
must be considered on a case-by-case 
basis, which the Board duly does before 
approving any appointments and then, 
on an annual basis, assesses whether each 
member of the Board is able to continue 
contributing effectively.

Sir Ian Cheshire is currently Chair of 
Channel 4, Spire Healthcare Group Plc, 
UK investment trust Menhaden Resource 
Efficiency Plc and serves as Non-executive 
Director at BT Group Plc. He is stepping 
down from the Chair position (remaining 
as Non-executive Director) at Menhaden 
Resource Efficiency Plc on 16 May 2023 
and will retire from BT Group Plc at its AGM 
in July 2023 to ensure he has sufficient 
capacity to act as Chair of Landsec. 

The Board was not asked to approve any 
additional external appointments for any 
of our Directors during the year.

Decisions on investing in Landsec securities 
conflicting with role on Landsec Board.

As Menhaden Resource Efficiency invests primarily in US and European 
markets, investing in businesses and opportunities delivering or benefitting 
from the efficient use of energy and resources, investment in Land 
Securities Group PLC securities is unlikely and in any event Sir Ian Cheshire 
does not participate directly in investment decisions at Menhaden and has 
agreed to never participate in investment decisions concerning the shares 
of Land Securities Group PLC at Menhaden.

Induction
Our induction plan is delivered over the 
first year of appointment. The aim is to 
enable a new Director to assume their 
responsibilities as quickly as possible and 
feel able to contribute to business and 
strategy discussions, with sufficient 
knowledge to provide effective challenge.

An induction plan was put in place for Miles 
Roberts upon joining as a Non-executive 
Director in September 2022. The aim of his 
induction was to support his understanding 
of Landsec’s business and financial position, 
strategy, culture, risks and opportunities, 
Board governance and dynamics. The plan 
assisted him to form relationships with the 
Chairman, the Board, the Executive 
Leadership Team and key external advisers, 
in addition to a number of site visits. Sir Ian 
Cheshire is currently undertaking a similar 
induction plan.

 — More information on their inductions 

can be found on page 85.

the Listing Rules requirements relating to 
diversity: (i) at least 40% of the Board are 
women (also meeting the FTSE Women 
Leaders target); (ii) at least one of the senior 
board positions are women (both Chair and 
CFO); and (iii) at least one individual on the 
Board is from a minority ethnic background 
(also meeting the Parker Review target). The 
Board and new Chair are aware that on the 
retirement of Cressida Hogg, our gender 
diversity will dip below 40%, and this will 
be taken into account in our near term 
succession planning. See table 33 below.

Training and development 
Directors received regular updates in their 
Board papers, facilitating greater 
awareness and understanding of the 
Group’s business and in particular the 
emerging strategy. 

The Board also received presentations on 
the flexible office market and the future 
of office assets acquired as part of the 
U+I Group and MediaCity acquisitions. 

Board diversity
As at the date of this report and throughout 
this financial year we have complied with 

In June 2022, the Board had a deep dive 
into the Southwark area of London, 
where Landsec has assembled a pipeline 

of c.1m sq ft. In addition, the Board received 
a teach-in session on embodied carbon 
from the Landsec sustainability team 
which included case studies on The Forge, 
Red Lion Court, Timber Square and 
Liberty of Southwark and discussed the 
implications for n2 whilst the Board visited 
the development. 

In December 2022, the Board received a 
detailed briefing on embodied carbon in 
development and Landsec’s objective to 
reduce embodied carbon. The Board also 
received a briefing and site visit of the n2 
development on the same day. 

In February 2023, the Board held its 
strategy away day at our Myo offices at 
Dashwood House in London with a tour 
of 21 Moorfields, a complex development 
nearing completion that showcased 
Landsec’s deep development expertise 
during the life of the project.

Finally, the Board were also provided with 
a market disclosure briefing to reinforce 
their knowledge of the Market Abuse 
Regulation including recent developments 
and case studies.

The Board in action

Decisions of the Board this year have been 
considered in the context of a challenging macro-
economic environment and whilst considering the 
changes, risks and opportunities that such an 
environment can bring. 

Board meetings
Board members attend eight scheduled 
meetings a year and meet as required 
for additional discussions. 

All members of the Board attended all 
Board and Committee meetings during 
their tenure and membership, with the 
exception of Christophe Evain who missed 
the Board, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee meetings held in March 2023 
due to a family bereavement.

If the Board needs to make decisions in 
between meetings, it can do so by 
unanimous approval by email but will only 
do so in such situations where the matter 
has been discussed at previous meetings 
so that Directors are fully appraised, have 
had the opportunity to ask questions and 
are therefore in a position to make a fully 
informed decision.

The Board met for four dinners throughout 
the year at which a number of matters were 
discussed including the macro-economic 
climate, areas of risk, culture and talent 
retention. These opportunities allow the 
Board to develop and solidify relationships 
and further discuss matters impacting the 
business in an informal manner without the 
inevitable time restrictions of Board and 
Committee meetings. 

The Non-executive Directors also met without 
the Executive Directors being present.

Execution of strategy
This year, the Board has continued to 
consider the Group’s strategy and the 
execution of strategy, particularly in 
the context of the uncertain macro-
economic and political environments. 
In addition, the alignment of culture 
and the internal governance framework 
and strategy has been a focus of the Board. 
All of Landsec’s stakeholder interests 
remain at the heart of strategy decisions 
especially in uncertain climates.

 — There is further information about the 

Board and our stakeholders on 
pages 76-79 and the Board and our 
Culture on pages 80-81 

The Board considered a number of strategic 
areas during the year, which included 
reviews of the retail strategy, the residential 
strategy and the alignment with urban 
mixed-use. In addition, the Board considered 
the future of the office and flex office. More 
details on the strategic (and other matters) 
considered by the Board can be found on 
page 75. As part of these strategic reviews 
the Board had a tour and deep dive review 
of our developments in the Southwark area 
of London.

In addition, the Board benefited from 
a session with some of the sustainability 
team on embodied carbon followed by 
a tour of the n2 development site, which 
brought to life some of the matters that 
had been discussed in the session. 

Board’s tour  
of Southwark

The June meeting of the Board took 
place in Southwark and allowed the 
Board to benefit from a walking tour 
of the area led by the Executive 
Directors and members of the 
Central London office team. 

The Board were initially given a 
presentation on why the Southbank 
was considered an important area 
and how in particular the Southwark 
area fitted into this growing part 
of London. 

During the tour the Board were able 
to see our four existing (or potential) 
development sites in the area – 
Timber Square, The Forge, Liberty of 
Southwark and Red Lion Court, and 
the thriving neighbourhoods in which 
they are located. 

The tour allowed the Board to ask 
questions on the area, its heritage, 
development progress, and 
sustainability credentials. The Board 
welcomed the additional insight 
into the developments, the location 
and the impact on Landsec’s 
growth strategy.

The Board and our stakeholders

Our purpose – sustainable places, connecting 
communities, realising potential – puts all our 
stakeholders at the forefront of the Board’s  
decision making.

This is our Section 172 Statement.

The Board is pleased to provide a 
statement that supports Section 172(1) 
of the Companies Act 2006. This requires 
that Directors promote the success of 
the Company for the benefit of the 
members, having regard to the interest 
of stakeholders in their decision making. 
Over the next few pages, we provide 
examples of how the Board engages with 
stakeholders and takes into account their 
interests when making decisions.

 — An introduction to our stakeholders 
can be found in our Strategic Report 
on page 11

Stakeholders and Board  
decision making
Our stakeholders’ interests and priorities 
continue to change, and affect the way 
we work, shop and engage with each 
other. Effective communication with our 
stakeholders is critical to keeping pace with 
their evolving needs, which is so important 
for our long-term success. The Board’s 
engagement with stakeholders is both 
direct and by management reporting up 
to the Board on stakeholder engagement, 
the importance of which is embedded 
throughout our business.

Our customers
We have made good progress with growing 
our customer relationships which has been 
a key feature of our strategy for two years. 
The Board receives regular updates on 
our customers. 

During the year, the Board received a 
detailed briefing on our retail, office and 
mixed-use strategies including customer 
insights, as well as regular updates on 
customers as part of the business update 
at every meeting. This has helped to 
understand the changing requirements 
of office customers since the pandemic, 
including changing space requirements 
and the increased demand for ‘healthy 
buildings’. As a business we have listened 
to office occupiers regarding their needs, 
resulting in us providing greater flexibility 
of office leases.

The Board reviewed the retail strategy 
update in September. The Reimagine 
Retail change programme has been 
implemented and is based on three main 
strategies: the future asset, brand partners 
and guest experience. We have developed 
clear plans for each of our assets to make 
sure they deliver the physical experience, 
which continues to attract the right visitors 
for brands. 

Each location will see a more distinct 
identity, more closely representing the 
narrative of the area in which it is located, 
although there are some key themes that 
reach across all locations. The Board noted 
the good progress that had been made in 
recognising and understanding consumer 
behaviour and its impact on investment 
decisions, the importance of improving 
data insights and direct relationship 
management, but also ensuring that 
downside scenarios were considered.

The Board also received a residential 
strategy update from the Chief Strategy 
and Investment Officer and Head of 
Lifestyle Investment. The Board supported 
the view that residential should be part of 
our strategy.

One New  
Street Square

In January 2023 the Board approved the 
sale of One New Street Square, EC4 to 
Chinachem Group, a property developer 
based in Hong Kong.

The total consideration for the sale amounts 
to £349.5m. The sale price compares to 
a September 2022 valuation of £362.8m 
and crystallises a total return on capital 
averaging 10% per annum since Landsec’s 
acquisition of the site in June 2005 and 
subsequent redevelopment in 2016.

One New Street Square is fully let to 
Deloitte, with a 14-year unexpired lease 
term remaining and a current annual net 
rent of £16.8m. With limited opportunities 
to add further value, the disposal was in line 
with Landsec’s strategy to recycle capital 
out of mature London offices.

The Board considered the sale to be in 
line with the strategic review conducted 
in late 2020, when Landsec announced its 
intention to sell c.£2.5bn of mature London 
offices over the medium term. With the 
inclusion of One New Street Square, the 
Company has now sold £2.1bn of offices, 
representing an average yield of 4.4%.

The disposal proceeds will initially be used 
to repay debt and, on a pro-forma basis, 
would reduce Landsec’s long-term value from 
31.1% to 28.9% based on September 2022 
valuations. Its strong balance sheet provides 
Landsec with significant optionality for future 
reinvestment in higher-return opportunities 
which are expected to emerge as markets 
continue to adjust to a new reality.

Our communities
To understand in more detail some of the 
communities our assets are located within, 
the Board visited certain assets during the 
year, including Southwark. The Board 
received a presentation on the Southwark 
area which highlighted the rich culture 
and heritage of this community, along with 
the good transport links, young population 
and amenities. 

The assets owned by Landsec in the area 
were highlighted, including Red Lion Court, 
the Forge, the Liberty of Southwark and 
Timber Square. This was then followed by 
a walking tour of the area. Our Capital 
Markets Day event in September also 
focused on Southwark and provided 
investors with an operational update and 
tour of the area.

The Board visited the n2 development in 
December to see first hand one of our sites 
under construction.

The Board had a tour of 21 Moorfields as 
part of their strategy day in February which 
was held at our Myo flexible office space in 
Dashwood House. The Board were impressed 
with the engineering challenges overcome 
at 21 Moorfields and thought the business 
should be proud of their achievement with 
this complex development.

 — You can read more about our 

community support on page 44

Our partners
The Board received updates during the year 
on fire safety. The political and legislative 
landscape had evolved since the last review, 
including the introduction of the Developers’ 
Pledge that required developers to rectify or 
fund remediation of critical fire safety works 
in certain circumstances. Landsec committed 
to the pledge in July 2022 and signed the 
associated contract in March 2023. 

The Board were updated by our Managing 
Director of Corporate Affairs during the 
year on local and national Government 
issues impacting the business. The Board 
also discussed the output of Landsec’s local 
and national Government engagement.

The Board and our stakeholders  
continued

Our employees
Employee Forum meetings were held 
monthly throughout the year, with four 
quarterly meetings held which Mark Allan, 
CEO, attends to answer any questions 
and get an indication of topical issues 
of importance to employees.

The Employee Forum sends out a list of 
summary topics for employees to vote 
on at the start of every financial year. 
The Employee Forum will then report 
back to constituents on topics throughout 
the year. 

Christophe Evain met with the Employee 
Forum separately to answer questions on 
executive remuneration. 

We continued with our employee 
engagement sessions with two Non-
executive Directors meeting a small group 
of employees from the Lifestyle area of the 
business. A range of matters were discussed 
including culture change, communications 
and business strategy. Manjiry Tamhane 
also joined a session of our Women’s 
Network. The feedback from those sessions 
is passed back into the boardroom. 

The Board also received a full briefing on 
the employee engagement survey which 
was undertaken in Summer 2022 which also 
gave them a good insight into employee 
sentiment. Read more about our 
engagement survey results on page 34.

During the year there have been a number 
of drop in lunches held with members of 
our Executive Leadership Team, including 
our CEO and CFO.

We are also planning to hold another 
‘Meet the NEDs’ event for employees 
immediately after our Annual General 
Meeting in July and further engagement 
events with smaller groups of employees 
from the other areas of our business in 
September and December. This will be a 
great opportunity for the Board to engage 
further with employees.

Themes raised at the employee engagement events included

  the cost of living

  retention of talent

  U&I integration

  the reorganisation and 
changes to the internal 
operating model

  office environment  
and culture

  diversity and inclusion

  business strategy

  managing change

  career development

  change communications

  employee wellbeing  
and benefits

Feedback from employee engagement events

 “We met with Christophe on behalf of the Employee 
Forum to discuss Executive Remuneration and raise 
queries on behalf of the business. It was really great 
to meet Christophe and we really valued the open 
discussions we had with him. We were given a clear 
insight into Board life and dealing with shareholders, 
he elaborated on his role and discussed the recent 
recruitment process for our new Chairman which 
was really interesting.”

 “I thoroughly enjoy the monthly ELT lunch sessions, 
they are great opportunities to have conversations 
and build relationships with our leadership team. 
To me, it shows how committed our Executive team 
are to listen to and engage with colleagues across 
the business.”

 “I was lucky enough to meet Sir Ian Cheshire to discuss 

the Employee Forum’s role and how it represents 
Landsec employees. We had a really open and 
wide-ranging conversation where Ian wanted to 
hear all about Landsec, the culture and what 
employees really cared about. We discussed the cost 
of living crisis, our focus on improving diversity and 
employee satisfaction drivers in a post-covid world 
– all issues that Ian is clearly engaged with and keen 
to help drive forward. We look forward to working 
with him and the wider Board more closely to make 
Landsec the best possible place to work.”

Our investors

We want to create sustainable value for our three types of investors: institutional, private and debt.

It is important to us that our investors understand our strategy and our equity story so they can support the execution  
of our strategy and our capital recycling.

Institutional investors

Private investors

Debt investors

Institutional investors
Our Executive Directors once again held 
meetings with investors representing more 
than half the share register by value.

Our private investors are encouraged to 
give feedback and communicate with the 
Directors via the Company Secretary 
throughout the year. 

We were delighted to return to a full 
programme of in-person investor events 
during the last year. Whilst some investor 
meetings were conducted online for the sake 
of convenience, the vast majority of our 
investor engagement has been face-to-face.

2022 Annual General Meeting 
We continued to hold our AGM as a 
hybrid meeting in 2022. We invited 
shareholders to ask questions and vote 
on the resolutions online or they could 
join the meeting physically.

All resolutions put to the meeting received 
overwhelming support of investors. The 
results of the voting at all general meetings 
are published on our website: landsec.com/
investors/regulatory-news. 

Five-year private investor plan
We have a rolling five-year private investor 
plan, the intention of which is to maintain 
an efficient share register, limited paper 
distributions, effective communications 
and the provision of best-in-class service 
to our investors. 

Private investors queries
We work closely with our registrar Equiniti 
to address all queries that we receive 
from our private shareholders throughout 
the year.

In September 2022, we held a Capital 
Markets Day in Southwark in London for 
institutional investors. This event provided 
an overview of the Southwark region and 
detail on the existing and potential 
development schemes Landsec has in this 
area of London. In addition, we explained 
our plans to reduce the embodied carbon 
within our developments through a 
combination of efficient use of materials, 
design and construction methods. The 
event also included a tour of Southwark to 
view our four major committed/potential 
development sites.

We engaged with investors throughout the 
year on all aspects of environmental, social 
and governance matters. In February 2023, 
we conducted a sustainability roadshow 
in the Netherlands, meeting with fund 
managers and sustainability analysts from 
major institutional investors.

Industry conferences
Industry conferences provide Executive 
Directors with a chance to meet a large 
number of investors on a formal and 
informal basis. Conferences attended this 
year included the UBS Global Property 
conference in London, the Kempen 
conference in Amsterdam, the Bank of 
America conference in New York, the Citi 
conference in Florida, Barclays’ real estate 
conference in London and Morgan 
Stanley’s real estate conference in London. 
All conferences were in-person events.

Credit side institutional investors 
and analysts
In March 2023, as part of the marketing 
process for the Green bond issuance, we 
held a series of debt investor meetings. 
A combination of the physical and virtual 
meetings, including a Group lunch and a 
recorded presentation, was well received 
by the investors and allowed us to provide 
a comprehensive update on our strategy 
as well as to present the recently updated 
Green Financing Framework.

Banks
Regular dialogue is maintained with our 
key relationship banks, including regular 
meetings and calls with our treasury team.

Credit rating agencies
During the year, business and financial 
updates were provided by our treasury 
team and senior managers to Standard 
& Poor’s, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s.

The Board and our culture

This year has seen the Board focus on supporting 
management to design and embed a more agile, 
efficient culture, with less internal complexity  
and more external and customer focus. 

A year of progress
In previous years we have outlined how 
an appropriate governance framework 
and an environment of trust, respect and 
accountability were all fundamental to 
our culture, and that the Board played an 
important role in monitoring and assessing 
our culture and the governance framework. 
This year we have made significant progress 
on a journey that had already commenced, 
but which has now been considered in 
detail by the Board and is being embedded 
throughout the Group. The key components 
of that journey are outlined here. 

In order to ensure that our growth 
strategy was not hindered by legacy ways 
of working, a cultural change programme 
was initiated during the year which resulted 
in a change to the operating model and a 
new internal governance framework led by 
the Board and supported by the Executive 
Leadership Team.

 — More detail on this revised framework 

can be found on pages 69-70

Embedding 
cultural change 
through a new 
operating model

The new operating model and governance 
structure ultimately flows up to the 
Board and is designed to facilitate and 
encourage clear reporting, decision making, 
empowerment, accountability, employee 
input and stakeholder feedback, and 
enable a focus on our customers, leading  
to growth. 

The Board have been regularly updated  
and inputted as this programme has 
evolved and are now supporting 
management in embedding this across 
the organisation through organisational 
design, business planning, leadership 
effectiveness and behaviours, reward and 
incentivisation and diversity and inclusion. 
More details on each of these areas are 
set out on the opposite page. 

In shaping this framework, feedback  
from an externally facilitated employee 
engagement survey undertaken during  
the year was also taken into account. 
The Board were appraised of the key themes 
arising from the survey and challenged 
management as to how they address the 
areas where the need for improvement 
was identified. Positive changes are already 
underway and employee engagement 
surveys will be undertaken on a regular basis, 
which will assist in allowing the Board to 
assess progress. 

In addition, as the Board have greatly 
benefited from first hand engagement 
with employees at Non-executive Director 
engagement sessions, similar meetings are 
continuing and a further series is planned 
throughout the coming year.

 — Further information on employee 

engagement can be found on page 34

Introduction from the  
Chairman of the Nomination Committee

Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the 
report from the Nomination 
Committee for the year.

The Committee has continued to assess 
the composition, succession plan and skills 
of the Board and its Committees and 
promote diversity.

Board and Committee changes 
Following a comprehensive selection 
process, in January we announced the 
appointment of Sir Ian Cheshire as Non-
executive Director and Chair Designate. 
Sir Ian joined the Board at the end of March 
and will succeed me as Chair on 16 May. 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
be welcoming someone of Sir Ian Cheshire’s 
calibre as Chair.

We also appointed Miles Roberts as 
Non-executive Director in September 2022. 
Miles, who originally trained as a structural 
engineer, brings significant experience as 
a serving chief executive and has held a 
number of non-executive roles. You can 
read about the Committee’s appointment 
process for both Sir Ian and Miles on 
page 84. 

Colette O’Shea stepped down from the 
Board in September and as Chief Operating 
Officer in March. Colette joined Landsec 
in 2003 and was appointed to the Board in 
2018. The Committee is extremely grateful 
to Colette for her significant contribution 
to the Board and the business during her 
time at Landsec.

Board evolution 
A balanced and diverse Board with a mix 
of skills, expertise, background and tenure 
is critical to the success of the Company. 
The composition of the Board underpins 
the quality of debate and challenge 
during discussions.

The process for Board appointments is 
led by the Nomination Committee which 
makes recommendations to the Board 
for its approval. It is the Nomination 
Committee’s responsibility to keep Board 
composition under review, including 
reviewing director independence and 
tenure. During the year the Committee 
reviewed the composition and skills of 
the Board, and developed an ongoing plan 
for Board succession, taking into account 
recent and likely future Board changes.

The Board is mindful that Edward Bonham 
Carter has been a Director in excess of nine 
years and so the Committee reviewed his 
independence and role and was completely 
satisfied that Edward continues to bring 
independent judgement to the Board. 
As such, the Nomination Committee was 
satisfied that Edward can continue to fulfill 
the role of Senior Independent Director.

The Committee also has responsibility for 
oversight of Executive Leadership Team and 
senior management succession. This is also 
discussed by the Board as a whole, with 
a focus on diversity and inclusion and 
developing and maintaining the internal 
talent pipeline.

Internal Board evaluation
This year our Board evaluation was carried 
out internally with the Committee’s 
effectiveness assessed as part of the internal 
review. The Committee was satisfied with its 
own effectiveness as a whole and pleased 
with the outcome of the Non-executive 
succession planning and processes, including 
the Chair selection process, which had been a 
main focus during the year. With a new Chair 
and Executive Leadership Team in place it is 
appropriate to reset the Committee’s 
priorities to focus more on wider Board 
succession, while continuing to cover all areas 
of the Committee’s remit including ongoing 
management succession planning.

 — Further details on the internal Board 

evaluation can be found on pages 86-87

Corporate governance
During the year, the Committee has 
overseen the corporate governance agenda 
on behalf of the Board. I am pleased to 
confirm that Landsec has complied with 
and applied all of the principles of the 
2018 UK Corporate Governance Code for 
the financial year ended 31 March 2023. 
The Code is published by the Financial 
Reporting Council and is available from 
frc.org.uk.

Diversity
The Board believes that diversity at Board 
level sets the tone for diversity throughout 
the business. We promote diversity in the 
broadest sense, not just gender or ethnicity 
but also experience, skills, professional 
background and tenure. The Nomination 
Committee monitors our talent pipeline 
to ensure we have a diverse pool of talent 
being developed at all levels of the business. 
Maintaining a diverse workforce is as 
important as diverse recruitment and 
we continue to assess and promote this. 
During the year, we have refreshed the 
overall diversity and inclusion strategy for 
the Group, including setting new targets.

I am pleased to report that during this 
financial year we met the Listing Rule 
requirements targets for diversity. 40% 
of our Board members are women, our 
Chair and CFO positions have been held 
by women, and we have one member 
of the Board from an ethnic minority 
background. The Committee is aware that 
as a result of the change of Chair in May 
2023, the Board’s gender diversity will dip 
below 40%, and this will be taken into 
consideration in Board composition and 
succession planning.

I am pleased to report that following 
the recruitment of Marina Thomas as 
Head of Governance and Company 
Secretary and Kate Seller as Chief People 
Officer during the year, one third of the 
Executive Leadership Team are women 
(which will increase to 40% when our 
new Chief Data & Technology Officer joins 
us in June 2023). We acknowledge that 
ongoing work is needed to increase diversity 
of our Executive Leadership Team and its 
direct reports whilst ensuring that 
appointments and succession plans are 
based on merit and objective criteria and 
the Committee, and the Board will continue 
to monitor progress.

Report of the  
Nomination Committee

Executive Director changes
During the year, Colette O’Shea stepped 
down from the Board on 30 September 
2022 and as Chief Operating Officer on 
31 March 2023.

Non-executive Director changes 
Cressida Hogg will step down as Chairman 
on 16 May 2023, having served over five 
years as Chairman and nine years on 
the Board. 

As the Chairman succession process 
began, it was agreed that Edward Bonham 
Carter would lead the process as Senior 
Independent Director, joined by the other 
members of the Committee, excluding 
Cressida Hogg (the Chairman, Succession 
Committee). Hedley May, an independent 
executive search firm and with no connection 
to Landsec, was appointed to conduct the 
search for a Chairman with experience in 
retail and customer-focused businesses. 
A diverse shortlist of candidates was put 
forward by Hedley May and the candidates 
met with members of the Chairman 
Succession Committee and the CEO, CFO 
and the other Non-executive Directors. 
The Chairman Succession Committee 
concluded that Sir Ian Cheshire would be 
an excellent addition to the Board bringing 
a wealth of experience across customer-
focused businesses in executive and 
non-executive positions in listed companies.

In 2022, the Nomination Committee 
appointed Russell Reynolds, an independent 
executive search firm with no connection 
to Landsec to conduct a search for a 
Non-executive Director. Members of the 
Committee and the CEO met with a shortlist 
of candidates put forward by Russell Reynolds. 
The Committee concluded that Miles Roberts 
with his experience as a serving chief 
executive and in non-executive roles would 
be a positive addition to the Board.

Diversity
The Board’s policy on diversity establishes 
the importance of diversity in the broadest 
sense, not just gender or ethnicity but also 
experience, skills, professional background, 
tenure and also other differentials between 

directors such as cognitive and personal 
strengths. The Board believes that diversity 
is crucial to creating a high-performing, 
effective Board, to provide a breadth of 
perspective and debate that aids decision 
making and which supports and directs the 
business more effectively.

The Nomination Committee works with 
executive search consultants to ensure 
they support our approach to diversity in 
providing a diverse selection of candidates 
for Board appointments and the selection 
can then be based upon merit and 
objective criteria.

Diversity at Board level sets the tone for 
diversity throughout the business. The 
Nomination Committee monitors our 
talent pipeline to ensure we have a diverse 
succession pool of talent being developed 
and maintained at all levels of the business. 
Maintaining a diverse workforce is as 
important as diverse recruitment and 
we continue to assess this.

Diversity is also addressed at the 
Remuneration Committee, particularly 
in the context of gender pay gap, and 
discussed at the main Board in light of 
its increased focus on the promotion 
and maintenance of diversity at all levels 
of talent throughout our business.

 — Further information on diversity at 

Landsec can be found on pages 35-38

Independence and re-election 
to the Board
The independence, effectiveness and 
commitment of each of the Non-executive 
Directors has been reviewed by the 
Committee. The Committee is satisfied 
with the contributions and time 
commitment of all the Non-executive 
Directors during the year.

The Committee will always discuss the 
additional commitments of all directors 
(including the Chairman) before 
recommending their approval to the Board. 
It also considers potential conflict issues as 
part of that assessment. The Committee 
is mindful that Edward Bonham Carter has 

been a director of the Board in excess of 
nine years and has reviewed his 
independence and role and is completely 
satisfied that Edward continues to bring 
independent judgement to the Board. 
As such the Committee is satisfied that 
Edward can continue to fulfill the role 
of Senior Independent Director. The 
Committee is confident that each of 
the Non-executive Directors remains 
independent and will be in a position to 
discharge their duties and responsibilities 
in the coming year. From a governance 
perspective, the Board as a whole is 
independent.

Sir Ian Cheshire and Miles Roberts are 
standing for initial election by shareholders 
at the AGM, with all other Directors 
standing for re-election at the AGM in 
July 2023 with the support of the Board 
(with the exception of Cressida Hogg 
who is stepping down from the Board 
on 16 May 2023).

Internal evaluation of the 
effectiveness of the Nomination 
Committee
Following a busy few years of Executive 
and Non-executive appointments, the 
internal review of the performance of the 
Nomination Committee included a review 
of the Chair succession process and 
considering the Committee’s priority for the 
year ahead to include role profile planning 
for future non-executive recruitment and 
continued detailed reporting back to the 
main Board.

Landsec Annual Report 2023GovernanceBoard induction

085

financial position and our five-year plan, 
budget and in-depth financial review. 

Miles met with members of the Executive 
Leadership Team to gain a deeper 
understanding of their areas of the business 
and get an understanding of the individual 
priorities and challenges that they face. 
Another key focus was meetings with 
the Managing Director of People and 
Corporate Services for a deep dive into 
our people and culture. 

Additionally, Miles spent time with other 
Non-executive Directors, including those 
that he had not met as part of the 
selection process.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance087

Conclusions of evaluation

The overall conclusion of the Board evaluation this year is 
that the Landsec Board and its Committees continue to 
operate in a collaborative and open way and work effectively. 

The priorities for the incoming Chair include strategic 
development and capital allocation, cultural and 
organisational change and succession planning. A priority 
for the Board as a whole is to provide support to the new 
Chair. The Board agenda and topics have the right focus on 
key areas, however there were some preferences for more time 
to be allowed for discussions during meetings or informally. 

The Board felt it added value in developing and implementing 
strategy and supporting the disposal programme, with the 
Board feeling they are appropriately agile to adjust to the 
changing environment. 

Nomination Committee evaluation
The Committee looked at its own effectiveness. Overall, the 
Committee was satisfied with its own effectiveness and that 
of the Non-executive Director and Chair succession processes. 
The Committee will keep Board succession planning and 
diversity as a key area of focus.

Our performance 2022/23

Output of 2022/23 Board evaluation: 
areas of focus for the year ahead

The composition of the Board 
was considered appropriate 
with good progress made 
during the year with the 
recruitment of two Directors 
to the Board, including the 
Chair Designate.

Members of the Executive 
Leadership Team and their 
direct line reports have 
spent time over the year 
on asset visits and providing 
presentations to the Board. 
However, the Board have 
requested continued increased 
visibility of the Executive 
Leadership Team and senior 
leaders in the year ahead. 

Progress has been made 
against the strategic 
objectives of the Company 
and regular reporting to the 
Board in this area was noted. 

During the year, the Board 
has spent more time focused 
on culture and business 
transformation including 
regular updates on 
organisational and digital 
transformation programmes, 
as well as sessions with the 
leadership team on 
engagement and diversity 
and inclusion. The Board 
have noted that the pace 
of change continues to 
accelerate across the business.

The Board has monitored 
progress with data and 
technology through sessions 
with the executives during the 
year and was pleased to note 
significant improvements in 
progress with our technology 
strategy, as well as the 
appointment of a Chief 
Data and Technology Officer 
who will join the Executive 
Leadership Team in June 2023.

   Strategic 
development
Continued progress with 
strategic developments. 
The Board would like to 
continue to build on their 
understanding of customer 
needs through enhanced 
access to customer data as 
part of the strategy process. 

   Capital  
allocation

Continued focus on capital 
allocation and investment.

   Culture and 
organisational change 

Progress already made on 
culture change within the 
business should continue, 
monitored by the Board 
through sessions with the 
executive and engagement 
survey results.

   Succession  
planning

An area of focus for the 
Board is succession planning 
and talent development.

   Support to  
new Chair 

A key focus for the Board is 
in supporting the new Chair 
to develop relationships 
across the Board.

   Board papers  
and Executive 
Leadership Team

Continued improvement 
of Board papers with a focus 
to move towards more 
executive summaries to 
allow more time for debate 
at Board meetings.

The Board would like 
to focus on more 
exposure to the Executive 
Leadership Team and other 
senior leaders.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance088

Introduction from the  
Chairman of the Audit Committee

Dear shareholder
During the financial year the 
Committee has continued 
to fulfil its oversight 
responsibilities on the 
financial statements, the 
integrity of the reporting 
process and the Company’s 
system of internal controls 
and risk management, the 
audit and valuation processes 
and the procedures for 
ensuring compliance with 
laws, regulations and ethical 
codes of practice.

Risk focus
Risk management is a primary responsibility 
of the Committee on behalf of the Board 
and is consistently monitored throughout 
the year. Information security and cyber 
threat remains a key operational risk and 
the Committee has had regular oversight 
of the significant work undertaken to 
mitigate against this risk and will continue 
to consider updates and monitor progress 
of the programme to improve cyber resilience. 

The macroeconomic outlook is currently the 
most significant risk. The risk management 
strategy in place to mitigate against this 
risk includes the regular monitoring of key 
risk indicators and scenario-based 
modelling of plausible economic 
trajectories. No emerging risks have been 
identified through the risk management 
process.

Climate reporting
The Committee has updates from the 
sustainability team on how Landsec is 
implementing the requirements of the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure (TCFD), the evolving reporting 
landscape for climate risks and our 
approach to climate risk identification, 
assessment and strategy. 

We have continued to make disclosures 
that are consistent with the TCFD 
recommendations and will continue to 
monitor these. Our TCFD disclosures can 
be found on pages 47 to 53.

Fire safety remediation 
Following the introduction of the Building 
Safety Act 2022, the Committee has been 
updated on work to assess our liability for 
fire remediation works on residential buildings 
developed by Group over the last 30 years. 
The Committee has regularly considered, 
alongside the external auditor, the level of 
the provision required, how the provision is 
determined and the associated disclosures.

Financial statements
The Group’s financial statements are of 
critical importance to investors and the 
Committee monitors the integrity of the 
Group’s reporting process and financial 
management. It scrutinises the full and 
half-yearly financial statements before 
proposing them to the Board for approval. 
The Committee reviews in detail the work 
of the external auditor and external valuers 
and any significant financial judgements 
and estimates made by management to 
ensure that it is satisfied with the outcome.

I am pleased to say that the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) included some 
disclosures from our 2022 Annual Report 
in its publication “What Makes a Good 
Annual Report and Accounts”, as they 
were considered examples of best practice.

Asset valuation
The valuation of our assets is an important 
constituent of our financial results and 
measurement of our performance. For a 
number of years CBRE has been the principal 
valuer of our entire portfolio, however in 
order to increase market insight and future 
flexibility, Jones Lang LaSalle Limited (JLL) 
has been appointed to value a large 
proportion of Landsec’s retail portfolio with 
effect from 31 March 2023. CBRE will continue 
to value the office portfolio and some of 
the retail portfolio. Both CBRE and JLL are 
industry-leading agencies with extensive 
expertise and appropriate knowledge who

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance089

provide us with an external valuation of our 
portfolio twice a year, in accordance with 
the relevant industry standards.

The valuation process requires the valuers 
to evaluate the likely future financial 
performance of each individual asset 
and apply recent, relevant transactional 
evidence in the market to determine 
an appropriate value at the period end. 
The Committee analyses, challenges 
and debates the valuations prepared 
by the valuers who attend Committee 
meetings for this purpose at the half and 
full year-end. The external valuation process 
and the values ascribed to specific assets 
are also reviewed independently by our 
auditor, EY, as part of its audit scope.

Acquisitions and disposals 
During the year, Landsec progressed 
with its strategy to accelerate growth 
through recycling capital into higher 
return opportunities through a number 
of significant disposals of 32-50 Strand, 
21 Moorfields and One New Street Square, 
and securing 100% ownership of St David’s 
shopping centre in Cardiff via the 
acquisition of the remaining 50% interest. 
The Committee considered the accounting 
treatment and disclosures of these material 
transactions and concluded that they 
were appropriate. 

Provisions for bad debt
The Committee has continued to closely 
monitor the cash collections of rents across 
the whole portfolio. The rent collection 
statistics are strong and although there 
remains bad debt provisions in respect of 
some occupiers who have been or may be 
unable to satisfy their rent obligations, the 
provisions have decreased from last year. 
Continual monitoring of the provisions is 
undertaken by the Committee particularly 
in light of the uncertain macro-environment. 

Internal audit
Until mid-summer 2022, the internal audit 
function was an in-house team which sat 
within the Risk and Assurance team and 
although this was operating effectively, 
it was considered an appropriate time to 

appoint an external third party which 
would increase flexibility over audits and 
improve the quality of the audits as a 
result of access to current best practice 
and subject matter expertise. Following 
a tender process, KPMG were selected 
as the preferred provider and since their 
appointment have undertaken stakeholder 
interviews to understand Landsec’s key 
risks, reviewed the internal audit plan 
and agreed an internal audit charter. 
They have completed audits on Turnover 
Rents, Car Park Income and Investment 
Appraisal. Eleven further audits are planned 
for the year ended 31 March 2024 and will 
include, amongst others, Treasury and 
Cash Management, U+I Post integration, 
Risk Management and ESG. 

Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee considered the Company’s 
2023 Annual Report in the round and 
concluded and recommended to the Board 
that, taken as a whole the 2023 Annual 
Report is fair, balanced and understandable. 

Going concern and viability statement
We continue to focus on the 
appropriateness of adopting the going 
concern assumption in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2023 particularly in light of the 
uncertain macroeconomic environment. 
The going concern statement is set out 
on pages 60 and 61, along with the viability 
statement and the rationale behind the 
chosen five-year time horizon. 

Audit tender
As highlighted last year, we were required 
to tender our audit as EY were approaching 
being in office for ten years having 
performed their first audit for Landsec for 
the year end 31 March 2014. A competitive 
and thorough tender process was 
undertaken during the year and following 
in depth consideration, the Committee and 
the Board concluded that EY remained the 
appropriate auditor for Landsec. EY would 
ensure continued independence through 
a change in partner with effect from 
July 2022. The appointment is subject to 
shareholder approval at the 2023 Annual 
General Meeting. 

UK Corporate Governance Code/ 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
Guidance on Audit Committees 
The Committee considered its compliance 
with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the FRC Guidance on Audit 
Committees and continues to believe that 
we have addressed both the spirit and the 
requirements of each. In addition, the 
Committee has been regularly monitoring 
the potential changes to the new corporate 
governance regime and preparing for its 
implementation, including reviewing a draft 
audit and assurance policy.

Committee effectiveness
During the first half of the year the 
Committee requested that a specific 
effectiveness survey was undertaken to 
supplement and support the Board and 
Committee annual evaluations. This 
in-depth review was undertaken by internal 
audit and concluded that the Committee 
is operating well and should maintain many 
of its existing practices. The internal Board 
evaluation was undertaken later in the year, 
which also highlighted the high standards 
of the Committee. 

The Committee welcomed Miles Roberts 
who joined as a member of the Committee 
in September 2022, replacing Christophe 
Evain. Myself and the Committee would 
like to thank Christophe for his valued 
contributions. 

I continue to appreciate the valuable input 
from the other members of the Audit 
Committee, management and the key 
advisers EY, KPMG, CBRE and JLL and would 
like to thank them for their support during 
the year.

Structure and operations
The Audit Committee’s structure and 
operations are governed by terms of 
reference, which are reviewed annually 
and approved by the Board. These were 
last approved in March 2023. The terms 
of reference are available on our website: 
landsec.com/aboutcorporate-
governance/board-committees.

To maintain effective communication 
between all relevant parties, and in support 
of its activities, the Chairman of the Board, 
Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, 
Company Secretary, Director of Risk and 
Assurance, the partner and representatives 
of our external auditor, EY, the partner and 
representatives of our internal auditor, KPMG 
and other members of the senior finance 
team regularly attend Committee meetings.

All directors are invited to attend meetings 
when the Group’s external valuers, CBRE, 
and JLL, present their full year and half-
year property valuation.

The Committee has private and informal 
sessions with the EY audit team and the 
CBRE and JLL valuation teams to ensure 
that open lines of communication exist, 
in case they wish to raise any concerns 
outside of formal meetings.

The Committee members are all 
independent Non-executive Directors and 
collectively have a broad range of financial, 
commercial and property sector expertise 
that enables them to provide oversight of 
both financial and risk matters, and to 
advise the Board accordingly. The Board 
has determined that Nicholas Cadbury, 
as Chairman of the Committee, has recent 
and relevant financial experience for the 
purposes of satisfying the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Details of the experience 
of all members of the Committee can be 
found on pages 66 and 67.

The Committee works to a structured 
programme of activities and meetings 
to coincide with key events around our 
financial calendar and, on behalf of the 
Board, to provide oversight of the Group’s 
risk management process. Following each 

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance 
 
091

meeting, the Committee Chairman reports 
on the main discussion points and findings 
to the Board.

Risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk 
management framework and risk appetite 
and is supported by the Committee 
through its monitoring and reviewing of 
the effectiveness of risk management and 
internal control processes during the year. 

An overview of Landsec’s approach to risk 
management, its risk management 
framework and governance, risk appetite, 
management and assurance of risks and 
principal risks and uncertainties are 
described on pages 54-59. The risk 
management framework includes the 
Board’s strategic overview, the Executive 
Leadership Team’s detailed review of the 
business risks, controls and mitigation 
strategies, and the assessment of the 
effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal controls system by the Audit 
Committee. A risk waterfall uses indicators 
to highlight whether each risk is within our 
appetite. This allows the Committee to 
consider whether principal risks are 
changing and whether the risk appetite 
remains appropriate. In response to changes 
in Landsec’s organisational structure, the risk 
management framework has been redefined 
in order to ensure clarity on roles and 
responsibilities at all levels and to embed 
risk management within the business.

Primary responsibility for the operation 
of the Company’s internal control and 
risk management systems, which extend 
to include financial, operational and 
compliance controls (and accord with the 
FRC’s 2014 ‘Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting’), has been delegated 
to management. 

These systems have been designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk 
of failure to achieve the Group’s business 
goals and can provide only reasonable, 
not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.

Risk assurance and internal control
Under the overall supervision of the 
Committee, there are several sub-
committees and working groups that give 
assurance over risks being managed within 
the business. The Group has a Director of 
Risk and Assurance (with a direct reporting 
line to the Audit Committee Chairman) who 
provides regular oversight of risk matters, 
evaluates emerging risks and monitors 
compliance to ensure that any mitigating 
actions are properly managed and 
completed. During the year the Committee 
benefited from regular updates from the 
technology team who provided detailed 
information on the progress of the projects 
to improve information security, cyber 
threat and processes to assist with financial 
controls. In addition, the EY team now 
includes a partner with expertise on 
technology and cyber.

Internal audits are carried out in accordance 
with an agreed annual assurance plan and 
reviewed by the Committee throughout the 
year. This plan was previously undertaken 
by the in-house internal audit team and is 
now the responsibility of KPMG who were 
appointed as internal auditor during the year 
following a tender process. It was considered 
appropriate to appoint a third party in order 
to increase flexibility over the audits and 
improve the quality of the audits due to 
access to current best practice and subject 
matter expertise.

Both the in-house team and KPMG have 
provided assurance to the Committee on 
key controls and programme assurance 
and identified improvements in key 
financial processes.

The key elements of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems 
are as follows:

 • an established organisational structure 

with clear lines of responsibility, approval 
levels and delegated authorities
 • a disciplined internal governance 
structure which facilitates regular 
performance review and decision making

 • a comprehensive strategic and business 

planning review

 • a robust budgeting, forecasting and 

financial reporting process

 • various policies, procedures and 

guidelines underpinning the development, 
asset management and financing 
operations of the business

 • a compliance certification process 

conducted in relation to the half-yearly 
and full year results, and business 
activities generally

 • a quarterly key controls self-certification 

by management

 • an internal audit function provided by 

KPMG whose work spans the whole Group

 • a focused post-acquisition review and 
integration programme to ensure the 
Group’s governance, procedures, 
standards and control environment are 
implemented effectively and on time
 • a financial and property information 

management system

 • a whistleblowing process that enables 
concerns to be reported confidentially 
and on an anonymous basis and for those 
concerns to be investigated.

Additionally, the Committee discusses on 
a quarterly basis:
 • the Group’s significant and emerging 

risks, and how exposures have changed 
during the period

 • the effectiveness of internal controls and 

processes at mitigating those risks

 • internal audit reports, summary reports 
of findings and recommendations from 
completion of the internal audit plan
 • progress against completion of agreed 
actions from the internal audit reports.

The Committee was satisfied that the 
system of risk management and internal 
controls has been effective throughout 
the year.

Report of the Audit Committee  
continued

External auditor
EY are Landsec’s external auditor and are 
engaged to conduct a statutory audit and 
express an opinion on the Company’s and 
the Group’s financial statements.

Their audit scope includes a review of the 
property valuation process and methodology 
using its own chartered surveyors (more 
details below), to the extent necessary to 
express an audit opinion.

When carrying out its statutory audit 
work, EY also has access to a broader range 
of employees and different parts of the 
business. If it picks up any information as 
part of this process, it would report to the 
Audit Committee anything that it believes 
the Committee should know in order to 
fulfil its duties and responsibilities. As audit 
partner, Julie Carlyle is authorised to 
contact the Committee Chairman directly 
at any time to raise any matter of concern.

Audit plan
EY presented its proposed audit plan 
(reviewed by senior management and the 
Director of Risk and Assurance), to the 
Committee for discussion. The objective 
was to ensure that the focus of its work 
remained aligned to the Group’s structure 
and strategy.

The Committee is keen to ensure that 
its auditor feels able to challenge 
management and is afforded all the access 
it requires to report on matters that may 
not be part of the statutory audit but 
which, in the opinion of the auditor, should 
be brought to the attention of the Audit 
Committee. These matters may be financial 
or non-financial and may be based on fact 
or opinion (including any concern over 
culture or behaviour). An example may be 
the use or adequacy of any controls used 
by the Company to detect any fraud or 
improper behaviour.

EY is afforded such access through 
attendance at each Committee meeting, 
supported by other meetings held during the 
year with the Committee or the Committee 
Chairman without management being 

present and the knowledge that it can raise 
any matter of concern to the Committee 
Chairman at any time without going 
through management. These regular 
discussions were useful to the Committee 
but no matters of concern emerged. 

Independence and objectivity
The Committee is responsible for 
monitoring and reviewing the objectivity 
and independence of the external auditor. 
In undertaking its annual assessment, the 
Committee took into account the UK 
Ethical Independence Standards introduced 
by the FRC in December 2019 and effective 
from 15 March 2020.

The Committee reviewed:
 • the confirmation from EY that it 
maintains appropriate internal 
safeguards in line with applicable 
professional standards, together with an 
explanation of the due diligence process 
followed to provide such a confirmation
 • the mitigation actions we take in seeking 
to safeguard EY’s independent status, 
including the operation of policies 
designed to regulate the amount of 
non-audit services provided by EY and 
the employment of former EY employees

 • the tenure of the audit engagement 
partner (not being greater than five 
years); Julie Carlyle was appointed as 
EY audit partner to the Group in July 2022

 • the internal performance and 

effectiveness review of EY referred 
to above.

No Committee member has any 
connection with the current auditor.

Taking the above review into account, the 
Committee concluded that EY remained 
objective and independent in its role as 
external auditor.

Effectiveness of the external audit
Following the issue of our Annual Report 
each year, the Director of Risk and 
Assurance conducts a performance 
evaluation and effectiveness review of the 
external audit. This is conducted against 

structured guidelines in consultation with 
the Executive Directors and members of the 
senior finance team and members of the 
Audit Committee to whom they report. 
The Committee Chairman met privately 
with the audit engagement partner before 
the Committee meeting to consider the 
results of the effectiveness review. The 
Committee’s preliminary view is that EY 
has continued to perform its audit services 
effectively and to a high standard, and this 
is consistent with performance each year 
since appointment in 2013. Areas identified 
for development will be shared with EY for 
inclusion in its audit and service delivery 
plans going forward.

Audit tendering
EY was first appointed to the office 
of auditor in respect of the 2013/14 
financial year.

Under current regulations, we were required 
to re-tender the audit by no later than the 
2023/24 financial year and therefore a 
competitive audit tender process was 
undertaken during the year which concluded 
that EY remained the appropriate auditor 
for Landsec, as recommended by the Audit 
Committee and approved by the Board. 
The evaluation criteria used during the 
tender process included the capability and 
competence of the audit partner, team 
and firm, the audit approach and service, 
cultural fit, quality of deliverables and 
presentation, and fees. EY were selected 
because the proposed team would provide a 
mix of continuity and embedded knowledge 
with the comfort of independence via a new 
partner, their ability to provide a partner 
with technology expertise embedded within 
the team, a strong commitment on audit 
approach and service, and a driven and 
enthusiastic outlook. 

The decision on the appointment was made 
by the Board without any influence by a 
third party, and without any contractual 
term of the kind mentioned in Article 16(6) 
of the Audit Regulation being imposed on 
the Company. 

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance093

EY will be appointed for the 31 March 2024 
financial year at this year’s Annual General 
Meeting, subject to shareholder approval.

The Company has complied with the 
Statutory Audit Services Order 2014 for 
the year under review.

Audit fee
The audit fees payable to EY for 2022/23 
(including the audit of the Group’s joint 
ventures) are £1.8m (2021/22: £1.8m). 
This fee takes into account a reduction in 
the number of Group subsidiaries that will 
be audited as they have taken advantage 
of the exemption from having accounts 
audited under s479A-479C of the 
Companies Act 2006.

Non-audit services
To help safeguard EY’s objectivity and 
independence, we operate a non-audit 
services policy that sets out the 
circumstances and financial limits within 
which EY may be permitted to provide 
certain non-audit services.

EY was engaged during the year to provide 
non-audit services to the Group relating 
to the Company’s half-yearly review, the 
assurance statement on sustainability, 
non-statutory audit of the Security Group, 
work in relation to the update of the 
bond programme documentation and the 
issuance of the Green bond. It was decided 
that it would be in the interest of the 
Company to use EY for these services, 
recognising that the use of audit firms for 
non-audit work should generally be kept to a 
minimum. Total fees for non-audit services, 
amounted to £359,000. Details of the fees 
charged by EY during the year can be found 
in note 8 to the financial statements.

No non-audit fees were approved or paid 
on a contingent basis.

External valuations and valuers
The valuation of the Group’s property 
portfolio, including properties held within 
the development programme and in joint 
arrangements, is undertaken by external 
valuers. The Group provides input, such 
as source data, and support to the 
valuation process. CBRE has been the 
Company’s principal valuer since 2015 
and Jones Lang LaSalle Limited (JLL) was 
appointed as joint valuer to undertake 
the valuation of a large part of the retail 
portfolio whilst CBRE will retain the 
valuation of the office portfolio and some 
of the retail portfolio. This change was 
implemented to increase market insight 
and future flexibility, and therefore the 
overall quality of the valuations.

The valuation helps to determine a 
significant part of the Group’s total 
property return and net asset value, which 
have consequential implications for the 
Group’s reported performance and the level 
of variable remuneration received by senior 
management through bonus and long-term 
incentive schemes. Accordingly, the scrutiny 
of each valuation and the valuer’s 
objectivity and effectiveness represent an 
important part of the Committee’s work.

Valuations for the half-year results were 
presented to the Committee by CBRE, and 
by CBRE and JLL for the full-year results. 
These were reviewed and challenged by the 
Committee, with reference to each valuer’s 
approach, methodology, valuation basis 
and underlying property and market 
assumptions. Other Non-executive 
Directors attended the full and half-year 
presentations. The Committee Chairman 
and other members of the Committee also 
had separate meetings with the valuer’s 
as part of this process to provide an 
opportunity to test and challenge the 
valuation outcomes and the principles 
and evidence used in the determination.

Additionally, CBRE and JLL met with EY 
and exchanged information independently 
of management. EY has experienced 
chartered surveyors on its team who 
consider the valuer’s qualifications and 
assess and challenge the valuation 
approach, assumptions and judgements 
made by them. Their audit procedures are 
targeted at addressing the risks in respect 
of the valuations and the potential for any 
undue management influence in arriving 
at them. This year 41 properties (comprising 
78% of the portfolio) were identified for 
substantive review by its valuation experts 
primarily on the basis of their value, type, 
risk profile, commitments to ESG and 
location. The Committee reviewed the 
auditor’s findings.

An internal evaluation of the valuers’ 
performance and effectiveness will be 
conducted after the year-end results 
are finalised, with the results reported 
to the Committee.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance094

Report of the Audit Committee  
continued

The Committee considered the independence 
of the valuers and has noted that CBRE and 
JLL check for conflicts of interest and seek 
approval for non-valuation activity and this 
process has been effective during the year. 
CBRE and JLL have also confirmed that 
their valuation departments operate 
separately from other advisory activity, 
and their valuation remuneration is not 
linked to other non-valuation work that 
they undertake.

A fixed-fee arrangement (subject to 
adjustment for acquisitions and disposals) 
is in place with the valuers for the valuation 
of the Group’s properties and, given the 
importance of their work, we have disclosed 
the fees paid to them in note 9 to the 
financial statements. These fees reflect 
the valuers work on the year-end and 
half-yearly valuations as well as other work 
on agency services including investment 
activity. The total valuation fees paid by the 
Company to CBRE and JLL during the year 
represented less than 5% of their total fee 
income for the year.

Significant financial matters 
The Committee reviewed four significant 
financial matters in connection with the 
financial statements, namely the valuation 
of the Group’s property portfolio, revenue 
recognition, fire safety remediation 
provisions and significant acquisitions and 
disposals. Further details are set out in the 
table on page 95.

These items were considered to be 
significant taking into account the level of 
materiality and the degree of judgement 
exercised by management and, in respect 
of the valuation, the external valuers. 

upgrades and improvements), going 
concern, and other specific areas of 
individual property and audit focus.

The Committee was satisfied that all issues 
had been fully and adequately addressed 
and that the judgements made were 
reasonable and appropriate and had been 
reviewed and debated with the external 
auditor who concurred with the approach 
taken by management.

Non-financial matters
The Committee understands the level of 
reliance that is placed by shareholders on 
the statutory audit and the report of the 
external auditor. 

We report on alternative performance 
measures on page 199. The Committee 
debated and discussed these measures 
and agreed that they were appropriate 
for the business.

Fair, balanced and understandable 
The Committee applied the same due 
diligence approach adopted in previous 
years in order to assess whether the 
Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable, one of the key UK 
Corporate Governance Code requirements. 
The Committee received assurance from 
the verification process carried out on 
the content of the Annual Report by the 
Executive Leadership Team to ensure 
consistent reporting and the existence of 
appropriate links between key messages 
and relevant sections of the Annual Report. 
Particular attention has been given this 
year to the consistency of the narrative 
disclosures around climate risks, our 
strategy and the financial statements.

In addition, the Committee considered, 
and made onward recommendations to the 
Board, as appropriate, in respect of other 
key matters including impairment of trade 
receivables, including lease incentive 
balances, development contracts, pensions 
buy-in, maintenance of the Group’s REIT 
status, financial systems transformation 
(including controls, processes and system 

Taking the above into account, together 
with the views expressed by EY, the 
Committee recommended, and in turn 
the Board confirmed, that the 2023 Annual 
Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
necessary information for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.

Whistleblowing policy
The Audit Committee provides a regular 
whistleblowing update to the Board, which 
has overall responsibility for whistleblowing. 
The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s 
Speak up policy which allows employees 
and third parties to report concerns about 
suspected impropriety or wrongdoing 
(whether financial or otherwise) on a 
confidential basis, and anonymously if 
preferred. This includes an independent 
third-party reporting facility comprising 
a telephone hotline and an alternative 
online process. Any matters reported are 
investigated by the Company Secretary, 
Chief People Officer and the Director of 
Risk and Assurance and escalated to the 
Committee, as appropriate. During the year 
two whistleblowing incidents were reported. 
One matter was investigated and no 
concerns or action were required following 
conclusion of the investigation. The second 
matter, which was reported close to the 
year-end is being fully investigated. 

We monitor whistleblowing awareness and 
remind employees that a dedicated hotline 
exists should they ever need to ‘blow the 
whistle’. The arrangements also form part 
of the induction programme for new 
employees. Details of the whistleblowing 
hotline are included in our Supply Chain 
Commitment, Sustainability Toolkit, 
procurement tender documentation, 
on our website, and at our assets and 
development sites.

Significant financial matters 

Significant financial matters – what is the risk?

How the Committee addressed the matters

Valuation of the Group’s property portfolio 
(including investment properties, investment properties 
held in joint ventures)
The valuation of the Group’s property portfolio is a major 
determinant of the Group’s performance and drives an element 
of the variable remuneration for senior management. Although the 
portfolio valuation is conducted by an external valuer, the nature 
of the valuation estimates is inherently subjective and requires 
significant judgements to be made by management and the valuer.

Significant assumptions and judgements made by the valuer in 
determining valuations may include the appropriate yield (based on 
recent market evidence), changes to market rents (ERVs), what will 
occur at the end of each lease, the level of non-recoverable costs 
and alternative uses. Development valuations also include 
assumptions around costs to complete the development, the level 
of letting at completion, incentives, lease terms and the length of 
time space remains void.

Revenue recognition (including the timing of revenue 
recognition and the treatment of lease incentives)
Certain transactions require management to make judgements 
as to whether and to what extent they should be recognised as 
revenue in the year. Market expectations and EPRA earnings targets 
may place pressure on management to distort revenue recognition. 
This may result in overstatement or deferral of revenues to assist in 
meeting current or future targets or expectations, including through 
incorrect treatment of lease incentives.

Completeness of provisions for fire safety remediation works

Following the Grenfell Tower disaster, a series of new fire safety 
regulations were introduced which impact the Group’s residential 
portfolio. Additionally, the Building Safety Act was enacted on 
28 April 2022, with the related leaseholder protections coming 
into force on 28 June 2022. 

These require companies to assess whether their properties are 
safe to use and perform remedial building works where they are 
not, including properties which are no longer owned. Management 
have therefore undertaken a review of which properties, in both 
the current portfolio and previously owned, are impacted by this 
legislation and which require remediation works. There is a risk that 
management do not identify all properties where fire remediation 
works are required.

Significant acquisitions and disposals 

Certain transactions require management to make judgements 
on accounting treatment, including how a profit or loss is 
recognised and calculated, and how a contract is interpreted. 

There is a risk that profits and losses on disposals are overstated or 
understated respectively, or asset ownership is incorrectly recorded.

The Audit Committee adopts a formal approach by which the valuation process, 
methodology, assumptions and outcomes are reviewed and robustly challenged. 
This includes separate review and scrutiny by management, the Committee 
Chairman and the Committee itself. The Group uses CBRE and JLL, both leading 
firms in the UK property market, as its principal valuers. It also involves EY as the 
external auditor which is assisted by its own specialist team of chartered surveyors 
who are familiar with the valuation approach and the UK property market.

EY met with the valuers separately from management and its remit extends to 
confirming that no undue influence has been exerted by management in relation 
to the valuers arriving at their valuations.

CBRE and JLL submit their valuation reports to the Committee as part of the 
half-yearly (CBRE only as JLL were not yet appointed as principal valuer) and full 
year results process. Both valuers were asked to attend and present their reports 
to the Board and to highlight any significant judgements made or disagreements 
which existed between them and management.

CBRE and JLL proposed changes to the values of our properties and developments 
during the year, which were discussed by the Committee in detail and accepted.

Based on the degree of oversight and challenge applied to the valuation process, the 
Committee concluded that the valuations had each been conducted appropriately, 
objectively and in accordance with the valuer’s professional standards.

The Committee and EY considered the main areas of judgement exercised by 
management in accounting for matters related to revenue recognition, including 
timing and treatment of rents, incentives, surrender premiums and other 
property-related revenue.

In its assessment, the Committee considered all relevant facts, challenged the 
recoverability of occupier incentives, the options that management had in terms 
of accounting treatment and the appropriateness of the judgements made by 
management. These matters had themselves been the subject of prior discussion 
between EY and management.

The Committee, having considered the views of EY, concurred with the 
judgements made by management and was satisfied that the revenue reported 
for the year had been appropriately recognised.

The Committee has been briefed throughout the year on the changes to the 
regulations and legislation, and management have provided detail on the process 
for identifying properties that are in scope for remediation assessment and the 
amount of any provisions required. 

The Audit Committee has discussed the fire remediation works provisions in detail 
at its meetings throughout the year and has heard from EY on their procedures 
for understanding the completeness of management’s review. The Committee 
has concluded that the procedures for identifying in scope properties, the 
assessment of fire remediation works and the level of the provision is appropriate.

The Audit Committee has considered the accounting treatment of a number 
of complex sale and acquisition contracts during the year, particularly those for 
21 Moorfields, One New Street Square and the remaining interest of St David’s. 

These transactions and the proposed accounting treatment were explained 
by management and the Committee thoroughly reviewed the appropriate 
treatment. 

The Committee was satisfied, based on its review and having considered the 
views of EY, that the accounting treatment was appropriate.

The above description of the significant financial matters should be read in conjunction with the Independent Auditor’s Report on pages 121 
to 128 and the significant accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

Directors’ Remuneration Report –  
Chairman’s Annual Statement

Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present, 
on behalf of the Board, 
the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 
31 March 2023.

late 2020, creating balance sheet resilience 
and optionality for future growth. 

We are a purpose-led business and aim 
to create value for all stakeholders. Our 
strategy for the coming year continues 
to focus on shaping Central London offices, 
major retail destinations and mixed-use 
urban neighbourhoods.

This year, the Executive Team has delivered 
strong operational results and continued to 
pro-actively execute the strategy, despite 
increased macroeconomic uncertainty. 
Our performance has been underpinned by 
a strong balance sheet, creating significant 
optionality for future growth.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
We have continued to operate under 
the Remuneration Policy approved by 
shareholders at our 2021 AGM. The 
Committee believes that the Policy provides 
strong alignment with our ambitious 
strategy whilst following best practice in 
corporate governance and providing an 
appropriate level of flexibility. We are next 
due to put forward an updated Policy for 
approval at the 2024 AGM and the 
Committee will start the process to 
review the Policy this summer.

Performance for the 2022/23 
financial year
During the course of the year, executive 
management has continued to drive the 
business strategy forward. In Central 
London we delivered continued strong 
leasing results as well as the disposal of 
£1.4bn of mature offices. In retail we 
delivered strong leasing momentum via 
our differentiated brand focused platform 
capitalising on the ‘flight to prime’, with 
6.9% year on year sales growth. In mixed-
use we have secured planning consent 
for our major Finchley Road project and 
signed a drawdown agreement for the 
first phase of land at Mayfield, progressing 
preparations for our 11m sq ft pipeline. 
Despite the general macro challenges, 
our performance highlights the high quality 
of the Landsec platform and portfolio and 
strong progress on executing strategy since 

For the year ended 31 March 2023, 
whilst asset values decreased by 7.7% 
in aggregate owing to wider economic 
conditions, EPRA earnings were up 10.7% 
and net debt has reduced by £0.9bn, 
reducing LTV by 2.7% to 31.7% in line 
with our LTV target range of 25% to 40% 
and net debt/EBITDA from 9.7x to 7.0x. 
Our current development pipeline is 60% 
pre-let or under offer. In Central London, 
£48m of lettings were completed or in 
solicitors’ hands, 5% ahead of valuers’ 
assumptions, and occupancy up 110bps 
to 95.9%. In Major retail destinations, 
£38m of lettings were completed or in 
solicitors’ hands, 9% ahead of ERV with 
occupancy up 110bps to 94.3%. These 
results are clearly reflected in the variable 
pay awarded to the Executive Directors. 

Annual bonus performance
The performance of the Executive Team 
has been both focused and decisive, with 
progress made in all areas of the strategic 
plan that was set out at the start of the 
year. This performance was achieved 
despite increased macroeconomic 
uncertainties including inflation tensions 
owing to geopolitical issues and the energy 
crisis leading to increased interest rates. 
Significant achievements include completing 
on key transactions at attractive prices 
including the sale of 21 Moorfields and 
One New Street Square. We further 
strengthened our sector-leading balance 
sheet with the issue of our inaugural 
£400m Green bond in challenging bond 
market conditions. We also carried out 
an organisational restructure enabling 
us to hold overhead costs stable year on 
year despite rising inflation. This leaves 
the Group well placed to pursue growth 
opportunities. The acquisition of the

against the targets resulted in overall bonus 
outcomes of 50% of maximum (equating 
to 75.04% of salary), which is considered 
to be appropriate in the context of the 
performance of the business.

Long-Term Incentive Plan 
performance
Vesting of the 2020 LTIP in 2023 was 
determined by performance against two 
equally weighted measures of Total 
Property Return (TPR) and Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) relative to FTSE 350 real estate 
companies. Performance under the TPR 
measure was below threshold while TSR 
was between threshold and maximum over 
the three years to 31 March 2023. As such, 
and after consideration of the value of the 
shares expected to vest, 37.69% of the 
2020 LTIP awards will vest. 

In addition, the 2021 buyout award granted 
to Vanessa Simms was determined by 
performance measured against the same 
targets as the 2021 LTIP award, albeit over 
two years to 31 March 2023. Performance 
against the Total Accounting Return (TAR) 
measure (now called Total Return on Equity 
(TRE)) was below threshold, TSR was upper 
quartile and ESG (reduction in carbon 
emissions) was above maximum over the 
two years to 31 March 2023. As such, 60% 
of the 2021 buyout award will vest.

Executive Director change
Colette O’Shea left the Board on 
30 September 2022 and stepped down 
from her role as Chief Operating Officer 
with effect from 31 March 2023 after a 
transitional period. 

Discretion
No positive discretion was exercised in 
the year ended 31 March 2023. Negative 
discretion has been used to reduce the 
value of an unbudgeted surrender premium 
received from EPRA earnings prior to 
calculating the annual bonus outcome. 
This was recommended by management 
and agreed by the Committee given that 
the surrender premium was unbudgeted 
and was not therefore factored into the 
original earnings targets.

Executive remuneration 2023/24
1. Base salary
From 1 June 2023, Executive Director 
salaries will increase by 4%. The payrise 
across the wider workforce was 6.75% 
(5% of which was accelerated and paid 
from 1 January 2023 to assist employees 
with the cost of living crisis). This was in 
addition to a one-off award of £1,000 paid 
to all employees earning below £40,000 p.a. 

2. Pension and benefits
Consistent with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, Executive Director 
pension contributions are aligned to the 
wider workforce at 10.5% of salary. No 
changes will be made to benefit provision 
other than a switch from a car to a travel 
allowance for Vanessa Simms.

3. Annual bonus
For the year ending 31 March 2024, Executive 
Directors will be eligible for an annual bonus 
of up to 150% of salary. Our bonus scheme, 
which remains aligned to our strategy, 
combines stretching targets for earnings, 
Total Return on Equity (TRE) (previously 
known as Total Accounting Return (TAR)) 
and ESG for the year ending 31 March 2024. 
Personal objectives will continue to apply 
for a minority of the award.

4. Long-Term Incentive Plan
We intend to grant awards under the 
LTIP in June 2023 which will be subject 
to performance conditions measured 
over a three-year performance period. 
Performance targets will continue to be 
based on TRE (previously known as TAR), 
relative TSR, and carbon reduction. Any 
awards which vest will be subject to a 
two-year post-vesting holding period.

Remuneration across the Company 
The Committee oversees all remuneration 
policies and practices across the organisation, 
and is regularly briefed by the Chief People 
Officer in this regard. The Committee takes 
account of the interests of all internal and 
external stakeholders when making any 
decisions on remuneration matters. During 
the year ended 31 March 2023, we continued 
to grant LTIP awards below the Executive 
Leadership Team, more closely aligning those 
who execute our strategy on a daily basis 
with the interests of our shareholders.

Employee voice
In April 2023, I took the opportunity to 
meet with members of our Employee Forum 
(which represents the wider Landsec 
workforce). This is an important activity 
and I was pleased to answer a number of 
questions posed by the forum on pay ratios, 
pay structures, LTIPs, base salary and 
investor views on remuneration. 

Effectiveness
During the year the Committee reviewed 
its own effectiveness and the effectiveness 
of FIT as advisers to the Committee. 
Overall, the Committee was satisfied with 
the effectiveness of both. Follow-up actions 
included streamlining Committee processes 
and ensuring proactive responses to issues 
and advice.

Conclusion
Despite increased macroeconomic 
uncertainty, Landsec’s Executive Team 
continue to lead the business to deliver 
strong operational results and active 
execution on strategy. I am grateful for the 
engagement and support provided by our 
shareholders and welcome your feedback.

Annual Report  
on Remuneration continued

1.2 Payments to former directors
As announced on 9 September 2022, following almost 20 years at Landsec, Colette O’Shea ceased to be a director of the Company on 
30 September 2022 and stepped down from her role as Chief Operating Officer with effect from 31 March 2023 after a transitional period. 
In respect of her remuneration arrangements, she:
 • received £281,906 in respect of her salary and normal benefits between 1 October 2022 and 31 March 2023 after leaving the Board. 

She will continue to be an employee until the end of her 12-month notice period on 8 September 2023 and will continue to receive her 
salary and normal benefits during the remainder of her employment

 • was eligible to receive an annual bonus in respect of the 2023 financial year to reflect her time served as Chief Operating Officer, subject 
to the satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria and determined on the normal timetable in line with the shareholder approved 
Remuneration Policy 

 • will not be eligible to receive an annual bonus in respect of the 2024 financial year
 • was treated as a good leaver in respect of her outstanding:

 — deferred bonus awards, which will continue and vest on the normal vesting dates

 — LTIP awards which will vest on their normal vesting dates, subject to the satisfaction of applicable performance conditions and time 
pro-rating. A two year post-vesting holding period will apply as normal. To the extent that awards vest, dividend equivalents may be 
credited where applicable

 — options under the Company’s Sharesave plan, which will be exercisable (to the extent of her savings as at the date of exercise) within 

six months after she ceases to be an employee

 • will receive a statutory redundancy payment of £15,417 calculated in accordance with applicable legislation and will be paid in lieu of any 
accrued holiday that cannot be taken. She will also receive a contribution of up to £14,500 (excluding VAT) in respect of legal fees and up 
to £70,000 (excluding VAT) in respect of outplacement support

 • will comply with the Company’s post-cessation shareholding requirements.

Other than the amounts disclosed above, Colette will not be eligible for any remuneration payments or payments for loss of office.

1.3 Annual bonus outturn
In the year under review, Executive Directors had the potential to receive a maximum annual bonus of up to 150% of base salary. Of this, 
120% of salary was dependent on meeting Group targets and 30% of salary was dependent on meeting personal objectives. All targets 
were set at the beginning of the year. The following table confirms the targets and their respective outcomes.

Major disposals were successfully executed (including the disposal of £1.4bn of mature offices). 
The London development pipeline was progressed, while preserving optionality and 100% 
of St David’s in Cardiff was secured. Combined, this activity accounted for c.46% of all 
investment activity in the City and c.24% of central London overall across the year, resulting 
in one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and the retention of Landsec’s strong 
investment grade rating.

Following effective Board and Senior Leader engagement, the strategy was refreshed 
successfully in the context of the current/expected market conditions, our future office 
proposition, a longer-term view of the future of retail, the residential strategy and the 
acceleration of growth.

New business planning cycle and streamlined organisation design launched, resulting in 
a reduction to overhead costs despite inflationary pressures.

Following the publication of Landsec’s refreshed Green Financing Framework, Landsec launched 
its first Green bond to enhance Landsec’s financial capacity and flexibility and leave it well 
placed to continue to deliver against the strategy.

While steps were taken to refresh Landsec’s D&I strategy, with greater focus on leadership 
accountability and data driven action, there is still progress to be made in respect of delivering 
the D&I strategy. As such, this target was considered to be partially met.

The CEO and CFO sponsored the core business systems change programme, ensuring that it 
remained on track with important decisions being made in a timely manner. 

During 2022/23, the CFO championed a detailed review of cyber security, the conclusions of 
which led to substantial and rapid improvements.

The personal objectives were considered by the Committee to have been largely met. On assessment, they delivered an outcome of 17% 
out of 20% against the CEO’s personal and shared targets and 17% out of 20% against the CFO’s personal and shared targets. These 
results (i.e. 85% of maximum against both sets of targets) are consistent with the strong operational performance delivered in 2022/23.

3. The difference between the value of the shares under awards vesting (£6.69 per share) and the value of the shares at grant (£5.47 per share). 

The Committee reviewed the estimated LTIP vesting values set out above (this is the first LTIP vesting since 2017) and concluded that the 
vesting values do not represent unjustified windfall gains, noting Landsec’s:
 • strong operational performance over the three years to 31 March 2023
 • proactive execution of the strategy (which includes a number of material asset disposals), notwithstanding the challenging market conditions
 • balance sheet strength (one of the strongest in the sector)
 • strong relative share price performance over the three years to 31 March 2023.

In addition, Vanessa Simms was granted a buyout award on 18 May 2021 in respect of LTIP awards forfeited from her previous employer.

2.1 Total shareholding (Audited)
Details of the Directors’ interests, including those of their immediate families and connected persons, in the issued share capital of the 
Company at the beginning and end of the year, together with their required shareholding, are set out in the table below.

Executive Directors are expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within five years of appointment to the Board. 
Where the minimum level is not met, or where the value of shareholding falls below the required level due to movements in the share price, 
the Executive Director is expected to retain 100% of the shares acquired, net of tax, under any share plan awarded by the Company.

Non-executive Directors are expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within three years of appointment to the Board. 
The shareholding requirements are considered met once the Non-executive Director has obtained the required holding value and, provided 
those shares are retained, no adjustment is required due to movements in the share price.

3.3 Performance targets for the coming year
Performance metrics and weightings in respect of the annual bonus, which will continue to be capped at 150% of salary, are set out below. 
To reflect the importance of delivering growth in like-for-like earnings in line with Landsec’s strategic aims notwithstanding the challenging 
market conditions, the EPRA earnings measure will be split equally between the existing EPRA earnings measured against budget and a 
like-for-like EPRA earnings growth measure in respect of the year ending 31 March 2024. Challenging sliding scale targets will operate and 
the Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to ensure any payouts against the targets reflect the underlying performance of the 
Company. Performance targets are considered to be commercially sensitive although will be disclosed in full, together with the performance 
and the resulting bonus awards, in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance110

Annual Report  
on Remuneration continued

The approach for the 2023 LTIP awards reflects both Landsec’s focus on delivering returns to shareholders combined with our approach 
to sustainability and our ambition to be a net zero carbon business. Relative TSR is based on an unweighted, median to upper quartile 
vesting schedule and TRE (previously called TAR) targets deliver a close alignment to strategy and a clear line of sight for management. 
The widening of the TRE targets from the prior year awards reflects elevated volatility levels in the market. The 2% to 10% p.a. TRE target 
range compares with a 4% to 10% p.a. range set for the 2021 LTIPs and a 6% to 11% p.a. range set for the 2022 LTIPs. However, reflecting 
the lower threshold for the 2023 LTIP award, the level of vesting for this part of the award has been reduced from the 20% normally 
operated to 0%, with a pro-rata vesting between threshold and maximum.

The 2023 LTIP award will be set at up to 300% of salary for the CEO and CFO.

4. Total Shareholder Return and Chief Executive pay
The following graphs illustrate the performance of the Company measured by TSR (share price growth plus dividends paid) against 
a ‘broad equity market index’. In addition to the ten-year period required by the disclosure regulations, a five-year period has also been 
presented to demonstrate Landsec’s performance more recently. As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index, 
this is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark for the purposes of the graphs. An additional line to illustrate the Company’s 
performance compared with the FTSE 100 Index over the previous five and ten years is also included.

This graph shows the value, by 31 March 2023, of £100 invested in Landsec on 31 March 2018, compared with the value of £100 invested 
in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 350 Real Estate Indices on the same date.

5. The context of pay at Landsec
5.1 Pay across the Group
a. Senior management
For the year under review, performance-related pay for our 37 most senior employees (excluding the Executive Directors) ranged from 
27% to 72% of salary (2022: 33% to 87%), equating to 45% to 60% of the maximum potential. The average bonus was 33.9% of salary 
(2022: 51.4%), equating to 49% of the maximum potential.

b. All other employees
Executive Directors’ base salaries were increased by 3% in 2022, which was below the workforce average increase of 5%. From 1 June 2023, 
Executive Director salaries will increase by 4%. The pay rise across the wider workforce was 6.75% (5% of which was accelerated and paid 
from 1 January 2023 to assist employees with the cost of living crisis).

In addition, in autumn 2022, we made a one-off payment of £1,000 to employees earning below £40,000.

As at 31 March 2023, the ratio of the base salary of the Chief Executive to the average base salary across the Group (excluding Executive 
Directors) was 10:1 (£82,948: £824,000).

c. Percentage change in remuneration between Directors and employees
The table below shows the year on year percentage change in salary, benefits and annual bonus earned for all current Directors compared 
to all employees. As noted above, 5% of the employee pay rise for 2023/24 was accelerated and paid in 2022/23, but this acceleration did 
not apply to Directors or members of the Executive Leadership Team. This will impact comparative numbers in both years.

1. Vanessa Simms joined the Board during 2021/22.
2. Colette O’Shea stepped down from the Board on 30 September 2022 therefore comparing part-year (FY22/23) with full year prior. 
3. Sir Ian Cheshire was appointed on 23 March 2023.
4. Miles Roberts was appointed on 19 September 2022.

d. CEO pay ratio
The tables below show how pay for the CEO compares to employees at the lower, median and upper quartiles (calculated on a full-time 
equivalent basis). The ratios have been calculated in accordance with Option A of The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 
2018, which uses the total pay and benefits for all employees, and is the same methodology that is used to calculate the CEO’s single figure 
of remuneration table on page 101. Figures are calculated by reference to 31 March 2023 using actual pay data from April 2022 to March 2023. 
Excluded from our analysis are joiners, leavers and long-term absentees from the Company during the year. As the CEO has a larger 
proportion of his total remuneration linked to business performance than other employees in the UK workforce, the ratio has increased 
versus last year primarily as a result of the partial vesting of the 2020 LTIP (the 2019 LTIP did not vest last year) more than offsetting the 
reduced bonus award for the year ended 31 March 2023. Given the alignment of incentive arrangements cascaded below Board level, 
the Remuneration Committee believes the pay ratios are consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for the Group’s UK 
employees taken as a whole.

1. Including base salaries for all employees, bonus and share-based payments.
2. Dividend paid represents dividends declared for the year. See note 11 to the financial statements.

6. Dilution
Awards granted under the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements (LTIP, Deferred Share Bonus Plan, Restricted Share Plan and the 
ESOP) are satisfied through the funding of an Employee Benefit Trust (administered by an external trustee) which acquires existing Land 
Securities Group PLC shares in the market. The Employee Benefit Trust held 781,456 ordinary shares (2022: 888,400) and 3,049,943 treasury 
shares (2022: 3,049,943) at 31 March 2023.

The exercise of share options under the Land Securities Group PLC Sharesave, which is open to all employees who have completed more 
than one month’s service with the Group, can be satisfied by the allotment of newly issued shares. At 31 March 2023, the total number 
of shares which could be allotted under this Scheme was 565,439 shares (2022: 635,473), which represents less than 0.08% (2022: 0.09%) 
of the issued share capital of the Company.

7. Remuneration Committee meetings
The Committee met for three scheduled meetings and one unscheduled meeting over the course of the year. All members attended all 
the scheduled meetings with the exception of one meeting which Christophe Evain could not attend owing to a family bereavement. The 
Committee meetings were normally also attended by the Chief Executive, the Chief People Officer and Company Secretary who acted 
as the Committee’s Secretary.

The Committee received advice on remuneration and ancillary share plan matters from FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP. FIT is a member 
of the Remuneration Consultants Group and is a signatory to its Code of Conduct, which requires their advice to be impartial. The 
Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and objective. Aside from some support in benchmarking remuneration 
for roles below the Board, FIT has no other connection with the Group. For the financial year under review, FIT received fees of £75,676 
(FY2022: £66,610) in connection with advice provided to the Committee.

Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy Summary

A summary of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy is set out below. The policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2021 AGM, will 
be reviewed during FY2024 in advance of seeking shareholder approval for a new policy at the 2024 AGM. The full policy can be found in 
the 2021 Annual Report.

1. Executive Directors

Base salary

Purpose and link 
to strategy

 • To aid the recruitment, retention and motivation of high-performing Executive Directors
 • To reflect the value of their experience, skills and knowledge, and importance to the business

Operation

Opportunity

Normally reviewed annually, with effect from 1 June, and reflects:
 • Increases throughout the rest of the business
 • Market benchmarking exercises undertaken periodically to ensure salaries are set at around the median of the market 

competitive level for people in comparable roles with similar levels of experience, performance and contribution

 • Changes in the scope of an Executive Director’s role

The maximum annual salary increase will not normally exceed the average increase across the rest of the workforce.
Higher increases will be exceptional, and may be made in specific circumstances, including:
 • Where there is an increase in responsibilities or scope of the role
 • To apply salary progression for a newly appointed Executive Director
 • Where the Executive Director’s salary has fallen below the market positioning

Performance measures

 • Individual and Company performance is taken into account when determining appropriate salary increases

Benefits 

Purpose and link 
to strategy

Operation

 • To provide protection and market competitive benefits to aid recruitment and retention of high-performing  

Executive Directors

Typical benefits include, but are not limited to:
 • Car allowance
 • Private medical insurance
 • Life assurance
 • Ill health income protection
 • Holiday and sick pay
 • Eligibility to participate in all-employee share incentive plans
 • Professional advice in connection with their directorship
 • Travel, subsistence and accommodation as necessary
 • Occasional gifts, for example appropriate long service or leaving gifts

Opportunity

 • The value of benefits may vary from year to year depending on the cost to the Company

Performance measures

 • n/a

Pension 

Purpose and link 
to strategy

 • To help recruit and retain high performing Executive Directors
 • To reward continued contribution to the business by enabling Executive Directors to build retirement benefits

Operation

 • Participation into a defined contribution pension scheme or cash equivalent

Opportunity

 • 10.5% of salary, in line with the maximum employer contribution for all employees in the Company’s Group Personal Pension Plan

Performance measures

 • n/a

Landsec Annual Report 2023Governance115

Annual bonus 

Purpose and link 
to strategy

 • Incentivise Executive Directors and senior management to achieve specific, predetermined goals during a one-year period, or less
 • Reward financial and individual performance linked to the Company’s strategy
 • Deferred proportion of bonus, awarded in shares, provides a retention element and additional alignment of interest 

with shareholders

Operation

 • The annual bonus operates by reference to financial and personal performance measures normally set and assessed over one year
 • Any bonus payment is determined by the Committee after the year end, based on performance against challenging targets which 

are reviewed annually

 • The achievement of on-target performance should normally result in a payment of up to 50% of the maximum opportunity
 • Bonuses up to 50% of salary are normally paid in cash. Any amounts in excess of 50% of salary are deferred into shares for one 

year. Any amounts in excess of 100% of salary are deferred into shares for two years

 • Deferred shares are potentially forfeitable if the individual leaves prior to the share release date
 • Dividend equivalents may be awarded on deferred shares between grant and vesting to the extent that awards vest
 • Bonus payments are not pensionable
 • Malus and clawback provisions apply
 • The level of payout at threshold performance for each performance measure is set annually, but will typically be no more than 

25% of maximum

 • The Committee retains discretion to amend the payout level (up or down) where it considers it to be appropriate, but not so as 

to exceed the maximum bonus potential and will fully disclose the exercise of any discretion in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
that follows such exercise of discretion

Opportunity

 • 150% of salary

Performance measures

 • The performance measures applied may be financial, non-financial, or individual, and in such proportions as the Remuneration 

Committee considers appropriate, although individual measures will form a minority of the potential

 • Performance measures will be aligned to the Company’s strategy. The Committee reserves the right to change measures 

(and their weightings) for each financial year to ensure the metrics chosen are appropriate means of assessing the performance 
of the Executive Directors

 • Once set, performance measures and targets will generally remain unchanged for the year; exceptionally targets may be 
adjusted by the Committee to take account of significant transactions such as acquisitions and/or disposals or in other 
exceptional circumstances such as timing of transactions that have a material impact on the business plan

Long-term incentive

Purpose and link 
to strategy

 • Incentivises value creation over the long term
 • Rewards execution of our strategy
 • Aligns the long-term interests of Executive Directors and shareholders
 • Promotes retention

Operation

 • The Committee may make an annual award of shares under the LTIP
 • Vesting is determined on the basis of the Group’s achievements against stretching performance targets, normally over 

a three-year period and continued employment

 • The Committee reviews the measures, their relative weightings and targets prior to each award
 • For each measure, no awards vest for performance below threshold
 • Up to 20% of an award may vest for threshold performance
 • Each measure is capped at 100% vesting, which represents a stretching target
 • Executive Directors are required to hold vested awards (net of tax/NI where relevant) for a further two years 

(including post-cessation) following the three-year vesting period expiry

 • Dividend equivalents may be awarded between grant and the expiry of any holding period to the extent that the award 

vests Malus and clawback provisions apply

Opportunity

 • 300% of salary

Performance measures

 • The performance measures applied may be financial, non-financial, corporate or strategic and in such proportions as the 

Remuneration Committee considers appropriate

 • The measures may be based on a mixture of relative and absolute financial performance as well as one or more measures 

to recognise the Company’s broader strategic ESG commitment

Notes to Policy table:
Performance measures and target setting
Full details of the performance conditions and targets applying for each award will be disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Where targets are considered to be too sensitive to disclose in advance for commercial reasons, full disclosure of the original targets, and the 
extent to which they have been achieved, will be provided on a retrospective basis at the end of the relevant performance period.
