All the questions in this section have been 
posed by investors over the past year.

Q:  
How would you summarise 
the past year for Rentokil Initial?

A:  
It has been an extremely busy and productive 
year, which has made me very proud of the 
Rentokil Initial team. The overall Group result 
was good. It was accomplished despite 
significant inflation and other macroeconomic 
headwinds, which illustrates the resilience of 
our business. The Group has been able to 
sustain strong momentum in our underlying 
operational and financial performance, 
achieving 4.9% Organic Revenue Growth and 
16.6% margin. Growth in North America in the 
second half of the year was disappointing, 
however we’ve now completed an in-depth 
performance review and have put in place an 
action plan, THE RIGHT WAY 2, to reinvigorate 
organic growth. In the year, we made great 
progress against our Terminix integration 
strategy, building a bigger, better business. 
We have delivered on all our integration 
milestones in both Selling, General and 
Administrative expenses (SG&A) and field 
operations. We overachieved in our cost 
synergy targets in 2023 by delivering $69m 
pre-tax net cost synergies against a target of 
$60m, and have increased the total gross 
synergy target by $50m to $325m by 2026. 

B Find out more on pages 46 and 47

Our focus has been, and will continue to 
be, around operational excellence, which 
remains key to delivering our growth 
ambitions. We’ll achieve this by leveraging 
opportunities created by the Terminix 
integration and through further Group 
investments in our people, service, 
innovation, and digital technology.

Andy Ransom,  
Chief Executive

Annual Report 2023

Q:  
The combination with Terminix 
increased your exposure to 
residential and termite business. 
Should we still view Rentokil Initial 
as a defensive business?

A:  
Rentokil Initial’s business model remains 
highly resilient, underpinned by the provision 
of essential services, a diversified portfolio, 
global presence, and a commitment to 
innovation. Pest control, in particular, but also 
hygiene solutions, are inherently defensive 
businesses. It’s true that pest control 
regulation means that commercial services 
are often less discretionary than residential 
services. However, the residential market, 
which is already the largest segment in the US, 
presents a strong future growth opportunity 
due to the current low penetration of 
professional pest care, population growth,  
and climate change. The diversified nature of 
our broader global service portfolio adds to 
the Company’s overall defensive qualities. 

While spanning the commercial, residential, 
and termite markets in pest control, we also 
offer a range of services in hygiene and 
workwear provision. This diversification 
reduces the risk of dependence on a single 
market segment. The Company’s ability to 
adapt to changing circumstances is another 
crucial factor. We’ve shown a commitment to 
innovation and technology, incorporating 
advanced pest control and hygiene solutions. 
This adaptability allows the Company to stay 
ahead of industry trends, ensuring that it 
remains relevant and resilient in the face  
of evolving challenges.

Q:  
In explaining softer trading in US 
Pest Control in the second half of 
the year, you pointed to weaker 
consumer demand. What further 
insights have you gained and what 
measures are you taking to address 
these challenges?

A:  
The main challenge to new business growth 
in the second half of the year was lower 
acquisition of new residential, termite, and 
SME customers, stemming from a reduction 
in in-bound sales leads. We estimate that the 
US market grew by approximately 4% in 2023, 
reflecting lower growth, particularly in the 
second half of the year, in these largely 
consumer-facing categories. However, we 
recognise that the Company’s sales lead 
generation also underperformed. We’ve been 
responding to that to identify what we can do 
to address the situation and take action to 
stimulate organic growth. 

There has been a comprehensive evaluation 
of opportunities to drive growth, including 
upselling and pricing, as well as to increase 
brand awareness and optimise digital 
channels. We’ve taken a hard look at how we 
best evolve our sales and marketing action 
plan in response to market conditions and  
to re-establish momentum in customer 
acquisition. We’ve made new appointments to 
the North America leadership team, including 
a highly experienced digital marketer to the 
role of Performance & Digital Marketing VP. 
The Terminix integration is a complex project 
that is demanding of our time, so we’ve also 
seconded our UK Operations Director to North 
America to take charge of technician leads.

We’re committed to protecting our underlying 
operating momentum as we work through the 
integration. We have shaped a detailed plan to 
help us do that. I’m also confident that Rentokil 
Initial remains a structurally robust business 
with the additional benefit of an integration 
that affords tremendous strategic opportunity.

B Find out more on pages 46 and 47

Q:  
The Group delivered another year  
of strong performance in its global 
operations. What do you attribute 
that performance to and how 
sustainable is it?

A:  
The sustainability of our strong performance 
reflects our consistently high levels of service 
quality, as well as our ability to harness 
opportunities for growth. Increased awareness 
of hygiene, especially in the wake of 
COVID-19, and the persistent need for pest 
management have continued to support 
demand for our services around the world. 

We’ve been able to service that demand and 
drive growth by having the right operational 
model in place; an existing global footprint  
and large customer base; continued market 
expansion, highly motivated people and great 
brands; and, a proven innovation capability 
and digital expertise. Ongoing investments in 
research and development and a proactive 
approach to emerging trends put us in a 
strong position to remain highly competitive. 
Our focus on Cities of the Future is another 
important driver to long-term sustainable 
growth, promoting a strategic approach to 
tapping into faster growing markets.

Q:  
You previously guided to over 5% 
Organic Revenue Growth per annum 
over the medium term. What will be 
the key drivers of that growth?

A:  
Our focus has been, and will continue to be, 
around operational excellence, which remains 
key to delivering our growth ambitions. We’ll 
achieve this by leveraging opportunities 
created by the Terminix integration and 
through further Group investments in our 
people, service, innovation, and digital 
technology. Accelerated growth through our 
enhanced scale will come from a number  
of areas, including upselling with the 
expansion of our Trusted Advisor programme 
(empowering technicians to generate leads 
and sales), effective pricing through 
segmentation and, in the future, premium 
positioning, and by enhancing brand value 
enabled by a streamlined brand portfolio in 
North America. 

Creating a high-quality customer service, 
delivering on time, and delivering in full, have 
always been core to our value proposition  
and will see renewed emphasis as we seek  
to further strengthen customer retention  
and acquisition. This will continue to be 
complemented by sustained investment in 
innovative pest control and hygiene solutions. 
Our commitment to science and innovation 
leadership not only ensures that Rentokil 
meets evolving customer expectations but 
also allows us to offer more efficient and 
effective services, attracting new customers. 
In the US, this includes the opening of our  
new science and innovation centre focused  
on termite and residential pest control.

Our medium-term targets 
Group medium-term targets for revenue, profit and cash were first introduced in 2014, and having 
consistently beaten them since introduction, were revised upwards in 2022 and 2023, reflecting 
confidence and ambition for the future.

Group Organic Revenue Growth Target: At least 5.0%
Pest Control Organic Revenue Growth Target: 4.5–6.5%
Hygiene & Wellbeing Organic Revenue Growth Target: 4.0–6.0%
Workwear Organic Revenue Growth Target: 3.0–4.0%
Free Cash Flow Conversion Target: FY 25: At least 90%

Annual Report 2023

Q:  
It’s been over a year since the 
Terminix transaction completed. 
What is your assessment of how the 
Terminix integration has proceeded 
this year?

A:  
There has been a strong start to delivery of 
the integration plan. Since the transaction 
completed, our teams have worked diligently 
towards harmonising cultures, processes, and 
technologies, putting us in a good position  
to capitalise on synergy opportunities and 
best practices from both organisations. In  
the year, we’ve reduced our branch network 
by 97 through branch consolidation, which  
is approximately 50% of target property 
synergies. We’ve conducted a series of  
branch integration pilots that we were  
pleased to see confirmed our forecasts of 
density benefits, laying the foundations for  
the branch integration work to be deployed  
at scale beginning later this year. 

We’ve also been busy completing the move  
of our US colleagues onto a single Human 
Capital Management and Payroll system, in 
addition to pilot testing projects in relation to  
a harmonised pay plan, data migration and 
data mapping, and technology applications. 
Our strategic ambition is clear and remains the 
same. We’re making complex and important 
changes that will create an optimal route  
and branch network. From the outset, we’ve 
recognised that we need to make sure that 
we’re able to do this as smoothly as possible 
for our customers and colleagues, taking the 
necessary time to test and take feedback on 
board so that changes can be rolled out in a 
measured and targeted way.

Q:  
What are the most significant parts 
of the integration programme in the 
year ahead? What do you see as the 
main challenges and how will you 
manage these?

Q:  
What are the key elements of your 
US growth plan that underpin your 
ambition to grow organically ahead 
of the pest control market in the 
medium term?

A:  
We’ve a large programme of work ahead of  
us that is focused on the branch integration 
phase. While it’s also the most complex part, 
the future opportunities and benefits for our 
customers, our business, and our shareholders 
are significant. We will be moving to consistent 
brands, service protocols, and a fully aligned 
customer offering in our field operations.  
This all has to be supported and enabled by 
integrated IT infrastructure and harmonised 
pay plans that have been long in the planning. 
At the same time as we make these important 
changes, we have to stimulate and protect 
organic growth in the North America business. 
The expected end result of the integration 
programme is a much more efficient service 
network across the country that benefits  
from strong operational density and is 
characterised by excellent service delivery.  
A project of this scale requires exceptional 
governance and we’ve put in place robust 
programme management with key operational 
and functional leaders from both organisations 
to support implementation. We are being 
disciplined and meticulous in our execution. 
Route and branch integration, which will be 
phased by region, is expected to commence  
in mid-2024. We have divided the US into 
seven regions, each comprising commercial, 
residential, and termite operations, and we’ll 
be working sequentially through each of these 
regions with continuous, rolling evaluation  
of the impact on colleagues, customers,  
and services. 

B Find out more on page 44

A:  
One of the reasons why the Terminix 
transaction has a strong financial case is  
the benefits of scale. In the US, we are now 
substantially larger than our nearest rival  
and that scale means we can drive greater 
purchasing power, build additional local 
branch density, drive more powerful marketing 
with a more impactful set of brands, and  
invest in technology in an unrivalled manner. 
We’re also committed to consolidating  
our shared experience and expertise. For 
colleagues, we’re training to best practices 
and introducing new pay and incentivisation 
plans to will drive productivity. For customers, 
there’ll be increased opportunity to benefit 
from an expanded service portfolio. Not only 
will the customer experience become more 
seamless, but scaling up initiatives like our 
Trusted Advisor programme across the 
combined organisation will better utilise 
our field colleagues’ expertise and enable 
higher levels of customer penetration.  
We also recognise how important robust 
pricing strategies are in driving growth.  
As we deliver the very best service levels, 
through the very best technicians, we should 
be proud to command a premium price in  
time. With more holistic data sets, there  
is the additional opportunity to take a 
segmentation approach to pricing,  
to develop more localised strategies. 

B Find out more on pages 46 and 47

Q:  
Do you believe there are any 
aspects of the business that are 
misunderstood by the market?

A:  
The key positive for us is that the Terminix 
integration has progressed strongly, at the 
same time as we’ve delivered a good overall 
Group performance in the year. We’ve seen 
affirmative results in our branch integration 
pilot testing and an encouraging uplift of 
8.1ppts in Terminix colleague retention since 
the deal close. We recognise the softer results 
in North America in the back half of last year, 
however our business model is resilient and 
we have confidence in our RIGHT WAY 2  
plan to address specific challenges and 
reinvigorate organic growth. Our market 
positions, pricing power, and structural growth 
characteristics remain robust and intact. 

Outside of North America, we saw another 
excellent contribution from other regions, 
including Europe, our second largest region, 
which was up 9.2% organically. Plus, the  
best is still ahead of us. We’ve talked about  
the significant potential upside from the 
combination with Terminix, both in terms  
of cost and revenue synergies. We look 
forward to taking them forward to their 
successful conclusion.

7. We are working collectively 
to achieve our net zero carbon 
emissions target by 2040
The journey to net zero emissions is not only 
the right thing to do for society, but it is also 
the right thing for our business. Over the past 
decade, we have met our targets for 10% 
(2011–15) and further 20% (2016–19) carbon 
efficiency improvements and, in 2020, we  
set our target to achieve net zero carbon 
emissions from our operations by the end  
of 2040.

colleague engagement

At the end of 2023, 100% of our Asia 
& MENAT region's line managers – 
almost 2,000 employees – had been 
involved in the programme.

The RI Ambassador technician 
programme was launched in Q4, 
focusing on world class service 
delivery from our outstanding 
technicians, enabling them to 
engage and serve our customers 
even better. The programme has 
five core themes: Sustainability; 
Care; Ownership; Results 
orientated; and Expertise.  
The programme is designed to 
demonstrate that our colleagues 
are our Brand and that world class 
customer service starts with world 
class technicians. 

The region hosted a torch relay  
to reinforce the Company’s  
mission, vision and values with  
all colleagues. 

Sharing our mission, vision and 
values, in a region spread across  
23 countries, where around 2,000 
languages are spoken, is not easy. 
However, our teams in Asia & 
MENAT planned a special campaign 
in Q2 2023 to do just that. Starting 
in Shanghai, an Olympic-style torch 
was passed from country to country 
in a relay. 

Colleagues gathered at each 
handover point to meet the 
management team and learn  
more about our shared mission, 
vision and values. 

It took four months for the torch  
to travel c.80,000 km to over 700 
branches. In India the torch featured 
in a marathon, with a team of 
colleagues carrying it over 100km.  
It took 16 hours, travelling from 
Mumbai to Pune, where the torch 
was officially handed over.

As a result of programmes like 
these, the Your Voice Counts (YVC) 
scores were excellent. Colleague 
Engagement was 89% and our Line 
Management Index (LMI) increased 
from 84% to 86%, up 6% over the 
external norm for the region. 

Furthermore, the region’s growth 
and development score was 86%, 
up 8% over the external Asia norm. 
Our Group YVC LMI of 80% is up  
by 4% since 2019.

A proven, resilient operating model

Within our business model, each cog is related to the others and measured 
consistently at Group, business, region, country, and branch level. By focusing  
on consistently executing our model, we continue to succeed, creating value for

Decentralised geographic approach
Due to our decentralised geographic approach – our businesses are grouped into five regions, with local 
market operations – our business model provides resilience to fluctuations in market dynamics, as well 
as geopolitical and trade risks.

This simple decentralised approach features single-country management teams operating local service 
teams in 90 countries around the world (with more than 94% of our revenues derived from outside of 
the UK).

Each country team leads integrated, multi-local and multi-service operations, using combined back-office 
functions underpinned by shared systems and processes, such as route optimisation, marketing and brand 
alignment, and measurement of customer satisfaction.

The heart of our business
Employer of Choice
We have a long-standing commitment to 
being an Employer of Choice and our 
market-leading practices help to sustain our 
performance, and give us the ability to not 
only attract and hire, but also retain, the best 
people from the widest possible pool of talent.

Health and safety
Health and safety is our most important 
priority – we want to ensure that everyone 
goes home safely at the end of their  
working day.

Throughout our decentralised business 
model, health and safety is the first item on 
the agenda at every management meeting, 
from local business units all the way up  
to the Executive Leadership Team and  
Board meetings.

Growth
Organic growth drives continual 
improvements in density
Organic Revenue Growth, new business 
and additional services to customers 
Delivering high levels of customer service 
and retention rates, along with continued 
innovation that provides new products for our 
customers, allows us to build our portfolio of 
customers and grow our existing customer 
base organically.

Price
Our strategy, with regards to managing pricing 
and protecting our ongoing margins, involves 
carefully communicating cost challenges to 
our customers, ensuring their understanding 
of why the financial effects of inflationary cost 
pressures should be passed through into 
customer prices.

Profit and margins
Revenue growth translates

Profit growth and our low-cost model
Our business model for profitable growth 
is focused on compounding revenue, profit, 
and cash growth through organic growth and 
M&A. This revenue growth, together with our 
low-cost operating model, allows us to deliver 
strong growth in profits for the Group.

Density
We have a fundamental understanding of 
route density, which helps us to consolidate 
our positions in existing markets and improve 
margins, in part by focusing on increasing the 
density of our routes, whether through organic 
activity or by acquisition.

Great customer service and  
customer retention
We serve customers from the largest 
multinational pharmaceutical, industrial, and 
food production companies to local shops, 
restaurants, and residential customers to 
protect their homes, and we endeavour to 
fully understand all our customers’ needs  
for pest control, and enhanced health and 
hygiene standards.

Our vision is to be the most loved and 
respected services business on the planet 
(read more on page 4), delivering consistently 
high standards to ensure customer retention 
and sales of additional products.

Strong brand trust and identity
As a services business, brand trust and 
identity matter. We have two large 
multinational brands in Pest Control –  
Rentokil and Terminix – and a recognised  
and trusted Initial Hygiene & Wellbeing  
brand. We continue to focus on building 
unified, globally aligned brands through  
our ongoing investment in marketing,  
people, service, innovation, digital, and 
sustainability, and to support our customers 
across multiple sectors.

Consistent performance

Cash
We are a highly cash-generative business  
and we work hard to maintain our balance 
sheet, allowing us the flexibility to reinvest in 
both innovation and M&A growth. Greater 
exposure to legacy termite claims arising from 
the Terminix transaction will lower our free 
cash generation over the next few years as  
we resolve these customer issues. We remain 
focused on cash flow and working capital 
management, and we work closely with our 
customers and suppliers to manage any 
supply chain challenges.

M&A
Acquisitions are a core part of our business 
model, mainly targeting city-focused deals  
to build presence and density in both Pest 
Control and Hygiene & Wellbeing.

Shareholder value and dividend
We aim to generate long-term profitable 
growth to help deliver value and strong 
returns for our shareholders. The Group is 
committed to maintaining its progressive 
dividend policy, with dividend payments  
twice a year related to the level of Free Cash 
Flow available, as agreed by the Board.

society, but it is also the right thing for our 
business. We have clear plans in all regions

already underway, focusing on:

• Sustainable solutions – hardware, 

consumables, and chemicals;

• Sustainable operations – colleague mobility, 

waste, and supply chain; and

• Sustainable workplace – our properties  

and culture.

non-toxic, and humane pest solutions.

Key actions taken in 2023 
Organic Revenue Growth
The Group overall delivered good growth of 
4.5% in Pest Control, led by the commercial 
business and supported by good customer 
retention rates. Organic Revenue Growth in 
North America Pest Control Services was  
3.5% owing to lower sales lead generation  
and conversion in a softer consumer market  
in the second half of the year. 

Product and service innovation 
deployed

to plan, test, and deploy new sustainable 
products and solutions to address customer 
needs, including EcoCatch Flies, BirdAlert, 
and RADAR X. PestConnect units deployed 
increased by c.23% to around 356,000 in 
2023. Five countries have connected devices 
in over 10% of their commercial portfolio.  
The Netherlands leads in Europe, with 
connected devices approaching 30% of  
the commercial portfolio. 

Sustainable, non-toxic development
During 2023, we prioritised sustainability,  
with 100% of our innovation pipeline being 
sustainable, non-toxic, or digital. Our Initial 
Soap range was accredited by the EU and 
Nordic Swan Ecolabel for sustainability. 

Our challenge is to drive sustainably 
higher rates of organic growth 
across the business, particularly 
in our key North America market.

across the Company. During 2023, we 
continued to deliver strong levels of colleague 
safety, improving our Lost Time Accident rate

This performance was driven by our ongoing 
focus on safety, robust management 
standards, and commitment to best practices 
and training.

Delivered regional environmental 
improvement plans
We continued our work on our plan to achieve 
net zero emissions by the end of 2040 during 
the year: eight workstreams are now under 
way and country teams are executing their 
plans. Our five-year emissions index has 
achieved a 16% improvement in carbon 
efficiency and is making good progress 
towards our emissions target of a 20% 
reduction by 2025. 

In addition, we have continued to migrate our 
fleet of vehicles to ultra-low emissions and 
hybrid vehicles. The fleet now comprises c.8% 
ultra-low emissions vehicles in the UK and 
Europe, and 1,484 hybrid vehicles worldwide. 

We are also proud to have continued our

Managing a responsible 
business in Latin America, 
by reducing fuel usage  
and CO2 emissions

We recognise that our ambitious net zero target can only 
be achieved if our colleagues are engaged and fully 
involved, and so in 2023 our Latin America business 
focused on changing mindsets.

14.3%

reduction in overall fuel 
usage in the Caribbean

The team set themselves an 
ambitious target of reducing fuel 
usage per customer visit by 10% 
during the year. 

In order to achieve this, vehicle 
emissions were managed by the 
careful selection of the right size 
and type of vehicle, the use of 
route planning to reduce mileage 
and the use of telematics to 
encourage more efficient driving, 
as well as the introduction of some 
of the first all-electric vehicles in 
the region and the increased use  
of hybrid vehicles. 

Overall fuel usage per visit in  
Latin America and the Caribbean 
reduced by 4.3%. However in the 
Caribbean alone, the reduction  
was 14.3%. 

In order to reduce electricity 
demand, the region has focused  
on increasing the use of LED lights 
in all branches. 

All pre-existing branches now have 
100% LED lighting, and including 
those acquired during the year, 
93% of Latin American branches 
and 85% of Caribbean branches 
now use all LED lighting, further 
reducing electricity usage. 

In the Bahamas, termite operations 
were restructured in order to 
improve the efficiency of 
fumigation services. The project 
included training the whole team  
at a specialist location in Florida, 
learning about the elements  
which impact the efficiency of  
an operation in detail, such as 
temperature and ground surface. 

Worn tents were replaced to 
protect against gas leakage, 
monitoring equipment introduced 
to check for gas loss in real time, 
and giant inflatable bags used to 
reduce the area to be filled with 
gas. Overall, the project has 
delivered a 40% reduction in  
CO2 emissions in the Bahamas, 
while at the same time increasing 
fumigation revenues by 37%.

Link to strategy
• By retaining our people, we also retain and build deeper relationships with our customers,  

which underpins our organic growth.

• Retaining more colleagues reduces cost of recruitment, as well as driving productivity 
improvement, and allowing new recruits the time to be trained and gain experience.

• We invest in training and development to ensure that our colleagues’ expertise is unrivalled.

• We recruit, appoint and promote on merit and, where possible, from within the organisation.

Link to remuneration
• Colleague retention is a Performance Share Plan (PSP) performance measure and is included  

in annual bonus personal objectives.

Commentary on performance
• Colleague retention improved by 4.7 percentage points versus a restated 2022 to 84.2%, 

translating to c.1,900 more colleagues choosing to stay with us compared to 2022. Every region 
saw an improved performance in the year, in overall retention as well as in both Service and 
Sales colleague retention. 

• Service colleague retention also increased 5.7 percentage points versus restated 2022 (77.6%) 
to 83.3%, which was driven mainly by strong performances in Asia & MENAT, up 6.7 percentage 
points, and North America, which was up 5.7 percentage points. In North America, Terminix 
Service retention was up 6.5 percentage points on FY 22 from 60.7% to 67.2%.

• Sales colleague retention increased by 1.1 percentage points to 77.4% versus restated 2022 
of 76.3%. All regions delivered an improved performance, the highest of which was Asia & 
MENAT, up 3.6 percentage points. Europe remained the highest performing region, up  
2.0 percentage points to 94.1%.

Prior year numbers have been restated primarily to include the Terminix acquisition, as well as to align all regions  
on consistent definitions and calculations. In addition the global metric is now a weighted average, based on the 
headcount of each region, rather than a straight average as it had been previously.

Colleague retention is defined as total colleagues retained in-year as a percentage of average headcount throughout 
the year. Colleague retention is measured on a rolling 12-month basis.

Measured by the implementation of an average Net 
Promoter Score across all branches, including in-year

those customers promoting our service, compared with 
those neutral or not promoting.

CVC scores are based on both telephone and digital 
survey channels, except for 2019 when only telephone 
surveys were used.

In 2023 global and regional scores have been weighted 
based on the portfolio value of the market. Prior year 
data back to 2020 has also been restated on this basis.

Link to strategy
• Our business model depends on servicing the needs of our customers in line with internal high 
standards and to levels agreed in contracts. Strong performance on CVC is linked to retention 
and sales of additional services to customers. Measuring customer satisfaction allows us to 
identify unhappy customers, reduce customer attrition, and increase revenue, profit, and cash.

Link to remuneration
• Improving CVC is one of the performance conditions of the PSP, which covers over  

1,100 colleagues across the Group.

Commentary on performance
• Our CVC score for 2023 was 50.8, a slight decrease of 0.1 points on the prior year (restated)  

but 1.3 points above our target of 49.5.

• Our category analysis shows that Pest Control is our highest rated category, at 54.9, flat on  
last year, despite improved performances in Europe, Pacific and UK and Sub-Saharan Africa.

• Initial Hygiene scored 49.3 points this year, an increase of 1.1 points on 2022 (restated). 
All regions achieved increases on the prior year, except for North America and LATAM.

• This year, our focus is on understanding feedback from CVC to gain insights at global and 

regional levels to see how customers feel about different aspects of our service.

Free Cash Flow is measured as net cash from operating 
activities, adjusted for cash flows related to the purchase 
and sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangible 
assets, and dividends received from associates.

An explanation of the reconciliation of the Adjusted  
Free Cash Flow Conversion can be found on page 67.

Link to strategy
• We are a highly cash-generative business and, after dividend and interest payments have been 
made, we reinvest our cash into the business for future growth through people, technology,  
and M&A.

Link to remuneration
• Free Cash Flow is a gateway target for the annual bonus, which covers the Executive Directors 
and managers across the Group. Failure to meet this target results in no bonus being payable 
regardless of how well the Company performs against revenue and profit targets.

Commentary on performance
• The new cash conversion metric reflects statutory ‘net cash flow from operating activities’ 
expressed as a percentage of ‘profit after tax’ as a measure of overall conversion of profits  
into cash.

• Adjusted free cash flow conversion of 89.4% (2022: 91.8%) is ahead of guidance for the sixth 
consecutive year. 2023 is broadly in line with 2022 and they represent a more normal years  
after the clear down of receivables from the COVID-19 disinfection revenues in 2021.  
2023 cash conversion also includes a full year of settlements against warranty termite claims.

• The cash performance reflects delivery of a full year of Terminix trading, including $69m of 

synergies, tight management of working capital and capital expenditure permitting M&A spend 
of £242m in the year, dividends of c.201m (2022: £122m) and the cash impact of integration 
activities of c.£107m. These resulted overall in a small decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 
c£40m. Net Debt fell by c.£133m as a result of the above cashflows and c.£169m of FX benefit, 
leaving Net Debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.8x (2022: 4.6x).

pipeline of innovation 
investment projects

Innovation is always guided by 
reviewing and researching what  
is scientifically and technically 
possible, balanced with the needs  
of our customers. Our commercial 
customers and residential consumers 
are seeking more sustainable 
practices and solutions. For our 
commercial service providers, this is 
also important, to help them deliver 
on their own environmental and 
sustainability goals. At Rentokil Initial, 
we leverage our deep customer 
relationships across the globe, to 
better understand customer needs 
ahead of time, allowing us to target 
our innovation in the right areas. 

We have four global innovation 
centres, including our latest North 
America centre in Dallas, which will 
be focused on residential services 
including termites, vector control,  
and fumigation. These centres are 
dedicated to researching pest 
behaviour and hygiene consumer 
needs, and translating that research 
into cutting-edge, breakthrough 
technical solutions. The key to our 
success is our people – industry-
leading scientists, engineers, field 
biologists, and technicians – who live 
and breathe innovation in everything 
they do.

The process of innovation is 
separated into two parts within 
Rentokil Initial: we have dedicated 
disruptive innovation teams (focused 
on solving new problems in 
unprecedented ways) as well as  
core optimisation teams (focused  
on finding more efficient, effective, 
and sustainable ways to deliver  
the market-leading service our 
customers recognise). At any one 
time we can have over 75 projects in 
our innovation pipeline, with projects 
taking just a few months to more 
than three years from inception to 
market launch, depending on the 
complexity of the challenge we are 
aiming to solve.
Disruptive innovation
All the innovation Rentokil Initial 
undertakes must deliver on our  
key metrics of organic growth, 
sustainability, and meaningful 
competitive differentiation. 

We ensure this happens by scoring 
hundreds of potential blue sky 
opportunities (with ideas being 
submitted from both within and  
from outside of the business, from 
academia to end users) based on  
Return on Investment potential, 
strategic importance, and complexity 

and selecting the most impactful 
ideas. We then consider our detailed 
customer requirements and create  
a clear technical brief which we 
develop against. All projects are 
evaluated for performance, efficacy, 
and durability through rigorous 
testing, both in a laboratory, and in 
the field, to ensure our products and 
services will deliver to the highest 
standards.

Annual Report 2023

Pest control market drivers

Pest control is a largely non-discretionary 
and essential service protecting public 
health, and demand for the service is 
driven by multiple macro drivers, creating 
a resilient market globally. These drivers 
include: globalisation, population growth 
and urbanisation, climate change, 
increased regulation, as well as increasing 
business and consumer intolerance to pest 
issues. The drivers are aided by advancing 
technology across the market, where 
Rentokil is a leader in innovation and 
digital adoption. 

Impact for Pest Control
• Extended pest-breeding seasons and 

lifecycles

• Translocation of pests into new 

geographies

• Urbanisation creates higher pest 

demands

• Regulatory pressures will limit 

over-the-counter solutions and increase 
products requiring licensed applicators

• Increased efforts in the food supply chain 

to prevent food loss

• Consumers could move from preventative 

services to more reactive pest control

Hygiene and wellbeing  
market drivers
Since the start of the global pandemic in 
2020, we have seen elevated standards  
for health and hygiene, particularly in  
the workplace. 

Industry commentators and our experience 
to date suggests this heightened focus on 
hygiene will be a long-term change that  
will create ongoing market opportunities 
from which our business can benefit.  
This structural shift and opportunities  
from compelling growth drivers give us 
confidence in delivering our organic  
growth targets for Hygiene & Wellbeing  
of 4.0-6.0% over the medium term.

 Population growth and urbanisation

  Rise of pests and vector 
borne diseases

The global population is growing by 1.1% per 
annum (c.80 million), primarily in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, South Asia, and MENAT. City 
populations are on the rise – 68% of the 
population will live in cities by 2050, up from 
55% in 2021. This higher concentration of 
people in cities leads to a higher volumes 
of pest-related activity.

The global rat population is set to increase to 
seven billion alongside increasing customer 
demand for non-toxic solutions. There are  
over 50 termite species in the US which  
cause c.$2bn p.a. in subterranean damage. 
Four billion people in over 125 countries are  
at risk of contracting dengue fever, which 
could double by the end of the century.

 Climate change

 Standards increasing

Extreme weather conditions are becoming the 
norm, with droughts and flooding bringing 
different pest challenges. Deaths related to 
malaria are on the rise, a direct impact of rising 
temperatures. Climate change also impacts  
on pest behaviour, distribution lifecycle, and 
pesticide resistance.

US Food Safety Modernization Act –  
most significant pest control legislation in  
over 70 years – focuses on the prevention  
of disease outbreaks. Regulatory pressures 
and legislation are increasing the role  
for innovation.

 Regulation increasing

The pest control industry is facing evolving 
regulations, particularly regarding the use of 
certain pesticides and chemicals, making 
compliance and adapting to changing 
standards a challenge.

 Sustainability

Gen Z amongst others are demanding 
sustainable solutions, driving the move away 
from rodenticides to environmentally friendly, 
non-toxic, and less harmful chemicals. The 
demand can be met by the promotion of 
integrated pest management practices  
that emphasise prevention and reduced 
chemical usage.

 Increasing pest intolerance

Pest infestations cost global businesses 
c.£5.8bn each year with some species 
becoming resistant. 29% of Americans have 
experienced a rodent pest issue at some 
point; and 35% in the Northeast of the US.

 Low residential penetration

There is an unserved market for residential 
and termite pest care prevention in the  
US of c.$48bn, with only c.$7bn being  
served currently.

 Rise of millennial population

 Surface hygiene

The millennial generation is highly focused  
on health and wellbeing and vocal about its 
importance, with increased spend across all 
wellbeing categories. 

 Sustainability

Customer demand for enhanced hygiene 
solutions has also created a related 
requirement to ensure that all solutions  
are delivered in the most sustainable  
way possible.

 Air hygiene

Increased sensitivities around air filtering,  
air purification, and air quality monitoring, 
driven by stricter regulations and standards, 
are presenting significant new opportunities 
for air hygiene.

The pandemic led to an explosion of sensitivity 
around microbe transmission points and 
surfaces being carriers of risk. The resultant 
shift to significantly enhanced cleaning 
regimes and protocols has largely remained  
in place following the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Hand hygiene

Good hand hygiene is one of the most basic 
yet powerful ways in which individuals can 
protect themselves from infection as shown 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting 
focus on hand hygiene has, to a large extent, 
remained a feature of everyday life.

 Brand trust and expertise

Customers now seek greater reassurance than 
ever from service providers, with brand trust 
being paramount in their choice criteria.

Global market position

Pest control

Hygiene and wellbeing

Market position
The pest control market is highly fragmented, with strong growth 
drivers across all regions (see page 29). The market accounts for 
c.80% of Rentokil Initial’s global revenue and c.81% of operating 
profit. Rentokil operates across 89 countries and is a leading global 
operator, enjoying a No.1 position in the majority of countries. 
Rentokil is the largest pest control provider in the US market, where 
40% of the market is served by three companies. The remainder  
of the market is highly fragmented, with 40% made up of larger 
private companies and 20% made up of thousands of small private 
companies. The market is split between residential, termite, and 
commercial customers.

Competition
Rentokil competes in the highly fragmented termites, residential, 
and commercial pest management markets. Key international 
competitors of Rentokil include Rollins, Orkin, Ecolab, and Anticimex.

Over the past 12 months there has been further M&A activity 
across the sector. Major players and increasingly private equity 
are targeting acquisitions in Growth and Emerging markets.

In addition, new technology solutions and increased digital 
marketing are driving inbound leads for national and smaller 
independent operators.

Market position
Our Hygiene & Wellbeing businesses operate in an attractive 
industry offering strong growth opportunities. Like Pest Control, 
Hygiene & Wellbeing is an essential, non-discretionary business  
and its medium-term opportunities are enhanced by rising demand 
for global hygiene services. It is difficult to estimate the total market 
size for hygiene and wellbeing as the services and products in this 
market are highly fragmented.

The Initial Hygiene brand is a leader in global core hygiene services 
– operating in 61 countries and in No.1 position in over a third of 
countries, and leading positions in the rest of its regional markets. 
Our Enhanced Environments business operates in 18 countries and 
has leading positions in a number of its markets.

Competition

The market is highly fragmented and there are many routes to 
satisfy washroom hygiene needs, with competitors providing a wide 
range of supply solutions. Regional, full-service companies provide 
service solutions, either direct or via cleaning companies/facility

Addressing the global market opportunity through our strategic priorities

The opportunities across the pest control and hygiene and wellbeing markets are driven by underlying macroeconomic, climate, and geographic 
factors, which in turn are driving organic growth rates across our regions. Executing our strategic priorities helps us to capture these opportunities 
and our leadership in innovation and digital continues to ensure that we differentiate our brands and support our customers’ needs in the changing 
social, economic, and regulatory environment. 

Growing population

Trend

How we are responding

Global population changes provide additional demand for 
our service, particularly across the residential and hotels, 
restaurants and catering (HORECA) sectors. The global 
population is growing by 80m people each year and is 
forecast to reach 9.1bn by 2050, creating further demand 
from pest proximity. Higher growth rates persist in parts 
of Asia and Africa. The US population is projected to rise 
from c.325m to c.400m by 2060.

We are expanding our geographic presence across pest 
control, hygiene and wellbeing through our targeted M&A 
programme, with a particular focus on cities in Growth and 
Emerging markets. Our acquisition of Terminix in 2022 has 
given us wider and deeper footprint across North America, 
where our branch integration will ensure we are optimised 
to serve the shifting population in the world’s largest pest 
control market.

Urbanisation

Rising middle  
classes

Climate change

An increasing proportion of the world’s population 
is residing in urban areas, leading to the growth and 
expansion of cities. By 2050, 68% of the global  
population will live in urban areas (versus 55% in 2021), 
where hygiene and sanitation issues are most prevalent. 
Rapid urbanisation is currently more pronounced in 
developing regions, particularly in Asia and Africa.

We have a fundamental understanding of route density, 
which has helped us consolidate our leadership position  
in our existing global markets and improve margins.  
We are serving 98 of the world’s largest cities by GDP  
and our M&A programme which extends from North 
America to the rest of the world is actively seeking to  
build local density in the c.1,000 cities we are already in.

The rise of the middle classes has been a significant 
global trend, particularly in developing and emerging 
economies. An additional 160 million people join the 
middle classes every year, with increasing hygiene 
and living standard expectations and a growing health 
consciousness afforded by higher disposable income.

We are well positioned to benefit from the rising middle 
classes through our global geographic presence and 
our diversified product offering. Our presence in 98 of 
the largest cities of the world by GDP ensures we are 
already serving this growing demographic, alongside 
the development of premium washroom product ranges 
targeting higher value customer segments.

Climate change has profound implications for human 
health, influencing the prevalence, distribution, and 
dynamics of various diseases. By 2050, climate change  
is expected to cause approximately 250,000 deaths  
each year from malnutrition, malaria and other diseases.

Between 2021 and 2050, annual US average 
temperatures are expected to rise, creating increased 
pest threats.

Consumers and customers are also responding to  
climate change by demanding sustainable solutions to 
reduce the impact on the environment and their own 
emission targets.

Increasingly, our innovations have a clear and 
demonstrable benefit for the planet, not just our business. 
They are developed with sustainability firmly in mind 
and we seek to ensure that their environmental impact is 
beneficial in relation to existing products and services in 
the marketplace. Our ambition to find more sustainable 
alternatives forms part of our pathway to net zero carbon 
emissions by 2040.

on pages 68 to 82.

Increasing standards 
and consumer 
expectations

Increased regulatory pressures, particularly in food safety, 
to reduce the spread of diseases are increasing the role 
for innovation.

Since the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic we 
have seen elevated standards for health and hygiene, 
particularly in the workplace, with rising demands from 
consumers and customers for higher standards of hygiene 
creating ongoing market opportunities. 

Rentokil Initial has been an innovator in the industry,  
with a steady release of new products and services.  
These include first-of-its-kind products like the energy-
efficient Lumnia insect light trap and our pioneering 
Connect suite of solutions. The successful development 
and deployment of our innovations and digital applications 
strongly differentiates us in the market. It gives us 
solutions to offer our customers and is the lifeblood  
of future growth for the business.

M&A execution, entering 
new markets such as rural 
pest control in New Zealand
We have recently made four investments into  
an exciting new area for Rentokil Initial – rural,  
(non-urban) pest control to support the New Zealand 
government’s significant investment into its  
Predator Free 2050 campaign. 

Predator Free 2050 is a national goal to rid New Zealand 
of the most damaging introduced predators that impact on 
the environment. Pest species such as possums, rodents 
and stoats threaten native wildlife in New Zealand and 
have already caused several critical species’ extinctions.

32 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

The programme encompasses large-scale 
pest control projects, on private and  
public estates, engaging respectfully with 
affected communities, and building strong 
local knowledge and lasting relationships 
for environmental and ecological 
protection. The Central Government is 
providing significant investment to restore 
the environment, and it’s estimated that up  
to a quarter of the investment will be used 
for pest eradication and management. 

We have acquired four new business in 
the last two years (in 2022 we acquired 
EcoFX in the North Island and Vector Free 
Marlborough in the Upper South Island, 
while in 2023 we acquired High Country 
Contracting in the Lower South Island  
and Feracon in the North Island).  
These acquisitions have added rural pest 
management capability to our existing 
urban pest management expertise.

In North America, Revenue was up 79.2%, 
benefiting from a full year of the Terminix 
acquisition. Regional Organic Revenue grew 
3.1%, achieved alongside the full programme 
of the Terminix integration. Organic Revenue 
growth in Pest Control Services for our 
commercial, residential, and termite customers 
was below our expectations at 3.5%, owing to 
lower new business lead generation in a softer 
consumer market in H2. The Pest Control 
category as a whole, which includes the 
Products Distribution and Lake Management 
businesses, recorded Organic Revenue 
growth of 3.1%. Weaker Q3 2023 growth in 
North America continued into the low season 
of Q4 at 1.2%, however Q1 2024 is expected  
to be c.2%. The company has conducted an 
in-depth review to fully examine the drivers  
of the underperformance and formulate a 
strategy to reinvigorate growth, resulting in 
THE RIGHT WAY 2 plan detailed below.

Adjusted Operating Profit growth of 95.9%  
to £618m reflects the combined impact from 
higher revenues and the Terminix acquisition. 
Statutory Operating Profit was up 158.4% to 
£489m at AER. Strong price realisation across 
all channels has successfully offset expected 
inflationary pressures. Adjusted Operating 
Margins in North America were up 160bps 
year-on-year to 18.7%. 

34 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

The full-year impact of lower Terminix margins 
reduced the overall North America margin  
by 70bps. However, Terminix synergies 
delivered a benefit of 140bps, while trading 
improvements, including density from growth 
and prudent cost management, contributed 
90bps of margin.

Total North America colleague retention, 
including Terminix, increased to 75.2% (FY 22: 
70.1%), driven by improvement in retention of 
technician roles. Sales colleague retention was 
flat. Terminix colleague retention has seen 
continued improvement, up to 69.7% (FY 22: 
64.0%). Since the close of the deal in October 
2022, colleague retention at Terminix has 
increased by 8.1ppts. The Group continued to 
make investments in being an Employer of 
Choice, and we are seeing ongoing success 
with our recruiting, onboarding, and training 
initiatives. Despite price increases, total 
customer retention in North America slightly 
increased to 79.5% (FY 22: 79.3%) and 
included an improvement at Terminix. 
Customer satisfaction was also positive,  
with an excellent Terminix Net Promoter  
Score of 64.9, up 1.5 on the prior year. 

Notwithstanding the considerable focus 
required to complete the Terminix transaction, 
our North American bolt- on M&A programme 

continued apace, with the purchase of  
13 businesses with combined annualised 
revenues of around c.£46m in the year prior to 
purchase. This included the acquisition in the 
second half of the year of Action Pest Control, 
a large Midwest provider. As we integrate 
Terminix, we will continue to selectively 
pursue high-quality M&A assets in the North 
America region.

In the year, there was further good progress 
on legacy termite warranty claim volumes,  
with significantly fewer filed warranty claims. 
Total filed warranty claims reduced by 14%  
on the prior year and by 44% since 2019.  
Open warranty claims further reduced by  
29% on the prior year and by 65% since 2019. 
Total filed warranty claims in the Formosan 
termite-heavy Mobile Bay reduced by 48%  
on the prior year and by 80% since 2019. 
Largely as a result of our plan to accelerate  
the resolution of legacy claims, particularly 
focused on complex litigated long-standing 
cases, and a shift in the mix of claim 
resolutions, the blended average settled  
cost per claim, including inflationary impacts, 
was up c.32%. Going forward, we have also 
successfully introduced a termite residential 
sales warranty cap for the lifetime of the 
agreement of $250,000 for new customers 
with qualifying homes.

Organic Growth in H2 2023
An in-depth review was conducted into the 
reasons for the slowdown in regional organic 
growth experienced in the second half  
of 2023. 

We have confirmed that service technician 
retention was further significantly improved 
and customer retention remained resilient 
throughout the period. The pricing strategy 
also continued to be effective, with cost input 
inflation recovered, as expected. 

Organic growth is generated from both 
existing and new customers. Trends in 
upselling to the existing customer base didn’t 
see a material change from prior trends. 
Notwithstanding this, we believe technician 
leads represent an important growth 
opportunity in the US with the potential for 
sizeable upside in the medium term. This is 
based on evidence of the Group’s success in 
other markets. For example, in 2023, c.88%  
of UK pest control technicians participated in 
submitting leads with a c.32% close rate. This 
compared to a US participation rate of c.50% 
and estimated c.20% close rate. Our ‘Trusted 
Advisor’ programme (empowering technician 
leads and sales) already underway in Terminix 
will be rolled out across Rentokil US branches. 

The main challenge to new business growth  
in the second half of the year was lower 
acquisition of new residential, termite and SME 
customers. The largest adverse change was 
observed in inbound sales leads and sales 
enquiries from prospective customers to our 
call centres and websites. In H2, in-bound 
sales leads were down 2-3% in the region.  
We estimate that the US pest control market 
grew at approximately 4% in 2023, reflecting 
lower growth in the residential, termite and 
SME sectors, particularly in H2. This is about 
1% lower than the recent historical average. 
Nevertheless, we recognise that the business 
was not sufficiently effective in attracting  
and closing sales leads. In 2023, integration 
planning focused attention on organisational 
change. Our marketing and sales leadership 
underwent considerable change, which in  
part affected our marketing performance to 
generate leads and convert sales (close rate in 
H2 was flat with prior year). Increased digital 
marketing spend by the competition and flat 
sales colleague retention (c.60% in Terminix 
and c.77% in Rentokil) compounded the overall 
impact. There was also a slightly disruptive 
influence felt from branch closures and pilots. 

THE RIGHT WAY 2 plan
We have taken action to strengthen the North 
America management team and fully resource 
the senior marketing and sales teams ahead  
of the 2024 pest season. In addition to Brad 
Paulsen, recently appointed to the position of 
North America CEO, we have in place new  
and experienced leadership for Residential 
Marketing, Digital Marketing, and Sales.  
We’ve also seconded our UK Operations 
Director to North America to take charge of 
technician sales leads. 

Following the review of H2, the team has  
now defined THE RIGHT WAY 2 plan to 
reinvigorate organic growth in North America. 
The core components of this plan are:

• Driving further improvement in frontline 
colleague retention and productivity, 
in particular in sales to improve sales 
conversion. Our Employer of Choice 
programme will focus on enhanced talent 
acquisition and onboarding, additional 
investment in training, and seasonal sales 
incentive programmes. 

• Investing in a brand strategy to reinforce 

awareness. This includes additional 
investment in the Terminix brand to build  
on its industry-leading awareness (#1 best 
known brand in US pest control according  
to a 2023 Google Brand Arc Study) and  
build preference with our target segments. 
We’ll also continue to build the equity of the 
Rentokil brand to support business growth in 
the National and Strategic accounts space. 

• Adding capabilities and resources in 

marketing to refine our focus and build our 
marketing excellence. In addition to the new 
regional marketing and sales leadership, the 
North America business will benefit from 
increased investment for growth of c.$25m 
towards people, sales leads, digital channels, 
and other brand and marketing activities. 
New marketing agency partnerships are  
now in place and our first multi-channel 
brand marketing campaign will be launched 
in Spring 2024. 

• Strengthening sales effectiveness to target 

increased sales colleague retention, 
particularly in the 0-12 months service 
category. Over time we will introduce new 
data, tools and technologies in order to 
improve timing from sales lead to inspection 
and quote. 

• Enhancing our approach to pricing 

discipline to continue to offset inflation. 
Sales and marketing initiatives will be 
accompanied by continued strong pricing 
discipline for both new and existing 
customers. Our pricing practices will be 
enhanced with third-party tools and data to 
deliver market and segment-specific value  
to customers. This includes the viability 
testing of new AI-backed capabilities.  
We will also optimise bundling, promotions 
and discounting programmes through 
consistent market-level pricing tests. 

• Improving customer satisfaction and 

retention to take it to par with the average 
elsewhere in the Group over time. We are 
dedicated to delivering a consistently 
positive customer experience including 
through investment in our digital platforms, 
in technician training and in our contract 
renewal processes. 

• Increasing technician sales leads to expand 
revenue from existing customers. Through 
execution of the Trusted Advisor Programme, 
we’re focused on driving up the volume, 
value, and conversion rate of technician 
leads towards the UK benchmark over time. 
In 2024 the Trusted Advisor programme will 
be rolled out to Rentokil technicians. 

Rentokil Initial has a proven long-term track 
record of operating very successfully through 
economic cycles. We are confident the team 
has the skills, know-how and insights to get 
growth back on track.

The region has enjoyed strong performance  
in 2023. Topline momentum in the first half of 
the year carried into the second half, driven by 
both effective price increases and resilience  
in overall demand. Revenue grew by 14.6% in 
the year to £1,078m (9.2% Organic). Revenue 
growth in Pest Control was 21.8%, with a 
strong contribution from key markets including 
France, Benelux, and Germany. Hygiene & 
Wellbeing grew Revenue by 5.8% in the 
period, driven by broad-based strength across 
the region and continued momentum in the 
core washrooms business. Ambius, part of the 
Enhanced Environments business, sustained  
a good performance through the year.  
As anticipated, there was an improvement  
in Specialist Hygiene and Dental in the  
second half of the year, after a period of 
post-COVID-19 disruption. 

UK & Sub-Saharan Africa

France Workwear Revenue was up 13.2%. 
Strong new business sales performance was 
reflected in its contribution, which was also 
supported by robust pricing.

Adjusted Operating Profit in the region grew 
by 12.5% to £210m. Statutory Operating Profit 
was up 15.6% to £182m at AER. In Europe, as 
expected, short-term H1 margin pressure from 
increased M&A activity reversed in H2. The H1 
headwind plus continued hyperinflation in 
Argentina in the aggregate resulted in full-year 
Adjusted Operating Margin down slightly by 
40bps to 19.5%. While inflationary pressures 
have persisted throughout the period, in 
Europe and most of LATAM we have been 
successful at protecting margins with 
pass-through pricing. Customer retention has 
remained strong at 88.4% (FY 22: 88.5%). 

A focus on sales retention, including 
recruitment, onboarding and early days 
retention led to excellent colleague retention 
rates of 90.4% (FY 22: 89.1%), with the 
business recording some of its best months 
on record in the second half of the year. 

In Europe and LATAM, 11 business acquisitions 
(five in Europe and six in LATAM) were 
completed in total with annualised revenues  
of c.£12m in the year prior to purchase.

The region delivered a good trading 
performance against a challenging macro 
backdrop and strong prior year comparators, 
especially in the first half of the year. 
Performance in the mature UK market was 
supported by strong service innovation and 
a record performance from technician sales 
leads. Revenue for the region overall 
increased by 7.9% (3.5% Organic). Pest Control 
grew by 8.0%. Hygiene & Wellbeing increased 
by 7.7%, lapping COVID-19-boosted 
comparators in the medical waste business. 
There was a positive contribution from the 
recently acquired Urban Planters business, 
which supplies plants to retail properties, 
offices, and restaurants. This was 
accompanied by an improved performance 
year-on-year in the UK Property Care business 
despite the cooler property market. 

Regional Adjusted Operating Profit decreased 
by 0.5% to £95m. Statutory Operating Profit 
was down 6.6% to £84m at AER. Adjusted 
Operating Margins decreased by 200bps  
to 24.1%. As previously stated, margin 
performance in the first half of the year was 
dampened by the anticipated reduction in 
COVID-19 disinfection and related services, 
such as needle and PPE disposal, and the 
non-repeat of UK COVID-19 credit note 
releases. However, these factors substantially 
fell away in H2. Cash performance has been 
strong in the year with debtor days finishing 
the year ahead of pre-COVID-19 levels. 
Inflationary pressures have been significant, 
but the region’s long-established pricing and 
margin management systems, process, and 
controls have delivered a price performance 
that mitigates these cost increases.

Annual Report 2023

These price increases have been delivered 
alongside a further improved customer 
retention rate of 86.9% (FY 22: 86.6%) and 
world class customer experience scores. 
Colleague retention for the full year was up 
strongly to 83.3% (FY 22: 77.9%).

The region delivered a good 2023 
performance. Revenue rose by 11.2%, of 
which 10.2% was Organic, underpinned 
by contractual activity. Pricing was 
complemented with volume growth, as 
markets overall remained structurally 
supportive. The performance was led by the 
region’s largest markets: India, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, and Singapore. Hong Kong 
continued to be challenged by a subdued 
economic environment, however there was 
a more positive contribution from China. 

Adjusted Operating Profit in Asia increased 
4.0% to £47m and Adjusted Operating Margin 
was down 100bps to 13.1%, lapping stronger 
COVID-19 disinfection revenues. Operating 
Profit was up 40.3% to £33m at AER. Customer 
retention was 78.7% (FY 22: 81.3%). Regional 
operations have benefited from an increased 
colleague retention rate of 92.0% (FY 22: 
86.1%), while the average time to fill vacancies 
has remained stable year on year. The region 
acquired seven businesses with total

15.0% to £261m. Organic Revenue grew 6.8% 
as pricing was complemented with volume 
growth. Pest Control delivered 25.2% Revenue 
growth, with notable strength in commercial 
services. Good sales and customer retention 
were also evident in the Hygiene & Wellbeing 
business, where Revenue growth was 6.4%. 
The region saw good demand for Ambius 
services.

Adjusted Operating Profit in the Pacific grew 
strongly by 19.8% to £57m and Adjusted 
Operating Margins rose by 90bps to 21.7%, 
with year-on-year improvement across both 
Pest Control and Hygiene & Wellbeing 
categories, supported by effective mitigation 
of cost inflation. Operating Profit was up 19.5%

Success in driving Organic 
Revenue Growth in Pest 
Control in Europe, through 
an enhanced customer 
experience
In recent years our European business has been focusing 
heavily on becoming more customer-centric. This started 
with a vision for how the future would be: to provide an 
experience that every customer enjoys, and every 
colleague is proud to deliver every time.

>80%

colleague satisfaction 
with training

The impact has already been 
profound: Customer Voice Counts 
in Europe has increased by around 
five Net Promoter Score points and 
colleague satisfaction with training 
has typically exceeded 80%. 

Genesys is helping the teams 
manage customer contact better 
than before and, in Austria and 
Switzerland alone, customers 
abandoning calls because they 
weren’t answered promptly 
reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, 
1View is already helping colleagues 
in Portugal solve customer 
problems 25% faster than before 
and at half the cost. 

More training and platform 
deployments are going to follow  
in the coming years, creating  
a customer experience that all  
colleagues in Europe can be  
proud to deliver every time.

The first step was to create a 
five-point strategy of what the 
business wanted to achieve:  
a customer experience culture;  
a recognised customer experience 
function; simple customer 
experience processes; a proactive 
customer experience; and all of 
that underpinned by technology. 

We also invested in a 
transformation programme, led  
by experts and working in close 
partnership with colleagues from 
all European markets and Group 
functions. 

In 2023, this led to: more than  
20 hours’ training delivered to 
around 200 customer care 
colleagues across Europe; 
increasing the number of markets 
with Genesys (a platform for 
improving the handling of customer 
communications) to nine; piloting  
a new customer management 
system, 1View, in Portugal; 
implementing customer 
satisfaction surveys in Spain and 
Switzerland; and, in Belgium, 
piloting new ways of coaching 
colleagues on how to best handle 
customer calls.

Our Pest Control business, now including 
Terminix, is the largest operator in both the 
US, the world’s biggest pest control market, 
and the world. Overall, the business delivered 
good growth in the year, underpinned by the 
critical nature of its services. Revenue was 
up by 60.6% (4.5% Organic) to £4,321m. 
Performance has been supported by both 
pricing and volumes, led by the Commercial 
Pest Control business, which has a high 
proportion of contractual activity. Both 
Commercial and Residential Pest Control 
businesses have benefited from resilient 
customer retention rates. Adjusted Operating 
Profit was up by 66.7% to £828m, resulting in 
an Adjusted Operating Margin of 19.2%, up 
70bps on the prior year, including a benefit 
from Terminix integration synergies of 130bps. 
Operating Profit was up by 107.5% to £649m at 
AER. For FY 23, Pest Control represented 80% 
of Group Revenue and 81% of Group Adjusted 
Operating Profit.

In 2023, new contracts for global accounts 
(multinational customers) were signed in the 
pharma and hotel, restaurant and catering 
sectors. Global Accounts now oversee 
revenues of over £100m, an increase of 14% 
on FY 22. 91% of total revenues in the Pest 
Control category were delivered by Growth 
markets and 9% by Emerging markets. 

M&A has continued to be strong this year, and 
we have acquired 34 pest control businesses 
in the period, with annualised revenues in the 
year prior to acquisition of c.£76m.

Pest Control

Our Pest Control strategy: key strategic themes

Global leadership  
driving growth 
Driving growth in Growth and Emerging 
markets organically and through M&A. 

Objective
We will seek to accelerate business growth  
by building on our global leadership, through 
further expansion, particularly in North 
America and Emerging markets, both 
organically and through M&A. In North 
America, we will leverage our scale and build 
market share through a balanced programme 
combining organic initiatives and targeted 
M&A to build density and increase our 
expertise in new pest sectors such as vector 
control and lake management.

How we have performed in the year
• Organic Revenue Growth of 4.5%, with 3.1% 

in North America. Growth supported by 
pricing and volumes, led by the commercial 
pest control business.

• Acquired c.£76m in revenue through 34 
acquisitions, with 13 in the US market.

• New US Innovation Centre built in Dallas 

opening in 2024.

• Global accounts (multinational customers e.g. 
food producers, pharma, hotels, restaurants 
and catering, etc.) now oversee revenues of 
over £100m, +14% growth in the year.

Building on strengths 
of leading brands 
Continuing to be recognised as the world’s 
leading brand in pest control.

Objective
Rentokil is the leading pest control brand in 
the world and the leading commercial pest 
control brand in North America. Terminix is 
the most recognised brand for termite and 
residential pest management in the US. 
We continue to focus on building the brand 
through ongoing investments in people, 
service, innovation, digital capabilities, and 
sustainability. We are driving our brand 
alignment efforts for a unified, consistent 
global presence to build trust and credibility, 
and effectively track and measure our brand 
equity. This is accomplished through central 
deployment of global campaigns with 
supporting toolkits for local activation through 
a wide range of communication channels, and 
building market share through a balanced 
programme combining organic initiatives. 

How we have performed in the year
• Development of a new marketing campaign 
in the US to support organic growth plans, 
rolling out in 2024.

• Customer satisfaction improvement in 
Europe with +5 point increase in Net 
Promoter Score.

• Social media campaigns across LinkedIn  

and X to support brand awareness.

Building scale and density 
through M&A
Continued M&A strategy to expand the city 
footprint and density. 

Objective
Acquisitions are a core part of our Pest Control 
growth strategy targeting acquisitions in key 
markets to build scale and density, increase 
our competitive positioning and improve our 
ability to service customers, targeting 
acquisitions in new countries and in 
megacities and large cities where we have 
identified strong growth potential.

How we have performed in the year
• £199m spent on Pest Control M&A, with 
34 businesses acquired with combined 
annualised revenues of c.£76m.

• Strong M&A in North America, Pacific, 

Europe, and UK.

• Acquisition in the second half of the year 
of Action Pest Control, a large Midwest 
US provider.

Differentiation through  
our innovation pipeline
An increasing focus on non-toxic pest control 
solutions.

Objective
Our culture of constant innovation drives  
our success, with science at the heart of  
our approach by our experts in our global 
innovation centres, driven by our goal to be 
the most loved pest control company in the 
world. In 2023, we have invested c.£10m 
across the world in pest control R&D, with 
3,000 colleagues supporting our innovation 
pipeline, and with more than 50 partners 
working with us to deliver best-quality 
solutions at pace.

How we have performed in the year
• £10m invested in R&D globally.

• 445,000 Lumnia units now installed,  

with energy savings of up to 79%.

Harnessing the digital 
opportunity
Using our digital expertise, including web, 
apps, portals, and services to lead digital 
pest control.

Objective
Digital innovation in pest control is necessary 
to meet the needs of an evolving world. 
Our smart technology is providing more 
remote monitoring solutions and increased 
transparency of data. We have also begun 
to integrate our data automatically into 
customers’ own internal reporting platforms. 
Our robust, scalable, and secure global 
infrastructure aims to meet the evolving 
digital needs of our customers.

How we have performed in the year
• myRentokil 24/7 self-service portal is now 

operational in 51 countries, supporting over 
300,000 users. User sessions in 2023 
increased by 35%.

• Increased PestConnect units in the year  
by c.23% to around 356,000 in operation 
across 21,000 sites.

• We now have five countries where 

connected devices account for more than 
10% of the commercial portfolio.

• Developed RADAR X dual catch unit, ready 
for launch in 2024. Enhancements not only 
for operational efficiency but also for 
sustainability. 

Meeting the demand for innovative, 
non-toxic, sustainable applications 
Through products designed and tested in  
our Innovation Centres, Rentokil is constantly 
adapting to changing regulations in the 
industry and the demand from consumers for 
non-toxic, or humane, sustainable solutions, 
leading the way with our own-designed 
solutions.

Intelligent bird scaring 
Birds can spread disease with their droppings, 
damage buildings and equipment, and create 
health and safety risks. Rentokil’s innovative 
bird management service includes Intelligent 
Bird Scaring (BirdAlert), an effective and 
sustainable device that’s been designed to 
deter birds without harm and is controlled and 
monitored remotely via an app. The BirdAlert 
device has an intelligent built-in system that 
recognises different bird species and identifies 
the best scare tool from a broad range to deter 
each of them. 

It can detect birds inside a radius of  
250 metres and can alternate the order  
and intensity of the scare tools to prevent 
habituation. Our new upgraded unit uses  
60% less power, contributing to a 50% 
reduction in carbon footprint. It is also made 
from 100% recycled plastic and is faster and 
easier to install. 

Effective and safe fly catching
Global population growth and rapid migration 
from rural areas to urban centres has led to an 
increase in food sources and living habitats for 
flies, cockroaches, and mosquitoes. This 
increase has driven growth in the fly trap 
market across commercial customers, with 
North America accounting for 43% of the 
global fly trap revenue. Rentokil’s fly control 
solutions include the newly launched 
sustainable exterior fly control solution, 
EcoCatch Flies, a reusable, effective external 
fly trap, that provides non-toxic and flexible 
control of ‘public health flies’. EcoCatch Flies  
is a visually aesthetic fly control solution that 
hides the flies captured in a more appealing 
container, catching 60% more flies in 24 hours 
(in controlled laboratory conditions), making it 
a very effective solution for use in outside 
areas in hospitality, hotel and pub gardens, 
and terraces, as well as outside bin and waste 
areas. Over 30% of the non-toxic, reusable 
trap unit is made from recycled plastics.

RADAR X
Delivering breakthrough solutions that reduce 
waste is integral to our innovation approach at 
Rentokil Initial. This is quite unique within the 
pest control industry, but a bar we strive to set 
ourselves and surpass as we challenge and 
reinvent what’s possible. RADAR X is our latest 
exciting step forward in our goal. 

RADAR X, our new industry-leading mouse 
riddance solution with dual catch and 
monitoring capability, offers a much-needed 
alternative to conventional chemical 
rodenticide practices. Our 24/7 connect 
monitoring ability enables early detection  
of pest activity and targeted intervention, 
reducing service inefficiency and associated 
CO2 emissions. It protects customers from the 
disruption pest infestations can cause, as well 
as minimising the risk of secondary poisoning 
to non-target species. It is designed as a novel 
modular system, which enables specific 
components to be swapped rather than 
needing to discard the whole unit if one part 
needs replacing. This not only minimises 
plastic and electronic waste, but also extends 
the lifespan of the product to deliver effective 
indoor mouse control for longer.

Terminix integration

Our Terminix vision
Our vision is to create a world-class business with market leading brands, highly motivated 
people, strong customer relationships, and with high levels of efficiency and growth to 
deliver strong financial returns for shareholders:

•  No. 1 in Commercial, Residential, and Termite;
•  Scale and density, with an outstanding network coverage across the entire USA;

•  Proven, repeatable, low-cost operating model and multiple drivers of revenue growth; 

Terminix integration phases

and

• Deliver significant value creation, including gross synergies of $325m by 2026.

Post-integration, our ambition is to generate Organic Revenue Growth in Pest Control 
Services of 1.5x the market over the medium term.

Phase One
Foundations: 
Complete

Terminix integration process
The Terminix integration process continues to 
make very good progress. We have completed 
the first phase of the integration and, in 2023, 
we delivered $69m of synergies, ahead of our 
target of $60m. Overall, we have delivered 
pre-tax net P&L cost synergies of $82m since 
completion of the deal. 

We have announced a further increase in the 
target for total integration cost synergies from 
the integration of Terminix – increasing the 
gross synergy target to $325m (previously 
$275m) and net synergy target to $225m 
(previously $200m). 

The timetable for integration is now set to be 
completed in 2026, rather than 2025, in order 
to de-risk the branch integrations and achieve 
greater synergies.

Pest Control

Organic growth in North America

In 2023, Organic Revenue Growth in North 
America was below our expectations at 3.1% 
and at 3.5% in Pest Control Services. 

We have undertaken a detailed evaluation, 
including through an independent third party, 
to identify the reasons for the reduction in 
organic growth in Pest Control Services and  
to put in place a thorough plan for 2024. While 
there were several factors including – lower 
market growth in termite, residential and SME, 
performance of our own marketing channels 
to generate sales leads from potential new 
customers, the impact of the business focus 

on integration, considerable change within  
the team and the impact from branch closures 
– the lower organic performance was 
predominantly due to a reduction in inbound 
sales leads from potential new customers of 
c.2-3% in H2. 

In our contracted portfolio business, Organic 
Revenue Growth is generated from both 
existing and new customers. In 2023, there 
was good progress in our activities to 
generate sales leads and organic growth from 
existing customers in North America, with 
strong improvement in service technicians’ 

retention, excellent customer satisfaction  
and strong State of Service performance, the 
benefit of strong pricing offsetting inflation 
and slightly improved sales leads from service 
technicians. 

The focus for 2024 is on generating sales from 
new customers which starts by getting it right 
for our sales colleagues, using the power of 
our brands, marketing and search engine 
optimisation (SEO), the effective management 
of inbound leads through to our sales 
channels, optimised pricing, and efficient  
and timely service implementation.

Plan: Increase sales leads and organic growth from 
new customers

Colleagues: 
Following a successful 2023, we aim to increase service technician 
retention with investment in training and tools to increase 
productivity. 

Customers: 
We will analyse customer feedback and Net Promoter Score data 
to identify customer experience areas of strength and opportunity. 
We aim to reduce known customer experience friction points 
including scheduling, billing and issue resolution. We will build 
out our ‘Save Angels’ programme to win back customers and 
reduce customer churn.

Pricing: 
Our plan is to enhance current pricing practices with third-party 
tools and data to deliver market and segment-specific pricing.  
We will test new AI-backed programmes to further optimise our 
pricing activities. 

Technician leads and selling: 
We will accelerate our Trusted Advisor programme and aim to 
increase technician participation in generating sales leads. 
Currently implemented for Terminix, this will be extended in 2024 
to Rentokil technicians through their existing, standard systems.

Colleagues: 
We will focus on improving sales colleague retention with enhanced 
onboarding, training and harmonised compensation plans.

Increase brand visibility:
We have defined a new brand strategy which will be implemented 
across multiple marketing channels. There will be investment in the 
Terminix brand to maintain industry leading awareness and build 
preference for our service within our Residential and SME customer 
segments. We will build the equity of the Rentokil brand to support 
business growth in national and strategic commercial accounts. 

Investment for growth:
We will invest c.$25m in the North American sales leads, our own 
digital channels, brand and marketing. This includes our first brand 
marketing campaign for two years. The ‘Terminix It’ campaign goes 
live in March 2024 in the US.

Sales conversion effectiveness:
We will use tools, data and technology to seek to reduce the 
average time between lead generation and initial sales contact.

Technician install productivity: 
Our plan is to increase route productivity and on-time arrival  
through PestPac ‘Best Fit’ with adherence to our sequential routing 
programme. In 2024 we will launch Rentokil Terminix University 
Certification programmes to standardise and enhance our service 
treatment programmes.

North America

Manage the integration  
of Terminix into our  
North America business  
by merging and  
expanding branches
In early 2023, we began one of the initial phases of our 
programme with integration pilot tests, undertaking two 
large branch integrations within the Rentokil  
North America legacy network. 

These covered the consolidation of a total of 40 branches 
into 23 branches. Locations had previously each been 
serviced by several different brands, service protocols, 
operating systems, and pay plans.

in 2023

branch integration pilots

Our evaluation of these pilots found that the migration, 
while demanding, was successful, with clear evidence of 
route and branch density benefits. The combination of 
larger branches with higher network density drove margin 
expansion of approximately five percentage points in the 
pilot areas. 

Through the course of 2023 we continued with the 
programme of branch co-locations, with a net reduction  
in the branch network of 97 branches.

In the year we also conducted a detailed analysis of our 
North America branch network that showed a clear link 
between branch size and margin, such that branches 
with annual revenue of more than $8m deliver Adjusted 
Operating Profit margin that is about 10% higher than 
branches with revenue of less than $3m. At the start of 
2023, across our network of more than 600 branches, 
we had at least 100 branches operating at more than 
$8m annual revenue and around 200 operating at less 
than $3m annual revenue.

Hygiene  
& Wellbeing

What we do
At Rentokil Initial, our Hygiene & Wellbeing technicians 
provide hygiene services to business environments to 
make them cleaner, safer and healthier, improve air 
quality, and ensure more pleasant places in which to 
operate. Establishing good hygiene practices 
throughout an organisation reduces the risk of infection 
being passed from person to person. As a result, fewer 
days are lost to sickness, which translates directly into 
real cost savings and increased productivity. Trading 
under the Initial brand, we offer the widest range  
of washroom hygiene services and products inside  
the washroom. 

Our Enhanced Environments businesses improve  
the occupant experience beyond the washroom and 
throughout customer premises. We also operate 
Ambius plants and scenting, Dental Hygiene and 
Cleanroom services operations. 

Growing the category
Our core Hygiene services currently operate 
in 61 countries and we aim to increase the 
reach and density of our footprint in new 
markets through leveraging our brand and 
expertise, creating differentiated products, 
and replicating the low-cost operating model 
that is used in our Pest Control business. 
Starting with core hygiene service provision 
Inside the Washroom, and then extending into 
Premises Hygiene and Enhanced 
Environments, our growth in the Hygiene 
category is supported by being experts in the 
category, delivered through service, product 
innovation, and sales capability.

Shared infrastructure
Hygiene & Wellbeing is a strong, 
complementary business to Pest Control.  
Both businesses service the same types of 
customer and share country management, 
technology, infrastructure, and back-office 
services. They are route-based businesses 
where profit growth is driven by a deep 
understanding of the importance of density.

Annual Report 2023

Our customers
Initial operates in 61 markets across six main 
customer segments: education, leisure & 
hospitality, healthcare, offices, manufacturing 
and retail. Our high customer satisfaction 
levels of 49.3 provide a key competitive 
advantage. Customer Voice Counts surveys 
are used to improve service levels and every 
detractor score is followed up with a call from 
an account/branch manager to discuss 
improvements.

• Hygiene has expanded beyond the 

washroom and buyers now have a greater 
appreciation for the value of good hygiene 
standards across their locations and look  
for expertise.

• There is now often a shared responsibility  
for washroom purchasing, as the value of 
hygiene has elevated, facilities buyers have 
been joined by commercial, operations, and 
health and safety.

• Strong preference for new digital reality 

means that digital prospecting and selling 
is becoming as effective as in-person 
engagement.

Rentokil Initial offers a wide range of hygiene 
and wellbeing services. Inside the washroom 
we provide hand hygiene (soaps and driers), 
air care, in-cubicle (feminine hygiene units), 
no-touch products, and digital hygiene 
services. In addition to core washroom 
hygiene, we deliver specialist hygiene 
services such as clinical waste management. 
We’re also improving the customer experience 
through premium scenting, plants, air quality 
monitoring, and green walls. 

Hygiene & Wellbeing Revenue increased 
by 5.4% to £866m. In addition to supportive 
pricing, continued good levels of demand 
across service sectors such as offices, 
shops, schools, and hospitality supported 
performance. Organic Revenue Growth was 
4.8%. In 2023, COVID-19 disinfection services 
generated £2m of revenues (FY 22: £21m) 
reducing category Organic Revenue Growth 
by 240bps and Group Organic Revenue 
Growth by 40bps. We see the main 
opportunities for future growth in our Hygiene 
& Wellbeing category as being core 
washrooms, premises hygiene, including air 
care, and enhanced environments. In 2023, 
Organic Revenue Growth in core washrooms 
was 4.5%, while organic growth in premises 
hygiene and enhanced environments was 
5.3%. Adjusted Operating Profit was down by 
1.5% to £161m due to COVID-19-boosted prior 
year comparators in H1 (Operating Profit was 
down by 4.9% to £149m at AER). Adjusted 
Operating Margin was 18.5%. 

We have acquired seven hygiene companies 
this year with annualised revenues of c.£30m 
in the year prior to purchase.

Hygiene & Wellbeing

Our Hygiene & Wellbeing strategy: key strategic themes 

Our strategy is to deliver continued growth through a combination of strong 
operational focus and targeted M&A to build city density. Central to this is 
the delivery of excellent customer service, product innovation, service line 
extensions, and improvements to productivity through digital products 
and applications.

Offer a complete  
product range
Avoiding cross-infection Inside the Washroom.

How we have performed in the year
• Range extensions (e.g. hand, air, and 
in-cubicle) supporting retention and 
increasing solution density.

Objective
An increased awareness of cubicle and 
washroom hygiene is providing more 
opportunities for new products and services 
for inside washrooms; expanding into new 
services for existing customers (e.g. air 
hygiene); new sales channels for existing 
washroom customers through the use of 
technology; satisfying demand for new, more 
sustainable services; and range extensions 
(e.g. no-touch washrooms).

• Attainment of EU and Nordic Swan  

Ecolabel accreditation for sustainability  
for Initial soap range.

• New innovations in Signature Scent, 

Signature Sustainable bins optimisation.

Focus on operational 
execution 
Building margins through postcode and 
product density.

Objective
Operational excellence is achieved through 
the commitment of our people and the earned 
respect for our brand and reputation. Creating 
a high-quality customer service culture and 
offering the best product ranges, as well as 
delivering our services, on time and in full,  
are core to our value proposition.

Margins are driven through postcode density 
(the number of customers on a route) and 
product density (the number of products/ 
service lines in each customer premises), as 
well as shared overheads with Pest Control 
(infrastructure and back office) and M&A 
(building further geographic density). 

How we have performed in the year
• Margin recovery in the second half was 
expected, and is stable following the 
prior-year boost of COVID-19 impacts.

• Focused on core segments of Education, 
Leisure/Hospitality, Healthcare, Offices, 
Manufacturing, and Retail.

Ecolabel sustainability accreditation
With sustainability a central theme of Rentokil 
Initial’s growth strategy, Initial Hygiene is 
driving leadership in sustainable hygiene and 
wellbeing, committed to actively reducing 
packaging waste and plastic use, as well as 
designing solutions for easier recycling. With 
increasing regulation of the industry and with 
more and more customers and users asking 
for environmentally friendly solutions, Initial’s 
soap range, including Halal and vegan 
versions and its hand, hair and shower range, 
used in gyms and hotels has been awarded 
the EU and Nordic Swan Ecolabel 
accreditations, one of the world’s most 
coveted sustainability accreditations.

The EU and Nordic Swan Ecolabel is an 
environmental labelling scheme certifying  
that a product or service complies with the 
requirements for the label. As one of the 
world’s toughest environmental certifications, 
the Nordic Swan Ecolabel is only awarded to 
products and services meeting ambitious 
environmental requirements.

Celebrating 120 years of Initial Hygiene
In 2023, Initial Hygiene celebrated 120 years 
of service. From humble beginnings in 1903, 
when Mr A P Bigelow, a soap salesperson in 
New York, brought linen supply services to 
Europe, he saw an opportunity and took it, 
relocating to London to start a personalised 
towel rental service for businesses there. His 
first innovation was simple but effective – 
each towel was marked with the customer’s 
initials to ensure they only received and used 
their own towels. From that creative idea 
sprung the business: ‘Initial Towel Supply 
Company’. 

In 1928 when it floated on the London Stock 
Exchange, Initial had become the leading firm 
of its kind and was one of the largest buyers  
of towels in the world. Over the next 70 years 
Initial grew into a world leader in hygiene and 
washroom services, through innovative 
leadership and global expansion. It was 
acquired by Rentokil in 1996 and under its 
ownership it continued to focus on innovation, 
whilst broadening its services beyond the 
washroom into a Hygiene & Wellbeing leader 
and putting preserving the planet at its core.

Geographic expansion 
through organic actions and targeted, 
city-based M&A to build density and  
grow profits.

Hygiene & Wellbeing has a strong growth 
opportunity through M&A, replicating the 
successful Pest Control model, which has 
similar characteristics. Our M&A focus is on 
building city density and supporting extension 
areas that we have defined as part of our 
growth plans, including air care, surface 
hygiene, safety, and digital monitoring. The 
economics of hygiene M&A are generally 
good, asset prices tend to be lower than  
pest control, and there is less competition  
for targets.

Our planned M&A programme extends across 
our five regions, from North America to the 
Rest of the World, as we actively seek to build 
local density in cities where we operate, as 
well as targeting major Cities of the Future 
where growth is set to increase.

How we have performed in the year
• Strong M&A in Hygiene & Wellbeing, with 

c.£30m annualised revenue acquired 
through seven acquisitions.

• M&A expansion in Brunei, Spain, 
Guadeloupe, Australia and UK.

Expanding outside  
the washroom
Take our Hygiene services everywhere.

Objective
From a relatively low-interest sector, hygiene 
is now one of the world’s most important, 
presenting opportunities for us to expand 
outside the washroom into new growth areas, 
including surface hygiene, specialist hygiene 
services, air care, air enhancement and 
purification, sustainable waste management, 
products, and expertise to enhance public 
spaces and buildings, route-based service 
extensions (such as first aid), digital products 
and applications, and the alignment of hygiene 
with the importance of wellbeing. Enhancing 
work and commercial environments to entice 
guests and workers in and increase dwell time 
has grown in importance. 

How we have performed in the year
• Good growth outside core washrooms has 

been seen in hygiene, air care, and 
enhanced environments (planting). 

• Air Care growth of c.6% to c.£65m revenue. 
Air Freshening accounts for the majority of 
the air category revenue at 71.5%.

• Enhanced Environments has seen strong 
growth, with the expansion of Ambius and 
planting. 

• Key focus on to improving sustainability 

across non-core areas.

Harnessing the  
digital opportunity
Developing digital innovations to address 
customer needs and increase productivity.

We continue to develop digital products for 
enhanced services combined with greater 
reporting and insight, taking our digital 
expertise from Pest Control and expanding 
into Hygiene & Wellbeing. 

Our myInitial online reporting platform adds 
efficiency to our operations by providing 
transparency of service, including signature 
capture, service history and details, dates  
of visits, and reporting facilities. A new and 
enhanced version was launched in 2022  
and continues to be rolled out across our 
customer base. 

How we have performed in the year
• 45,000 myInitial customer portal users now 

registered, with a 35% increase in user 
sessions in 2023.

• New and enhanced version rolled out in 

21 countries.

During the year, Initial Hygiene in the UK announced  
a strategic partnership with the England and Wales 
Cricket Board (ECB) to work together to ensure that 
menstruation is not something that holds women 
and girls back from being involved in sport. 

We Got Game is the womens’ and girls’ cricket  
community across England and Wales and is supporting 
this important initiative by helping to reach, support, and 
educate the cricket network about period dignity.

Annual Report 2023

Initial Hygiene’s In-Cubicle Period Dignity Dispensers will 
be supplied to up to 1,000 grassroots cricket clubs, along 
with the free servicing of period waste bins. These 
dispensers provide free and discreet access to period 
products within the toilet cubicle for those who menstruate. 

A pilot programme is now underway in Derbyshire, with  
the support of the Derbyshire Cricket Foundation, and  
will shortly be rolled out across England and Wales. 

ECB and Initial Hygiene both believe that periods shouldn’t 
be a taboo subject, and alongside access to free period 
products, we will also be sharing educational material with 
the cricket clubs involved, to open up dialogue as we look 
to normalise conversations about periods and empower 
future generations.

continued

Revenue
The Group delivered a good topline performance, with Revenue rising 
45.8% to £5,414m. Organic Revenue grew 4.9%. Statutory Revenue was 
up 44.7% to £5,375m at AER. Revenue growth in North America was up 
79.2%, benefiting from the Terminix acquisition. Europe, the Group’s 
second largest region, was up strongly by 14.6%, while the Asia & 
MENAT region was up 11.2%. Group Organic Revenue growth including 
COVID disinfection was 4.5%. 

Cash (at AER)
Net cash flows from operating activities have risen by 22.8% to  
£737m in 2023. Free Cash Flow of £500m was £126m higher than in  
FY 22. Higher trading profits resulted from organic and acquisitive 
growth. Adjusted EBITDA was £1,228m, up 43.0% versus 2022.  
One-off and adjusting items (non-cash) of £11m inflow (FY 22: £77m) 
represent Terminix related one-time share incentive schemes and  
asset impairments. 

Our Pest Control category grew Revenue by 60.6% (4.5% Organic) to 
£4,321m, underpinned by continued effective pricing and resilient 
customer retention. Hygiene & Wellbeing Revenue increased by 5.4% 
(4.8% Organic) to £866m, led by continued demand for washroom 
services. Strong new business sales performance was reflected in the 
contribution from our France Workwear business, with Revenue up by 
13.2% to £217m (13.2% Organic).

Profit
Adjusted Operating Profit rose by 57.0% during the year to £897m, 
reflecting a full year of Terminix profit and core business growth across 
major regions, in addition to effective ongoing capture of synergies from 
the Terminix transaction. This led to a 120bps increase year on year in 
Group Adjusted Operating Margin to 16.6%. Synergies from the Terminix 
transaction contributed 100bps to Group margin. Statutory Operating 
Profit at AER was up 96.9% to £625m. We have continued to deliver on 
our strategy of driving density improvements and M&A integration. Price 
increases have also been successfully implemented over the course of 
the year to offset the impacts of inflation on our cost base. The ability  
of the Group overall to offset inflationary pressures for another year 
demonstrates the resilience of the business model and the essential 
nature of our core products and services.

Within business categories, Adjusted Operating Margin for Pest Control 
was up by 70bps year on year to 19.2% (FY 22: 18.5%). Hygiene & 
Wellbeing Adjusted Operating Margin decreased by 130bps year on 
year to 18.5% (FY 22: 19.8%). However, Hygiene & Wellbeing margin was 
20.2% for H2, in line with the guidance of above 19.0% for H2, issued at 
the Interim Results. The half year and full year 2024 margin profile of 
Hygiene & Wellbeing is expected to be similar to 2023. 

Adjusted Profit before Tax (at AER) of £766m, which excludes one-off 
and adjusting items and amortisation costs, increased by 43.8%. 
Adjusted interest of £141m at actual exchange rates was higher year on 
year, partly reflecting £86m of annualised interest charges relating to 
the financing of the Terminix transaction, £15m of lease interest charges 
and a £7m offsetting reduction from the impacts of hyperinflation and 
net interest received. In the year, hyperinflation of £11m at AER in 2023 
was £11m lower than the prior year (FY 22: £22m) due to devaluation of 
the Argentinian peso. Full year restructuring costs of £9m at CER (£7m  
at AER) were down £3m on the prior year, consisting mainly of costs in 
respect of initiatives focused on our North American and Argentinian 
transformation programmes. One-off and adjusting items (operating) at 
AER of £98m includes £1m of deal costs and £81m of integration costs 
related to the Terminix acquisition (‘Costs to Achieve’) and £17m of other 
M&A costs. Statutory profit before tax at AER was £493m, an increase  
of 66.9% on the prior year (FY 22: £296m) reflecting a full year of 
Terminix profits net of one-off and adjusting items/Costs to Achieve  
and increased interest costs relating to the Terminix transaction.

The Group had a £47m working capital outflow in FY 23. Working capital 
was driven higher by revenue growth, predominantly in North America and 
Europe, across receivables and contract cost assets. Capital expenditure  
of £211m was incurred in the period (FY 22: £190m), reflecting a more 
normal pattern of spend post pandemic and the inclusion of Terminix  
capital expenditure. Lease payments were up 45.2%.

Cash interest payments of £166m were £127m higher than in the prior 
year, reflecting the timing of interest charge payments relating to 
financing of the Terminix transaction. Cash tax payments for the period 
were £100m, an increase of £23m compared with the corresponding 
period last year. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion was 89.4%.

Integration of Terminix
Strong progress on the integration; gross synergy target raised  
by $50m to $325m 
The Terminix integration continues to make very good progress.  
We have completed the first phase of the integration and in 2023 we 
delivered $69m of net synergies, ahead of our target of $60m. Overall, 
we have delivered pre-tax net P&L cost synergies of $82m to date. 

We have announced a second increase in the target for the total value 
of integration cost synergies from the integration of Terminix – the gross 
synergies target is increased by $50m to $325m and the net synergies 
target is increased by $25m to $225m. $106m gross and $40m net cost 
synergies are expected to be delivered in 2024. 

The timetable for integration is now set to be completed in 2026, rather 
than 2025, in order to de-risk the branch integrations and achieve 
greater synergy targets.

Phase One (foundations) complete
Phase One of the integration completed at the end of 2023 and has 
delivered the foundations for success. Further to the Selling, General 
and Administrative (SG&A) initiatives, large integration pilots and initial 
branch co-locations communicated at the Interim Results, substantial 
headway continued to be made in H2, in preparation for the frontline 
route and branch integration that is set to commence mid 2024. 

An additional 44 branch locations were exited in the second half of the 
year as part of the consolidation of the legacy network and co-location 
of colleagues. This brings the total number of branch locations exited 
since closing the deal to 108. With 11 new sites, there has been a net 
reduction in the branch network of 97 branches.

Strong progress was also made in effectively positioning HR and IT. 
These are key enablers of administrative and operational efficiencies  
to be gained from the overall integration plan, as well as critical levers 
for improving the colleague and customer experience.

Annual Report 2023

Key HR initiatives realised in the year include:
• Migration onto the Workday HR Information System (HRIS): 10,500 
colleagues from the legacy Rentokil North America business have 
been transitioned from UKG to the Workday platform, completed in 
September 2023. This change to a single HR platform for reporting  
is crucial to aligning numerous business processes, including time 
tracking, payroll and performance management, and to enabling 
downstream initiatives, such as pay plan harmonisation and  
branch integrations. 

• Benefits harmonisation: Following an in-depth review, we adopted 
best practices from across the combined organisation to update 
company policies, procedures and offerings. All activities were 
completed allowing for a singular Open Enrollment experience for our 
colleagues in November. A harmonised benefit platform is critical to 
the reduction of administrative complexity and ultimately colleague 
engagement. It ensures consistent application of benefit access and 
cost to all colleagues, increases efficiencies, and provides a single 
platform of communication.

• Preparation for harmonisation of technician, sales and field 
management pay plans: Both legacy organisations have had 
numerous different compensation plans for front-line and field 
management roles. Harmonisation for approximately 11,000 front-line 
colleagues, 2,500 sales colleagues and 550 field management  
roles are set to provide market competitive base salary and 
performance-based commission directly aligned to our strategic 
objectives. New positions have been defined in each area based on 
skills, experience, certifications and licenses, with corresponding  
fixed base salary and incentive levels. Pay plan design, which entailed 
impact analysis to mitigate colleague retention, has been largely 
completed. Implementation will take place in 2024 in a staged 
approach across regional markets.

There has been substantial work on IT systems and products. Google 
Apps have now been rolled out to 13,000 colleagues and there have 
been 71 foundation IT system enhancements. There have been 
important advances to the Group’s digitally enabled products and 
processes, drawing on Best of Breed from across the organisation and 
with direct input from colleagues in the back office and field services. 
Key initiatives realised in the year include:

• Customer Content Management (CCM) and self-service portal. 
These two transformational tools are now live in North America, 
delivering business benefits and improving the customer experience. 
The new residential portal, deployed already to 18 brands in the 
region, meets customer demand for a 24/7 personalised experience 
that includes bill payment, appointment scheduling and service 
recommendations. The portal also frees up valuable call agent time  
to handle more complex, high value interactions. Alongside this we 
have launched a refreshed CCM tool that better empowers our call 
agents with detailed customer tracking, a 360 view of the customer 
and guided workflows for consistency and best practice. The new 
CCM tool has delivered improvements in customer query resolution 
and new colleague training. 

• Enhanced field sales tools. Valuable new features have been 

integrated to our ‘Winning Formula’ residential sales app, which is  
also being made available for the first time to our Terminix colleagues. 
The app follows the sales process end to end, from site inspection 
through to proposal and first appointment scheduling. Additionally, 
we’ve integrated the ‘Trusted Advisor’ process within our ServiceTrak 
app, further supporting service technicians to generate sales leads 
and upsell opportunities. This reflects a strategic focus on closer 
alignment between sales and service teams, enabled by technology. 

• Big data platform. The development of a data command centre brings 
the benefits of fast time access to big data and insights from multiple 
sources. It will allow for Terminix data to be integrated and increasingly 
provide actionable analytics from across our entire branch network. 
We also see exciting AI opportunities with predictive capabilities. 

Phase Two
Following completion of Phase One of the integration programme  
in 2023, we have embarked on Phase Two – full preparedness for 
branch integrations. Phase Two is scheduled to be largely delivered  
in approximately the first six months of 2024, with a number of clearly 
defined legal, IT and operational goals, including:

• A legal entity merger, critical to enabling branch integrations and 

unified contracts

• Roll out of more than 100 IT system features leading up to the 

commencement of system migration

• Migration to a single Procurement platform

• Consolidation onto a unified Finance system, including consolidation 
to a single expenses and travel management system, followed by 
purchase card harmonisation

• Migration of Terminix National Accounts to Rentokil’s single customer 

management and billing platform

• Combination of all heritage customer care agents onto a single unified 

communications platform

• Completion and sign off on data migration and IT system architecture 

configuration

Throughout 2024 we will also continue to co-locate branches ahead of 
integration, with approximately an additional 75 properties to be exited 
during the year.

Phase Three
The next phase of our integration plan is focused on the migration of 
Terminix regions and branches. The first Terminix colleagues will begin 
to migrate onto standard systems, data and processes in mid 2024,  
with rerouting and technician pay plans introduced approximately  
three months later. 

We have seven pest control Regions in the US and each integration will 
be executed over approximately 10 months from planning to rerouting. 
The first six to seven months will be used to develop a specific plan for 
the branches being integrated, based upon our best practice playbook. 
We anticipate that this will become increasingly standardised as 
Terminix markets use similar technologies and systems. The planning 
stage includes three test data migrations. This leads up to integration 
where the branch systems and data are migrated. There then follows  
a three-month period of evaluation leading up to the final part of the 
branch integration with branding, rerouting and technician pay plan  
and contracts being standardised as appropriate. 

Phase Four
The fourth and final phase in 2026 onwards will see the final Terminix 
markets and branches complete their integrations.

This will mark the completion of the branch integration programme and 
the delivery of our new synergy target in 2026. Post integration, our 
ambition is to deliver Organic Revenue Growth in pest control services 
of 1.5x the market over the medium term.

Synergies and approximate phasing
There has been strong delivery on cost synergies in 2023 with $69m  
of pre-tax P&L net cost synergies achieved, ahead of the guided $60m. 
This takes the cumulative P&L benefit from net synergies to $82m since 
completion of the transaction.

M&A remains central to our strategy for growth. We will continue to seek 
attractive bolt-on deals, both in Pest Control and Hygiene & Wellbeing, 
to build density in growth and emerging markets (Cities of the Future). 
Our pipeline of prospects remains strong and our current guidance on 
spend on M&A for FY 24 is c.£250m.

Continued progress on delivery has validated our assumptions and 
given us heightened confidence in the overall opportunity, allowing us 
to increase our estimate of synergies achievable from the acquisition. 
We now expect to achieve approximately $325m of annual pre-tax 
gross cost synergies ($225m net cost synergies) by the end of 2026.

Central and regional overheads
Central and regional overheads of £121m (at CER and AER) were up 
£14m on the prior year (FY 22: £107m at CER and AER) driven by 
Terminix related central investments including higher share based 
payment charges for the larger combined organisation.

Restructuring costs
The Company reports restructuring costs within Adjusted Operating 
Profit. Costs associated with significant acquisitions are reported as 
one-off items and are excluded from Adjusted Operating Profit. 
Restructuring costs of £9m at CER (£7m at AER) were down £3m on the 
prior year (FY 22: £12m at CER and AER). They consisted mainly of costs 
in respect of initiatives focused on our North American and Argentinian 
transformation programmes.

Interest (at AER) 
Adjusted interest of £141m at actual exchange rates was higher year on 
year, partly reflecting £86m of annualised interest charges relating to 
financing of the Terminix transaction, £15m of lease interest charges and 
a £7m offsetting reduction from the impacts of hyperinflation and net 
interest received. In the year, hyperinflation of £11m at AER in 2023 was 
£11m lower than the prior year (FY 22: £22m) due to devaluation of the 
Argentinian peso. Cash interest in FY 23 was £166m (FY 22: £39m) 
reflecting both higher interest on debt raised for the Terminix acquisition 
and the phasing of coupon payments annually in arrears. 

The Adjusted interest summary table on page 62 demonstrates how  
the components of our financing drive interest costs and incomes  
and the expected range for 2024 at average exchange rates.  
Changes in variable interest rates, exchange rates and CPI rates in 
hyper-inflationary economies during 2024 will impact the reporting  
of interest costs for 2024.

Tax 
The income tax charge for the period at actual exchange rates was 
£112m on the reported profit before tax of £493m, giving an effective tax 
rate (ETR) of 22.7% (FY 22: 21.6%). The Group’s ETR before amortisation 
of intangible assets (excluding computer software), one-off and 
adjusting items and the net interest adjustments for FY 23 was 23.8% 
(FY 22: 19.7%). This compares with a blended rate of tax for the countries 
in which the Group operates of 25.1% (FY 22: 23.7%).

Investments relate to salary and benefits harmonisation, SHE, 
innovation centre, IT and branding, as well as additional SOX, audit 
and listing costs. They are expected to be incurred 100% in cash. 

Total one-time cash cost to achieve synergies are expected to be 
c.$250m. Phasing of $131m in 2022-2023, $85m in 2024, $28m in 
2025 and c.$5m in 2026. In addition to the $131m of cash synergies 
in 2022-2023, we also incurred non-cash costs to achieve of c.$42m 
relating to the impairment of the Terminix head office and share-based 
integration incentive costs.

Paragon Distribution Business
As part of the Terminix merger, Rentokil acquired a small product 
distribution business, Paragon, with revenue of c.$68m and profit of 
c.$4m in 2023. This business is largely dependent upon a single, 
partially exclusive supplier relationship, which will be discontinued  
with effect from 1 April 2024. As a consequence, the decision has been 
taken to close this business. North America regional Revenue and 
Adjusted Operating Profit in 2024 will be reduced by approximately 
$61m and $4m respectively. 

Continued strength of bolt-on M&A
We acquired 41 new businesses, comprising 34 in Pest Control and 
seven in Hygiene & Wellbeing. A total consideration of c.£261m was 
agreed for these acquired businesses with total annualised revenues 
of c.£106m in the year prior to purchase. We have added 13 new 
businesses in North America during the period with c.£46m revenues 
acquired. This included the acquisition in the second half of the year of 
Action Pest Control, a Midwest provider ranking #62 on the Pest Control 
Technology Top 100 list. There was also a good performance in the 
Pacific region with eight deals (annualised revenues of c.£22m), Asia 
and MENAT with seven deals (annualised revenues of c.£8m), Europe 
(inc. LATAM) with 11 deals (annualised revenues of c.£12m) and two deals 
in the UK & SSA region (annualised revenues of c.£18m). In addition,  
the Group acquired a further 8% of the share capital of the Rentokil  
PCI business in India to take ownership to 65%. The Rentokil  
PCI business is already 100% consolidated in the Group accounts.

Net cash flows from operating activities have risen by 22.8% to  
£737m in 2023. Free Cash Flow of £500m was £126m higher than in  
FY 22. Higher trading profits resulted from organic and acquisitive 
growth. Adjusted EBITDA was £1,228m, up 43.0% versus 2022.  
One-off and adjusting items (non-cash) of £11m inflow (FY 22: £77m) 
represent Terminix related one-time share incentive schemes and  
asset impairments.

The Group had a £47m working capital outflow in FY 23. Working  
capital was driven higher by revenue growth, predominantly in North 
America and Europe, across receivables and contract cost assets. 
Capital expenditure of £211m was incurred in the period (FY 22: £190m), 
reflecting a more normal pattern of spend post pandemic and the 
inclusion of Terminix capital expenditure. Lease payments were  
up 45.2%.

Cash interest payments of £166m were £127m higher than in the prior 
year, reflecting the timing of interest charge payments relating to 
financing of the Terminix transaction. 

Cash tax payments for the period were £100m, an increase of £23m 
compared with the corresponding period last year. Adjusted Free  
Cash Flow Conversion was 89.4%.

Cash spend on current and prior year acquisitions was £242m, dividend 
payments were £201m and the cash impact of one-off and adjusting 
items was £107m (largely related to the Terminix acquisition). Foreign 
exchange translation and other items of £169m is primarily due to the 
weakening of the US Dollar against Sterling. Overall, this led to a change 
in net debt of £133m and closing net debt of £3,146m.

Going concern 
The Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing  
the accounts on the basis that the Group’s strong liquidity position  
and its demonstrated ability to manage the level of capital expenditure, 
dividends or expenditure on bolt-on acquisitions are sufficient to  
meet the Group’s forecast funding needs, including those modelled  
in a severe but plausible downside case. Details of the scenarios 
modelled are explained in the Material Accounting Policies section  
of the Annual Report.

The Board is recommending a final dividend in respect of 2023 of  
5.93p per share, payable to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 5 April 2024, to be paid on 15 May 2024. This equates to 
a full-year dividend of 8.68p per share, an increase of 15.0% compared 
to 2022. The last day for DRIP elections is 23 April 2024.

Funding
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had liquidity headroom in the  
region of £1,600m, including £785m ($1.0bn) of undrawn revolving  
credit facility (RCF), with a maturity date of October 2028. The net debt  
to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6x at 31 December 2023 (31 December 
2022: 3.8x). The net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.8x at 31 December 2023 
(31 December 2022: 4.6x). In July 2023, S&P Global reaffirmed the 
Group’s BBB investment grade credit rating; and in October 2023 the 
Group got a second rating (BBB with a stable outlook) from Fitch Ratings. 
The interest rate on approximately 81% of the Group’s debt including 
leases is fixed. The Group has no debt maturities until November 2024. 

Dividend
The Group adopts a progressive dividend policy with dividend 
payments related to the level of Free Cash Flow available. The Group 
aims to pay dividends twice a year and the level of each dividend is 
decided by the Board. When determining the level of dividend each 
year, the Board considers the following:

• cash generation in the year;

• future cash generation;

• cash availability at the point of dividend;

• profits available for distribution;

• cash required to invest in capital; and

• expenditure and acquisitions.

Reconciliation of non-IFRS measures to the nearest IFRS measure
The Group uses a number of non-IFRS measures to present the financial performance of the business. These are not measures as defined under 
IFRS, but management believe that these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the Financial Statements, in order to 
better understand the underlying trading performance in the year from activities that will contribute to future performance. The Group’s internal 
strategic planning process is also based on these measures and they are used for management incentive purposes. They should be viewed as 
complements to, and not replacements for, the comparable IFRS measures. Other companies may use similarly labelled measures which are 
calculated differently to the way the Group calculates them, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. Accordingly, investors should 
not place undue reliance on these non-IFRS measures.

The following sets out an explanation and the reconciliation to the nearest IFRS measure for each non-IFRS measure.

Constant exchange rates (CER)
Given the international nature of the Group’s operations, foreign exchange movements can have a significant impact on the reported results 
of the Group when they are translated into sterling (the presentation currency of the Group). In order to help understand the underlying trading 
performance of the business, revenue and profit measures are often presented at constant exchange rates. CER is calculated by translating 
current-year reported numbers at the full-year average exchange rates for the prior year. It is used to give management and other users of 
the accounts clearer comparability of underlying trading performance against the prior period by removing the effects of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The major exchange rates used for 2023 are £/$ 1.2441 (2022: 1.2421) and £/€ 1.1503 (2022: 1.1717). Comparisons are with the  
year ended 31 December 2022 unless otherwise stated.

Organic Revenue Growth
Acquisitions are a core part of the Group’s growth strategy. The Organic Revenue Growth measures (absolute and percentage) are used to  
help investors and management understand the underlying performance, positive or negative, of the business, by identifying Organic Revenue 
Growth excluding the impact of Acquired Revenue. This approach isolates changes in performance of the Group that take place under the 
Company’s stewardship, whether favourable or unfavourable, and thereby reflects the potential benefits and risks associated with owning  
and managing a professional services business.

Organic Revenue Growth is calculated based on year-over-year revenue growth at CER to eliminate the effects of movements in foreign 
exchange rates.

Acquired Revenue represents a 12-month estimate of the increase in Group revenue from each business acquired. Acquired Revenue is 
calculated as: a) the revenue from the acquisition date to the year end in the year of acquisition in line with IFRS 3; and b) the pre-acquisition 
revenues from 1 January up to the acquisition date in the year of acquisition. The pre-acquisition revenue is based on the previously reported 
revenues of the acquired entity and is considered to be an estimate.

In the year a business is acquired, all of its revenue reported under a) above is classified as non-organic growth. In the subsequent first full 
financial year after acquisition, Organic Revenue Growth is calculated for each acquisition as the reported revenue less Acquired Revenue. 

At a Group level, calculating Organic Revenue Growth therefore involves isolating and excluding from the total year-over-year revenue change:  
i) the impacts from foreign exchange rate changes, ii) the growth in revenues that have resulted from completed acquisitions in the current period, 
and iii) the estimate of pre-acquisition revenues from each business acquired. The sum of ii) and iii) is equal to the total Acquired Revenues for all 
acquisitions. The calculated Organic Revenue is expressed as a percentage of prior year revenue. Prior year revenue is not ‘pro-forma’ adjusted 
in the calculation, as any such estimated adjustments would have an immaterial impact.

If an acquisition is considered to be a material transaction, such as the Terminix acquisition in October 2022, the above calculation is amended  
in order to give a ‘pro-forma’ view of any Organic Revenue Growth for the full financial year in the year of acquisition, as if the acquisition had 
been part of the Group from the beginning of the prior year. The pro-forma calculation is completed using pre-acquisition revenues to normalise 
current and prior periods as shown in the table below. These revenue normalisations are considered estimates, and ensure that the potentially 
larger Organic Revenue Growth is measured over a denominator that includes the material acquisition. The same adjustments are made to our 
North America and Pest Control segment revenues for 2022 and 2023 as a result of the material Terminix acquisition.

While management believes that the methodology used in the calculation of Organic Revenue is representative of the performance of the Group, 
the calculations may not be comparable to similarly labelled measures presented by other publicly traded companies in similar or other industries.

Adjusted expenses and profit measures
Adjusted expenses and profit measures are used to give investors and management a further understanding of the underlying profitability 
of the business over time by stripping out income and expenses that can distort results due to their size and nature. Adjusted profit measures 
are calculated by adding the following items back to the equivalent IFRS profit measure:

• amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software);
• one-off and adjusting items; and
• net interest adjustments.

Intangible assets (such as customer lists and brands) are recognised on acquisition of businesses which, by their nature, can vary by size and 
amount each year. Capitalisation of innovation-related development costs will also vary from year to year. As a result, amortisation of intangibles 
is added back to assist with understanding the underlying trading performance of the business and to allow comparability across regions and 
categories (see table on page 181).

One-off and adjusting items are significant expenses or income that will have a distortive impact on the underlying profitability of the Group. 
Typical examples are costs related to the acquisition of businesses, gain or loss on disposal or closure of a business, material gains or losses 
on disposal of fixed assets, adjustments to legacy environmental liabilities, and payments or receipts as a result of legal disputes. An analysis 
of one-off and adjusting items is set out below.

Net interest adjustments are other non-cash or one-off accounting gains and losses that can cause material fluctuations and distort 
understanding of the performance of the business, such as amortisation of discount on legacy provisions and gains and losses on hedge 
accounting.

Adjusted expenses are one-off and adjusting items, and Adjusted Interest. Adjusted profit measures used are Adjusted Operating Profit, 
Adjusted Profit Before and After Tax, and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Earnings Per Share is also reported, derived from Adjusted Profit After Tax.

Adjusted cash measures
The Group aims to generate sustainable cash flow in order to support its acquisition programme and to fund dividend payments to shareholders. 
Management considers that this is useful information for investors. Adjusted cash measures in use are Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, 
and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion.

Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow is measured as net cash flows from operating activities, adjusted for cash flows related to the purchase and sale of property, 
plant, equipment and intangible assets, cash flows related to leased assets, cash flows related to one-off and adjusting items and dividends 
received from associates. These items are considered by management to be non-discretionary, as continued investment in these assets is 
required to support the day-to-day operations of the business. Free Cash Flow is used by management for incentive purposes and is a measure 
shared with and used by investors.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion
Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion is provided to demonstrate to investors the proportion of Adjusted Profit After Tax that is converted to cash. 
It is calculated by dividing Adjusted Free Cash Flow by Adjusted Profit After Tax, expressed as a percentage. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is measured 
as Free Cash Flow adjusted for product development additions and net investment hedge cash interest through Other Comprehensive Income. 
Product development additions are adjusted due to their variable size and non-underlying nature. Net investment hedge cash interest through 
Other Comprehensive Income is adjusted because the cash relates to an item that is not recognised in Adjusted Profit After Tax.

amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software), one-off and adjusting items, and the net interest adjustments for 2023 was 
23.8% (2022: 19.7%). This compares with a blended rate of tax for the countries in which the Group operates of 25.1% (2022: 23.7%). The Group’s 
low tax rate in 2023 is primarily attributable to net prior-year tax credits of £12m (2022: £9m). 

The Group’s tax charge and Adjusted ETR will be influenced by the global mix and level of profits, changes in future tax rates and other tax 
legislation, foreign exchange rates, the utilisation of brought-forward tax losses on which no deferred tax asset has been recognised, the 
resolution of open issues with various tax authorities, acquisitions and disposals.

Responsible Business

At Rentokil Initial, being a responsible business means working with our 
colleagues to create a safe workplace; protecting the environment through 
our innovations and more efficient ways of operating; supporting customers 
with high levels of service; protecting the resilience of our operations; actively 
contributing to our communities; and managing our governance to provide 
our stakeholders with confidence and transparency. These responsible 
business priorities are aligned with those of our key stakeholders  
(see page 83) and are driven by our mission and business strategy.

2023 has seen several developments in 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
reporting requirements.

For three years we have reported against the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB) standard for our sector of Commercial 
Services, and this will now be incorporated 
into our Social sustainability statement along 
with updates on our colleagues, customers, 
suppliers and communities, and links to other 
relevant information. More information can be 
found on pages 69 to 71.

The Financial Conduct Authority’s new Listing 
Rules requirements on diversity-related 
reporting came into effect during the year. 
Further details on our targets related to the 
representation of women and ethnic minorities 
on the Board can be found on page 128. 

Within our Environment sustainability 
statement, we provide a review of our good 
progress against our environment plan in 
2023 (see pages 72 to 74) and include our 
third report against the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
standard, which can be found on pages 75 
to 81.

We are also taking our first steps towards the 
International Sustainability Standards Board 
(ISSB) disclosure standards (IFRS S1 General 
Requirements and IFRS S2 Climate-related 
Disclosures), having completed a high-level 
assessment against the standards. This shows 
that we are already disclosing against many 
of the requirements. 

In addition, in our Governance sustainability 
statement we outline the process that we have 
undertaken to prepare the Company to meet 
the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD). In the coming years, we will 
continue to enhance our climate and social 
sustainability disclosures to ensure alignment 
with new reporting requirements.

Annual Report 2023

From our most recent Fast Track Global  
Talent Pool which started in 2023, 10 (45%) of 
participants are female, the highest number 
we have had in the Fast Track cohort. 

In line with The Parker Review we have set a 
target to improve our ethnic diversity and 
reach 20% of our senior leadership team by 
the end of 2027 (2023: 15.5%). This is based  
on those colleagues who have provided data, 
and excludes those based in countries where 
we cannot ask or hold ethnicity information. 

Training and development
We support colleagues with a wide range  
of training and development opportunities, 
including technical training and online 
development through U+. Colleagues 
undertook 1.96m courses on U+ in 2023 and 
over 150 new training courses were developed 
by our in-house content development team.

In 2023, we continued to provide  
employment opportunities for young people 
with 247 apprentices; we accounted for c.5% 
of the customer service apprenticeships in 
England. We have been placed within the  
top 30 apprenticeship employers in England, 
being recognised for our commitment to 
creating new apprenticeships, the diversity  
of our apprentices and the number of 
apprentices who successfully achieve  
their apprenticeships. 

More information can be found in the 
Responsible Business Report, which is 
available on our website.

Our colleagues
Rentokil Initial defines a responsible 
workplace as one focused on safety, 
underpinned by a values-driven culture,  
and supports our colleagues to develop  
a long-term career with the Company. 

We are committed to being a world-class 
Employer of Choice and employ 62,900 
colleagues (2022: 58,600) in 90 countries. 

Colleague safety
Above all else, our colleagues’ safety comes 
first. This is one of our primary ESG risks and is 
managed by a dedicated team with consistent 
global policies and performance measures 
across the Company. 

This year, we have delivered another high 
level of colleague safety, improving our Lost 
Time Accident rate to 0.31 (against our target 
of 0.38) and Working Days Lost to 7.05 
(against our target of 7.86). See the table 
below for long-term safety performance. 

This performance was driven by our ongoing 
focus on safety, robust management 
standards, and commitment to best practices. 

There were no work-related colleague 
fatalities in 2023.

Diversity
We strive to ensure that our local businesses 
reflect the communities in which we operate 
and to create an environment where 
everyone’s contribution matters, and everyone 
has equal opportunities to succeed. 

Our workplace strategy places great emphasis 
on diversity, where everyone regardless of 
gender identity, race, colour, nationality,  
age, sexual orientation, physical ability or 
background, can reach the highest levels 
based on merit. In 2023:
• 14,640 (23.3%) of colleagues were female 

and 48,291 (76.7%) male;

• 35 (25%) of our senior leaders were female 

and 105 (75%) male;

• 52 (25%) of our senior leaders (inc. subsidiary 
directors) were female and 157 (75%) male; 
and

• three (33.3%) of our Board directors were 

female and six (66.6%) male.

Colleague engagement 
This year, we undertook Your Voice Counts 
(YVC), a global, confidential survey, which 
provides every colleague with the chance  
to give feedback on workplace culture, 
leadership, customer focus, development, 
and line manager performance. The survey 
is undertaken every two years.

We maintained our strong levels of 
engagement (79%, in line with the Global 
Company Norm) and enablement (83%, 
which was 5ppts ahead of the Global 
Company Norm). We received excellent 
feedback on the questions relating to 
Safety, Health, and Environment (SHE), 
‘My Manager’, and Diversity, Equality,  
and Inclusion. 

The survey results also demonstrated that 
colleagues support the Company’s 
approach and focus on safety – a key ESG 
risk – which continues to be our highest 
performing category. 

Areas which fall below the Global Company 
Norm include satisfaction with benefits and 
manager support for development. 
Absolute scores for Engagement were 
generally lower than for Enablement.

Our suppliers
The supply of products to our global 
businesses is managed through the Group 
Procurement team. 

We purchase a wide variety of hardware and 
equipment such as rodent traps, insect light 
traps, and bird protection devices which  
are typically designed internally and either 
manufactured in-house or sourced externally 
from specialist suppliers. 

In our sourcing decisions, compliance with 
Rentokil Initial standards for a responsible  
and sustainable business approach is used  
as a go/no-go gate rather than as a weighting 
factor for decision-making. Suppliers that do 
not conform to required standards during  
the pre-selection evaluation are eliminated 
from the tender process. If an area of 
non-compliance is discovered at a new  
or existing supplier, they are given the 
opportunity to address and resolve the issue, 
with our support where required. 

For further details, please see Governance on 
page 82 and our Modern Slavery Statement 
which is available on rentokil-initial.com 

Colleague retention
In 2023, colleague retention increased 
globally by 4.7% to 84.2%. All regions 
improved year on year. 

In 2023, our North America region increased 
colleague retention by 5.0ppts. This has been 
achieved through a wide-ranging programme 
including:
• launch of a consistent retention dashboard 

and manager training;

• empowering leaders to meet with colleagues 

to identify potential issues before they 
escalate and exploring potential solutions 
that may encourage a colleague to stay;

• mentoring resources; and

• consistent and enhanced new hire and 

onboarding experiences with a clear plan  
for the first three days, welcome kits and 
communications, plus one-month and 
six-month onboarding surveys.

Please see our Group KPIs on page 22.

Recruitment
Our Career+ app has also seen continued 
success across Rentokil Initial and has been 
successfully launched in Terminix. The app 
provides colleagues with a tool to share job 
vacancies externally on social media and to 
view roles across the organisation, allowing 
them to seek out potential opportunities  
for progression or roles more suitable for  
their needs. 

In 2023, Career+ received more than 22,000 
job applications – 16,480 external and 5,719 
from existing colleagues – with no advertising 
or recruitment fees. In addition, the Company 
has launched a new global career portal.

Annual Report 2023

In 2023, we began to undertake a series of 
customer trials in the use of micro digital 
camera technology and Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) to remotely monitor, identify, and alert 
technicians and customers to rodent activity. 
Cameras were installed in customers’ 
premises in areas such as roofing voids and 
behind ceiling panels which may be difficult  
to reach.

Digital technologies
Digital technologies are increasingly  
deployed across the Company to enhance  
the experience of colleagues and customers, 
and to add efficiency and insight. 

In 2023, we began to investigate the use of AI 
to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of 
our operations. Activities included:
• a private AI cloud setup was completed;

• we saw encouraging outcomes from initial 

Proof of Concepts;

• an AI Blueprint definition is under 

development; and

• we have identified four initial-use cases 
focused on Organic growth: Sales lead 
conversion, contract renewals and pricing 
execution, sales lead qualification, and 
customer retention.

Digital security
Like all organisations, we continue to identify, 
monitor, and mitigate the risk of cyber attacks. 
We have a dedicated IT security team who are 
supported by external specialists. 

We continue to invest in IT security, ensuring 
that the security posture of our systems and 
services are maintained at an appropriate level 
and this is monitored and regularly improved. 
Our approach to data protection is aligned 
with the key requirements of established 
global data protection and privacy laws.

Further information is available on page 116  
in our Corporate Governance report.

Our communities
Our approach to charitable and community 
engagement is in line with our core social 
purpose of Protecting People, Enhancing Lives 
and Preserving our Planet. We also aim to 
make a meaningful contribution to the local 
economy and to support the communities 
where we operate.

Rentokil Initial Cares is our global charity and 
community programme which supports 
colleagues’ local efforts, alongside national 
and global initiatives. It supports charities and 
good causes which have significant impacts  
in many parts of the world, such as protecting 
families from the threat of malaria in Africa  
and reducing deforestation in the Pacific  
and Africa. 

In 2023, we donated £569,000 to charities 
and good causes. This excludes gifts in kind 
and product donations. 

To mark the first anniversary of Rentokil 
Terminix, we held a Spirit Day. The event was 
about giving back to the communities in which 
colleagues live and work with a month-long 
food drive. We committed donations of 
$70,000 to Feeding America and $30,000 to 
Second Harvest in Canada. Colleagues also 
donated cans and other non-perishable foods 
to local charities.

During the year we donated £25,000 to the 
UNICEF Syria-Türkiye Emergency Appeal.

See our Responsible Business Report 2023 
for further details.

Social value
Better Futures is one of Rentokil Initial’s  
key long-term community initiatives. 
Predominantly focused on India, the 
programme delivers basic health education  
to local community members, schools,  
and charities. 

More than 39,500 children and adults have 
participated in educational events over the 
past 10 years through Better Futures. 

Our customers
A responsible partner
Rentokil Initial’s services protect people from 
the health dangers of pests, enhance lives 
with greater standards of hygiene and better 
workplace environments, and protect our 
planet through ever more sustainable services 
for customers. 

Providing outstanding customer service is  
a key component of our business model.  
We set out to engage our customers to fully 
understand their needs and provide innovative 
services to meet their requirements. 
Customers range from multinationals to  
local businesses and people at home. 

In 2023, our State of Service (Group KPI) 
reached 97.8% (2022: 95.9%), ahead of our 
95% global target.

Innovation
Innovation is an integral part of our business, 
which not only provides our customers with 
more efficient and best-in-class products and 
services, but also ensures our operations are 
conducted more efficiently and sustainably. 

Our innovation pipeline is focused on 
developing non-toxic solutions, more 
sustainable products, and digital services. 

Our innovation projects are mainly generated 
in-house, through our science and innovation 
teams, or as a result of insights gained from 
our businesses and customers around  
the world. 

Other projects are initiated as a collaboration 
with external partners, who bring their  
own specialised expertise to a project.  
Our partners engage with our scientific and 
technical teams to turn ideas into new and 
exciting solutions to meet customer needs 
now and in the future.

In 2024, we will open our first dedicated pest 
control innovation centre in the US.

To read more about sustainable innovation, 
see our Environment Sustainability Statement 
on page 72. 

Digital services
Rentokil Initial uses digital technologies to set 
new standards in the protection of people 
from the risks of pest-borne disease. This is  
a contracted service for customers such as 
food producers and retailers.

PestConnect
PestConnect offers 24/7 monitoring and 
therefore more effective control of rodents. 

By the end of 2023, we had c.356,000 
PestConnect units operating in customer 
premises, an increase of c.23% year on year.

Fumigation
Our goal is a 70% reduction in emissions from 
fumigations by 2030. This will be tackled 
through our Replace-Reduce-Recapture (3R) 
initiatives: Replace, to use non-chemical 
methods such as heat treatment wherever 
possible; Reduce, minimising the space 
required to be treated; and Recapture, using 
experimental setups and filtration trials. 

In 2023, we continued to explore alternatives 
for the use of sulfuryl fluoride (SF) as a 
fumigant, while ensuring quality of service  
is maintained, and made good progress in  
the use of methods to reduce the level of 
fumigation gas used on customer sites. 

We have agreed regional reduction paths 
across the Group and are continuing to test 
alternative chemicals and prepare country 
registration requirements, although approval 
may take several years.

The emissions equivalent from fumigation 
decreased year on year by 16% in 2023 
reflecting our 3R activities and fluctuations  
in customer demand.

See page 81 (Environment data) for details  
of the emissions equivalent from fumigation 
services over time.

2. Consumables
We are continuing to reduce our 
environmental impact from paper, soaps,  
and plastics. 

Our goal is for all hygiene paper products to 
hold recognised environmental accreditations 
(FSC for virgin fibre, EU Flower or equivalent 
for recycled) by 2025. Having set a target of 
over 90% by the end of 2022, we were 
pleased to confirm that we reached c.96% last 
year and we are now working with suppliers to 
further improve this. 

We are also focused on working with suppliers 
to reach 90% of the palm oil used in our 
products or services to be sourced from 
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) 
approved supply chains. We are pleased to 
confirm that this target was reached in 2023. 

Our environment plan features eight 
workstreams, which made good progress  
in 2023. 

Chemicals

Consumables

Hardware

Sustainable 
solutions

1. Chemicals
Our aim is to minimise the use of chemicals  
in pest control through Integrated Pest 
Management (IPM) processes, digital 
connected solutions and non-toxic devices. 
We use a range of non-toxic and sustainable 
solutions, such as the use of heat treatments, 
where possible. We only use products that are 
on our authorised product list.

Before a technician undertakes pest control 
activities, a site risk assessment is undertaken 
to evaluate the correct response to deal with 
the infestation. Alternative integrated pest 
management strategies, such as proofing  
and improved housekeeping are advised 
where appropriate. Around 10 million site  
risk assessments were undertaken in 2023.

Operations are undertaken in line with local 
regulations and the use of rodenticide in line 
with the practices identified by the Campaign 
for the Responsible Rodenticide Use. 

Development of non-toxic solutions
In pest control, before any treatment is 
considered, we consider barriers, such as 
proofing and exclusion materials under doors 
or in gaps next to pipes, that might solve the 
pest problem. 

In 2023 we continued to roll out Flexi Armour, 
a range of rodent-proofing barrier products. 
This innovation enables our technicians to  
seal gaps with resilient resin, allowing the 
expansion joints to continue to flex while 
stopping rodents from gaining access. 

Use of heat treatments is a chemical-free 
method of pest control that, through the 
targeted application of heat, is effective 
against most types of pest insects, such as 
bedbugs and cockroaches. It eliminates the 
different life stages of insects (egg, larva and 
adult) in just one treatment.

This Environment Sustainability Statement 
provides an update on our journey towards 
more environmentally friendly operations and 
services, and progress towards our target to 
reach net zero carbon emissions from our 
operations by the end of 2040. Activities are 
undertaken with consistent global policies, 
measures, and management approaches, 
executed locally by our country teams. 

The journey to net zero emissions is not only 
the right thing to do for society, but it is also 
the right thing for our business. Our 
stakeholders, particularly our colleagues, 
support our environmental ambitions. 

We have met our previous targets for 10% 
(2011–15) and further 20% (2016–19) carbon 
efficiency improvements.

In 2020, the Board set a new target to reduce 
the emissions intensity index (kilogrammes of 
CO2 per £m revenue on a constant exchange 
rate basis) by 20% by the end of 2025 (using 
2019 data as the baseline). As of the end of 
2023, this efficiency index had achieved a 16% 
reduction. This includes Terminix emissions 
and revenue.

Flying insect control
Our innovative Lumnia LED fly control range 
continues to offer a more effective and 
energy-efficient alternative to traditional 
fluorescent tubes systems:
• energy savings of up to 79%;

• lamps last 33% longer than other LED units 

on the market;

• 80% greater reach than traditional 

fluorescent tubes; and

• zero toxic chemicals – no mercury.

Around 445,000 Lumnia units have been sold 
since launch in 2017, delivering energy usage 
and carbon emissions reductions for our 
customers. This year, Lumnia was registered 
for use in North America, allowing us to 
continue our strategy of offering sustainable 
pest control solutions. 

In 2024 we will introduce BirdAlert 2.0,  
a sustainable solution which uses the audible 
calls of different species to scare away 
nuisance birds; and EcoCatch, a new fly 
control solution, the most sustainably  
focused solution created for exterior fly  
control in the market.

4. Waste
We aim to drive the responsible sourcing of 
products and services, and the disposal of 
waste, to ensure that we operate at the 
highest standard that local infrastructure 
allows in each country. 

We are committed to reducing the 
environmental impact from waste, including 
the waste we collect from customers through 
our washroom operations, which is a 
significant proportion of the waste we manage 
in those countries with washroom services.

In some instances, the waste we dispose of is 
required by law to be incinerated for health 
and safety reasons as it is medical or feminine 
hygiene waste. However, where it is possible 
and within our control, we have implemented 
strategies for increasing the sustainability of 
our waste disposal. 

During 2023 we:
• used 30% recycled plastic in all medical 

waste bags meaning that we are certified  
by RecyClass;

• continued to explore new, more sustainable 
ways of disposing of hygiene and medical 
waste within the legislative restrictions.  
In India we have begun to work with a 
supplier who uses low temperature 
incineration allowing us to reduce the energy 
usage of our waste disposal process;

• disposed of 78% of waste from our European 
operations via sustainable means, in line with 
the European Waste Codes;

• implemented a paper, plastic and e-waste 

programme in MENAT;

• battery recycling in Europe reached 75%; and

• continued to refurbish washroom dispensers 
in France and Italy, with the addition of insect 
light trap refurbishment in Italy.

Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023 73

Reduction in use of plastic bags
Strict standard operating procedures for the 
On-Site Servicing (OSS) of our sanitary waste 
units mitigate the spread of germs and 
bacteria, in a hygienic and professional way. 

OSS also has environmental benefits versus  
a depot-washing of the bins, including: water 
and electricity savings, and reduced transport 
CO₂ emissions (in Australia, The Carbon Trust 
calculated a 24% saving).

3. Hardware
Rentokil Initial offers a range of services and 
products that support our customers to 
achieve their own sustainability objectives.

Rodent control
All of our rodent bait stations are now 
produced from recycled polymer, including 
Eradico, our new global bait station that can  
be used with different types of solutions, 
including our connected products. 

In 2024 we will launch RADAR X, a proprietary 
new solution to protect businesses from mice:
• more sustainable with longer battery life,  

less packaging and modular build with field 
replaceable components to reduce waste; 
and

• more robust as the central part of the unit 
withstands pressure of up to two metric 
tonnes, dust and water resilience to IP65  
for a longer service life.

5. Mobility 
Our aim is to minimise vehicle emissions 
through: 
• choosing the optimum size and type of 

vehicle which offers the most efficiency; 

• selection of ultra-low emission vehicles 
(ULEV) or manufacturer model with the 
lowest CO2e;

• the use of route-planning tools to reduce 

journey mileage; and

• the use of telematics for encouraging more 

efficient driving. 

We now have a range of more sustainable 
mobility options across our fleet including 
electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrid EVs, 
non-plug-in hybrids, e-motorbikes, hybrid 
motor bikes and e-trikes, and the use of public 
transport where it is feasible. 

Our strategy to reduce emissions from mobility 
and to transition our fleet to ULEVs by 2040  
is continuing to build momentum, with 683 
ULEVs (2022: 368) and 1,484 hybrid vehicles 
(2022: 1,250) at the end 2023. 

c.8% of our UK and Europe fleet are ULEVs as 
we make good progress towards our target to 
achieve 10% in 2025. 

We continue to be limited by a lack of electric 
charging infrastructure in some countries, as 
well as a limited choice of large, ultra-low 
emission vans. 

Following the appointment of a new fleet 
provider in the USA, in 2023 we continued  
to select the lowest CO2e vehicle option 
available based on providing the right-sized 
vehicle and optimum mileage requirements  
to provide our services.

6. Supply chain
The Company’s supply strategy is focused  
on sustainability, and in ensuring that our 
suppliers share our values and commitments 
to high ESG standards. 

We are continuing to work with transport and 
logistics suppliers to reduce the environmental 
footprint of our supply chain. See page 81 for 
Scope 3 emissions. 

Properties

Culture 

Sustainable

7. Properties
To reduce our emissions from purchased 
electricity, our strategy is to introduce green 
energy or renewable tariffs for our owned 
buildings, focusing on our top 20 countries. 

Renewable energy contracts in the UK, Italy, 
the Pacific region, and for the first time, in 
India, have reduced our carbon footprint by 
1,915 tonnes in 2023. 

We also focus on energy efficiency in our 
properties. This includes the installation of 
LED lighting in branches and warehouses,  
and new systems for lights, heating, and air 
conditioning, with motion sensors to switch off 
automatically after a certain period of time. 

In 2023, our Workwear plants in France  
saw an increase in their water efficiency – 
improving by 6% (9.9 litres/kg in 2023, down 
from 10.5 in 2022).

8. Culture
We recognise that our ambitious net zero 
target can only be achieved if our colleagues 
are engaged and fully involved. 

Questions around our environmental activities 
are included in our Your Voice Counts (YVC) 
all-colleague confidential survey, giving us  
a better understanding of the views of our 
colleagues on our commitments and efforts 
towards our climate targets. 

In our 2023 YVC survey, 83% agreed that  
the Company is making the right decisions  
to ensure we operate as an environmentally 
friendly business (4% unfavourable), and 84% 
agreed that the Company delivers products 
and services responsibly and sustainably (3% 
unfavourable).

See page 81 for our 2023 emissions and 
energy data.

Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures report
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations set an 
important framework for understanding and 
analysing climate-related risks, and Rentokil 
Initial is committed to regular, transparent 
reporting to help communicate and track  
our progress.

The information set out on pages 75 to 81 aims 
to provide key climate-related information  
and cross-references to where additional 
information can be found. 

In accordance with the UK’s Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Listing Rule 9.8.6 (8) we confirm 
that we have complied with the TCFD 
recommendations and 11 disclosures, and we 
have responded to these in this report on 
pages 75 to 81, and as more broadly reflected 
in the TCFD Index below. These disclosures 
are also made in accordance with sections 
414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006.

In 2023, we have undertaken significant work 
to prepare for forthcoming sustainability 
regulations. Our activities to prepare for the 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD) can be found on page 82. 

Our focus is to implement, embed and track 
progress at an operational level in each 
country against our plan to achieve net zero  
by the end of 2040. Details of our activities  
in 2023 can be found on pages 72 to 74.

During the year, we acquired 41 businesses. 
This has increased our absolute carbon 
footprint but does not change our 2040 
net zero target. We recognise that with  
a large global operational footprint this 
is a stretching target, but we believe it is 
the right thing to do.

Climate-related governance
The Board and Executive Leadership team work together to oversee, assess, and manage climate-related risks and opportunities. Our Governance 
Framework is detailed on page 105; below we outline the environment and climate-related governance approach.

The Board
The Board has responsibility for oversight of the long-term climate change strategy of the Group, including considering climate-related issues, 
investments, opportunities and risks. Safety, health and environment remains a core component on every Board agenda. In addition, the Board 
holds separate sessions to challenge and analyse different aspects of our plan and actions being taken, including our progress towards net zero 
through the transition to ultra-low emission vehicles and implementing new more sustainable services.

Chief Executive and the Executive Leadership Team (ELT)
Our Chief Executive has overall responsibility for environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters and our operationally-focused response to 
the risks and opportunities of climate change. Responsibility for the delivery of our climate change plans is integrated into roles and responsibilities 
of senior managers, including: marketing & innovation, supply chain, procurement, and, in particular, our country and regional leadership teams.

Group Risk Committee 
Comprising the Chief Financial 
Officer and six other functional 
executives, it monitors the internal 
control environment and external 
emerging risks, and reviews 
internal policies and procedures 
for identifying, assessing, and 
reporting risks, meeting quarterly.

The Board’s oversight
In 2023, the Board held sustainability sessions 
in June and December. Discussions included: 
the Company’s longer-term sustainability 
approach, progress and priorities. Risks and 
opportunities were discussed such as new 
regulation, the move to more sustainable 
fumigation, fleet transition, and the 
development of more sustainable services.

Assessment and management of 
climate-related risks
Our regions have developed sustainability 
initiatives in line with our overall net zero 
target. The Chief Executive’s monthly 
performance reviews include progress  
against their sustainability plans.

The Group’s Executive Leadership Team (ELT) 
and Group Leadership Forum (GLF) meetings 
have Environment as the third item on the 
agenda (following Safety and People). 

Vehicle emissions intensity for our 20 largest 
operations are presented to the ELT and  
GLF (six meetings per year). This tracks the 
vehicle fuel efficiency performance for each 
country against the prior year, per thousand 
litres of fuel used, per million of revenue in 
local currency. 

Our major countries have an agreed carbon 
reduction pathway to net zero from our 
operations by 2040 and our activities are 
aligned to our Business Model, see pages 14 
and 15.

The Audit Committee considered climate 
change risks in 2023 (see page 120).

Our Corporate Compliance curriculum is 
mandatory training for all managers within  
60 days of hire, or promotion to Work Level 3. 
This includes Code of Conduct training, which

Executive reward is linked to our 
environmental, social and governance 
priorities through the performance share plan 
awards, which are measured against seven 
performance conditions including: Sales  
and Service colleague retention, customer 
satisfaction, and vehicle fuel intensity.

We have started the implementation of a new 
environment management tool in 2023 and 
worked to better understand the forthcoming 
regulatory requirements and ensure that our 
system is aligned to the latest taxonomy.  
Our plan is to make this operational ahead  
of the new reporting requirements.

Engagement with our key stakeholders, 
particularly colleagues, customers, suppliers, 
shareholders and analysts, about our 
environmental plan, progress and targets, 
continued throughout 2023 and we welcome 
opportunities to discuss and review.

Climate-related strategy 
and risk management
In 2020, we developed a business-wide 
operational strategy (see graphic below) for 
climate-related environmental sustainability 
and 2023 has seen us continue the execution 
of our ambitious plans as we transition to a 
more sustainable way of working. This is  
fully aligned with our business strategy and 
operating model (see pages 14 and 15), has 
clear deliverables, and is one of the ways  
in which we deliver with impact our social 
purpose of Protecting People, Enhancing  
Lives and Preserving our Planet.

We believe that our goal to be at net zero 
emissions from our operations by the end  
of 2040 is a bold and ambitious target, 
particularly given the Terminix integration  
in North America. 

Our strategy, which is being delivered through 
our country operations, is built on three pillars: 
Sustainable Solutions, Sustainable Operations 
and Sustainable Workplace, and includes 
measures to mitigate to the impacts of climate 
change (see below). 

For more information on our progress on  
this strategy in 2023 please read our ‘2023 
progress report’ on pages 72 to 74.

In developing this strategy and the associated 
targets, we have considered the potential 
climate-related risks and opportunities, and 
risk management, on pages 78 to 79. 

See pages 88 to 93 for more details on 
principal risks which outline the impact  
of climate-related risks: failure to grow  
our business profitably in a changing 
macroeconomic environment and failure  
to develop products and services that are 
tailored and relevant to local markets and 
market conditions (transitional risk); and  
failure to ensure business continuity in the 
case of a material incident (physical risk). 

See our Viability Statement on page 94 which 
addresses the impact of climate change on  
the business model, and page 120 for the 
consideration of climate change in the context 
of the financial statements. 

Scenario analysis
Our strategy is also built on an analysis of 
three emissions scenarios through to 2100. 
A specialist consultancy conducted an 
assessment of each scenario, adopting a 
data-driven approach to identify and analyse 
physical climate risks facing our operations 
and how those risks may manifest differently  
in each scenario. 

The physical risk survey was conducted across 
16 climate risk areas, both acute and chronic. 
Acute risks are typically high magnitude/
severity events that occur over a short period 
of time whilst chronic hazards are those that 
typically occur over a prolonged period.

The scenario analysis identified risks and  
how those risks may manifest differently  
under emissions scenarios: RCP2.6 
(aggressive mitigation, assumes that global 
annual GHG emissions peak between 
2010-20), RCP4.5 (strong mitigation, assumes 
that emissions peak around 2040) and  
RCP8.5 (business-as-usual, emissions 
continue to rise). These Representative 
Concentration Pathways represent three 
potential trajectories of global emissions set 
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  
Change (IPCC).

The results reinforced that, while physical 
impacts do occur, the overall risk to the wider 
business was localised, with most properties 
and customer bases not being at direct risk. 
It found that the majority of risk, such as the 
increased threat of heat stress, would fall on 
colleagues, and will require the Company to 
provide mitigations in the field. 

The conclusions have supported the 
Company’s preparation of similar measures 
that could be introduced elsewhere across  
the globe as required. Our analysis and 
conclusions remain current for this reporting 
period and materiality is unchanged.

In addition to this external study, an internal 
climate change report, analysing the potential 
financial risks to the wider Company, has  
been produced. This report found minimal to 
moderate risk to the Company as an ongoing 
venture, with any potential effects having little 
disruption to our global operations.

Climate-related risk 
management 
Our operational and functional teams are 
responsible for identifying and analysing 
climate-related risks. For example, our supply 
chain and procurement teams identify risks 
relating to the resilience of supply and access 
to materials, while our country and product 
regulatory teams identify risks related to new 
laws and regulations.

Risks and opportunities are discussed at the 
relevant Boards – Category Boards, as well as 
the Executive Leadership Team and the Board 
of Directors. 

Annually, we update the Audit Committee  
on any changes in the assessment of climate 
change, physical, societal, or legislative 
impacts on the assets and trading of  
the Company. 

Overall, our analysis demonstrates that the 
Company is not materially exposed to climate 
change events in the short (up to three years) 
to medium term (four to ten years), due to its 
disaggregated nature, including following the 
integration with Terminix. Please see below. 

Longer-term (10 years plus) risks require 
further analysis as data becomes available.

Our plan and steps to achieve net zero 
emissions (page 80) are stretching, but we 
believe they are achievable within the 
timelines with no material adverse impacts  
on assets, liabilities, or profitability and  
cash flow over time.

For details on our process for managing  
risk across the business including risk 
identification, assessment and management, 
see our risk management process on pages 
87 and 88. 

Potential climate-related risk

Overall risk likelihood and potential severity

Potential financial impact

Potential physical risks

Loss of physical inventory 
from flood, wildfires, or other 
climate disaster.

We do not see a material risk in the types of inventories we use being 
impacted. There is a risk that storage of our physical inventories could be 
impacted; however, stock holding locations are small and immaterial meaning 
that the severity of this risk is low. Stocks typically are held locally, close to 
technicians and customers. 

No material financial impact, 
but on a local level some loss 
of stock.

Loss of building and 
infrastructure assets from 
flood, wildfires, or other 
climate disaster.

Our cost base is predominantly colleague-based and not dependent on 
significant assets (e.g. large manufacturing plants) or complicated supply 
chains. In addition most of our buildings are leasehold, so we have the option 
to relocate over time.

No material financial impact, 
but some disruption likely on 
a local level.

Physical events such as 
floods or wildfires destroying 
material value assets.

Most of the assets used for generating revenue (equipment for rental) 
are low-value assets meaning that the severity of this risk is low. The 
geographical spread of these assets means that we do not face the risk  
of physical events, such as floods or wildfires, destroying material value 
assets. Physical risks have a low likelihood of resulting in a material risk  
to asset valuation at a Company level due to distribution of properties  
across the globe.

No material financial impact.

Potential transition risks

Possibility of increased or 
changing legislation related 
to climate change, in the 
fields of worker safety, 
vehicle usage and property 
maintenance. 

Cost and productivity impact 
of transitioning to a ULEV 
fleet of vehicles.

It is of a medium likelihood that over time legislative (e.g. carbon pricing) or 
societal changes will impact our customers and the sectors that they operate 
in. The severity of the impact would be dependent on the legislative change 
which took place but could likely have a high impact. 

Financial impact would 
depend on the severity  
of the legislative change.

The fleet of vehicles we have today are typically internal combustion engine 
powered. We have begun to transition to ULEVs in several countries and 
good progress has been made, with the number of ULEVs up to 683 in 2023 
(2022: 368). In the UK and Europe, c.8% of our fleet is ULEVs. If we were to 
move fully to ULEVs in the short to medium term, clearly, this would have 
a large impact on cost and productivity but that is not our strategy. We will 
reach 100% ULEV in line with our goal of reaching net zero by 2040, as 
ULEVs and charging infrastructure becomes available.

The cost of our fleet transition 
remains within our existing 
operational budgets. 

Failure to decarbonise 
our operations resulting 
in reputation and brand 
damage.

Rentokil Initial has a robust net zero transition strategy and plan in place 
allowing us to make regular progress towards decarbonising our operations. 
This means that this risk is of a low likelihood. However, should it occur the 
severity of the risk would be medium to high.

Should this risk materialise, 
this could have a material 
impact.

Rentokil Initial has robust business continuity plans in place.

The vast majority of properties are leasehold allowing us to move in a timely 
manner should a localised risk increase.

Our operational policies and infrastructure, products and services, continue 
to operate effectively in countries which already have very high temperatures 
such as MENAT. 

Should we fail to adapt, 
potential loss of revenue  
and increased operating 
costs locally, not material.

Potential adaptation risks

Failure to adapt operations 
to climate change impacts – 
localised flooding and higher 
temperatures.

Annual Report 2023

Operational resilience
The Company has a very disaggregated 
customer base, both geographically and 
across many sectors, with low average 
contract values. Therefore, we are not 
exposed to significant climate change risks  
in our customer base over the short to  
medium term.

As we continue to experience and observe  
the emerging effects of climate change, we 
are taking the appropriate steps to respond. 
This includes a variety of mitigations across 
our business to minimise the impacts upon our 
colleagues, customers, and the communities 
and environments in which we operate. 

Rentokil Initial continues to demonstrate 
resilience with mitigation measures already in 
place in those areas we operate that are already 
at risk of extreme weather events. For example, 
our colleagues in the Middle East are scheduled 
not to work between noon and 2.00pm during 
summer months when temperatures reach over 
45°C and in Australia, we have issued workwear 
uniforms made of lighter weight fabrics with 
specialist cooling technology.

Climate-related opportunities
Rentokil Initial continues to develop  
non-toxic and sustainable solutions such as 
PestConnect for rodent control and Lumnia  
for flying insect control. Opportunities to 
differentiate our services as sustainable  
will become of increasing importance to 
customers of all sizes.

As a global leader in pest control and  
hygiene and wellbeing services, there are  
also opportunities which may arise from the 
changes occurring with a warming planet:

• longer, warmer breeding seasons will be 

advantageous to insects and rodents, and 
warmer temperatures in winter will likely also 
see lower pest mortality rates; and

• we are already seeing insects move into 
regions where they have previously not  
had a presence because of the changing 
environment.

During the summer of 2023 in Europe, where 
record temperatures were recorded, the 
Company’s operations continued with the 
safety team implementing best practices  
such as ensuring water breaks and not 
working outside during peak heat times.  
Our operations remained highly resilient. 

Transition monitoring
Rentokil Initial continues to monitor any such 
local legal changes to ensure we continue to 

remain fully compliant with all local, regional 
and national regulations. City-based vehicle 
charging is also monitored and we analyse the 
availability of low-emission vehicle charging 
infrastructure and the suitability of lower 
emission vehicles to meet the needs of our 
local operations. Our local teams continue  
to monitor their local markets and maintain 
engagement with customers. 

The University of Hawaii has identified  
climate change as a major threat to global 
health security. On top of increasing global 
urbanisation and mobility, climate change 
provides more opportunities for emerging 
diseases and new infections to spread. The 
study concluded that the effects of climate 
change are making more than half of 
infectious diseases worse.

Greater floods and increasing temperatures 
provide ideal conditions for the propagation  
of insects, with studies predicting 
disease-carrying mosquitoes will continue  
to spread if global emissions do not fall.

In 2023, malaria spread from mosquitoes to 
humans inside the US for the first time in  
20 years, according to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. 

In the US, VDCI, our vector control company, 
supports public sector mosquito abatement 
programmes. VDCI is also a leading provider 

of emergency response mosquito control 
services after major flood events or increased 
mosquito-borne disease activity.

Last year a review on public health impact 
found that West Nile continues to be the 
deadliest mosquito-borne disease in the 
continental US. First reported in 1999, the  
virus is now considered endemic by public 
health authorities in most areas.

We are at the forefront of mitigating the  
effect of pests across the globe, supporting 
our customers and local communities to 
minimise the impacts on their businesses  
and public health.

In 2024, our new innovation centre will be 
opened in the US, focused on residential  
pest control, termites, vector control and 
sustainable fumigation. The centre will  
bring together a range of expertise from 
entomologists, vector scientists, fumigation 
chemists and residential product owners.

Climate-related metrics  
and targets
Rentokil Initial has published its emissions 
data for 19 years and continues to improve  
the quality and range of its environmental 
reporting. In addition, we report on a number 
of operational metrics in relation to our net 
zero transition plan including the number  
of ULEVs, renewable energy usage and 
reduction in fumigation use (see below for  
our targets which contribute to our net zero 
transition plan). 

Our GHG emissions are derived from the use 
of energy in our properties and vehicles and 
through the use of chemicals in pest-related 
fumigation projects. 

Our absolute values of tonnes of CO2e are 
reported in line with the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting standard 
(revised edition), using UK government 
conversion factors for GHG reporting and 
International Energy Agency conversion 
factors for non-UK electricity.

We first set an emissions target in 2012 of a 
10% reduction in our emissions intensity index 
by 2016, which was achieved in 2015. Then, 
using 2015 data as the baseline, we set a 
five-year emissions target to achieve a 20% 
reduction in this intensity index by the end of 
2020, which we achieved a year early.

In 2020, we set a new target to improve the 
emissions intensity index by a further 20%  
by the end of 2025 (using 2019 data as the 
baseline). As of the end of 2023, we had 
improved by 16% towards this target.

Net zero transition plan
Our pathway to net zero from our operations 
by the end of 2040 is built around three  
core pillars and eight workstreams, with 
climate-related milestone targets in 2025 
and 2030. 

Key elements of the plan include our 
transition to a low-emission fleet, the 
reduction in our energy emissions through 
the transition to renewable property 
electricity, and reduction in emissions  
from the use of chemicals, each of which  
are under way and detailed in this report 
(see pages 72 to 74). 

At this stage we do not expect carbon 
offsetting to represent a significant part of 
our journey to net zero. We have owned the 
Terminix business since October 2022 and  
it is incorporated into our net zero transition 
plans. Details of our combined carbon 
footprint can be found on page 81.

Note: This table includes emissions data for Terminix from October 2022, when acquired by Rentokil Initial. Based on Terminix’s full-year 2022 data, the 
combined emissions would total 400,505 compared to 409,201 for 2023. This would represent a year-on-year increase of 2.2%.

Scope 1 – emissions from our vehicles and the operation of our facilities, with the majority of emissions derived from the use of petrol and diesel across our  
fleet, with a small amount of gas, fuel oil, LPG and aviation fuels. Reductions in the previously reported Scope 1 emissions for 2022 are due to a review of data 
collection in a few countries.

Scope 2 – emissions derived from the purchase of electricity. This has been split between Location- and Market-based to account for those operations switching 
to green and renewable tariffs. Slight changes to prior-year figures are due to updates in the IEA conversion factors.

Scope 3 – includes Category 3 relating to fuel and energy-related activities not included in Scope 1 and 2. Slight changes to prior-year figures are due to updates 
in the International Energy Agency (IEA) conversion factors.

Market-based emissions (deductions) – emissions deducted under the renewable electricity contracts we have implemented in the UK, Italy, Australia,  
New Zealand and India. 

Absolute emissions in 2023 from Scope 1 were 294,006 tonnes CO2e with the UK constituting 6% in 2023 (2022: 9%) and the emissions from Scope 2 were  
21,614 tonnes CO2e with the UK constituting 4% (2022: 5%).

Rentokil Initial: UK and global energy consumption
Since 2018, we have also reported our energy consumption and the UK operations’ percentage. In 2023, global energy consumption was  
1,384,577 MWh, with the UK and offshoring representing 72,497 MWh or 5.2% (2022: 8.5%).

Our total energy consumption is calculated using electricity purchased (MWh) and fuel volumes converted to MWh using the UK government GHG conversion 
factors for company reporting. Direct GHG emissions relate to the combustion of fuel and the operation of any facility. Indirect GHG emissions relate to the 
purchase of electricity, heat, steam, or cooling. 

The table above represents energy consumption within Rentokil Initial, including Terminix. Reductions in the previously reported Group energy for 2022 are due 
to review of data collection in a few countries.

Fumigation services
Around the world, some of our operations 
provide customers with fumigation services 
that utilise sulfuryl fluoride (SF). The use  
of SF is specified as a treatment by some 
destination countries to prevent the spread 
of invasive pests, and also in the treatment  
of termites to prevent structural damage  
to buildings. 

This accounts for a small percentage of our 
revenues, and we are committed to finding 
alternative, more sustainable solutions, in 
line with our net zero by 2040 target (see 
page 72).

The reduction this year was due to 
fluctuations in customer demand, as well as 
greater progress on our reduction strategies, 
in particular, our monitoring of the quantities 
of SF throughout the fumigation process. 

Emissions equivalent from the use of SF 
decreased by 16% in 2023 to 1,293,043 
tonnes (2022: 1,540,236 – factoring  
a full year of Terminix; 2021: 792,744;  
2020: 814,700; 2019: 548,449). 

A significant proportion of our North America 
fumigation services are conducted by 
third-party subcontractors. Their SF usage is 
tracked and has been included in our data.

operating with the utmost professional 
integrity. 

In 2023, the Company updated a range  
of policies and harmonised its Code of 
Conduct following the Terminix acquisition. 

In the Human Rights section of the Code,  
we state that we will under no circumstances 
make use of forced or coerced labour, 
servitude or slavery and will only employ 
individuals who are working of their own free 
will. It further states that no colleague will be 
deprived of identity papers or be required to 
provide financial inducements to the Company 
to facilitate their employment.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct was updated in 
2021 to expand the remit of the Environmental 
section to include new sections on: quality  
of products or services, zero tolerance of  
tax evasion and protecting personal data.  
We have aimed to make our Supplier Code 
accessible by making it available in 19 
languages on our website. Our Supplier  
Code of Conduct will be reviewed in 2024.

Progress towards CSRD in 2023
Rentokil Initial recognises that double 
materiality is important to underpinning our 
responsible business approach against the 
CSRD. This year we worked with a specialist 
consultancy to start the in-depth process of 
understanding our material issues. 

Double materiality refers to 
sustainability-related impacts, risks and 
opportunities for a company. It is defined by 
the CSRD as comprising impact materiality 
and financial materiality. 

Impact materiality refers to a business’s 
impacts on the environment and people. 
Financial materiality refers to the risks and 
opportunities that a company faces in relation 
to the environment and people. 

A sustainability matter is considered ‘material’ 
for a company if it surpasses materiality 
thresholds for impact materiality, financial 
materiality or both.

So far, we have worked with internal 
stakeholders to understand what areas of  
the ESRS topics are likely to be material.  
We will engage with a range of stakeholders, 
both internal and external, to consider these 
areas as part of this assessment. 

When making major sourcing decisions, 
sustainability elements must be considered; 
for instance, calculating air, sea, or road freight 
transport impact to destination. 

All major supply contracts include a clause 
requiring compliance with the Supplier Code 
and specific clauses on bribery, corruption, 
and modern slavery. 

We encourage our supplier employees or 
other stakeholders to report genuine concerns 
over malpractice, illegal acts or failures to 
comply with recognised standards of ethical 
behaviour that they observe at any point 
within our global supply chain through our 
Supplier Speak Up programme.

Supplier audits are undertaken as set out  
in our Modern Slavery Statement, which is 
available on our website. The environmental 
and social impact of sourcing options is 
included in the criteria for the evaluation of 
alternatives for the global supply of products.

Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive
In preparation for the new Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD),  
we have considered the published guidance, 
taken advice from corporate advisors,  
and appointed a specialist consultancy. 

We have undertaken an indicative 
assessment of applicability of CSRD to the 
Group and, based on that assessment, are 
preparing the relevant reporting for the 
January – December 2025 financial year.

Our Stakeholders
Committed to stakeholder engagement

Our purpose and our core values 
of service, relationships, teamwork 
and responsibility reflect the central 
importance of our stakeholders to 
our business and influence how 
we engage with them. 

We believe that by engaging regularly with 
all of our stakeholders and responding to 
their feedback we support the long-term 
sustainability of our business. 

The Company’s section 172(1) statement 
is detailed below, with the Group’s key 
stakeholders and our engagement with 
them detailed on pages 84 and 85. 

Section 172(1) statement
Section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 
aims to ensure that the board of directors of a 
company has a comprehensive understanding 
of its key relationships with a broad range  
of interested groups, such as employees, 
suppliers and customers, and that there is 
proper perspective of the impact on both 
internal and external stakeholder interests  
in order to secure the company’s long-term 
success. 

This statement plans to set out how our Board 
of Directors (the Board), both individually and 
collectively, have paid due regard to these 
factors during 2023 when undertaking the 
duties set out under section 172(1).

The sections of the Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 108 to 111, which expand 
upon the Board’s activities and principal 
decisions in 2023 and evidence how the 
Board considered the impact of its decisions 
on the factors set out in section 172(1), also 
form part of this statement. These pages  
are incorporated by reference into the 
Strategic Report.

Our stakeholders
We identify our key stakeholders as 
colleagues, customers, shareholders, 
communities and suppliers. We classify  
the environment as strongly related to 
communities and so often consider them 
together. We also recognise the broadening 
impact the environment has on all our 
identified stakeholders and its increasing 
importance to areas of our business 
operations. 

In discharging its section 172(1) duties,  
the Board has had regard to these key 
stakeholders and the associated impacts, 
although some factors may have been more 
relevant than others, depending on the  
nature of the matter under consideration. 
Where appropriate, the Board also gave 
consideration to other factors or interested 
parties relevant to the decision being made, 
such as regulators, industry bodies or other 
business relationships.

• The Company’s Modern Slavery  

Statement on our website – the statement

annually, and involves consideration of key 
stakeholder groups.

Our strategic priorities
Board decisions and actions are aimed at 
creating long-term value for our shareholders 
through our sustained economic success 
while furthering the Company’s mission of 
protecting people, enhancing lives and 
preserving our planet. The Board agenda is 
designed to ensure that key strategic priorities 
are captured and considered throughout  
the year, with an in-depth review of the 
longer-term direction of the business 
undertaken as part of its annual strategy day 
sessions. Sufficient information is provided  
by management to enable the Board to  
make informed decisions on any impact to 
stakeholders. Details of how our Board 
operates and the way it reaches decisions, 
including the matters discussed and debated 
during the year, can be found in the Corporate 
Governance Report.

When considering the needs of relevant 
stakeholder groups, conflicting requirements 
inevitably arise and in those circumstances  
we aim to make judgements that balance  
and serve the long-term interests of the 
stakeholders. We acknowledge that not  
every decision the Board makes will 
necessarily result in a positive outcome for  
all stakeholders. However, by considering  
key stakeholder groups and aligning our 
activities with our strategic plan, as well as  
the Company’s culture and values, we aim  
to act fairly, transparently, responsibly and in 
the best interests of the Company over the 
long term. 

In making their decisions and choices, and in 
setting policies and strategy, our Directors 
also consider any associated risks when 
discharging their duties. Maintaining effective 
systems of risk management and internal 
control, reviewing and mitigating our principal 
risks and identifying emerging risks, all help 
underpin the Group’s overall strategy and 
allow the Board to have regard to factors that 
could affect stakeholder relationships and 
their impact on our long-term success.

Our responsible business
In line with most businesses, there are impacts 
trade-offs that we recognise and manage 
proactively and appropriately. We aim to 
reduce our impact, for instance, as a result of 
the chemicals we use and the greenhouse  
gas (GHG) emissions involved in providing 
services to our customers, by developing 
innovative products and services which  
are increasingly non-toxic and sustainable.  
We proactively engage with suppliers as part 
of this. We have published the key activities  
to achieve net zero carbon emissions from  
our operations by the end of 2040 and 
regularly report on our innovative solutions. 
Our environmental strategy focuses on the 
operational risks and opportunities that we 
have identified and is embedded within  
our operating model as a multi-local, 
route-based business.

Our reputation is of utmost importance to our 
business success, as we rely on customers’ 
satisfaction and the continued investment of 
shareholders. Our culture model includes our 
mission and values, along with our five core 
culture themes: customer focused, driven  
to succeed, diverse, down to earth and 
innovative. We continue to monitor our culture, 
recognising the important and evolving role  
it plays in driving behaviours that bring the 
business sustainable long-term success. Our 
comprehensive set of policies and procedures 
ensure high standards of professional 
business conduct, including embedding 
adherence to our Code of Conduct. We strive 
to act fairly and transparently between 
stakeholders of the Company at all times.

The event was also about giving back to 
the communities, kicking off a month-long 
food drive, with donations made to the 
US charity, Feeding America, and the 
Canadian charity, Second Harvest (see 
page 71).

Our approach and key policies

Environmental matters

Rentokil Initial recognises the responsibility we have in protecting the environment and managing 
climate-related risks and opportunities. We are on a journey to reach net zero emissions by the end of 
2040 and have a clear strategy in place to help us achieve this. Our environmental strategy consists of 
three core pillars: Sustainable Solutions, Sustainable Operations and Sustainable Workplace. Within 
these pillars it addresses eight key components of our business: Chemicals, Consumables, Hardware, 
Waste, Mobility, Supply Chain, Properties and Culture. 
Our Code of Conduct states that all our colleagues must conduct their work in a way that complies with 
environmental laws and minimises any adverse effect on the environment. Our Environmental Policy  
sets out our commitment to carrying out our business in an environmentally responsible way.
We expect our suppliers to adopt a similar approach to us in protecting the environment. As a minimum, 
our Supplier Code requires that they comply with applicable laws and respect the environment in work-
related activities, on any of our premises, our customers’ premises and sites, and their own premises. 
The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for managing climate-related risks and opportunities within 
the Company, supported by oversight of the Board and the work of the Executive Leadership Team. 
Further information on our climate related-risk and opportunities can be found in our TCFD Report.

Risks and Uncertainties
How the business manages uncertainty and risks

The embedded management of key risks supports our strategic objectives through 
identification and mitigation, helping drive good decisions and practice. 

Risk management approach
The Group’s overall risk management 
approach, described here and on page 123,  
is designed to provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance across the Group that 
risks are being effectively identified and 
robustly managed. This includes ensuring 
appropriate mechanisms are in place to 
ensure that issues and concerns relating to 
risk can be escalated up through the 
organisation successfully and confidentially.

The Board has oversight of the Group’s 
operations to ensure that internal controls  
are in place and operating effectively. This is 
achieved by reviewing the effectiveness of the 
risk management process and managing the 
evolving risk environment as it approves the 
Group’s overall strategy. Key components of 
the Board risk management process include:
• annual presentation and approval of the risk 

process by the Audit Committee;

• review of Group Risk Committee minutes by 

the Audit Committee; and

• annual presentation and approval of the 

Group strategy.

Management is responsible for the effective 
operation of internal controls and risk 
management including the execution of the 
agreed risk mitigation plans. Key components 
of the risk management process by 
management include:
• identification, assessment and management 
of risk integrated into day-to-day operations 
by local and regional operational 
management;

• maintenance of a central risk register 

periodically reviewed with movements and 
impacts tracked;

• emerging risks and potential mitigations 

reviewed at quarterly Group Risk Committee 
meetings; and

• deep dives on specific or emerging risks at 

senior management meetings.

The risk management process was 
strengthened during 2023 by reviewing 
compliance responsibilities across the Group, 
reviewing and refreshing the major incident 
protocols, and the inclusion of additional deep 
dive sessions on specific or emerging risk 
topics at senior management meetings. 

The Board is satisfied that, through the 
processes set out above, it is able to 
effectively identify and manage risks. The 
Board is further satisfied that the responsible 
managers have the necessary skills and 
expertise to ensure that the relevant risk 
management processes and control systems  
are in place and fully operative.

The Board relies on the assurances provided 
by management and Internal Audit through 
periodic reports presented to the Board and 
Audit Committee.

Using the process set out above, the Board 
confirms it has undertaken a robust 
assessment of the principal risks which may 
impact or otherwise threaten the delivery of 
the strategy and the long-term viability of the 
Group. In addition, the Board has assessed  
the identification and assessment of emerging 
risks, and is satisfied that appropriate 
mitigation plans are in place for both emerging 
and principal risks. The Group’s business 
model remained broadly the same in 2023 as 
in previous years. It incorporates a number  
of elements that moderate the risk profile of 
the Company.

• Low capital intensity and high portfolio 

retention rates: our categories exhibit strong 
defensive qualities, as density and efficiency 
gains are reflected in margin growth.
• Local market operations: the limited 

dependency on cross-border flows of people 
or products reduces the impact of 
geopolitical risks, and foreign exchange  
risk is muted since revenue is earned  
and costs are incurred in local currency. 
There is natural resilience to fluctuations  
in market dynamics in individual markets,  
and geopolitical and trade risks due to our 
local market operations.

• Clear and simple geographic model: our 
decentralised model has single-country 
management teams leading integrated 
operations, with combined back-office 
functions underpinned by shared systems.

Changes in risk profile  
of the Company in 2023
We continue to monitor existing and emerging 
risks regularly at both the Audit Committee 
(see pages 123 and 124) and the Group Risk 
Committee (see page 105), and to take 
mitigating action as appropriate.

Areas where the risk profile of the business 
has improved in 2023 include:
• continued roll-out of our target financial  

and operational systems across the globe, 
including a dedicated Treasury project, 
automating significant amounts of 
calculations and reporting;

• continued investment and early 

standardisation in technical infrastructure to 
mitigate the risk of a successful cyber attack;

• continued strong cash flow giving financial 

headroom to continue to acquire businesses 
with good strategic fit;

• continued evolution of a Fraud Risk 

Assessment; 

• deep dive management sessions on risks, 

including customer retention, artificial 
intelligence, termite claims and innovation; 
and

• formalisation and documentation of internal 

controls as required by SOX legislation.

Areas where our risk profile has increased in 
2023 include:
• fluctuating inflationary pressures, with limited 

exposure to hyperinflation markets, 
challenging international geopolitical activity 
including impacting energy costs;

• increased potential for general industrial 

action in some markets driven by 
macroeconomic factors;

• increased legal compliance, including the 

Economic Crime and Corporate 
Transparency Act and SOX legislation;
• increased volume of cyber attacks; and
• increased scale and complexity of the Group. 

Focus areas for risk mitigation 
in 2024
We continue to look for ways to improve both 
our risk process and mitigating actions to 
address the identified risks. In 2024, we plan 
to focus on the following areas:
• develop the risk methodology and assess 
the usage of risk tools to further embed  
our processes;

• continue the review of the Group’s 
compliance structure, roles and 
responsibilities conducted by the Group 
General Counsel and Director of Internal 
Audit & Risk; and

• repeat and develop Fraud Risk Assessment 

Process, expanding definitions and 
formalising a defined response plan and 
policy. Training to be rolled out globally to 
enhance knowledge and awareness.

Identified risks
The principal risks most relevant to the Group 
are described in the table on pages 88 to 93, 
together with mitigating actions.

Information on climate-related risks is 
provided on page 78.

Full details of our financial risks can be found 
in Note C1 on pages 203 and 204. The exact 
financial impact of one or more of our principal 
risks materialising will depend on the precise 
operational impact of the risk, its interaction 
with other risks and whether mitigating actions 
are successful in reducing the overall financial 
impact. The Group is exposed to other risks 
and uncertainties related to environmental, 
political, social, economic and employment 
factors in the territories in which we operate. 
Additional risks and uncertainties not 
presently known to management or deemed 
to be of lower materiality may, if they manifest 
themselves, have an adverse impact on the 
Group’s growth, profitability, cash flow and/or 
net assets.

Principal risk: Strategic
Failure to integrate 
acquisitions and  
execute disposals from 
continuing business

The Company has a strategy that includes 
growth by acquisition, and 41 new businesses 
were acquired in 2023. These companies 
need to be integrated quickly and efficiently  
to minimise potential impact on the acquired 
business and the existing business. 

Impact should the risk materialise
If the Company fails to successfully integrate 
acquisitions into its existing organisational 
structures and IT systems, fails to deliver the 
revenue and profit targets, or fails to deliver 
expected synergy savings, the business  
may not achieve the expected financial and 
operational benefits, which may adversely 
impact growth, profitability and cash flow.

Our business may be required to recognise 
impairment charges or be subject to asset 
re-evaluations or downgrades.

Business disposals also have to be managed 
efficiently to minimise risk to the businesses 
being disposed of and the residual business.

Mitigating actions
• Integration plans considered by the 
Investment Committee as part of the 

Principal risk: Strategic
Failure to develop products 
and services that are tailored 
and relevant to local markets 
and market conditions

We operate across markets that are at 
different stages in the economic cycle, at 
varying stages of market development and 
have different levels of market attractiveness. 
We must be sufficiently agile to develop and 
deliver products and services that meet local 
market needs, which allows us to meet our 
growth objectives and stay ahead in a highly 
competitive industry.

Impact should the risk materialise
If we are not able to adapt to local business 
and consumer needs, our existing customers 
may choose not to renew contracts, or seek 
reductions in prices. This would negatively 
impact our ability to maintain or increase 
margins and cash flow.

Examples include:
• We must adapt to changes to the regulatory 
environment that may ban certain products 
or service models from being used, such as 
permanent rodent baiting.

• We need to respond to the expectations  

from customers and society for us to  
reduce our own environmental impact  
and support our customers in reducing  
their environmental impact.

Impact should the risk materialise
Changes in the macroeconomic environment 
could have a number of different impacts on 
the ability of the business to grow profitably,  
to sustain recruitment and to deliver  
against targets.

Examples include:
• Recession and economic slowdown in some 

of our key markets.

• Changes to the global job market and the 

challenges of recruitment.

• Increased costs of doing business, with rising 
costs as a consequence of political instability, 
increasing interest rates and civil unrest.
• Low-growth economies with inherent cost 
inflation where the Company has weak 
pricing power may make it difficult to 
maintain profitability, especially in areas of 
hyperinflation.

• Growing market presence of multinational 

competitors may increase the cost of 
acquisitions and drive down prices, 
impacting profitability.

• Shift to greater proportion of key accounts in 
some markets may drive down prices and 
make it difficult to maintain profitability.

• Legislation (including climate change 

legislation), regulation or society expectation 
limits our ‘licence to operate’.

• Inflationary pressures drive costs higher, 

potentially pricing out customers in 
challenging financial positions coupled  
with wage inflation demands.

Trend: Stable
Stable, albeit compliance with SEC reporting 
and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act remains a

As a responsible company we aim to comply 
with all laws and regulations that apply to our 
businesses across the globe.

Mitigating actions
• Group legal oversight in acquisitions.
• Tax strategy reissued and approved by the 

Impact should the risk materialise
Failure to comply with local laws including 
bribery and corruption, anti-competitive 
practice, employment law, data privacy, health 
and safety, or financial and tax reporting 
requirements may result in fines or withdrawal 
of licences to operate, which could adversely 
impact growth, profitability and cash flow,  
as well as causing reputational damage.

The Group operates across many different  
tax jurisdictions and is subject to periodic tax 
audits, which sometimes challenge the basis 
on which local tax has been calculated and/or 
withheld. Successful challenges by local tax 
authorities may have an adverse impact on 
profitability and cash flow. Additionally, as the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other US legislation 
now applies to the Group, the risk of failing  
to establish and maintain an effective  
system of internal controls to meet these  
laws could impact the Company both 
financially and operationally.

Principal risk: Operational
Fraud, financial crime and 
loss or unintended release 
of personal data

Collusion between individuals, both internal 
and external, could result in fraud if internal 
controls are not in place and working 
effectively. The business holds personal data 
on colleagues, some customers and suppliers; 
unintended loss or release of such data may 
result in sanctions, fines and reputational risk.

Impact should the risk materialise
Loss of personal data of customers, suppliers 
or colleagues could, if significant, result in 
regulatory intervention, which may result  
in substantial fines and damage to the 
Company’s reputation.

Theft of Company assets including property, 
customer or colleague information, or 
misstatement of financial or other records via 
deliberate action by colleagues or third parties 
may constitute fraud and result in financial loss

colleagues, customers and other stakeholders 
remain safe, that the working environment is 
not detrimental to health and that we are 
aware of and minimise any adverse impact  
on the environment.

Impact should the risk materialise
The Company operates in hazardous 
environments and situations, for example:
• use of poisons and fumigants in Pest Control;
• driving to and working at customers’ premises;
• working at height; and
• exposure to needlestick injury/biohazards 

from medical waste.

Non-compliance with internal policies or 
industry regulations could lead to personal 
injury, substantial fines or penalties, including 
withdrawal of licences to operate and 
reputational damage.

Environmental risks may arise from former 
activities at sites currently operated by the 
Group or acquired by the Group. Legislation 
and changing expectations may require the 
business to alter its methods of operation.

Impact should the risk materialise
If our operatives are not sufficiently qualified, 
or do not have the right skills, or we fail to 
innovate successfully, this may negatively 
impact our ability to acquire or retain 
customers, adversely impacting growth, 
profitability and cash flow.

Industrial action in key operations could  
result in diminished customer service  
levels; if prolonged, it could damage the 
Company’s reputation and ability to secure  
or renew contracts.

In markets where overall employment rates 
are high, and/or our business is growing  
fast organically or via acquisition, we may  
have difficulty attracting and retaining key 
management of the right capability and the 
right calibre of operational personnel.

Changes in the global job market resulting in 
difficulty in recruiting and retaining colleagues 
at all levels of the organisation, may impact  
our ability to service our customers to the 
highest standards.

Major digital change programmes could 
disrupt our ability to deliver high levels of 
service to our customers.

Annual Report 2023 93

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceViability Statement

In accordance with provision 31 of the 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board of 
Directors has assessed the viability of the 
Group, taking account of the Group’s current 
financial position, the latest three-year 
strategic plan and the potential impact of our 
principal risks described on pages 88 to 93. 
Based on this assessment, the Board confirms 
that it has a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over  
the period to 31 December 2026.

The business model of the Group is focused on 
the delivery of services to customers at their 
premises. These are professional and often 
highly technical services, where customers have 
a need that we can help resolve. While these 
needs are subject to some seasonality and 
macroeconomic cycles, overall they are highly 
stable and growing at GDP rates or faster.  
The drivers of this growth are key to the Group’s 
prospects. Population growth, growth of the 
‘middle class’, and urbanisation around the  
world brings growing numbers of humans  
closer together, increasing the need for hygiene, 
as seen in the pandemic, and for control of  
pests where sources of food are more available. 
While climate change will undoubtedly have 
some adverse impacts on the Group, the 
disaggregated nature of our services at 
customer locations materially reduces our 
physical risks. Finally, the change in environment 
will likely bring upsides as pest breeding 
seasons are longer, mortality rates are lower  
and infestations are able to move into markets 
where they historically could not survive.  
Overall, the combination of business model and 
macroeconomic factors suggests that recent 
growth trends should foreseeably continue in 
line with our medium-term targets and beyond.

Period of assessment
Although the Directors have no reason to 
believe that the Group will not be viable over  
a longer time frame, because of the degree  
of uncertainty, the period over which the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation as to 
the Group’s viability, is the three-year period  
to 31 December 2026. Having considered 
whether the assessment period should be 
extended, it is the view of the Directors that  
a three-year period is still appropriate as it is 
consistent with the historical periods in the 
budgeting and strategic planning process. 
Three years is also aligned with the most 
frequent duration of both the customer and 
supplier fixed term contract periods entered 
into by the Group.

Strategic planning process
The budget and longer-term plan have been 
prepared in line with the Group’s strategy as 
described in detail in the Strategic Report 
(pages 3 to 94). The Board reviews the Group’s 
performance at its meetings and depending 
on the external environment and its potential 
impact on the Group’s latest full-year forecast 
and strategic plan, may model a number  
of scenarios.

Viability assessment
In making their assessment, the Directors have 
considered the current position of the Group 
and have undertaken a robust evaluation of the 
principal risks, in particular the ones that could 
impact on the liquidity, solvency and viability of 
the Group. The Directors have taken account of 
the Group’s liquidity position and the Group’s 

94 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

ability to raise finance and deploy capital. 
The results consider the availability and likely 
effectiveness of the mitigating actions that 
could be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or 
occurrence of the identified underlying risks.

Mitigating actions that were identified as part 
of the viability assessment in previous years, 
and which were found to be effective during 
the pandemic, include securing additional 
liquidity, deferring shareholder distributions, 
pausing M&A activity, reducing planned 
capital expenditure, use of recognised tax 
payment deferral mechanisms and actively 
managing the cost base of the Group. Should 
these measures be insufficient then the Group 
would consider raising equity; however, that 
has not been required to date.

Although the review considered all the 
emerging and principal risks identified by  
the Group, the focus was also on how  
global events, like a worldwide pandemic, 
could impact the Group’s future financial 
performance and its cash generation under 
different scenarios. As a result, severe but 
plausible downside sensitivities were applied 
to the three-year plan approved by the Board.

The three-year plan is most sensitive to  
the reduction in revenue due to customer 
suspensions over extended durations.  
With that in mind, the Directors have chosen 
scenarios reflecting the principal risks to  
stress test the three-year plan for the following 
downside scenarios:
• Revenue reduces by 20% against the  

budget for six months of 2024. This scenario 
is significantly worse than the customer 
suspensions experienced during the first  
half of 2020, before the acquisition of 
Terminix (which increased the size of the 
Group revenue by c.60%), which peaked  
at slightly below 30% for one month only.
Risks: failure to grow our business profitably 
in a changing macroeconomic environment; 
failure to deliver consistently high levels of 
service to the satisfaction of our customers; 
failure to develop products and services that 
are tailored and relevant to local markets and 
market conditions; failure to ensure business 
continuity in case of a material incident; and 
failure to integrate acquisitions and execute 
disposals from continuing business.

• A prolonged downturn where revenue 

reduces by 20% for each of the three years  
in the model.
Risks: failure to grow our business profitably 
in a changing macroeconomic environment; 
failure to deliver consistently high levels of 
service to the satisfaction of our customers; 
failure to develop products and services that 
are tailored and relevant to local markets and 
market conditions; failure to ensure business 
continuity in case of a material incident; and 
failure to integrate acquisitions and execute 
disposals from continuing business.

• A significant one-off charge of £200m either 
in the form of a number of bank failures or as 
a result of a major fine.
Risks: failure to ensure business continuity in 
case of a material incident; breaches of laws 
or regulations (including tax, competition  
and antitrust laws); failure to mitigate against 
financial market risks; fraud, financial crime 
and loss or unintended release of personal 
data; and safety, health and the environment.

We have also considered two joint scenarios 
of the above: 1) the six-month scenario and a 
substantial fine; and 2) the three-year scenario 
and a substantial fine. Reverse stress tests 
were considered involving bank losses or fine 
of c.39% of 2024 Global Revenues (GDPR 
capped at 10%), or a 57% downturn in Global 
Revenues for existing headroom to be fully 
used. If we assumed no mitigating activities  
as described above, this would be 37% for 
three years.

The impact of the scenarios has been 
modelled to test projected liquidity headroom 
over the three-year viability period. In each  
of the individual and joint scenarios, the  
Group continues to retain sufficient liquidity 
headroom with the mitigating actions it can 
deploy. None of the scenarios required 
additional external funding above and beyond 
existing committed facilities and in the most 
severe downside scenario the minimum 
headroom modelled was c.£1bn before the 
inclusion of mitigating actions. 

In the three-year period of the viability 
statement, the Group has three debt 
maturities. In November 2024 the €400m 
bond matures, followed by the $700m term 
loan in October 2025 and the €500m bond  
in May 2026. As at 31 December 2023, the 
Group had total undrawn committed facilities 
of $1bn (£785m) and unrestricted cash, net  
of overdrafts of £818m, giving the Group 
combined headroom of £1,603m.

In addition to its committed headroom, the 
Group also has a $250m accordion linked to 
its RCF, a £1bn Commercial Paper Programme 
and an uncommitted, undrawn overdraft 
facility amounting to £20m.

Throughout 2023, the Group maintained its 
long-term (BBB with a Stable outlook) and 
short-term (A-2) credit ratings. At the time  
of the acquisition of Terminix, S&P Global 
reaffirmed the rating and also moved the 
Group’s Business Risk Profile up from 
Satisfactory to Strong. In addition to this the 
Group also obtained a second long-term  
rating (BBB with a Stable outlook) from  
Fitch Ratings during 2023.

The combination of a strong investment  
grade credit rating, the RCF banks’ willingness 
to provide debt funding free of financial 
covenants, the flexibility the Group has to 
make material reductions in its cash outflows, 
which was demonstrated during 2020, and the 
fact that the Group has continued to generate 
cash, provide the Directors with confidence 
that the Group could raise additional debt 
finance if required.

The geographical spread of the Group’s 
operations helps minimise the risk of serious 
business interruption. Furthermore, the  
Group is not reliant on one particular group  
of customers or sectors.

Based on this assessment and having carefully 
considered the Group’s current standing,  
debt servicing and the risks and uncertainties 
referred to above, in line with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the  
Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period ending 31 December 2026.

The integration of Terminix has been 
a key focus for the Board, and the Group 
has made strong progress with the 
integration, successfully delivering on all 
our integration milestones and achieving 
our cost synergy targets for the year.

Richard Solomons,

Annual Report 2023

Dear Shareholder
The Group delivered a good operational  
and financial performance in 2023, despite  
the continuing macroeconomic uncertainty  
in certain markets, including inflationary 
pressures in key markets. In achieving strong 
revenue growth and improved margins, the 
Group has demonstrated the resilience of our 
business model. This is underpinned by our 
provision of essential services, a diversified 
portfolio, global presence, and our firm 
commitment to innovation. 

The integration of Terminix has been a key 
focus for the Board, and the Group has  
made strong progress with the integration, 
successfully delivering on all our integration 
milestones and achieving our cost synergy 
targets for the year. The combination 
continues to create significant 
value-enhancing benefits, and the Group  
has upgraded our expectations for total cost 
synergies. Lower sales lead generation and 
conversion in a softer consumer market in the 
second half of 2023, however, has resulted  
in a slowdown of organic growth in North 
America. The Board has evaluated the 
business’s response to these market 
conditions, so as to maintain our underlying 
operating momentum in the region, and  
there is a clear and comprehensive plan, to 
strengthen our sales and marketing capability, 
and drive customer wins, in the region. The 
Board will continue to closely monitor any 
impact on our share price that this may have.

Given the Group’s operational and financial 
performance in the year, I am pleased to 
announce that the Board is recommending a 
final dividend of 5.93p per share for 2023. 

An overview of the key matters considered  
by the Board during the year is set out  
below, with further detail provided on  
the Board’s composition, activities and 
corporate governance arrangements in  
the following pages. 

Strategy 
Throughout the year, the Board has monitored 
the Group’s performance against our strategy, 
with consideration given to our strategic 
priorities. Rentokil Initial is the world’s largest 
pest control and hygiene and wellbeing 
services provider, and we continue to progress 
our strategy, with sustained organic growth 
and bolt-on M&A. In 2023, the Group acquired 
41 new businesses, with a focus on high- 
quality pest control businesses in Growth and 
Emerging markets, and the expansion of our 
Hygiene & Wellbeing business. Further details 
as to our strategic priorities, and the progress 
that the Group has made on them in the year, 
can be found on pages 16 to 19. 

Safety, health and 
environment
At Rentokil Initial, we provide high-quality 
services for our customers by focusing on  
the safety, engagement and training of our 
colleagues, and by developing innovative 
products and services which are increasingly 
non-toxic and sustainable. 

This is emphasised through our mission: 
Protecting People, Enhancing Lives and 
Preserving our Planet. 

The Board reviews safety, health and 
environmental (SHE) performance at each 
meeting, and is pleased to note our sustained 
delivery of high levels of colleague safety 
performance, as the Group continues to give 
priority to ensuring that everyone gets home 
safe at the end of their working day. During the 
year the Board also discussed the Group’s 
broader sustainability strategy, including the 
environmental initiatives across the Group. 
More information can be found in the 
Responsible Business section on pages 68 to 
82 and in our separate Responsible Business 
Report, which is published on our website. 

Board composition and 
effectiveness
At the conclusion of our Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) in May 2023, Julie Southern 
stepped down from the Board, having  
served as a Non-Executive Director for nine 
years, with our considerable thanks for her 
exemplary support and guidance. 

In April 2023, we welcomed Sally Johnson, 
Chief Financial Officer at Pearson plc, as a 
Non-Executive Director. Sally subsequently 
succeeded Julie as Audit Committee Chair in 
May. Sally brings strong financial expertise, 
and US listed company experience, to the 
Board and has settled in well to the role 
following a comprehensive induction as 
detailed on page 130. 

Further details on Board composition may  
be found on page 107 and on succession 
planning on page 127. 

In 2023, we undertook an external Board 
evaluation, facilitated by Chris Saul of 
Christopher Saul Associates. The report  
found that the Board and Board Committees 
continue to operate effectively. Information on 
this year’s Board evaluation, and the progress 
made with the actions arising from the prior 
review, can be found on pages 112 and 113. 

Remuneration 
The Remuneration Committee Chair led a 
comprehensive engagement process with key 
shareholders during 2023 and early 2024,  
as the Board puts forward a new Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy for shareholder approval 
at the AGM in May 2024. Full details of the 
Remuneration Committee’s activities, 
including the new Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, is contained in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 131 to 161. 

People
We believe that it is our colleagues who make 
Rentokil Initial what it is. The Board recognises 
the great team of people that the Group has, 
and is grateful to all our colleagues for their 
professionalism and dedication. We have 
continued our investment in being a 
world-class Employer of Choice, with a 
particular focus in the year on the North 
America business and the integration of the 
Terminix business. The Group now has 62,900 
colleagues across the globe, with a shared 
mission, vision and values. The Board aims  
to engage with a broad range of colleagues, 
through attendance at meetings, partaking  
in colleague events, and site visits. We also 
receive fulsome updates from management  
on our colleagues, workforce engagement 
undertaken and culture. A key method for the 
Board to monitor culture, and to understand 
the sentiments of employees, is the Your  
Voice Counts (YVC) colleague survey.  
A YVC colleague survey was held in 2023, as 
detailed on page 70. The Board was pleased 
to note that we retained our strong levels of 
engagement and enablement, and that the 
Group received excellent feedback on the 
questions relating to SHE, My Manager, and 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. The Board’s 
oversight of the Group’s culture can be found 
on page 116, along with an overview of the 
Board’s engagement with colleagues, and  
our wider stakeholders on pages 114 and 115. 
As can be seen below, as part of our ongoing 
engagement activities, I visited our Hong Kong 
office in November 2023. 

During the year, the Board and the Nomination 
Committee continued to discuss the 
composition of and succession plans for  
senior management, with a particular focus  
on the North America leadership team.  
In October, Brett Ponton stepped down as  
the CEO of the Company’s North America 
region. The Board is grateful to Brett for  
his contribution to the Group. Following a 
comprehensive recruitment process, we were 
delighted to announce the appointment of 
Brad Paulsen as CEO of our North America 
region in December 2023. Brad was 
previously the CEO of Rexel USA, and brings 
significant leadership experience to the 
business. See page 127 for further details on 
senior management succession planning and 
talent development. 

Looking ahead
As we embark into 2024, the Board has 
confidence in the business’s plans for 
maintaining the Group’s performance  
and underlying trading momentum, 
notwithstanding the continued 
macroeconomic headwinds in certain  
markets. We will continue to closely monitor 
our North America business and the 
effectiveness of THE RIGHT WAY 2 plan,  
the action plan that has been put in place to 
reinvigorate organic growth in North America. 

I take this opportunity to express my gratitude 
to all our shareholders for their continuing 
support to the Company. We will once again 
be holding a hybrid AGM in May 2024, which 
all shareholders are welcome to attend.

Meeting with colleagues  
in Hong Kong

In November 2023, while visiting Hong Kong, I had the pleasure of 
spending the day at our local Rentokil Initial office. The visit granted 
me the opportunity to meet with the Hong Kong team, and to take a 
tour of the office. 

Whilst there, the team provided a presentation of the business and its 
people, along with an overview of the local market and opportunities 
in the region, the business’s key priorities, a SHE update, and the 
business’s key initiatives for 2024. I also held a Q&A session with  
the team. I am immensely grateful to the Hong Kong team for hosting 
me, and for providing me with increased insight into the business,  
its people and its customers, which I shared with my Board colleagues 
at our next meeting.

Board biographies on pages 99 to 101.  
The Board’s approach to assessing external 
commitments, including those considered 
during the year, can be found on page 107. 

A table detailing the number of Board,  
and Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee meetings held in 2023, and 
Director attendance at those meetings,  
is provided on page 98. 

I. Board policies, processes, information,  
time and resources
The Company Secretary works with the Chair 
of the Board, the Chairs of the Committees, 
the Chief Executive and other members of 
management to ensure that the Board has  
the policies, processes, information, time  
and resources it needs in order to function 
effectively and efficiently.

3. Composition, succession  
and evaluation
J. Appointments to the Board 
The Nomination Committee (which comprises 
all the Non-Executive Directors and the 
Chairman) is responsible for succession 
planning for, and recommending candidates 
for appointment to, the Board. For more 
information about the work of the Nomination 
Committee and the Board’s policy on diversity, 
equity and inclusion, see the Nomination 
Committee Report on pages 125 to 130. 

5. Remuneration
P. Remuneration Policy and practices 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for 
determining remuneration policies and practices 
which support the strategy and promote the 
long-term sustainable success of the Group.  
For more information about the work of the 
Remuneration Committee, see the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 131 to 161. 

Q. Executive remuneration 
The current Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
was approved by shareholders at our Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) in May 2021. A copy  
of the policy can be found on our website.

Details of how the policy was applied during 
2023 and how the Remuneration Committee 
has undertaken its duties can be found in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 131 
to 161. 

In accordance with corporate governance 
requirements, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy will be put to shareholders for approval 
at the AGM in May 2024. A copy of the 
proposed policy can be found on pages 152  
to 158. As part of the process for developing 
the policy, the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee consulted with major institutional 
shareholders on the proposals. 

R. Independent judgement and discretion 
The Remuneration Committee determines 
remuneration outcomes for the Executive 
Directors and other members of senior 
management and in so doing exercises 
independent judgement and discretion in the 
context of Company performance and individual 
performance and the wider circumstances,  
as appropriate. No Director or member of 
management is involved in determining their 
own pay.

The Board has a formal system in place for 
Directors to declare a conflict, or potential 
conflict of interest, as summarised on  
page 126. 

K. Board skills, experience and knowledge 
The key skills and experience of each of  
the Directors are included in the Board 
biographies on pages 99 to 101.

Annual Report 2023

Board composition
The Board currently has nine members, 
comprising a Non-Executive Chairman, two 
Executive Directors and six Non-Executive 
Directors, whose key responsibilities are set 
out on page 106. They receive advice and 
support from the Company Secretary and the 
Group General Counsel. Full details of the 
Board members who served during 2023, 
and in 2024 to the date of this report, are on 
pages 99 and 101.

Non-Executive Directors have regular 
opportunities to meet members of the ELT 
and other members of senior management 
(see pages 114 and 115) and also have at 
least one meeting during the year with the 
Chairman to facilitate discussion without 
executive management present. In 2023, 
the Non-Executive Directors met with the 
Chairman twice without management present. 

A Nomination Committee, comprising all the 
independent Non-Executive Directors and 
chaired by the Chairman, is responsible 
for managing the appointment process, 
as part of a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for appointing Directors.

Sally Johnson joined as a Non-Executive 
Director on 1 April 2023. Details of the 
recruitment process undertaken can be found 
on page 127. She became a member of the 
Nomination Committee and Audit Committee 
from her date of appointment, and succeeded 
Julie Southern, who stepped down from the 
Board on 10 May 2023, as Audit Committee 
Chair on that date.

Further information on appointment and 
succession planning is provided in the 
Nomination Committee Report on page 127. 

The Board keeps its membership, and that 
of its Committees, under review in order to 
maintain an ongoing and appropriate balance 
of skills and experience.

The Board considers that it and its Committees 
have an appropriate composition to discharge 
their duties effectively.

Meetings and attendance
The Board met a total of ten times during 
the year, one of which was an additional 
unscheduled meeting. A committee of the 
Board met four times for scheduled meetings 
in relation to the release of financial results 
and trading updates. The membership and 
attendance at Board and Committee meetings 
during 2023 is shown on page 98.

During the year, Sarosh Mistry was unable 
to join the additional unscheduled meeting of 
the Board, and two Remuneration Committee 
meetings, one of which was an additional 
unscheduled meeting, due to conflicting 
commitments which could not be rearranged. 

While we endeavour to avoid conflicts with 
other commitments of Board members by 
setting our calendar up to three years in 
advance, it is sometimes impossible to avoid.

Where Directors are unable to attend 
meetings, they will still receive papers in 
advance of the meetings and the Chairman or 
Committee Chair would seek the individual’s 
views ahead of the meetings and brief them 
on the outcome. We believe that all Directors 
have sufficient capacity to perform their  
roles effectively. 

External commitments
All Directors may accept positions on other 
boards if they can demonstrate that the 
additional commitments will not compromise 
their time commitment to us or represent 
a conflict of interest. Any new external 
appointment must be approved by the  
Board having given due consideration to the 
nature of the appointment and the anticipated 
time commitment. The significant external 
commitments of the Directors can be found 
in their biographical information on pages 99 
to 101.

We consider significant appointments (as 
referred to in Principle 15 of the Code) to be 
either a role with a listed company or a role 
with a time commitment equal to or greater 
than their time commitment with us. Currently, 
Non-Executive Directors are required to 
commit to us at least 20 days a year, and the 
Chairman an average of two days a week. 
There was only one significant external 
appointment considered and approved by  
the Board during 2023, being Andy Ransom’s 
appointment as a Non-Executive Director 
of Informa plc in February 2023. 

We monitor, in line with published investor 
guidance, the issue of Board Directors 
becoming over-committed by taking on 
too many potentially significant positions 
(otherwise referred to as ‘overboarding’), 
and the need to remain flexible to deal with 
unforeseen circumstances.

The fact that some of the members of the 
Board hold multiple non-executive positions 
has not presented any problems regarding 
their ability to manage potentially competing 
demands for their time. In addition to 
published investor guidance, the Board 
considers a Director’s time commitment in 
aggregate and takes into account whether a 
Non-Executive Director holds any executive 
appointments. Full attendance details can be 
found on page 98.

Independence of 
Board members
The independence of Directors is considered 
upon their appointment, and subsequently 
reviewed as part of the individual Director 
performance evaluation process, to ensure 
all Non-Executive Directors retain the 
necessary independence of judgement. 
In their continued constructive challenges to 
the executive team and senior management 
at Board and Committee meetings, the 
Non-Executive Directors reflect their 
ongoing independence.

The Board has determined that all our 
Non-Executive Directors are independent and 
have retained their independence of character 
and judgement. In coming to this conclusion, 
the Board has taken into account the identified 
indicators of potential non-independence as 
set out in the Code. No Director took part  
in the Board’s consideration of their own 
independence. The Chairman was considered 
independent on his appointment. You can find 
details of the Directors’ share interests in the 
Company in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on page 146. No current Non-Executive 
Director has served on the Board for longer 
than nine years. You can see the length of 
tenure for each Director on page 98.

We consider and address any potential 
conflicts of interest before any new external 
Board appointment. All potential conflicts are 
submitted to the Board for consideration and, 
as appropriate, authorisation in accordance 
with our articles of association and the 
Companies Act 2006. Details of these are 
recorded in a register of conflicts, which the 
Nomination Committee also reviews in full 
annually. No material conflicts have been 
declared. You can find further details of this 
process in the Nomination Committee Report 
on page 126. 

In accordance with the Code, the Directors are 
subject to annual re-election by shareholders 
and will, therefore, be seeking re-election at 
the AGM in May 2024 (see page 242).

Board activities in 2023

In order to discharge responsible leadership 
and optimise the breadth of Board oversight, 
the Board conducts discussions at formal 
meetings facilitated by carefully structured 
agendas which are agreed in advance by  
the Chairman, in conjunction with the Chief 
Executive and Company Secretary. 

A review of safety, health and environmental 
performance is the first item on the agenda at 
scheduled meetings. The Chairs of our Board 
Committees also provide verbal reports on the 
proceedings of those meetings, highlighting 
key discussion points and particular concerns 
for the Board’s attention. Other standing 
agenda items comprise reports on operational 

and financial performance, and legal and 
governance updates. Details of the key 
matters receiving Board attention at meetings 
in 2023 are set out below.

As an acknowledgement of the value of 
understanding the views of our stakeholders 
and their importance in the ability to deliver 
our strategy and purpose, the Board takes  
into account the Group’s key stakeholders  
and their diverse perspectives as part of  
the Board’s discussions. Examples of this 
approach in relation to certain principal 
decisions taken by the Board during the  
year can be found on page 111.

Be an Employer of Choice 

Drive Organic Revenue Growth

Manage a responsible business

Strategy 

The Board monitors the Group’s performance 
against its strategy, as defined at the annual 
strategy review sessions, throughout the year. 
Strategy updates provided to the Board 
include reports by the Chief Executive at  
each scheduled Board meeting, which among 
other things include an overview of health  
and safety results, operational business 
performance, investor relations, M&A, external 
insights and people matters. The Board also 
receives performance management reports 
from the Chief Financial Officer, which  
include information on our financial and 
non-financial key performance indicators 
(KPIs), and the outcome of regional business 
and functional reviews. 

The Board’s annual strategy day was held over 
two days in November and gave the Board  
the opportunity to conduct a comprehensive 
review of the Group’s medium-term  
strategic plan. This year’s event consisted  
of presentations on the key strategic issues  
for the Group, the growth plan for the North 
America business, an update on customer 
needs and market opportunities, a review of 
the Group’s digital marketing strategy, an 
update on the Cities of the Future strategy, 
and an overview of the Group’s IT strategy. 

The Board also received an external 
presentation from the Company’s brokers on 
the external macro financial environment and 
medium-term financial outlook, and held a 
session on key global themes with Kearney  
(an external consultancy firm). Further details 
as to the Board’s consideration of the potential 
use by the business of Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) and Extended Reality (XR) can be found  
on page 110. 

During 2023, the Board undertook regional 
deep dives with the management teams for 
North America; Europe, the Caribbean and 
Latin America; the Pacific; and the UK & 
Sub-Saharan Africa regions. These sessions 
provide an overview of operational 
performance and future strategy for the 
region, and highlight specific areas of progress 
or challenge. They also allow the Board the 
opportunity to gain further knowledge and 
engage with the leadership team in the  
region on particular areas of focus. One of the 
reviews of North America took place as part of 
the Board’s overseas visit to Chicago in June 
2023. More details can be found on page 109. 

In June and December, the Board considered 
the Group’s sustainability strategy, including 
the steps being taken to achieve net zero  
by 2040 and the progress of regional 
sustainability plans to achieve agreed  
targets by 2025 (see the Responsible 
Business section on pages 68 to 82 for  
more information). 

The Head of Investor Relations presented  
to the Board in June on the Investor  
Relations function, the composition of the 
Company’s share register and planned 
investor engagement activities. The Board 
also discussed the Company’s American 
Depository Receipt (ADR) programme and  
the key areas of focus for investors. 

Customer and supplier contracts over an 
agreed threshold are also reviewed and 
approved by the Board. In 2023, these 
included an energy contract and vehicle 
supply contract. 

Safety, health 
and environment

A review of safety, health and environmental 
(SHE) performance is the first item on the 
agenda of each scheduled Board meeting; a 
practice mirrored at ELT meetings. The Board 
receives updates from management on health 
and safety performance, including KPIs, and 
consideration of any major incidents during 
the period, identifying any root causes and 
actions or learnings as a result. Further details 
on colleague safety can be found in the 
Responsible Business section on page 69. 

An update on the Group’s Lost Time Accident 
(LTA) and Working Days Lost (WDL) KPIs (see 
page 22) is provided in each SHE presentation 
to the Board. In addition, twice a year, the 
Board reviews our SHE leading indicators. 
There are three leading indicators which  
focus on our more hazardous activities,  
such as fumigation, that are consistently 
measured across the Group, and two leading 
indicators that focus on compliance with key 
safety training. 

Throughout the year, the Board discussed  
the Group’s broader sustainability strategy, 
including the environmental initiatives in 
progress across the Group. The Board also 
considered updates on the stakeholder 
landscape from an ESG perspective and  
ESG reporting requirements. In 2023,  
we engaged an external specialist 
consultancy firm to support the in-depth 
process of understanding the material 
sustainability-related impacts, risks and 
opportunities for the Group, in preparation for 
compliance with the Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD) and enhanced 
ESG reporting in the future. The outcome of 
this initial assessment was shared with the 
Board (see the Responsible Business section 
on pages 72 to 82 for more information).

People 

Governance and compliance 

Mergers and acquisitions

In July and December, the Board received 
updates from the Group HR Director on 
colleague retention, workforce engagement 
and culture. This included an overview of the 
external employment landscape, an update  
on our Employer of Choice programme, and  
a summary of the enhancements being made 
to the Group’s talent and career development 
initiatives. In December, the Board also 
received a summary of the key findings from 
our colleague survey, Your Voice Counts 
(YVC). The survey, which is undertaken every 
two years, is one of the principal methods for 
both senior management and the Board to 
understand the main areas of focus for our 
people, and to identify potential opportunities 
for improvement. Further details as to the  
YVC survey can be found on page 70. 

The Board also receives regular updates from 
the Chief Executive on any changes to senior 
management. Succession planning for the 
North America leadership team was a major 
focus during the year, with Brett Ponton 
stepping down as CEO North America in 
October 2023, and Brad Paulsen being 
appointed as his successor in December. 

In March, the Board approved the Company’s 
Gender Pay Report. We continue to have no 
material gender pay gap between women and 
men, and are making progress in building our 
female representation in senior management 
roles. The Gender Pay Report is available  
on the Company’s website, while further 
details of our approach to diversity, equity  
and inclusion (DE&I) can be found in the 
Responsible Business section on page 69. 

In November, the Board received an  
update on the UK apprenticeship scheme. 
Since 2017, 617 apprentices have obtained  
an apprenticeship qualification through  
our programmes. Further details on our 
apprenticeship scheme can be found on  
page 69. 

The Board received recommendations  
from the Nomination Committee on  
the appointment or reappointment of 
Non-Executive Directors during 2023, 
including the appointment of Sally Johnson 
as a Non-Executive Director, as set out on 
page 127. 

The Board reviews its effectiveness 
annually and in 2023 work was undertaken 
to progress the actions identified from the 
previous internal review in 2022, with the 
status being considered at the Board 
meeting in June. The 2023 review was 
externally facilitated by Chris Saul of 
Christopher Saul Associates, with the 
findings discussed at the Board meeting  
in December 2023 and the actions arising 
from that review agreed at the February 
2024 meeting. Read more on pages 112 
and 113. 

Governance procedures and practices are 
closely monitored by the Board, which also 
has oversight of forthcoming governance 
developments or regulatory changes, 
supported by biannual briefings from the 
Company Secretary. In 2023, the Board 
spent time considering the proposed 
changes to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the requirements introduced by  
the Economic Crime and Corporate 
Transparency Act, and the additional 
reporting requirements outlined in the  
draft Companies (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) Regulations prior to its 
withdrawal in October 2023. Other updates 
provided to the Board related to climate 
reporting, the Listing Rules and SEC rules. 

In December, the Board noted the revision 
of various key Group policies, including the 
Group Authority Schedule, and approved 
an updated schedule of governance 
procedures and practices and the 
Committees’ terms of reference.

North America site visit

In June 2023, the Board travelled to Chicago to hold a Board meeting and strategic 
sessions with the North America leadership team. The visit allowed the Board to review 
the Group’s strategic performance and outlook in the region, including the progress 
made with the integration of the Terminix business. The meetings, which were held  
over three days, included an overview of the North American pest control market, an 
in-depth review of the key focus areas for the combined Rentokil Terminix business, a 
review of the technology systems within the business, an update on the progress made 
with our Employer of Choice agenda, and an overview of the customer experience. 

The Board also visited Wrigley Field, the home of the Chicago Cubs, a Major League 
Baseball team, for a demonstration of the pest control services provided there by 
Rentokil, and took a tour of our Des Plaines Facility, which houses our Ambius, Target 
Specialty Products and Pest Control businesses, where the Board had the opportunity 
to meet with colleagues from these businesses. 

The Board receives updates on current M&A 
activity from the Chief Executive as part of  
his report to the Board at each scheduled 
meeting. Regular updates are also included  
on the status of the M&A pipeline. 

In 2023, the Group acquired 41 businesses. 
When a transaction is of a significant size or 
involves the Group entering a new territory or 
business line, the business case is reviewed 
and approved by the Board. During 2023,  
the Board approved two acquisitions, further 
details of which can be found on page 111. 

Twice a year, the Board undertakes a 
post-investment review of acquisitions in 
aggregate to evaluate the performance of  
the total investment in acquisitions which 
completed in the prior 12–30 months, 
including the delivery against business  
cases and execution of integration plans. 
These continue to indicate ongoing rigour and 
aggregate performance of the M&A strategy 
against investment criteria and key metrics.

The Board monitors its competitors on an 
ongoing basis through the Chief Executive’s 
report and Investor Relations update, with a 
specific discussion on our competitors also 
taking place as part of the Board’s annual 
strategy day.

Financial management 

Risk monitoring and oversight

At each meeting, the Chief Financial  
Officer updates the Board on the financial 
performance of the Group. The Board  
reviews the reporting of the Group’s  
financial performance, and approves  
the financial results and associated  
regulatory announcements. 

The Board assessed the viability of the Group 
over the next three-year period, the potential 
impact of the principal risks, and stress-tested 
financial forecasts for severe but plausible 
scenarios. The Board approved the viability 
statement (refer to page 94) and going 
concern statement. 

Having considered the Group’s dividend 
policy and the financial performance of  
the Group, the Board approved an interim 
dividend for 2023 of 2.75p per share and is 
recommending a final dividend for 2023 of 
5.93p per share. This equates to a full-year 
dividend of 8.68p per share, an increase of 
15.0% compared with 2022.

The Board reviews the Group’s capital 
structure, including financing needs and 
funding, as well as capital allocation 
throughout the year. In July, the Board 
approved the issuance of 2.5m ordinary 
shares to satisfy the 2020 Performance  
Share Plan awards which vested in 2023. 
Further information on the Company’s capital 
structure can be found on pages 242 and 243. 

The Board reviews the Group’s annual 
operating plan each year, with a draft 
considered in December and the final plan 
approved early in the following year. 

The Board also reviews the Company’s 
treasury policy and tax strategy annually.  
The treasury policy is designed to ensure  
that the Group has sufficient liquidity and 
manages financial risk as outlined in Note C1 
to the Financial Statements on pages 203  
and 204. The tax strategy is aligned to our 
wider business strategy, in the belief that  
this approach creates a responsible and 
sustainable tax strategy that will strengthen 
long-term shareholder value. The current tax 
strategy, which was approved in December 
2023, is available on the Company’s website.

Risk management and internal controls 
effectiveness are considered by the Board 
throughout the year as part of its review of 
business strategy and performance, and in  
its regular engagement and consultations  
with executive management. The Audit 
Committee and senior management also 
update the Board and give it assurance that 
risks are being identified, effectively managed  
and mitigated.

The Board reviewed the Speak Up process and 
reports received in 2023, and considered any 
thematic issues identified (refer to page 124).

The Board undertook a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
and internal controls systems and found  
them to be effective, notwithstanding the 
material weakness identified under the SOX 
requirements. Further details can be found  
in the Audit Committee report on pages 117  
to 124. 

The Board also receives quarterly summaries 
of ongoing material litigation and claims  
within the Group, including updates on  
termite damage claims by customers in North 
America and ongoing actions to manage this 
risk, and an annual briefing on IT security  
(see page 116). 

Exploring the potential use of technological 
advancements for the Group

In November 2023, as part of the annual strategy day sessions, the 
Board received an overview of key external forces that may impact 
the business in the future from Kearney, an external consultancy firm. 
The presentation detailed the evolution of technology, data and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), and provided the Board with insight as to the 
potential implications of technological advancements for the Group. 

The Board also received an update from the Chief Information Officer 
on the Group’s AI journey, including the identification of potential 
risks and opportunities, and the development of an AI strategy 
and roadmap. 

In addition, the Chief Information Officer provided the Board with  
an overview of Extended Reality (XR), and what was possible with  
the Metaverse and XR in business. XR is the collective reference for 
virtual reality, augmented reality and a combination of the two (mixed 
reality). The discussion included an exploration of the potential use 
cases for the Group, such as virtual and mixed reality training. 

The Board also attended live system demonstrations from our IT team, 
on ServiceTrak Trusted Advisor, Genesys Unified Comms, and the 
Data Command Centre, providing them with the opportunity to 
experience the Group’s technology in action.

Principal decisions of the Board
We consider the principal decisions of the 
Board to be those direct decisions taken, 
rather than delegated to management or a 
Committee of the Board (unless considered 
and approved in principle by the whole  
Board first), and which may have a potentially 
material impact on the Company’s strategy,  
a stakeholder group or the long-term value 
creation of the Company. 

We group the Board’s principal decisions  
into nine categories: financial results; capital 
allocation; funding; strategy (including ESG 
strategy); M&A activity; supplier and customer 
contracts; Board changes; Company 
statements; and other matters reserved to the 
Board. Within these categories, some matters 
are considered less material or strategically 
significant. These business as usual matters, 
include items such as the Committee’s terms 
of reference and the issue of new shares to 
satisfy our executive share plans.

Building on the strengths 
of our businesses
The Board approves acquisitions above a set 
threshold, as set out in the Group Authority 
Schedule. During 2023, one such example of 
this was the acquisition of Action Pest Control, 
a residential and commercial business located 
in the Midwestern United States. 

Promoting the highest 
standards of ethical behaviour
In February 2023, the Board received a 
comprehensive update on modern slavery, 
including the principal risk areas for the  
Group, and the initiatives in place to mitigate 
the risks. The Board also considered the 
Company’s Modern Slavery Statement for 
2022 for approval.

An overview of the Board’s activities during 
2023 can be found on pages 108 to 110.  
This contains details of the significant 
decisions made during the year. In addition, 
examples are provided below to illustrate how 
the Directors have had regard to the matters 
set out in section 172(1)(a)–(f) of the Companies 
Act 2006 when making principal decisions  
in 2023 (these include consideration given  
to key stakeholders, including employees, 
communities and commercial counterparties 
but are set out in full in the key opposite). 
Relevant Board papers for deliberation or 
decision by the Board are drafted to include 
an appendix clearly setting out the potential 
impact on stakeholder groups to aid the 
Board’s consideration.

The section 172(1) statement can be found on 
page 83, with further details of the Board’s 
engagement with stakeholders during the 
year provided on pages 114 and 115.

Long-term results
The Board determined that the acquisition further supported our residential and commercial 
pest control capabilities in North America, with additional scale and density in the Midwest. 
The acquisition also provided further technical capability to our commercial work in  
the Midwest. 

Colleagues
The employees of the acquired business would benefit from the Group’s technical and sales 
training and tools, and the opportunity for an enhanced career path. It was also agreed that 
the integration of the business into the Group would be phased, in recognition of the existing 
impact to colleagues from the ongoing integration of Terminix. 

Our business relationships
The Board considered that the acquisition would allow us to offer new and existing 
customers a wider range of products and services. 

Fairness between our shareholders
The acquisition aligned with our strategy to identify opportunities for broader-based growth, 
and with our strong track record of successful M&A integration, will benefit shareholders by 
contributing towards a long-term return on their investment in the Company. 

Outcome
The Board approved the acquisition, with the purchase of Action Pest Control concluding in 
June 2023. 

Colleagues
The Modern Slavery Statement highlights how the Company mandates the highest 
employment standards for our colleagues in all countries of operation, as outlined in our 
Code of Conduct, which emphasises our determination to embed our values of Service, 
Relationships, Teamwork and Responsibility across the Group.

Our business relationships
The Board deliberated on the risk assessments of suppliers, and their adherence to the 
Group’s Supplier Code, which is aligned to our Code of Conduct, including the potential 
outcomes of non-compliance by any supplier. The Board also considered the approach 
taken to customer compliance. 

Communities and the environment
The Modern Slavery Statement highlights the Board’s recognition of its responsibility to 
manage our business and supply chains to identify and alleviate any potential or actual 
human rights violations. 

Our reputation
The Modern Slavery Statement supports our commitment to maintain the highest standard 
of ethical behaviour and governance compliance, and the Board considered the actions 
being taken to raise awareness of and to mitigate the potential for modern slavery. 

Outcome
The Board approved the Modern Slavery Statement for 2022. The Board considers the 
Modern Slavery Statement on an annual basis, and our statement for 2023 was approved  
in February 2024. Our Modern Slavery Statement is available on our website.

Board evaluation
In line with best practice, the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors are comprehensively assessed 
annually through a formal evaluation. In accordance with provision 21 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have adopted a three-year cycle 
of external Board evaluations. 

The 2022 Board evaluation was internally facilitated, with the outcomes informing elements of the Board’s work. An update on the status of 
recommendations resulting from the 2022 review is provided below. 

Following two years of internal reviews, in 2023 an external evaluation was undertaken, conducted by Chris Saul from Christopher Saul Associates, 
an independent advisory firm. Chris Saul has no other connection with the Company or individual Directors. Chris Saul has previously facilitated the 
Company’s Board review in 2020. The process, outcomes and follow-up actions are described in more detail below. 

2022 evaluation recommendations and progress made during 2023

Monitor Terminix 
integration

An update on the Terminix integration was provided to the Board at each meeting in 2023 with additional in-depth 
sessions and an overseas visit held to supplement this. The Board also received briefings on compliance obligations 
and changes to regulation in the US throughout the year.

Stakeholder 
considerations 
and Non-Executive 
Director engagement

Customer focus was enhanced in regional presentations and engagement opportunities were considered when 
drafting Board agendas. Additional opportunities were introduced in the year to allow the Board to meet with colleagues, 
including special lunches and site visits. More information on Board engagement with stakeholders can be found on 
pages 114 and 115.

Enhance competitor 
oversight

The information flow on competitors to the Board was considered when drafting agendas, with specific discussions held 
as part of the Board’s annual strategy day and Investor Relations update.

Review of Board papers  Guidelines were developed and communicated to those responsible for producing papers for the Board and the Board 
Committees, alongside updated templates. Individual reviews of some papers were undertaken to streamline them or 
ensure clarity of purpose by the Company Secretary.

Findings 
Following his evaluation, 
Chris Saul produced a 
detailed report, which 
was discussed with  
the Chairman and the 
Company Secretary. 

He attended the 
December Board 
meeting to present  
his findings and 
recommendations  
for discussion. 

Action plan 
Following the meeting, 
the Chairman, Chief 
Executive and the 
Company Secretary 
reviewed the outcome 
of the Board discussion. 
Proposed actions for 
2024 were presented 
at the Board meeting 
in February 2024 for 
discussion and 
agreement. 

Selection
Chris Saul of Christopher 
Saul Associates was 
selected to conduct the 
evaluation, given the 
successful and robust 
process and outcome  
of the previous review  
he facilitated in 2020. 
The appointment of  
Chris Saul was approved 
by the Board in  
February 2023. 

Planning 
The Chairman and the 
Company Secretary  
met with Chris Saul in 
advance to agree the 
objectives and scope of 
the evaluation, including 
the areas of focus. 

Insight
Chris Saul held a  
series of detailed, 
in-depth one-to-one 
conversations with the 
Board, key executives, 
and representatives of 
key external advisors. 

He reviewed relevant 
background materials, 
including Board and 
Committee papers,  
and other relevant 
information, to enable 
him to undertake a 
thorough review of  
the Board and its 
committees.

The interviews focused 
on certain key areas, 
including Board 
dynamics and meetings, 
the agendas and papers, 
and the Terminix 
acquisition. Another  
key theme was the 
engagement with  
certain key business 
areas, including  
strategy, performance, 
competitors and risk. 
Discussions were also 
held on areas for focus 
over the next 12 months.

He attended one 
meeting of the Board and 
each of its committees, 
and part of the Board’s 
annual strategy day, in 
order to gather insight 
into the Board’s 
dynamics, culture, 
leadership and individual 
Director contribution.

Findings and actions for 2024
The findings of the Board evaluation were positive, with the external evaluator finding the Board to be collegiate and well-led, operating to  
high standards of professionalism, and benefiting from quality support from the executive team. The evaluation concluded that the Board was 
operating effectively. The review set out some recommendations which may add to the efficiency and impact of the Board and its Committees. 
Following consideration of these, the Board has approved the following actions for 2024.

2023 evaluation recommendations

Actions to be taken during 2024

To consider and develop the 
balance of Board agendas 
in 2024 in order to facilitate 
additional focus on key or 
emerging areas linked to the 
execution of strategy.

To review the skill set of the 
current Non-Executive Directors 
to assist the Nomination 
Committee with its future 
succession planning for  
Non-Executive Directors.

To retain focus on the 
enhancement of Board papers 
and to ensure the frequency  
and timings of meetings 
remains appropriate.

To consider opportunities 
for enhanced stakeholder 
engagement.

• To continue the Board’s focus on the North America business through regular deep dives and overseas visits.
• Ongoing development of the Board’s annual planner to ensure sufficient focus on topics of emerging 

prominence or interest, such as AI. 

•  To review current standing agenda items to ensure that all areas of material risk are adequately addressed 

throughout the Board year. 

• To undertake a Non-Executive Director skills matrix assessment to identify any gaps between the competencies 
required to achieve the Company’s strategic goals and the skills and experience of the current Non-Executive 
Directors. 

•  To develop in addition a plan to address any knowledge or skills gaps identified, including the inclusion of 

specific deep dive sessions with management or the use of external experts in the 2024 agenda. 

• To undertake a review of the implementation of the Board and Committee guidance rolled out in 2023 to ensure 

ongoing effectiveness. 

•  To consider the length and locations of meetings, given the increased scale and complexity of the business.

• To consider any additional opportunities for colleague engagement in the Board calendar.
• To review if the Board’s current engagement approach to customers remains appropriate. 

Board Committee evaluation 
The effectiveness of Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees were considered as part of Chris Saul’s evaluation (which involved him 
undertaking interviews and attending committee meetings as described overleaf). The review set out findings and recommendations for each 
committee. These formed part of the Board discussion held in December 2023 and then each committee considered the findings and agreed the 
action plan for 2024 at their meetings in February 2024. 

The evaluation process assessed the effective performance of the Board Committees and concluded that they operate effectively and are 
well-integrated into Board decision-making processes. Further details are set out in each Committee report on pages 124, 126 and 138. 

Director evaluation 
In previous years when the Board evaluation has been undertaken internally, each Non-Executive Director has completed a self-evaluation 
questionnaire. This year the performance of all Directors was considered as part of the external review process, with Chris Saul meeting  
with each Director separately. The performance of the Chairman was also considered as part of the external evaluation process. 

The review set out key findings on Board culture, the mix of skills on the Board and the Chairman. In addition, the Chairman continued his usual 
practice of meeting with individual Directors throughout the year. 

Executive Directors are subject to regular review and the Chief Executive appraised the performance of the Chief Financial Officer as part of the 
annual Group-wide performance evaluation of all colleagues. The Chairman evaluates the performance of the Chief Executive as part of the same 
process. Executive Director performance is also reviewed by the Remuneration Committee as part of its deliberations on bonus payments. 

The Nomination Committee takes the outcome of these evaluation processes into account each year in order to inform the Nomination Committee’s 
recommendation for Board members to be put forward for re-election by shareholders. All Directors were deemed to be effective members of the 
Board and are recommended for re-election at the Company’s AGM.

Direct Board engagement
The Board aims to engage with a broad range 
of the senior management team, whether this 
is by joining senior management meetings, 
colleague events or by colleagues attending 
and presenting to the Board at its meetings.

Wherever possible, the Board seeks to 
continue this engagement outside of the 
boardroom via informal events such as 
lunches or dinners. For instance, in June,  
the Board had dinner with the North America 
management team, and in November, the 
Board had lunch with members of the IT team 
and colleagues who have progressed through 
our apprenticeship scheme, to allow the 
opportunity for further discussion following 
a presentation on the scheme to the Board. 
Directors also have the opportunity to hold 
individual meetings with colleagues.

The opportunity for Director engagement with 
other colleagues is primarily via visits to local 
Rentokil Initial operations, attending town hall 
sessions, undertaking site visits or going on 
‘ride-alongs’ with technicians.

The outcome from any engagement,  
as well as any feedback that has been 
received, is shared at Board meetings  
where appropriate.

Information is shared from the Board to 
colleagues via established methods of 
colleague engagement (see page 84). 

Information flow to the Board
• Chief Executive report at each Board 
meeting includes an investor relations 
update

• Financial performance reports
• Analyst notes circulated
• Presentations on market perspectives 

by the Company’s brokers

• Capital Markets Day and feedback
• Feedback from investor meetings

Direct Board engagement
There are a number of ways the Board 
engages directly with shareholders, including 
correspondence with investors, attendance 
at the Preliminary and Interim Results 
presentations in London, meetings with the 
Chairman and Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, and the AGM.

The Chairman writes to key shareholders  
each year to offer the opportunity to engage 
with him ahead of the AGM. In March 2023,  
he wrote to our top 20 investors, representing 
c.46% of the Company’s issued share capital. 
In response to his offer, the Chairman held 
multiple meetings with investors. Topics 
covered included the integration of Terminix; 
sustainability and culture; management 
succession; and Board composition. The 
Board will have regard to the matters raised 
by investors when considering items on the 
agenda during the year. The Chairman will 
also meet with investors if requested to do 
so at other times of the year. 

In October 2023, the Remuneration 
Committee Chair wrote to investors in the top 
30 of our share register, representing c.50% of 
the Company’s issued share capital, to outline 
proposals for the new Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy to be put for shareholder approval at 
the AGM in May 2024. We also engaged with 
three of the largest proxy voting agencies. 
Full details are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 131 to 161. 
The final policy is being submitted for 
shareholder approval at the AGM in May 2024. 

The Chairman and Committee Chairs  
welcome any comments on this report and 
shareholders are invited to contact them 
via email at chairman@rentokil-initial.com. 
They will also be available to answer questions 
at the Company’s AGM.

Stakeholder engagement
We identify the key stakeholders relevant 
to the Group’s businesses or operations as 
our colleagues, shareholders, customers, 
communities and suppliers. Information on 
our key stakeholders is set out on pages 84 
and 85, including associated key issues and 
impacts, as well as how our businesses and 
management engage with these groups. We 
will continue to monitor if these groups remain 
appropriate.

The following pages provide details of how the 
Directors receive information about our key 
stakeholders, alongside some examples of 
engagement the Directors undertook in 2023. 
You can find our section 172(1) statement, 
which describes how the Board has regard to 
key stakeholders, on page 83, with examples 
of principal decisions taken in 2023 and the 
attention given to stakeholders in its 
considerations on page 111.

In assessing the Board’s engagement with the 
Group’s workforce, we believe our existing 
arrangements for workforce engagement are 
as appropriate as the proposed methods set 
out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Having regard to the size, distribution and 
scale of our businesses and our dispersed, 
global workforce, totalling approximately 
62,900 people in 90 countries, we believe 
the existing framework of local and regional 
engagement tools, which flow up to the  
Board together with supplementary individual 
Director engagement, remains effective.

Management reports to the Board regularly 
on performance measures such as colleague 
retention, Your Voice Counts (YVC) survey 
results and Glassdoor ratings. We expect each 
Non-Executive Director to engage individually 
with a range of colleagues, so they bring  
back their experiences to discuss with the 
Board. They do this by visiting technicians or 
customers, having discussions with relevant 
management teams across different regions  
or functions, adding visits to local Rentokil 
Initial operations to their other travel plans, or 
attending town hall sessions or management 
meetings. We also identify ways for individual 
Board members and the Board collectively to 
engage with target groups across the year.

The workforce engagement undertaken 
during the year allowed the Board to gain a 
deeper understanding into how individual 
businesses and functions operate, the 
approaches taken by management and 
awareness of our culture in practice.  
Feedback from engagement sessions is  
used to determine any areas for additional 
strategic focus by the Board or management.

Customers

Information flow to the Board
• Regional deep dive presentations
• Customer Voice Counts (CVC) scores
• Strategy day review – including product 

pipeline and innovation

• Material customer contracts requiring 

Board approval

• Monitoring external measures such 

as Trustpilot

Direct Board engagement
The Board has the opportunity to meet 
customers on overseas site visits and as part 
of a ‘ride-along’ with technicians. 

In 2023, Richard Solomons, while visiting our 
teams in Atlanta and Memphis, also attended 
an event with colleagues and a number of our 
strategic customers. 

Due to the highly dispersed nature of our 
customer base, in which the largest customer 
represents significantly less than 1% of 
revenue, we believe that the current level of 
engagement is appropriate, but this will be 
kept under review.

Communities

Information flow to the Board
• Safety, health and environmental updates
• Regional deep dive presentations
• Annual Report review
• Responsible Business Report review
• Updates on RI Cares (see page 71)
• The RIGHT WAY magazine, which contains 

a variety of examples of the business and our 
colleagues engaging with the community

Direct Board engagement
While communities and the environment 
continue to be a focus for the Board, no direct 
engagement took place between Directors 
and communities during 2023. Given the 
nature of our business we believe that the 
indirect engagement provided is at an 
appropriate level and no Director engagement 
is required, but this will be kept under review.

Suppliers

Information flow to the Board
The Board oversees the principal engagement 
undertaken by operational management 
(especially the central procurement and supply 
chain function, and national procurement 
managers) through:
• review and approval of our major supplier 

contracts;

• approval of our Modern Slavery Statement; 

and

• oversight of the Supplier Speak Up ethical 

reporting process.

Direct Board engagement
Given the nature of the business, we do not 
expect our Directors to have any direct 
engagement with our suppliers. They instead 
rely on the indirect engagement set out above 
and the Company’s engagement as detailed 
on page 85.

2024 Annual General Meeting
The Board takes the opportunity to  
engage with both private and institutional 
shareholders at the Company’s AGM and 
views it as an occasion to update all our 
shareholders on the performance of the 
business they own.

In order to make our AGM more accessible 
and encourage engagement from a broader 
range of shareholders, we will be holding  
a hybrid AGM in May 2024.

The 2024 AGM will be held at, and be 
broadcast via live webcast from, the 
Company’s offices at Compass House, 
Manor Royal, Crawley, West Sussex 
RH10 9PY from 11.30am on 8 May 2024.

We encourage our shareholders to  
utilise the live webcast of the meeting. 
Questions can also be submitted in  
advance of the meeting by emailing 
chairman@rentokil-initial.com. A recording  
of the meeting will be available afterwards 
on the Company’s website.

A separate Notice of Meeting, containing 
both an explanation of the items of  
special business and full details of how  
to join the meeting remotely, has been  
sent to shareholders and is available on  
our website.

Joining our technicians  
on the front line
In 2023, many of our Directors joined our 
technicians on a ‘ride-along’, with Sarosh 
Mistry, David Frear, Cathy Turner and Sally 
Johnson all taking the opportunity to join  
a ride-along with a pest control technician. 
The ride-along grants Directors direct 
exposure with our colleagues and our 
customers, while also providing them  
with a hands-on experience of the work 
undertaken by our technicians. Each 
Director shared feedback from their 
ride-along with the Board. 

Celebrating Thanksgiving 
with our colleagues 
In November, Stuart Ingall-Tombs,  
Chief Financial Officer, joined the North 
American management team, serving up 
Thanksgiving lunch to colleagues at our 
Reading, Pennsylvania, office.

Helping to raise funds 
In September, Andy Ransom, Chief 
Executive, helped colleagues in Crawley 
raise funds for Malaria No More UK, by 
being one of the many colleagues who 
participated in a 58-mile cycle challenge; 
the distance from our head office to our 
new technical centre in Waterlooville.  
The 304 miles achieved on the day 
exceeded the initial target. 

Sharing expertise among 
colleagues
In January 2023, Linda Yueh joined our 
Global HR Leadership conference to 
present on the current economic 
landscape. 

The Global HR Leadership team comprises 
more than 80 colleagues from across  
the Group, and the event was therefore 
held virtually. 

Linda shared her views on the prevailing 
economic climate and key focus areas  
for HR, including the cost of living,  
wage inflation and the impact on labour 
supply, and then answered questions  
from colleagues.

Culture and values 
Our culture is characterised as customer 
focused, driven to succeed, diverse, down  
to earth and innovative. In October 2022,  
we launched a refreshed mission, vision and 
values, following feedback from colleagues 
globally. We updated our mission to include a 
third limb of ‘preserving our planet’, and added 
a new value, ‘Responsibility’. The revised 
cultural framework underpins our vision. 

The Board’s ongoing oversight of the Group’s 
mission, vision and values ensures that our 
culture is aligned with our business goals and 
brings purpose to our colleagues. Key metrics 
have been identified to monitor our culture 
which are included in the updates that the 
Board receives twice a year on culture, 
progress on our Employer of Choice agenda, 
and workforce engagement. This year the 
reports included updates on colleague 
retention, enhancing colleague development, 
a follow-up on the outcomes of the YVC 
colleague survey undertaken in 2021 and  
a summary of the key findings from the  
2023 survey.

One of the key methods for both senior 
management and the Board to monitor culture 
is to analyse the results of the YVC colleague 
survey, which is carried out every second year. 
This includes questions mapped to each of  
the five core themes in our culture model to 
provide a score and trend for each at a Group, 
functional and regional level. There are  
12 questions in the survey to create a Core 
Culture Index. In 2023, our Core Culture Index 
was 80%, which is broadly in line with our  
2021 survey result. Full details can be found  
on page 70.

Examples of other ways that the Board 
monitors and assesses culture include:
• monitoring Sales and Service colleague 
retention rates, overall colleague rolling 
12-month retention and analysis of retention 
by region;

• monitoring, as appropriate, content and 

usage of the U+ online learning platform and 
other means of delivering training and 
development;

Policies and practices 
We have a comprehensive Group-wide 
procedure framework in place to supplement 
local policies and legislation. The cornerstone 
of this policy framework is the Code of 
Conduct. The Code of Conduct sets out a 
fundamental commitment to comply with all 
legal requirements that apply, and to operate 
with high ethical standards. It outlines 
responsibilities to colleagues, customers and 
the business, and highlights our determination 
to establish our values, and a culture of 
integrity, everywhere within the business.

Clear guidelines are provided to all  
colleagues on how to seek further advice  
or report concerns, and we also operate  
a whistleblowing (Speak Up) facility for 
colleagues or third parties. This is designed  
to allow colleagues across the Group to raise 
concerns confidentially internally and to 
disclose information which the individual 
believes highlights or would indicate  
illegality, unethical behaviour or other  
serious malpractice. 

We have a Group-wide share dealing policy 
and an insider trading policy, which govern  
the purchase, sale, and other dispositions  
of the Company’s securities by Directors, 
senior management and colleagues, that  
are designed to promote compliance with 
applicable insider trading laws, rules  
and regulations. 

Specific programmes are in place to support 
implementing the Code of Conduct and 
underlying policies, national laws and 
regulations, and monitoring and reporting 
compliance with them. This includes the use  
of e-learning training on our online learning 
and development platform, U+, and we track 
dissemination and adoption across the Group.

We review policies periodically to ensure they 
meet current best practice and legislative 
requirements, and our technical and safety 
standards and practices often exceed local 
regulatory requirements. 

Examples of our key policies are available on 
our website.

Cyber security
The Board oversees the Group’s risk 
management and internal control framework, 
including consideration of the risks posed from 
cyber security threats. Management provides 
an in-depth annual update to the Board on the 
Group’s IT security arrangements, including 
details of our cyber security operations and 
performance, and the status of this risk. 

To protect the Group from potential cyber 
security threats, we have employed 
complementary processes for assessing, 
identifying, and managing the risk, with our 
information systems being protected by a 
multi-layered set of technology and processes 
(implemented and monitored by cyber security 
professionals), and consistent with the US 
National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).  
This is periodically assessed via recurring 
independent third-party assessments, internal 
audits, and penetration testing. The Group has 
also adopted cyber security incident response 
plans, to ensure the appropriate escalation  
of potential threats in a timely manner, and  
we use our e-learning platform for cyber 
security training, along with regular phishing 
simulations, to assess the effectiveness of  
our training and to test user awareness  
of current threats. The Group has not 
experienced previous cyber security  
incidents that have materially impacted  
the business or business strategy.

In addition to the annual presentation to the 
Board, the outputs of these security activities 
are summarised and reviewed by the Group 
Risk Committee and discussed at the IT 
leadership team meetings. The Audit 
Committee would also be notified of any 
control incidents. Third-party partners are 
subject to appropriate controls as specified  
on Rentokil Initial third-party risk management 
processes, procurement processes, and 
enforced via service agreement and contract 
terms and conditions. 

Management reviews cyber security risks 
through updates received from the Group 
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO),  
IT Risk Committee and Internal Audit.  
These updates include details of the actions 
being taken to prevent, detect, mitigate  
and remediate the risk of cyber security 
threats. Management also considers 
recommendations from the Group CISO, 
including any corrective actions required to 
address exposed risk to information systems 
from cyber security threats. 

The Group’s CISO has over 20 years of 
cumulative cyber security expertise, across 
a range of diverse industries, and leads our 
Information Security team. The Information 
Security team is supported by an external  
third party that provides uninterrupted  
security monitoring.

Dear Shareholder
It is with pleasure that I present the report  
of the Audit Committee for the financial  
year ended 31 December 2023. The report, 
which is my first report since being appointed 
Chair of the Audit Committee in May 2023, 
sets out how we have discharged our duties  
in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the key activities 
during the year.

Julie Southern stepped down as Audit 
Committee Chair in May 2023 and I would  
like to offer my thanks on behalf of the Audit 
Committee for her contribution over the last 
nine years. 

During the early part of 2023, a key focus for 
the Audit Committee was the consideration  
of the financial information and audit-related 
disclosures for the 2022 Annual Report.  
An additional meeting was held in March 
2023, to ensure adequate review time was 
given to support acquisition accounting and 
related judgements. 

The Audit Committee reviewed any further 
opening balance sheet adjustments at the July 
2023 meeting, where we also considered the 
interim financial reporting, and in December 
2023, we reviewed the accounting of the 
termite provision ahead of the 2023 financial 
year end. 

Throughout 2023, the Audit Committee has 
closely monitored the Group’s journey to 
Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance following 
our successful listing on the New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE). We have had regular and 
comprehensive updates from management 
on the SOX implementation programme, 
which the Group commenced in 2022.  
The attestation for 2023 full-year reporting 
was finalised in early 2024. While progress  
has been made in relation to our previously 
identified material weaknesses relating to 
IT general controls, it has not been fully 
remediated and will remain a key focus 
for 2024. 

PwC was reappointed as our external auditor 
at our AGM in May 2023. In 2023, the Audit 
Committee has continued its focus on the 
oversight of the quality of the external  
audit, including the advancement of audit 
technology to deliver on our 2023 audit 
strategy. We have also completed the annual 
audit quality review, and identified with  
PwC a series of actions that we can take to 
improve the audit process. Overall, the Audit 
Committee concluded that the external auditor 
and the audit process was effective. 

The Internal Audit team continues to utilise  
a hybrid model, with some elements of  
audits completed remotely and some on-site. 
This approach continues to deliver an effective 
audit programme. The Terminix Internal  
Audit team has been fully integrated into  
the Rentokil Initial Internal Audit team, and 
process, scope and reporting are aligned 
across the businesses. 

Regular updates on the control environment 
are received from Internal Audit, giving the 
Audit Committee the opportunity to review 
any control incidents at each meeting. It is 
worth noting that the number of incidents 
remains relatively low, with a small increase  
in the level of reporting via our internal 
whistleblowing process, Speak Up.

Fraudulent activity across the Group  
remains at a low level in 2023, with 14 cases 
recorded; the same as in 2022. Following full 
investigation of these incidents, processes 
have been updated and further training 
provided where necessary. These incidents 
were not material to the Group’s reporting. 

The Audit Committee continues to play a 
crucial role in providing all our stakeholders 
with the assurance of not only robust financial 
reporting, but also assurance over the 
thematic areas of risk and operational 
resilience. In line with our commitment to 
manage climate change risk, we have been 
engaged in assessing and monitoring this  
risk on an ongoing basis and as part of the 
year-end audit report, and its disclosure in  
the 2023 Financial Statements.

During the year the Audit Committee has  
been briefed on the proposed changes to  
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
requirements to be introduced by the 
Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency 
Act and the FRC’s Audit Committees and  
the External Audit: Minimum Standard (the 
Minimum Standard). The Audit Committee  
also considered the additional reporting 
requirements outlined in the draft Companies 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations prior to its withdrawal in  
October 2023. 

Full details of the Audit Committee’s work 
during 2023 can be found set out in the 
following report.

Purpose and role of the 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee assists the Board in  
its oversight and monitoring of financial 
reporting, risk management and internal 
controls. The Audit Committee’s focus is to 
review and challenge in these areas both 
management, internal audit and the external 
auditors. This includes the undertaking of  
at least an annual review of effectiveness of 
the Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems. The Audit Committee also 
oversees the relationship with the external 
auditors, including their appointment, and  
the assessment of their independence  
and effectiveness. 

The full responsibilities of the Audit Committee 
are set out in its terms of reference, which 
were last reviewed in December 2023. As part 
of the review, the terms of reference were 
updated to reflect the requirements outlined  
in the Minimum Standard. The updated Audit 
Committee terms of reference are available  
on our website. 

Membership and attendance
All Audit Committee members are 
independent Non-Executive Directors.  
Sally Johnson, Chair of the Audit Committee,  
is a Chartered Accountant and in February 
2024, the Board determined that the Audit 
Committee met the UK and US composition 
requirements by virtue of Sally having recent 
and relevant financial experience for the 
purpose of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, having competence in accounting and/
or auditing for the purpose of the Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules, and being 
a financial expert for the purposes of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. John Pettigrew has 
extensive commercial and operational 
experience in overseeing the financial affairs 
of substantial business undertakings and 
Linda Yueh has a strong economic and 
academic background with considerable 
experience gained in advisory roles. The  
Audit Committee as a whole is, therefore, 
considered to have competence relevant to 
the sectors in which the Company operates. 
Full biographical details of the members of the 
Audit Committee can be found on pages 100 
to 102. 

The Audit Committee met six times during the 
year, with all members attending all meetings. 
Full details of the attendance of the members 
during 2023 can be found on page 98. 

Meetings of the Audit Committee are attended 
by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief 
Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Director of Internal Audit & Risk, the Interim Head 
of Internal Audit & Risk, the Group Financial 
Controller, the Group General Counsel, the 
Company Secretary (who acts as secretary to 
the Audit Committee), and the external auditor. 

The Audit Committee meets at least once per 
year separately with the Company’s auditor 
and the Director of Internal Audit & Risk, 
without executive management present. 
In 2023, these meetings took place in 
February and December. The Chair of the 
Audit Committee also meets periodically 
with the external auditor and other relevant 
stakeholders. The Chair of the Audit 
Committee reports to the Board on the activity 
of the Audit Committee and any matters of 
particular relevance in the conduct of its work. 
The Audit Committee did not find it necessary 
to seek external advice during the year,  
other than through its usual dialogue with  
the external auditor.

Financial reporting
The Annual Report should provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance and prospects and, 
as a whole, should be fair, balanced and understandable. The Audit Committee considered closely the judgements and decisions taken by the 
management team in the preparation of the Financial Statements. The Committee reviewed and recommended approval of the half- and full-year 
financial statements during the year. Following the listing of our American Depository Shares in October 2022, the Company is also required to file a 
US annual report (Form 20-F), which the Audit Committee reviewed as part of its year-end process. The sections below set out the significant issues 
and judgements that were applied in preparing the 2023 Annual Report, as well as providing additional details on other financial reporting matters 
considered during the year.

Significant issues and judgements
The Audit Committee has reviewed the following significant financial reporting issues and judgements made during the preparation of the Financial 
Statements with management and the auditor. The significant areas of focus considered and actions taken are set out below. These issues have 
been discussed and reviewed by the Audit Committee during 2023 and early 2024, notably at the review of the interim results, at the review and 
agreement of the audit plan for 2023 and as part of the year-end review and approval process. Please see the section on assumptions and 
estimation uncertainties in General accounting policies on pages 176 and 177 for further disclosure on estimates and accounting judgements.

Significant matter

Acquisition accounting

Action taken

The Group makes a large number of acquisitions each year, many of 
which require the valuation of acquired intangible assets, including 
brands, customer lists and goodwill. The calculations for valuing these 
assets on acquisition are subject to judgement and estimation about 
the future performance of the acquired business, such as forecast 
customer termination rates, discount rates and growth rates. At the 
balance sheet date, recognition of acquired assets and liabilities is 
often provisional, although measurement period adjustments made 
in the following year are generally immaterial. Judgement is often 
required to determine whether required adjustments relate to the 
period pre- or post-acquisition.

Climate change

At the year end, management provided the Audit Committee with 
a summary of M&A activity in the preceding year, including details 
of new acquisitions, as well as updates to provisional accounting. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the accounting treatment of certain 
aspects of significant acquisitions, including determination of the 
consideration paid, the identification and valuation of acquired 
intangible assets and a review of provisional opening balance  
sheets. For further details, please refer to pages 195 and 196 in  
the Financial Statements.

The Group operates across many markets around the world and  
is impacted by physical events caused by climate change and  
also contributes to climate change through its carbon emissions.  
The Group has a net zero target for 2040 (see page 80) and this  
plan requires operational changes in how we service our customers 
and deal with the effects of climate change.

As part of its discussion of the audit strategy for 2023, the Audit 
Committee considered climate change risks as part of the review of 
Group risks and the Audit Committee received an update from the 
Chief Financial Officer and the Group Financial Controller outlining 
the accounting considerations and climate change reporting in the 
Company’s Financial Statements in February 2024.

Goodwill impairment review

The Group carries material balances for goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets, and due to the acquisition programme makes 
material additions to these balances each year. The recoverable 
amount of these assets is determined based on the higher of value-
in-use calculations, using cash flow projections, and fair value less 
costs to sell. Annual impairment tests are primarily based on value-
in-use calculations which require significant judgements in relation to 
the inputs used, including forecast growth rates and discount rates. 
Management is required to perform annual tests for impairment on 
indefinite-lived intangible assets and on other acquired intangible 
assets when there are indicators of impairment.

Management reviewed all impairment tests for goodwill balances 
over £5m using a centrally provided model. The intangible assets 
were grouped into cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of 
assessing recoverable amounts, using cash flows based on the most 
recent strategic plans, as amended for any significant changes since 
their preparation. Cash flows were discounted using the internally 
calculated country and category-specific discount rates. The Audit 
Committee received a summary of the results of the review and, 
although the total value of intangible assets is significant, was satisfied 
that the outcome of the impairment review was adequately disclosed 
in Note B2 Intangible assets.

Legacy termite damage claims provisioning

As part of the acquisition of Terminix in October 2022, we recognised 
a significant provision for future termite damage claims whose liability 
existed at the acquisition date. Termite damage claims include 
judgements on the quantum, timing and severity of claims over a  
multi-year period.

The judgements here should be read in line with the section above  
on acquisition accounting.

Management gathered the historical data, contract data and other 
supporting data to provide the basis for forward-looking judgements. 
The Group has also hired external professional advisors to support 
modelling and analysis and to help management with meeting the 
requirements of SOX. On the termite damage claims, it may take many 
years before we fully understand the outcomes and we have provided 
sensitivity analysis on pages 185 and 186 to help understand the 
estimation and judgement involved. We will be maintaining external 
valuation support on an ongoing basis to validate the provisioning.

The Audit Committee considered the outcomes of the 2023 review. 
This has been reported as updates to acquisition values and through 
the results for the period as applicable.

Other financial reporting 
matters
Going concern and viability statements
At its meeting in February 2024, the Audit 
Committee considered the Group’s ability  
to continue as a going concern, taking into 
account budgets, borrowing facilities, timing of 
cash flows, and financial and operational risk 
management before recommending to the 
Board that it adopt the going concern basis of 
preparation for the 2023 Financial Statements. 
At the same meeting, the Audit Committee 
also considered the longer-term viability of  
the Company, reviewing the analysis from 
management to support the viability statement 
in the 2023 Annual Report. Both going 
concern and viability modelled forecasts of 
future cash flows included stress-testing 
scenarios and an analysis of other risks that 
could impact the viability of the business over 
a one-year and three-year period (2024 to 
2026) respectively and how they could be 
mitigated. The going concern statement for 
2023 can be found on page 244, and the 
viability statement for 2023 can be found on 
page 94.

Fair, balanced and understandable reporting
During 2023, the Audit Committee undertook 
a review of the 2022 Annual Report ahead of 
its publication to consider whether it was fair, 
balanced and understandable as required by 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. A similar 
process was repeated for the 2023 Annual 
Report at the Audit Committee meeting in 
February 2024. The Audit Committee received 
a report from management summarising the 
process undertaken, which covered, but was 
not limited to, the following:
• The Chairman and Chief Executive provide 

input and agree on key elements to be 
included, which set the tone and balance  
of the Strategic Report.

• All contributors to the Annual Report are 

made aware of the requirement for content 
to be fair, balanced and understandable.

• Regular review meetings are held with 

appropriate senior management to ensure 
consistency of the whole document.

• An extensive review and verification  

process is undertaken by the appropriate 
departments and senior managers, using 
verification software to test and track the 
accuracy of the content.

• Additional independent internal reviews  
are undertaken to enable any perceived  
lack of clarity, balance or understanding  
in the Annual Report to be identified  
and addressed.

The Audit Committee was satisfied that the 
Annual Report provided a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s 
position and prospects. The Board’s statement 
on fair, balanced and understandable in 
relation to the 2023 Annual Report can be 
found on page 245.

Correspondence with regulatory bodies
The Company received no specific 
correspondence from the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) in the period. The areas 
identified in the FRC’s ‘Key matters for 
2023/24 reports and accounts’ publication 
were reviewed. However, no specific changes 
were required to the Company’s accounts as  
a result.

External audit plan and strategy
At its meeting in May 2023, the Audit 
Committee received a presentation from  
PwC on key technology initiatives. The Audit 
Committee also discussed the plan for 
adopting new technologies in the Group  
audit in 2023, including supporting the 
Group’s transition to SOX compliance  
through technology.

In December 2023, the Company received a 
letter from the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the SEC) following its review of 
the Company’s Form 20-F for the year ended 
31 December 2022. The letter contained 
questions, among other things, on the 
presentation of non-GAAP measures in the 
Financial Statement footnotes and the 
calculation and presentation of Organic 
Revenue Growth. Following a review of the 
points raised, the Company refiled its 2022 
Form 20-F in February 2024.

No statutory financial numbers (including  
Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet, 
Statements of Changes in Entity, Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flow or footnotes to the 
accounts) were changed as a result of the 
revised Form 20-F. The revision was made in 
order to comply with SEC rules following an 
administrative error where some exhibits were 
not dated and to make some presentational 
disclosure changes, including relocating or 
deleting some non-IFRS measures as required 
under SEC rules.

External audit
External auditor
The external auditor is appointed to give an 
opinion on the Group and Company Financial 
Statements. The audit includes the review and 
testing of the data contained in the Financial 
Statements to the extent and materiality level 
necessary, for expressing an audit opinion  
as to whether they present a true and fair  
view of the Group and Company affairs as  
at 31 December 2023.

PwC has been the Group’s external auditor 
since May 2021. They were reappointed by 
shareholders at the 2023 AGM to continue  
to serve as the Group’s external auditor. 

Neil Grimes is the Lead Audit Partner. He has 
been in post since PwC was appointed and 
will be required to rotate after five years.  
The external auditor attends all meetings of 
the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee 
met twice with PwC without executive 
management present and met with the Audit 
Committee Chair independently four times  
in 2023.

In 2023, the main engagement between the 
external auditor and the Audit Committee  
has been in relation to audit strategy, the  
audit and publication of annual and periodic 
financial statements, the auditor’s scope and 
priorities and its approach to key judgement 
areas. PwC has also been extensively  
involved in discussions regarding our SOX 
implementation programme and the testing  
of our internal controls.

In July, PwC presented the 2023 external  
audit plan, which summarised the key  
aspects of their audit planning, including the 
external auditor’s assessment of Group audit 
materiality, audit risks and scope, and the 
overall approach to the audit of the Company 
and its subsidiaries. The audit approach for 
2023 had been updated to reflect the 
completion of the Terminix acquisition in 2022, 
and the first year of the Group’s implementation 
of SOX. The plan was discussed and approved 
by the Audit Committee.

At the December meeting, the Audit 
Committee discussed with the auditors the 
status of their work, focusing in particular  
on internal controls and the status of their  
SOX testing. The results of the controls testing 
for SOX reporting purposes was considered 
by the Audit Committee in February 2024,  
as detailed on page 124.

External auditor and audit process 
effectiveness
The effectiveness of the external auditor is 
monitored throughout the year, including 
through:
• FRC’s Audit Quality Inspection and 

Supervision report 2022/23: The Audit 
Committee reviewed the results of the  
report during the year, noting that PwC  
was found to have maintained its focus on 
audit quality and had achieved consistent 
inspection results.

• Progress against external audit plan and 
strategy: The Audit Committee continually 
evaluated and monitored progress against 
the agreed plan, and discussed any issues 
or reasons for variation from the plan.

• Reports to, and interaction with, the Audit 
Committee: At each meeting, the Audit 
Committee considers the work undertaken 
by the external auditor, their insight around 
key accounting and audit judgements, and 
the competence with which they have 
applied constructive challenge in dealing 
with management.

• Annual internal effectiveness survey: 

A tailored online questionnaire covering the 
overall audit process and the structure and 
governance of the external audit team is 
utilised annually. The questionnaire is 
completed by the Chief Financial Officer,  
the Director of Internal Audit and Risk, the 
Interim Head of Internal Audit and Risk, 
Finance Directors of the Group’s subsidiaries, 
the senior finance management team, and 
the Accounts, Tax and Treasury functions. 
The results of the survey are collated by the 
Chief Financial Officer, and a summary of the 
findings are provided to the Audit Committee 
and PwC.

continued

At the July meeting, the Chief Financial Officer 
presented the summary of the results of the 
annual effectiveness questionnaire. The Audit 
Committee noted that overall, the results were 
positive. The Audit Committee considered the 
areas of strength and opportunities identified 
from the survey. The actions arising from the 
review included the undertaking of additional 
planning with the regions, an increased focus 
on improving communication around the audit 
plan and timelines, and consideration as to 
how to gain even greater insight of business 
and controls from the audit. 

Following consideration of all elements of the 
audit effectiveness review process, including 
the results of the survey, the Audit Committee 
confirmed it was satisfied that the external 
audit process provided by PwC had been 
delivered effectively for the 2022 financial 
year. A similar process will be undertaken  
for the 2023 financial year. 

External auditor independence  
and objectivity
To safeguard the objectivity and 
independence of the auditor, the Company 
has a policy on the engagement of the 
auditor’s services on audit-related and 
non-audit services. The Audit Committee 
accepts that in some instances certain work  
of a non-audit nature is best undertaken by  
the auditor. The policy sets out the nature of 
services that are permitted and those that are 
specifically prohibited. In general, permitted 
services would be limited to matters that are 
closely related to the annual audit process or 
where detailed knowledge of the Group is 
advantageous. 

The Audit Committee regularly reviews the 
amount and nature of non-audit work 
performed by the auditor to ensure that the 
auditor’s independence is not compromised. 
Any engagement fee on permitted services  
in excess of £10,000 requires the approval  
of the Chair of the Audit Committee and  
any engagement fee in excess of £250,000 
requires the approval of the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee has pre-approved 
permitted services, as outlined in the policy, 
with fees below £10,000. A copy of the  
current policy on the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditors is available 
on our website.

Audit fees for the statutory audit for 2023  
were £8m (2022: £7m). Fees for audit-related 
assurance services and other non-audit 
services incurred during the year amounted  
to £3m (2022: £5m). The ratio of non-audit  
fees to statutory audit fees for the year was 
therefore 0.4:1 (2022: 0.7:1). The non-audit fees 
for 2023 relate to 2023 reporting on internal 
financial controls. The non-audit fees were 
substantially higher in 2022 as a result of the 
specialist accounting work performed by  
PwC in respect of the acquisition of Terminix. 
Further details on audit services can be found 
in Note A8 to the Financial Statements on 
page 186.

Annual Report 2023

The Audit Committee also received 
confirmation from PwC that it was 
independent and objective within the context 
of applicable professional standards.

The Audit Committee does not believe that 
there is any material risk of the Company’s 
auditor withdrawing from the market. 

The controls and processes in place, as 
detailed above, help to ensure that the 
required level of independence of the  
auditor is maintained. 

External auditor tender and appointment
The role of external auditor will be put out to 
tender at least every ten years and will be 
conducted by no later than 2031 in line with 
prevailing best practice. The Company 
confirms its compliance with the provisions  
of the UK Competition & Markets Authority 
Order regarding statutory audit services for 
the financial period ended 31 December 2023.

The Audit Committee concluded that  
it is satisfied with the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor, PwC, 
and that the effectiveness of the external audit 
process was robust. The Audit Committee  
has recommended to the Board that it seeks 
shareholder approval for the reappointment  
of PwC as the external auditor for the financial 
year ending 31 December 2024.

Internal audit
Role of Internal Audit
Internal Audit provides independent and 
objective assurance to management, the Audit 
Committee and the Board on the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management framework 
and internal controls.

Internal Audit, which is led by the Director  
of Internal Audit & Risk, reports to the Chief 
Financial Officer and has direct lines of 
communication with the Chair of the Audit 
Committee, the Chief Executive and the 
Chairman of the Board, as well as to all 
operational and functional leaders in  
the business.

At each meeting, an update on Internal Audit  
is provided covering an overview of the work 
undertaken in the period, actions arising from 
audits conducted, the tracking of remedial 
actions and progress against the Internal  
Audit plan, and SOX compliance. The Audit 
Committee Chair routinely meets 
independently with the Director of Internal 
Audit & Risk to discuss the results of the  
audits performed and any additional insights 
obtained on the risk management and control 
environment across the organisation.

In December, the Audit Committee also 
reviewed and approved the Internal Audit 
Charter, which defines the purpose,  
authority and responsibility of the Internal 
Audit function.

Internal Audit Plan
The 2023 Internal Audit plan was approved  
by the Audit Committee in December 2022. 
The plan is structured to align with the  
Group’s risk profile, control environment  
and assurance arrangements. The plan for 
2023 included an audit of the integration of 
Terminix, and a continued focus on IT and  
SOX testing.

The common themes arising from the Internal 
Audit work during 2023 were presented to the 
Audit Committee in December 2023, together 
with recommendations to senior management 
to improve the controls across some 
processes. None of the failures identified in 
the control environment by Internal Audit or 
any of the recommendations relating to 
individual audits represented a systemic 
underlying issue. The overall work of the 
Internal Audit function is utilised by the Audit 
Committee and the Board in their assessment 
of the adequacy of the Group’s financial and 
operational controls environment.

The 2024 Internal Audit Plan was approved  
by the Audit Committee in December 2023.  
A key focus for the 2024 plan is SOX testing, 
with the Internal Audit team supporting the 
testing cycle, and thematic audits, in order to 
give the function greater ability to respond to 
emerging risks within the business.

Internal Audit effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Internal Audit function 
was considered by the Audit Committee 
during its review and approval of the 2024 
Audit plan by means of a review of the 
resources available, qualifications of the team, 
delivery, reporting and the independence of 
the function.

The Audit Committee also ensures that an 
independent third-party assessment of the 
effectiveness and processes of the Internal 
Audit function is conducted at least once 
every five years, in line with the requirements 
of the Institute of Internal Auditors’ 
International Standards for the Professional 
Practice of Internal Auditing. The most recent 
such assessment was undertaken in 2021.

Governance and compliance
Compliance and whistleblowing 
The Audit Committee has responsibility for 
reviewing the Company’s procedures for 
handling compliance with our Code of 
Conduct and Anti-Corruption Policy, and 
confidential reporting (whistleblower) 
arrangements, known as Speak Up.

The Group’s Code of Conduct, which outlines 
our commitment to comply with all applicable 
legal requirements and with high ethical 
standards, can be found on our website.  
It clearly sets out how colleagues can seek 
advice and report concerns about suspected 
ethical or illegal misconduct policy violations. 
The Company uses an international 
confidential Speak Up email address and 
phone line to allow colleagues to report  
any suspected wrongdoing internally to 
independent senior management at  
Group level.

Risk management  
and internal control
Risk management and internal  
control framework 
The Board has overall responsibility for 
maintaining an effective risk management  
and internal control framework. The Board 
delegates responsibility for risk management 
to the Audit Committee, where appropriate. 
The risk management and internal control 
framework is designed to manage and 
mitigate risk, rather than eliminate the risk  
of failure to achieve business objectives.  
In pursuing business objectives, internal 
controls and risk management can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement  
or loss.

The Group’s risk management structure and 
process is detailed on pages 87 and 88. The 
responsibilities of the Board, some of which it 
chooses to delegate to the Audit Committee, 
include:
• review and approval of the Group’s overall 
strategy, which includes reviewing the risks 
that may prevent the Group from achieving 
its objectives and ensuring that these  
risks are mitigated or managed to an 
acceptable level;

• regular reviews of business performance, 

including updates of the risks that the 
business is facing, and challenging 
management to obtain assurance that  
these risks are being effectively managed;

• review of management’s approach to 
identifying and managing risk, and 
recommending enhancements;

• evaluation of the effectiveness of internal 
controls, including financial, operational  
and compliance controls; evaluation of the 
effectiveness of internal and external audits;

• delegation of authority to the Chief Executive 

and Chief Financial Officer to make 
commitments on behalf of the Company; and

• the evaluation of the effectiveness of our 

internal controls.

Risk and internal controls 
The identification and management of risk is 
integrated into the development of the 
Group’s strategy and the day-to-day 
operational execution of the strategy by the 
regions and business units. Ensuring that risks 
are identified and managed effectively is a 
part of every manager’s and supervisor’s job 
through leadership of the teams for which  
they are responsible. An assessment of the 
emerging and principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would affect its business 
model and future performance, is carried out 
by the Board. The principal risks identified can 
be found in the Risk and Uncertainties section 
on pages 87 to 93.

The Company has also established a separate 
Speak Up line for suppliers and their 
employees or other stakeholders to report 
genuine concerns over malpractice, illegal acts 
or failures to comply with recognised standards 
of ethical behaviour that they observe at any 
point within our global supply chain.

Reported cases are monitored by Internal 
Audit and any potential misconduct reported  
is formally investigated and appropriate action 
taken, with the results of the investigation 
being reported back to the whistleblower 
where possible. The Director of Internal Audit 
& Risk provides regular updates to the Audit 
Committee of any control incidents.

The Audit Committee also periodically reviews 
the communication process in place throughout 
the Company regarding whistleblowing and  
the use of Speak Up to ensure its effectiveness 
and to monitor our colleagues’ understanding 
of the system. A thematic review of Speak Up 
incidences and the control processes in place 
was considered by the Board in December.

The Audit Committee is informed of the 
outcome of the annual Letter of Assurance 
process whereby senior management are 
required to confirm compliance with key 
Group policies, including the Code of Conduct, 
and the dissemination of these policies to  
their respective country and functional teams. 
An overview of exceptions reported during the 
process is shared with the Audit Committee 
and any thematic issues raised are also shared 
with the Executive Leadership Team (ELT)  
as required.

Governance 
In 2023, the Audit Committee also spent time 
considering the proposed changes to the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
requirements introduced by the Economic 
Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill, the 
Minimum Standard, and the additional 
reporting requirements outlined in the draft 
Companies (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations prior to its withdrawal in 
October 2023. 

For the Economic Crime and Corporate 
Transparency Bill, the Audit Committee 
received a presentation as to the 
implementation plan for the proposed 
enhancements to fraud risk assessments. 

For the Minimum Standard, the Audit 
Committee considered an in-depth analysis of 
the requirements, and recommendations as to 
potential enhancements to Audit Committee 
processes. The Audit Committee approved  
the suggested amendments to the Audit 
Committee terms of reference, and for other 
processes to be enhanced to align with the 
Minimum Standard, including the review of the 
effectiveness of the external auditor. 

The Audit Committee report, in particular the 
External audit section of the report, describes 
how the Audit Committee has complied with 
each of the provisions of the Minimum 
Standard during the year. 

An explanation of the Group’s accounting 
policies is provided on pages 175 to 177. 

The Audit Committee receives regular  
reports from the Chief Financial Officer  
and the Director of Internal Audit & Risk on 
financial controls and process improvement 
programmes, including:
• an annual report on the overall status of the 
control environment in the Group, including 
the results of testing and reports on 
identified areas of weakness in controls;

• action plans on control environment 
improvements and updates on their 
implementation;

• updates on control weaknesses and  

planned actions to prevent a reoccurrence;

• periodic reports from regional and Group 
finance executives, and Internal Audit; and

• updates on the SOX implementation 

programme.

During 2023, the Audit Committee was 
updated on the risk and control environment 
in the main businesses, as well as the Regional 
Finance Directors’ assessment of the quality 
and priorities of the Finance function in the 
relevant part of the business. Audit Committee 
members received reports from the Regional 
Finance Directors for the UK & Sub-Saharan 
Africa region and the Pacific region, with other 
regional updates provided as part of the Board 
agenda. This provides a high-level insight for 
the Audit Committee on potential risks.

The Audit Committee continues to evaluate 
cyber incidents and risk throughout the year 
and, although there is no indication we are  
a specific target, we remain vigilant given  
both the number and seriousness of cyber 
attacks in the year, with repeated distributed 
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and 
attempted ransomware incidents. Our cyber 
technology and resilience have continued  
to allow us to detect and avert complex and 
volatile threats before they were able to  
have any material impact on our operations. 
This is an area we will continue to prioritise 
and monitor as we integrate and synchronise 
IT capabilities across the Group. See page 116  
for more information on cyber security.

The Audit Committee also receives the 
minutes of the Group Risk Committee. The 
Group Risk Committee comprises the key 
functional and operational senior managers, 
and considers the risk framework, and key and 
emerging risks. Where appropriate, items that 
are raised as significant or emerging issues  
by the Group Risk Committee are reflected  
in adjustments to the control environment.

In 2023, some control issues were 
experienced including:
• a colleague had their IT user credentials 

compromised. No data was lost and there 
were no further instances of weaker  
security protocols;

• three businesses performed work without 
authorisation under the Group’s Pink Note 
process. This was subsequently rectified  
and guidance reissued; and

• a payment fraud in our Australian business  

of immaterial scale to the Group.

continued

The Audit Committee receives regular reports 
of matters reported via Speak Up, our internal 
whistleblowing process. There were 103 
control incidents reported in 2023 (2022: 84). 
The nature of the matters reported remain 
similar to previous years and relate to 
employee and employment matters, with  
very few relating to fraudulent activity,  
which remains at a low level across the  
Group. The increase reported is reflective of  
a bigger, more complex business compared  
to the prior year. 

Internal Audit received one report on our 
Supplier Speak Up line, which was a  
request for ESG data rather than a concern 
regarding malpractice and was swiftly 
resolved by management.

SOX controls 
In 2022, the Group identified material 
weaknesses relating to IT general controls  
and aspects of management’s overall  
system of financial controls (lack of sufficient 
technical accounting knowledge, segregation 
of duties and management review controls). 
The Board and Audit Committee reviewed  
the progress made to address the potential 
weaknesses identified. 

At each meeting in 2023, the Audit Committee 
received an update on the status of the 
Company’s SOX implementation programme. 
The updates included details regarding 
progress against the defined plan, design 
effectiveness on the specific controls, and 
colleague training and team resources.  
The updates reviewed both business process 
controls and IT governance controls, as well as 
progress by specific processes and countries. 
As the year progressed, the focus of the 
updates moved to tracking testing plans, 
operating effectiveness results and tracking 
any identified deficiencies and associated 
remediation plans. At the request of the Audit 
Committee, a monthly status report was also 
provided outside of the scheduled meetings to 
allow for continuous visibility. From late 2023, 
the Audit Committee also received a monthly 
status report from the external auditor. 

An in-depth review of the status of our SOX 
compliance for 2023 was undertaken at the 
December 2023 meeting, including discussion 
as to any identified material weaknesses.  
For the 2023 financial year, the evaluation  
of effectiveness of our internal controls 
identified material weaknesses relating to  
IT general controls. 

The Board and the Audit Committee reviewed 
the work completed for the material weakness 
relating to aspects of management’s overall 
system of financial controls (lack of sufficient 
technical accounting knowledge, segregation 
of duties and management review controls) 
and are satisfied this has been remediated. 

The Board and the Audit Committee has 
further reviewed the progress made in 2023  
in relation to the material weakness relating  
IT general controls and will continue to have 
oversight of management’s ongoing 
remediation plans in 2024. 

Effectiveness of risk management and 
internal control framework 
The Board, with the support of the Audit 
Committee, conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control 
for the year ended 31 December 2023 and 
confirms that:
• the Group has an ongoing process for 

identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group;

• this process has been in place for the  
year under review and up to the date  
of approval of the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements;

• the Board reviews the process regularly; and

• the process operates in accordance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code and  
the FRC Risk Management and Internal 
Control Guidance.

Audit Committee 
effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Audit Committee  
was considered as part of the external Board 
effectiveness review undertaken in 2023 by 
Chris Saul of Christopher Saul Associates, with 
the output considered and follow-up actions 
agreed by the Audit Committee. The review 
concluded that the Audit Committee continues 
to operate effectively and is well-integrated 
into the Board decision-making processes. 

In 2024, the Audit Committee will continue to 
focus on its oversight of the Company’s SOX 
compliance and will consider opportunities to 
further enhance its focus on risk. Full details  
of the Board evaluation review, including its 
outcomes and actions, are disclosed on  
pages 112 and 113.

Given his significant leadership experience, 
and proven track record of successful delivery, 
I am sure that Brad will be an excellent 
addition to the ELT. 

As is its usual practice, the Nomination 
Committee reviewed succession planning for 
our Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer 
and members of our ELT during the year.  
In December, the Nomination Committee 
considered detailed succession plans for  
key roles. To ensure Board familiarity with 
senior managers and potential succession 
candidates, a number of senior managers and 
colleagues from across the Group have also 
presented to the Board or met with Directors 
during 2023 and it is planned that this 
engagement will continue in 2024 as part of 
the Board’s ongoing practice of meeting with 
talent from around the world.

Diversity and inclusion remains a core area of 
focus, framed by our Board diversity policy. 
The diversity of the Board is detailed on page 
129, with membership comprising 33% women 
and two Directors from an ethnic minority 
background. Further details on our Board 
diversity policy and the targets set out in the 
policy, which were updated in January 2023, 
can be found on page 128. 

Full details of the Nomination Committee’s 
work during 2023 can be found set out in the 
following report.

Richard Solomons
Chair of the Nomination Committee 
7 March 2024

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you the  
report of the work undertaken by the 
Nomination Committee in the year ended  
31 December 2023.

During the year, the Nomination Committee 
continued to assist the Board in fulfilling  
its responsibilities, with a particular  
focus placed on the composition of, and 
succession planning for, the Board and  
senior management. 

As identified in last year’s report, Julie 
Southern, who would have served on the 
Board for a period of nine years by July  
2023, stepped down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) on 10 May 2023. Following a 
comprehensive recruitment process, full 
details of which are provided in the Company’s 
2022 Annual Report, the Board welcomed 
Sally Johnson as a Non-Executive Director. 
Sally joined the Board on 1 April 2023,  
and became a member of the Audit and 
Nomination Committees. She succeeded  
Julie as Chair of the Audit Committee from  
10 May 2023. Sally is currently the Chief 
Financial Officer of Pearson plc, a FTSE 100 
global education and learning business,  
and has brought strong technical and 
commercial finance skills to the Board, 
including knowledge of the US listed 
environment. As identified in the 2023 Board 
evaluation, Sally has settled into her new 
position expertly, bringing further energy  
and engagement to the role. 

Both the Nomination Committee and the 
Board spent time in 2023 discussing the 
composition of the North America leadership 
team, in light of the enlarged scale of the 
business in that region following the 
acquisition of Terminix in 2022. In October 
2023, Brett Ponton stepped down as CEO of 
the Company’s North America region and as  
a member of the Executive Leadership Team 
(ELT). In December, we were delighted to 
announce the appointment of Brad Paulsen  
as CEO, North America. He also became a 
member of the ELT, as detailed on page 103. 
Brad was previously the CEO of Rexel USA,  
a leading distributor of electrical parts, 
services, and solutions, with more than  
450 US branches and $7bn in annual sales.

Role of the Nomination 
Committee
The Nomination Committee monitors the 
composition and balance of the Board  
and of its Committees by identifying and 
recommending to the Board the appointment 
of new Directors and Committee members 
and ensuring they have the appropriate 
balance of skills, knowledge, experience,  
and diversity to govern the Company in a 
professional, ethical, and transparent manner. 

The Nomination Committee also oversees 
talent and succession plans for members of 
the ELT and the Company Secretary, ensuring 
the development of a diverse pipeline for the 
future senior management of the Group. 

Additionally, it plays an active role in setting 
and meeting diversity objectives and 
strategies for the Company as a whole,  
and has oversight of the impact of these 
diversity initiatives. 

The full responsibilities of the Committee  
are set out in its terms of reference, which 
were last reviewed in December 2023.  
The Nomination Committee terms of  
reference are available on our website. 

Membership and attendance
All Non-Executive Directors are members  
of the Nomination Committee to ensure  
they have a formal forum to input and help 
determine the composition of the Board.  
The Chair of the Board, Richard Solomons, 
chairs the Nomination Committee. 

The Nomination Committee met four times 
during the year and full details of members’ 
attendance during 2023 can be found on  
page 98. Members of the Committee also  
hold discussions as required outside of the 
formal meetings.

The Nomination Committee Chair will seek 
views in advance from any member who 
cannot attend a meeting and provide a 
briefing on outcomes if appropriate. Papers 
and minutes of the meeting are circulated to  
all Nomination Committee members, whether 
or not they attend. 

The Chief Executive also usually attends 
meetings of the Nomination Committee, 
especially to assist with discussions of 
executive succession and talent  
programmes, as does the Group  
General Counsel and Group HR Director.  
The Company Secretary acts as secretary  
to the Nomination Committee.

Nomination Committee 
effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Nomination 
Committee was considered as part of the 
external Board effectiveness review 
undertaken in 2023 by Chris Saul of 
Christopher Saul Associates, with the output 
considered and follow-up actions agreed  
by the Nomination Committee. The review 
concluded that the Nomination Committee 
continues to operate effectively.

In 2024, the Nomination Committee plans  
to continue to focus on Executive Director  
and senior management succession plans, 
including the gender and ethnic diversity 
within these groups. It also intends to 
undertake a Non-Executive Director skills 
matrix to support the Nomination Committee 
in future Board succession planning.  
Full details of the Board evaluation review, 
including its outcomes and actions, are 
disclosed on pages 112 and 113.

Managing conflicts of interest
The Directors have a statutory duty to avoid  
a situation where they have, or could have,  
a direct or indirect interest that conflicts or 
might possibly conflict with the interests of  
the Company. The Board is permitted, under 
powers from shareholders contained in the 
Articles of Association, to authorise actual or 
potential conflicts of interest.

We have a procedure to manage the situation 
where a Director has a conflict of interest, and 
as part of the process the Board considers 
each potential conflict situation on its merits. 
Since the procedure was introduced, a 
number of potential situational conflicts arising 
from appointments on external boards, or 
through some other ongoing relationship, 
have been authorised after review by the 
Board, none of which is subject to any specific 
restriction or condition. We maintain and 
review annually a register of authorisations 
granted during the year.

The Nomination Committee reviews the 
current schedule of authorisations on an 
annual basis, with a view to considering 
whether they remain appropriate or whether 
they should be revoked or otherwise limited. 
In 2023, it was concluded that no updates 
were necessary. All authorisations given  
were considered to remain appropriate and 
none were revoked or otherwise limited.

The conflicts of interest process also informs 
the assessment of the independence of Board 
members. You can find further details of the 
assessment on page 107.

Board recruitment and 
succession process 
Board recruitment and appointment 
procedure
The Nomination Committee is responsible  
for ensuring there is a formal, rigorous, and 
transparent process in place for appointing 
Directors. Potential appointments are 
assessed with a view to ensuring the optimal 
composition for the Board to discharge  
its duties and responsibilities effectively. 
Candidates are considered from a diverse 
group of individuals whose skills and 
experience have been gained in a variety of 
backgrounds. Successful candidates have  
to demonstrate integrity and independence  
of mind and must enhance the overall 
effectiveness of the Board. All appointments 
are considered objectively and are made on 
merit. We support the process of appointing 
new Directors to the Board by using external 
recruitment consultants. 

Director reappointment 
All Non-Executive Directors undertake a  
fixed term of three years subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders. The fixed term 
can be extended, and consistent with best 
practice, does not exceed nine years subject 
to defined circumstances as identified by the 
Nomination Committee. 

Extensions recommended in the period were:
• The reappointment of Cathy Turner for a 

second three-year term.

• The reappointment of Linda Yueh, who had 

served on the Board for a period of six  
years as of 1 November 2023, on an annual 
rolling basis. 

• The reappointment of John Pettigrew, who 
had served on the Board for a period of  
six years on 1 January 2024, on an annual 
rolling basis.

• The reappointment of Sarosh Mistry for  

a second three-year term. 

In line with standing practice, each  
decision was supported by the continuing 
independence, experience, and contribution 
that each Director brings to both Board and 
Committee work.

As part of the review of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, consideration was  
given to the appointment terms of the 
Non-Executive Directors. Given that a fixed 
term appointment is a legacy construct under 
old corporate governance codes where  
annual re-election was not required, and two 
three-year terms (with the possibility of nine 
years) were recommended, it is proposed that 
the terms be updated to remove a fixed term. 
Further details can be found in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 131 to 161.

Non-Executive Director succession
The Nomination Committee is responsible  
for ensuring plans are in place for orderly 
succession to the Board, taking into account 
the challenges and opportunities facing the 
Company, and the skills, expertise, and 
diversity needed on the Board in the future. 
Accordingly, the Nomination Committee 
considers Non-Executive Director succession 
on a regular basis to ensure that changes  
to the Board are proactively planned for.  
As part of this consideration, the Nomination 
Committee monitors the Non-Executive 
Directors’ tenure, and reviews potential 
departure dates assuming the relevant 
Directors are not permitted to serve more  
than nine years from their appointment date, 
unless in exceptional circumstances. 

As noted in last year’s report, a formal 
recruitment process was undertaken in 2022, 
to identify a suitable successor for Julie 
Southern. The executive search agency, 
Spencer Stuart, was appointed to support this 
process. Spencer Stuart does not have any 
connections with the Company or any Director 
that may impair its independence and is a 
signatory to the Enhanced Voluntary Code of 
Conduct for Executive Search Firms. Following 
the conclusion of this process in 2023, Sally 
Johnson was appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director from 1 April 2023, and a member  
of the Audit Committee and Nomination 
Committee. When Julie stepped down from 
the Board at the conclusion of the Company’s 
AGM in May, Sally assumed the role of Chair  
of the Audit Committee. Full details of the 
recruitment process were disclosed in the 
Company’s 2022 Annual Report, which is 
available on our website. 

Senior management 
succession planning and 
talent development
The Board and Nomination Committee 
recognise that strategic, thoughtful, and 
practical succession planning and talent 
development is critical to the long-term 
success of the Company. The Board has 
ultimate responsibility for succession planning 
for Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
and senior management, supported by the 
oversight and recommendations of the 
Nomination Committee. The Nomination 
Committee undertakes to bring new energy, 
challenge, and oversight to the process and to 
reflect the business strategy and operational 
goals in appointments. While Board approval 
is only required for changes to the ELT, as 
outlined below, the Nomination Committee 
also considers senior talent and succession 
planning below this level.

The succession planning process involves the 
evaluation of each leadership team role along 
with other critical roles against whether there 
are successors ready now, ready in one to two 
years, or ready in three to five or more years, 
as well as identifying any emergency cover in 
place for those roles. Colleagues identified as 
successors and select talented colleagues  
are included in a talent pool and put through  
a robust development assessment and 
planning process where strengths and gaps 
are identified using, among other measures, 
psychometric assessments, career 
conversations, and a 360-degree feedback 
assessment. The information from this is 
applied to help create effective development 
plans as well as to inform the content of the 
talent pool development sessions.

In 2023, a full succession planning review of 
regional and functional leadership teams  
and critical roles was completed. The Group 
HR Director and HR Director Global Talent & 
Group Functions presented a detailed update 
on the Company’s talent strategy to the 
Nomination Committee in December. The 
session reviewed the talent and succession 
update as well as providing a spotlight on 
talent selection in North America, given the 
enlarged scale of the business in that region 
and the continued integration of Terminix, 
highlighting the best of breed approach to 
retaining the best talent across the Group. 

The Nomination Committee considered the 
succession plans for the Chief Executive,  
Chief Financial Officer and other members  
of the ELT, including a discussion as to the 
potential ELT of the future. Global and critical 
role succession was also reviewed, with an 
update on regional leadership succession 
plans provided.

In 2023, there was one change to the ELT,  
with Brad Paulsen succeeding Brett Ponton as 
CEO of the Company’s North America region 
in December 2023. 

The Nomination Committee considered the 
progress made towards the priorities identified 
in relation to talent for 2023. The Company 
has established global, regional and fast-track 
talent pools to help identify successors for  
key roles and to identify and accelerate the 
development of fast-track talent. The Board 
aims to familiarise itself as much as possible 
with the senior management team as well as 
colleagues identified as successors or ‘high 
potentials’ through its ongoing engagement 
programme. More details can be found on 
page 114.

The effectiveness of our talent development 
and succession planning activity is regularly 
monitored. In our ELT and Group Leadership 
Forum (GLF; our top c.100 senior management 
team), 71% and 87% of roles respectively  
have near-term successors identified.  
While the ELT level is slightly down from the 
prior year, the GLF level has improved by 9%. 
Promotion rates have also increased, by 5% 
from 2022 to 66% in 2023, following recent 
leadership appointments.

Diversity and inclusion 
Fostering a diverse and inclusive culture
A key strategic aim of the Company is to  
be recognised as a world-class Employer  
of Choice, which is able to attract, recruit,  
and retain the best people from the widest 
possible pool of talent. We are, therefore, 
committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive 
working environment for all employees by,  
at all times, striving to be an organisation that 
values everyone’s talents and abilities in an 
environment where diversity is encouraged.

In our 2023 Your Voice Counts (YVC) 
employee survey the Diversity, Equity & 
Inclusion (DE&I) index was our second highest 
scoring dimension overall, improving by 1% 
versus the previous survey and 6% higher  
than the global norm benchmark.

More information on our approach to DE&I can 
be found in the Responsible Business section 
on page 69 and our Group Diversity, Equity & 
Inclusion policy is available on our website.

As part of its monitoring of gender, the Board 
reviews our Gender Pay Report each year  
and we continue to have no material gender 
pay gap between women and men (see  
page 148). The reports are available to view  
on our website.

Embracing  
equity on 
International 
Women’s Day

On 8 March 2023, events were held 
globally around the Group to celebrate 
International Women’s Day, with many 
embracing the theme of equity. Group 
online events included guidance and 
discussions on allyship, menopause,  
and sponsorship. 

Linda Yueh, a Non-Executive Director, 
joined in the Rentokil Women in 
Leadership Panel, a panel discussion  
with our North American HR team. Linda 
recounted her experiences during her 
career, and answered questions from 
colleagues. 

Senior leadership diversity 
The Group continues to focus on enhancing 
the diversity of our senior management, with 
25% of senior roles in the business held by 
women (2022: 29%). The decrease in gender 
diversity in 2023 was a result of a notable 
increase to the size of our senior management 
team. We define senior management as the 
members of our ELT and their direct reports, 
excluding colleagues in administrative and 
support roles. When the breakdown includes 
any other directors of the Company’s related 
undertakings there are 52 females (24.9%) and 
157 males (75.1%). 

Approximately 23% of our colleagues are 
female (2022: 23%).

As a global organisation, we also believe it 
is important to have a senior management 
team that is representative of the markets 
we operate in, and the customers we serve. 
In line with the Parker Review we have set 
a target to improve our ethnic diversity and 
reach 20% of our senior leadership team by 
the end of 2027 (2023: 15.5%). This is based 
on colleagues who have provided data, and 
excludes those based in countries where 
we cannot ask or hold ethnicity information. 

We aim to remove any bias from our 
recruitment processes to ensure we are 
attracting the best people from the widest 
possible pool of talent. A summary of our 
culture and further details on our colleagues 
are provided in the Responsible Business 
section on pages 69 and 70. You can find 
details on how the Directors monitor culture 
on page 116.

Board diversity objectives
Objectives

Outcome in 2023

That the Board comprises at least 40% women by 2028.

33.3% of our Directors are female (2022: 33.3%).

That at least one of the Chair, CEO, CFO, or Senior Independent 
Director (SID) is a woman by 2028.

Currently all roles are held by men.

That at least one member of the Board is from a minority ethnic 
background.

This was achieved with the appointment of Linda Yueh in 2017 and 
exceeded with the appointment of Sarosh Mistry in 2021.

Commitment to a merit-based approach to Board composition within  
a diverse and inclusive culture.

Considered as part of all Board appointments, including the 
appointment of Sally Johnson.

To work only with executive search firms on Board appointments 
that have signed up to the Enhanced Voluntary Code of Conduct 
for Executive Search Firms on gender diversity and best practice 
(Enhanced Code).

To support the executive management of the Company in developing 
and implementing appropriate policies, programmes, and initiatives 
designed to promote diversity at all levels of the organisation.

All executive search firms retained by the Company during 2023 for 
Board appointments had signed up to the Enhanced Code.

In 2023, our ELT and its direct reports (excluding colleagues in 
administrative roles) were 25% female (2022: 29%). Approximately 
23% (2022: 23%) of our colleagues are female. The Board receives  
two detailed briefings on culture and our Employer of Choice agenda 
each year, which address progress on diversity and inclusion.

To ensure that there is a pipeline of female executives within the 
organisation who are qualified and capable of taking up senior 
leadership positions.

32% of those on our regional leadership succession plans are female, 
and 35% of those on our functional leadership succession plans  
are female. 

Aim to ensure that there is appropriate and meaningful disclosure in 
the Company’s Annual Report on Board composition, appointment 
processes, the policies and initiatives the Company has in place,  
and the steps it is taking to promote diversity, both at Board level  
and across the Company.

128 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

Considered each year when drafting the Annual Report.

Our Chair, Richard Solomons, has held  
the position since May 2019, following 
appointment to the Board in March 2019.  
This resulted from a robust appointment 
process, as detailed in the Company’s 2018 
Annual Report. 

Our Senior Independent Director, John 
Pettigrew, has held the position since May 
2019, following appointment to the Board in 
January 2018. John was appointed in line with 
the internal succession plan for the role and 
continues to support the Board and Chair in 
this position. 

While the Company values all forms of 
diversity and work continues to ensure that 
gender and ethnicity, alongside broader 
diversity characteristics, are present across 
the Board, we do not believe given the current 
composition of our Board, and recognising  
the factors noted above, that the Listing Rule 
targets are achievable prior to 2028. 

Board diversity 
The Board of Directors has adopted a Board 
diversity, equity and inclusion policy to 
support, at Board level, the Company’s 
commitment to fostering a diverse and 
inclusive working environment. The key 
objectives of the policy and its effectiveness 
are set out on page 128, and the policy is 
available on our website. 

Due to the current size of the Board and its 
Committees, there is no separate policy or 
provisions within the Board diversity policy 
for Committees.

In 2022, in light of the new Listing Rules 
requirements on diversity-related reporting 
and the recommendations set out in the  
FTSE Women Leaders Review (the successive 
phase of the Hampton-Alexander Review),  
the Nomination Committee recommended  
that the Board update its diversity targets.  
The revised policy and targets were approved 
by the Board in January 2023. 

While the Board remains committed to 
diversity within our organisation and 
recognises diversity as a priority, it was agreed 
that the Board’s focus should be on setting 
targets which are considered appropriate 
given the succession timeframe of existing 
members of the Board, and which take 
account of the existing skills, knowledge, 
experience, and composition of the Board. 
Based on current succession timing, we  
have therefore set a target for the Board to 
comprise at least 40% women by 2028, which 

we believe to be an appropriate timeframe for 
our Board, based on normal succession plans 
(assuming that the two executive roles on  
the Board remain constant and assuming 
Non-Executive Director tenure of nine years in 
line with the UK Corporate Governance Code). 
To achieve this earlier would require either 
recruiting an additional female Non-Executive 
Director or replacing an existing Director 
prematurely. As the Board is considered to be 
operating effectively, neither of these options 
are considered to be in the best interests of 
the Company or its shareholders at this time. 

We were placed 83rd in the 2023 FTSE 
Women Leaders Review for women on Boards 
and in leadership in the FTSE 100, published in 
February 2024.

Explanation against Listing Rule 9.8.6(R)
As at 31 December 2023 (the Company’s 
chosen reference date), the Company confirms 
it has met the target for one Director to be 
from an ethnic minority background. It has  
not met the targets that at least 40% of the 
individuals on its board of directors are 
women and that at least one of the Chair,  
CEO, CFO, or SID is female. 

The roles of the Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer have been held by Andy 
Ransom and Stuart Ingall-Tombs for 10 and 
three years respectively. These positions 
support the long-term strategic delivery of  
the Group and remain subject to considered 
succession planning.

Director induction 
and training
The Chairman, supported by the Nomination 
Committee through its review of the skills, 
knowledge and experience of the Board, leads 
the training and development of Directors. 

Induction
The Chairman and Company Secretary 
prepare a detailed induction for each new 
Director. This is tailored to the prospective 
roles the individual will assume on the Board 
and its Committees, and also accounts for 
their existing knowledge and experience. 

The induction programme includes a series of 
meetings, beginning before the Director joins 
the Board and running for several months. 
These one-to-one meetings are arranged  
with the Chair and existing Non-Executive 
Directors, the Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer, members of the ELT and  
the Company Secretary, along with other 
members of senior management. They are 
also introduced to and given access to the 
Company’s external advisers (auditors, legal 
advisers and brokers).

All Non-Executive Directors also receive the 
following materials on their appointment:
• key Company policies, procedures and 

governance information, including the Code 
of Conduct, Board Governance Manual, 
Responsible Business Report and Group 
Authority Schedule; 

• details of the Group structure; 
• analysis of the Company’s key shareholders 

and share capital; 
• recent analyst notes; 
• minutes and papers from the most recent 
Board and relevant Committee meetings, 
including the most recent strategy meeting; 

• copies of the most recent Board and any 

relevant Committee evaluation reports; and 

• guidance on the legal and regulatory 

responsibilities of a Director in a UK and  
US publicly listed company. 

New Directors are also encouraged to undertake 
the same online induction modules as other  
new colleagues in our online learning and 
development platform (U+), on key compliance 
subjects, such as our Code of Conduct, 
anti-bribery and corruption, competition law, 
information security and privacy, insider 
information, and conflicts of interest. 

Between 12 and 18 months after their 
appointment, Directors are asked to complete  
a questionnaire to provide feedback on the 
induction process. This allows us to assess the 
effectiveness of the induction and any training 
provided, to identify any areas of improvement 
and to highlight any further development needs.

The table below illustrates the purpose of 
some of the meetings that formed part of 
Sally’s induction programme. 

Further areas of focus for Sally’s induction 
were pertinent to her role on the 
Committees, in particular her role on the 
Audit Committee. This included receiving  
an overview of the current risks faced by the 
Group, our risk management framework and 
Internal Audit programme. Sally also met 
with the Company’s external auditors, and 
attended a meeting of our executive Group 
Risk Committee. 

In May 2023, Sally and Sarosh Mistry visited 
the Power Centre, which included a tour of 
the facilities and presentations from senior 
management and the scientists based 
there. The Power Centre is our home for 
science, innovation, and training academy  
in the UK. 

In December 2023, Sally also joined a pest 
technician in London for a ride-along, 
providing her with hands-on experience of 
the work undertaken by our technicians and 
the opportunity to meet with customers. 

Sally Johnson’s induction 
Sally Johnson joined the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director on 1 April 2023. 
She became a member of the Nomination 
Committee and Audit Committee from the 
date of her appointment, before being 
appointed Audit Committee Chair in  
May 2023. 

Sally had an extensive induction 
programme, covering a range of areas 
across the business. In addition to receiving 
a detailed overview of the Group and  
its business operations, she attended a 
number of sessions covering topics 
including governance, Company culture,  
and stakeholder engagement.

ongoing development of Directors, details  
of externally facilitated events and training  
are also circulated periodically.

Directors’ Remuneration Report

Corporate Governance

Financial Statements

Other Information

Dear Shareholder
It is my pleasure to present to shareholders,  
on behalf of the Board, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2023. I hope you find the 
information in this report clearly explains the 
remuneration approach taken by the Company 
and enables you to understand how it links 
performance to business strategy and results. 

It has been another busy year, with the key 
areas of focus including:
• reviewing the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
(the Policy) which is due for renewal and will 
be voted on at the AGM in May 2024;

• continuing the integration of the Terminix 

acquisition; and 

• focusing on the remuneration for all 
colleagues given the cost-of-living 
challenges continue to impact our  
colleagues across the globe.

Policy renewal
A large proportion of the Remuneration 
Committee’s time in 2023 has been spent 
reviewing the Policy. Our aim has been to 
ensure that the Policy put to shareholders at 
the AGM in 2024 continues to support the 
delivery of our strategy while appropriately 
balancing the incentivisation and reward of  
our experienced Executive Directors, with the 
interests of shareholders, colleagues, and the 
wider community.

We were also keen to ensure that the 
remuneration of our Executive Directors is 
realigned appropriately following the 
acquisition of Terminix, which has added 
significantly to the size and complexity of  
the Group. We were prudent following the 
acquisition of Terminix, by not immediately 
adjusting any remuneration as is common  
in such circumstances. The deal closed in 
October 2022 and we decided at that time, to 
consider any adjustments as part of a detailed 
review in line with the Policy renewal process.

We know that shareholders value 
understanding the benchmark data we used in 
conducting the review, and this has therefore 
been included in the detail below. The data is 
an important reference point in determining 
the Policy proposals but is only one 
contribution to Committee’s deliberations.  
In developing the Policy proposals we have 
considered the current stage of the Group’s 
evolution, its increased size and international 
focus as well as the high regard in which our 
CEO is held not only in the UK, but globally, 
where an increasing proportion of our 
business is positioned. Consistent with the 
current Policy we remain committed to 
weighting variable pay over the long term. 

Key findings
The acquisition of Terminix and secondary 
listing on the New York Stock Exchange, 
combined with the continued growth of the 
rest of our business, has fundamentally 
changed the scale and complexity of the 
business since the last Policy review. 

• Revenue (at AER) has increased by 90.4%, 

from £2,823.5m in 2020 to £5,375m in 2023.

• Profit before tax (at AER) has increased by 
114.5%, from £229.8m in 2020 to £493m  
in 2023.

• Percentage of revenue (at AER) from outside 
the UK has increased from 89.8% to 94.0% 
and the percentage of revenue from North 
America has increased by 41.9%, from 43.4% 
in 2020 to 61.5% in 2023.

• The number of countries has increased by 

seven, from 83 in 2020 to 90 in 2023.

• The number of employees has increased  
by 18,311, from 44,589 in 2020 to 62,900  
in 2023.

It is appropriate to review the packages of our 
Executive Directors against the new relevant 
benchmarks to ensure that remuneration 
remains market-aligned and would be fit for 
purpose throughout the life of the Policy from 
2024-2027.

Annual Report 2023

Benchmark data
The Committee adopted a UK FTSE market benchmark, given that many 
of the largest UK companies are global. We considered how best to 
reflect our significant presence in North America and, notwithstanding 
the different pay practices and higher levels there, concluded that the 
broad-based FTSE was suitable given that many UK-based companies 
have operations in the US. In addition, our Executive Directors are 
based in the UK. 

The Committee used the market data as a reference point for the  
overall sizing of the proposed packages given the significant change  
in the business and the associated demands upon our leadership as  
a consequence. Our framework remains unchanged; we aim to deliver 
the fixed element of remuneration around market median and provide 
the opportunity to achieve up to the upper quartile for outstanding 
performance. This ensures that remuneration is weighted to 
performance and is variable.

When we started the review in July 2023, the benchmark we used  
was companies within the FTSE 15 – 50, excluding financial services. 
Given the shareholder experience in the second half of 2023, we felt 
that it was appropriate to revise the market benchmark downwards 
accordingly. Therefore, we have adopted a lower market benchmark  
of the FTSE 21 – 50, excluding financial services. While the share price 
has been volatile, in the round, this peer group is felt to reflect our 
overall size and complexity, having regard to the increased revenue  
and increased scope of our international activities. We have consciously 
chosen not to include data from non-UK, particularly US, companies 
which would have increased the benchmark figures. 

Shareholder engagement
We started our engagement with our top shareholders, which hold 
around 50% of our share capital, along with shareholder representative 
bodies/proxy agencies in October 2023. The quality of engagement 
and input has been extremely helpful. We are grateful for the time 
invested and the practical suggestions as to how we might structure an 
appropriate level of remuneration potential for the future. There was 
much consistency in the feedback, including:

• recognition of the capabilities of our management team and support to 

remunerate them competitively and in line with the market;

• a preference for any incremental opportunity to be balanced between 
fixed and performance-based variable pay, rather than just fixed pay, 
which we had initially contemplated;

• consideration of phasing any base salary increases; and

• to share the benchmark data we have used in formulating  

the proposal.

Shareholder experience
During the consultation process, following our Q3 trading update,  
there was an adverse reaction from the market. This reaction was 
disappointing as the overall business continues to perform well and has 
delivered strong profit and revenue in 2023. However, the Committee 
determined that the remuneration proposals need to reflect the impact 
of this change, which included the following:
• Revising downwards the market benchmark from the initial FTSE 15 
– 50 excluding financial services, to the FTSE 21 – 50, excluding 
financial services; and

• Incorporating specific measures and targets related to the integration 

in North America and delivery of Organic Revenue Growth. 

Proposed Policy
Taking into consideration the feedback received from shareholders,  
as well as the lower benchmark data, the proposed changes to the 
Policy are as follows:

Corporate Governance

Financial Statements

Other Information

Annual bonus
• Lift the maximum opportunity from the current, below-market level of 

180% of base salary, to 225%. 

• This uplift will be based on the achievement of targeted and 

measurable financial results. Furthermore, for 2024, the uplift in  
bonus opportunity will be fully aligned to the delivery of Organic 
Revenue Growth and integration synergy targets in our North 
American business.

In recognition of shareholder feedback the increased portion of the 
bonus opportunity for 2024 will be focused on the delivery of key North 
American integration targets, which include the delivery of integration 
synergies and driving Organic Revenue Growth rates.

We feel that setting the total opportunity above the median is 
appropriate for our CEO as it recognises his high level of experience, 
with more than 10 years in position, and the delivery of superior returns 
for all our stakeholders during his tenure.

Bonus deferral
• Increases from 40% to 50% of any bonus payable. The bonus will 

continue to be deferred into shares for a three-year period.

• This change increases the proportion of the package that will be 

delivered in the long-term.

Our CFO will also be adjusted and remunerated within the same 
structure and approach as the CEO. His base salary will be slightly 
below market median (95%) and his total remuneration package is 
benchmarked to deliver a median market opportunity, to reflect his  
level of experience in the role.

Shareholding guidelines
• Increases for the CEO from 300% to 400% of salary and for the CFO 

from 200% to 300%. 

• Post-cessation guidelines will continue to apply, which will  

normally require Executive Directors to hold shares for two years 
post-cessation.

The following elements will not be changed:

Base salary
• Base salaries will continue to be set taking into a range of factors 

including scope and responsibilities of the role and individual skills  
and experience (see page 150 for full details). For the 2024 review, 
effective 1 July 2024, we are proposing an increase in line with the 
broader employee population plus a market realignment of 7.5%. 

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
• The PSP will remain at 375% of salary for the CEO and 300% of salary 

for the CFO.

Pension
• There are no changes proposed to pension and this will remain 

aligned with the wider workforce at 3% of base salary.

Response to cost-of-living challenges
In 2023, the challenges around the impact of the cost-of-living globally 
continued and we have remained committed to paying our colleagues 
fairly, with particular focus on the impact that higher inflation has had  
on our more junior and frontline colleagues. We continued a number  
of the successful initiatives that we had introduced in 2022 into 2023, 
which included:
• giving a cost-of-living bonus to colleagues who are not eligible to 

participate in a performance or other bonus plan;

• giving higher increases to frontline colleagues compared to senior 

leaders and management teams, for example, the typical pay increase 
for frontline colleagues in the UK was double the typical salary 
increase for management and senior leaders in 2023;

• giving frontline colleagues the opportunity to flex their work hours  
and, based on colleague feedback, offering them the opportunity  
to increase their contractual hours, and accordingly their pay;

• supporting colleagues to help them maximise their incentive 

opportunity;

• increasing meal voucher benefits to support colleagues with the rising 

costs of food inflation; and

Rationale for changes
We understand that the external environment is not conducive to 
material pay opportunity increases and we have therefore been 
thoughtful as to how we can ensure that we have appropriate packages 
in place without being excessive. 

• providing support to colleagues to help them develop their own 

strategies to manage the cost of living challenge. For example, by 
providing access to a range of financial tools and calculators through 
our benefit platform in the UK and partnering with HSBC to deliver 
financial education webinars.

As detailed above, we have listened carefully to the feedback received 
from our shareholders. We have actioned many of the changes 
proposed and believe that the proposal offers an approach that 
recognises the increased complexity following the Terminix acquisition, 
and ensures appropriate incentivisation of our Executive Directors.  
At the heart of our philosophy is a commitment to performance based 
variable pay. 

The proposal for the CEO aligns the base salary with median, and 
delivers a target and maximum total remuneration package of between 
median and upper quartile. It also broadly maintains the percentage of 
long-term remuneration at c.81% as a result of the increase in bonus 
deferral, notwithstanding the increase in annual bonus opportunity.  
Our annual bonus will operate such that, for any annual bonus award, 
50% would be converted to shares and held for a further three years. 
Currently, the annual bonus potential is 180% of base salary with a 40% 
deferral, i.e. a maximum of 72% of base salary is deferred. Increasing  
the annual bonus potential to 225% with a 50% deferral results in up  
to 112.5% of base salary being deferred. 

The Terminix acquisition was completed in October 2022 and the 
Committee considered it appropriate to maintain the then current 
packages for the remainder of the three-year Policy, and is only seeking 
to reflect the transaction as part of the Policy renewal. 

The salary increases will not take effect until 1 July 2024 in line with the 
Company’s annual salary review. The Committee considers that this 
deferment equates to a phasing of the new package. For completeness, 
and consistent with our current process, the increased salary will apply 
for the 2024 bonus cycle.

Wider workforce engagement
The Committee has continued to engage with the wider workforce to 
enable understanding of the broader remuneration and related policies, 
and their impact. We continue to believe in and embed practices that 
enable all Board members to engage in this agenda. Engaging with the 
wider workforce and understanding their views was already a practice 
that the Board had undertaken for many years prior to the introduction 
of these requirements by the FRC UK Corporate Governance Code 
(Code), through initiatives such as Employer of Choice (see page 16  
and pages 69 and 70 for more information).

Key decisions in 2023
Context of business performance
Performance in 2023 demonstrated the continued core strength of our 
businesses, growing revenue, profit, and cash despite the challenges  
to the economy globally. Of note is that Adjusted Operating Profit and 
Revenue at CER grew by 57.0% and 45.8% respectively. We have also 
continued to deliver against our ESG goals (see page 15 for further 
information) and our Employer of Choice goals (see page 16 for further 
information). In fact our strength in attracting, developing and retaining 
our frontline colleagues has continued to improve in 2023, with 
retention up across both Service and Sales colleague groups and our 
Your Voice Counts employee survey remaining stable. This strong 
performance is reflected in the incentive payments to our frontline 
colleagues, management, and Executive Directors, reinforcing our 
strong link between performance and reward.

Shareholder experience
Our share price reduced considerably following the Q3 trading update, 
which meant that our shares ended the year down from the start of the 
year. Our Executive Directors are strongly aligned with shareholders, 
and therefore impacted, in that they hold significant levels of stock 
themselves.

As at 31 December 2023, the CEO’s shareholding greatly exceeded  
the required level and the CFO has also met the requirement when all 
qualifying shares are taken into account, and c.76% of the requirement 
with shares held outright.

We have carefully considered shareholder experience when reviewing 
the outcomes of the annual bonus and PSP vesting level, particularly 
with respect to whether any downward discretion should be exercised 
by the Committee. On balance, we feel that the formulaic outcomes  
take account of the generally good financial performance with a 
disappointing fall in the share price and ensures the Executive Directors 
are rewarded for the many strong aspects of performance in 2023. 

We have taken into consideration that the largest element of variable 
incentive, the PSP, directly reflects shareholder experience as the share 
price performance has impacted the estimated vesting of the 2021 PSP. 
The total shareholder return (TSR) element is currently below threshold 
and this element is expected to lapse. This represents half of the award.

The Committee felt that the company element of the annual bonus, was 
the appropriate vehicle to reward the Executive Directors for delivering 
good financial results in a challenging year. 

In addition, both the CEO and CFO were awarded a PDR rating of 3 to 
reflect delivery of strong financial results and broad based delivery 
across all of their goals balanced and also acknowledges the 
accountability for the shareholder experience.

Salary review
The CEO’s salary was increased by 3% to £928,288 and the CFO’s 
salary was increased to £566,500 as part of the salary review in July 
2023. The increase was below the typical increases received by the 
wider workforce in the UK of 6% and below the median increase for 
FTSE 100 CEOs of 4%.

Annual bonus outcome
The annual bonus for Executive Directors rewards both Company and 
personal performance. The Company element is designed to reward 
sustainable profit growth and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to align the 
Executive Directors’ incentives with the Group strategy. As with all 
incentives across the business, the targets set continue to be  
suitably stretching. 

The Company element of the scheme for Executives Directors  
operates in the same way for all managers, a population of more than 
2,000 colleagues, the only difference being that some targets are 
aligned to their specific business area rather than being based on 
overall Group performance. How the scheme operates and the 
performance outcomes at Group level are described below.

• Company performance – There are two performance gateways  

which are based on profit and cash generation, both of which were 
achieved. The level of bonus payable is determined by two key 
metrics: Adjusted Operating Profit and Revenue performance. 
Performance was assessed against the targets and, in addition,  
careful consideration was given to the quality of earnings in context  
of the 2023 results and stakeholder experience. Following these 
assessments, it was determined that the outcome achieved for 
Company performance in accordance with the formula was 
appropriate for the revenue measure, achieving 54.5% of  
maximum and 66.4% of maximum for Adjusted Operating Profit.

134 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

• Personal performance – The Executive Directors are assessed on 
their personal performance with the potential of up to 30% of salary 
based on these objectives, which are measured through the 
Company’s performance and development review process. The 
Committee has given careful consideration to the Executive Directors’ 
performance ratings and their overall bonus outcomes. The Committee 
recognises that this has been a particularly demanding year with the 
work related to the integration of Terminix, as well as the need to 
continue driving financial and business results across the rest of the 
Group. However, we are also mindful of shareholder experience  
and with this in mind the CEO, Andy Ransom, was awarded a 
performance rating of 3, giving a bonus of 15% of salary. The CFO, 
Stuart Ingall-Tombs, was also awarded a performance rating of 3, 
giving a bonus of 15% of salary. These assessments are set out on 
page 142 of the report and demonstrate the strong performance both 
executives have delivered in 2023.

• Total bonus outcome – The table below shows the total outcome as  
a percentage of base salary. See pages 141 and 142 for a breakdown

Performance Share Plan (PSP) vesting
2020 PSP
During 2023, the PSP award granted in 2020 came to the end of its 
three-year performance period. The vesting level of the award was 
dependent on six performance conditions:
• 60% – relative TSR;

• 20% other financial measures – Organic Revenue Growth and 

Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion; and

• 20% – strategic/ESG measures – Sales and Service colleague 

retention, customer satisfaction, and vehicle fuel intensity.

TSR was measured over a three-year period ending 7 September 2023 
and all other measures over a three-year period to 31 December 2022. 

The vesting level of 64.6% was higher than the estimates included in the 
2022 Annual Report due to the share price improvements resulting in 
the TSR element vesting. The Committee reviewed the vesting level 
based on the achievement against targets, to ensure that the outcome 
was a true reflection of the wider business performance and determined 
that it was. This scheme operates identically for our colleagues across 
the Group.

2021 PSP
The 2021 PSP is due to vest on 23 March 2024 and performance will  
be measured against six performance conditions:
• 50% – relative TSR;

• 30% other financial measures – Organic Revenue Growth and 

Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion; and

• 20% – strategic/ESG measures – Sales and Service colleague 

retention, customer satisfaction, and vehicle fuel intensity.

TSR is measured over a three-year period ending 22 March 2024 and  
all other measures over a three-year period to 31 December 2023.

Based on estimates to 29 February 2024, the TSR element is not 
expected to vest and the vesting level of the award is expected to be 
48.7%. See page 144 for a breakdown. 

While the lack of vesting on the TSR element is clearly disappointing it 
does align with the shareholder experience in 2023. The other half of 
the award, which covers internal financial and non financial measures, 
performed well. In addition, the Committee carefully considered the 
outcomes of the additional financial and strategic measures in the  
PSP to ensure that these had not been inadvertently made easier  
by inflationary increases or other impacts outside of management 
control. On this basis, the Committee concluded that the level of  
vesting was appropriate.

The Committee also reviewed the potential for any windfall gains and 
determined that there was none.

PSP grants
In March 2023, the Committee awarded the Executive Directors’ PSP 
awards at the Policy levels, with the CEO receiving an award of 375% 
of salary and the CFO receiving an award of 300%. The performance 
conditions are as follows:
• TSR – weighting 50%;

• Organic Revenue Growth – weighting 15%;

• Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion – weighting 15%; and

• Strategic/ESG measures (Sales and Service colleague retention, 
customer satisfaction, and vehicle fuel intensity) – weighting 20%.

We expect the 2024 PSP awards for the CEO and CFO, which are 
planned for March 2024, to be made on the same basis, with the 
exception that the TSR comparator group will be updated from the 
FTSE 350 to the FTSE 100 and will continue to exclude financial 
services, property, and primary resources sectors.

Given that the repositioning of the salaries, due to take effect on 1 July 
2024, and that the PSP award is expected to be granted before then,  
it is envisaged that the Policy levels will be achieved through an initial 
grant in March 2024 and a top up grant in September 2024.

Use of discretion
The Remuneration Committee has exercised its discretion on executive 
remuneration outcomes on a consistent basis over the last few years,  
in order to ensure any outturn is aligned with performance. The table 
below shows the Committee’s use of discretion over the past five years.

EPS targets were increased from

15% to 16.1% at maximum due to 
material M&A activity.

The in-flight PSP awards were 
amended to ensure that the 
targets remain as originally 
intended and have not become 
inadvertently easier or harder as a 
result of the Terminix acquisition.

See page 143 for further details.

Strategic alignment of pay
Ensuring that our remuneration supports the delivery of the strategy  
is important to the Committee and this is achieved through aligning  
the measures used in our incentive schemes with our key strategic 
priorities. The Committee also ensures that the right behaviours and 
actions are driven from the top of the organisation by ensuring that 
focus is balanced across both financial and non-financial outcomes, for 
example the inclusion of colleague, customer and health, safety, and 
environment metrics in both the personal element of the annual bonus 
and the PSP. The Committee also takes into consideration the wider 
business performance when reviewing formulaic outcomes of metrics 
across all incentives.

Policy implementation
Taking into consideration all the different elements of the Policy, the 
Committee is comfortable that it operated as intended in terms of 
Company performance and the quantum payable to the Executive 
Directors during 2023.

Base salary
At the same time as the Policy review, and in consultation with 
shareholders, the Committee reviewed the base salaries of the CEO  
and CFO, due to the significant growth in size and complexity of the 
Group following the Terminix acquisition in October 2022. 

The review took into consideration the impact of the changes to the 
business on the scope of the role (see page 131), how the CEO’s and 
CFO’s skills and experience had developed since the last review in 
2020 and appropriate benchmarks (see page 154). 

The CEO’s base salary will increase to £1,040,000 and the CFO’s base 
salary will increase to £635,000, which represents a 12% increase in 
total i.e. 4.5% in line with expected 2024 increases for management 
levels in the UK, which are expected to be lower than the wider 
workforce, plus a 7.5% adjustment to align with the market. 

The proposed increases enable us to reward our Executive Directors 
appropriately and differentiate for their skills and experience, with  
the CEO proposed at median and the CFO at 95% of the median.  
We will again review the base salary levels relative to the appropriate 
benchmark in 2025. 

Further phasing of the increases was considered by the Committee. 
However given that the change in the scope of their roles occurred  
in October 2022 and the salary increase will not be recognised until  
July 2024, we have concluded that sufficient phasing had already  
been achieved.

In conclusion
Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued  
support of our Policy, and its application and to our colleagues for 
delivering another strong set of results in 2023, despite the continuing 
economic challenges.

I hope that our proposed Policy demonstrates our continued 
commitment to being thoughtful when making pay decisions and 
reflects shareholder feedback. We very much hope that these proposals 
are seen to be consistent with our track record of appropriate and 
stretching remuneration. As such, I hope that we can count on your 
support with the Policy vote at the AGM. 

I welcome any comments you may have ahead of this.

Strategic ReportDirectors’ Annual Remuneration Report – Introduction

Introduction
The Annual Remuneration Report has been split into four sections for 
ease of reference. This introductory section provides an overview  
of the Remuneration Committee and their activities during the year.  
The second section, from page 140, provides an explanation of how  
the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy was implemented in the  
year ended 31 December 2023 and shows the alignment between the 
Company’s strategy, remuneration framework, and performance, as  
well as the payments made to Directors during this period. The third 
section, from page 150, provides an overview of how the new Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy will be applied in 2024. The final section includes 
details of the proposed changes to the Policy and proposed Policy that 
will be put to shareholder vote at the 2024 AGM.

Remuneration Committee responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee’s main responsibilities are developing 
and setting the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and overseeing its 
application. It determines and agrees the policy with the Board and 
approves individual remuneration arrangements for the Chairman, 
Executive Directors, members of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), 
and the Company Secretary. It reviews executive performance and 
strives to ensure that remuneration structures align the interests of 
management with those of shareholders and operate in the long-term 
best interests of the Company.

The Remuneration Committee oversees contractual terms on 
termination affecting Executive Directors, members of the ELT, and the 
Company Secretary, and seeks to ensure that any payments made  
are both fair to the individual and to the Company, that failure is not 
rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised. The 
Remuneration Committee also oversees the Company’s incentive 
schemes, including the operation and effectiveness of performance 
measures and targets in both the annual bonus plan and the PSP.  
It also lends oversight to major changes in colleague remuneration 
across the Group.

Membership and attendance
The Remuneration Committee members in 2023 were:
• Cathy Turner (Chair)

• David Frear

• Sarosh Mistry 

• Julie Southern (stepped down 10 May 2023)

• Linda Yueh

There were five Remuneration Committee meetings held in 2023,  
which is an increase on the number of meetings held in 2022 and was 
due to the additional requirements of the Policy review. Details of the 
members of the Remuneration Committee and their attendance during 
the year can be found on page 98. The Group HR Director, the Group 
General Counsel, the Company Secretary (who acts as secretary to the 
Remuneration Committee), and the Group Head of Reward also attend 
Remuneration Committee meetings.

The Group HR Director has direct access to the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and, together with the Group Head of 
Reward, advises the Remuneration Committee on remuneration matters 
relating to Executive Directors and members of the ELT. The Company 
Chairman also attends meetings and makes recommendations in 
relation to the remuneration and incentive arrangements for the  
Chief Executive. The Chief Executive attends meetings and makes 
recommendations in respect of remuneration arrangements for his 
direct reports. No Executive Director or member of the ELT is present 
when their own remuneration is under consideration.

The Remuneration Committee members have a broad and diverse 
set of skills and knowledge that, when combined, bring the necessary 
level of experience and know-how to ensure that remuneration matters 
are dealt with in a balanced, independent, and informed manner. 
No member of the Remuneration Committee has any personal financial 
interest in the matters to be decided by the Remuneration Committee, 
other than as a shareholder. 

138 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

No member of the Remuneration Committee has any conflict of interest 
in carrying out their role on the Remuneration Committee arising from 
other directorships, nor does any member participate in any of the 
Company’s incentive or pension arrangements or have any involvement 
in the day-to-day running of the Company. 

In order to avoid any conflict of interest, remuneration is managed 
through well-defined processes, ensuring no individual is involved  
in the decision-making process related to their own remuneration.

The Remuneration Committee also receives support from external 
advisors and evaluates the support provided by those advisors annually 
to ensure that advice is independent, appropriate, and cost-effective.

Remuneration Committee effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Remuneration Committee was considered as 
part of the external Board effectiveness review undertaken in 2023 by 
Chris Saul of Christopher Saul Associates, with the output considered 
and follow-up actions agreed by the Remuneration Committee. The 
review concluded that the Remuneration Committee continues to 
operate effectively.

In 2024, the Remuneration Committee will continue to focus on the 
renewal and approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the 
Company’s AGM in May 2024 and the ongoing integration of the 
Terminix acquisition, ensuring the right remuneration packages are in 
place to attract, motivate and retain talent. The Committee will also 
maintain its oversight of colleague reward given current macroeconomic 
challenges. Full details of the Board evaluation review, including its 
outcomes and actions, are disclosed on pages 112 and 113.

External advisors
Material advice and/or services were provided to the Remuneration 
Committee during the year by FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (FIT), 
which is retained to provide independent advice on executive 
remuneration matters and on the Company’s long-term incentive 
arrangements. FIT was appointed on 6 November 2018 by the 
Remuneration Committee following a review of its advisors. FIT is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its 
code in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. Fees 
charged during the year for advice to the Remuneration Committee  
by FIT were £102,130 and were accrued on a time and materials basis. 
FIT does not have any connection with the Company or any Director 
that may impair their independence, and the Remuneration Committee 
is satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and objective.

AGM voting outcomes
The outcome of the advisory vote in respect of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report at the 2023 AGM and the vote on the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy at the 2021 AGM are shown in the tables below.

The notes below have been audited.

Base salary 
• Base salary earned from 1 January to 31 December for each year.

Benefits
• Executive Directors are provided with family health insurance,  
health screening, life assurance, permanent health insurance,  
and a car allowance. 

• The value of the taxable benefit and includes the P11D value for  

health insurance and the gross cash car allowance. There were no 
other taxable benefits paid to Executive Directors in 2022 or 2023.

Pension
• Andy Ransom received a pension contribution, in the form of a cash 
supplement, worth 21.5% of salary in 2022 due to the cash amount 
being fixed in absolute terms and was reduced to 3% of base salary 
from January 2023 in line with the UK wider workforce. 

• Stuart Ingall-Tombs received a pension contribution, in the form  
of a cash supplement, worth 3% of base salary in line with the UK 
wider workforce. 

• Neither Andy Ransom or Stuart Ingall-Tombs, contributed to a 
Company pension scheme and do not have any prospective  
benefits under a Company defined benefit scheme.

Bonus
• In both years, 40% of the individuals bonus entitlement was awarded 
as deferred shares. These awards are subject to a three-year holding 
period, but are not subject to performance or service conditions.

• For 2023, Andy Ransom received 105.7% of salary and Stuart 

Ingall-Tombs received 105.7% of salary. See pages 141 and 142 for 
details of the 2023 bonus calculation.

PSP
• The 2023 single total figure includes the 2021 PSP, which is due to vest 
in March and May 2024. The value of the 2021 PSP at vest has been 
estimated based on the average of the Company’s share price over 
the last financial quarter of 2023, giving a price of 473.2p, and the 
anticipated performance outcomes, giving a vesting level of 48.7%. 
See page 144 for details. 

• The actual value of the 2021 PSP will be confirmed next year once  

the final performance outcome, the share price at the date of vesting, 
and the impact of dividend accrual are known.

• The 2020 PSP estimate included in the 2022 single figure has been 
restated. The award vested at 64.6%, which was above the estimate  
of 37.3%, due to an improvement in the Company’s TSR performance. 
The value has been restated to reflect the actual vesting level, actual 
share price at the date of vesting on 8 September 2023 of 589.0p,  
and the impact of dividend accrual. This has increased the value of  
the PSP outcome.

Annual bonus 2023
This section has been audited.

The annual bonus plan comprises three parts: gateway measures, 
Company performance, and personal performance. This means that 
bonuses earned reflect the performance of the constituent businesses 
which make up the overall Group performance, as well as achievement 
against specific personal objectives. The gateway measures and 
Company performance are measured against financial targets. The 
Executive Directors had a maximum bonus opportunity of 150% of salary 
if the Company financial targets are achieved in full and an opportunity 
to earn up to 30% based on personal performance, which is measured 
through the Group’s performance and development review process.

In total, the maximum bonus opportunity is up to 180% of salary.

2023 Annual bonus outcome
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the 2023 bonus plan outcome  
for the Group’s senior management population based on the targets set  
at the start of the financial year. The focus of the bonus was on rewarding 
sustainable profitable growth and delivery of Adjusted Free Cash Flow in 
order to align Executive Directors’ incentives with the Group’s strategy. For 
2023, Executive Directors had the opportunity to earn up to 180% of salary 
and 40% of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years.

Gateways
Structure
95% of the Profit target and an Adjusted Free Cash Flow gateway have 
to be reached at Group level before the financial performance element 
of the bonus can be paid.

measure and the result.

their personal performance against objectives measured through the 
Company’s performance and development review (PDR) process and 
objectives typically include areas such as people, customers, safety, 
systems, governance and control, and key strategic projects.

Rationale 
Careful consideration was given as to whether or not the outcomes were reflective of overall Company performance and appropriate in the context 
of the experience of wider stakeholders, particularly in relation to the ongoing cost-of-living challenges for colleagues and the impact of the 
reduction in share price following the quarter three update on shareholders, and was felt to be a fair reflection and that no discretion should be 
applied to adjust the outcome. The rationale for this included:
• The Company had another strong year in 2023, delivering profit and revenue figures above consensus and were accomplished despite significant 

inflation and other macroeconomic headwinds. Revenue grew by 45.8% and Adjusted Operating Profit by 57%. 

• The Company has strong alignment of incentives throughout management levels, which means that the Executive Director’s only achieve their 
annual bonus targets if the frontline and managers are achieving their incentives. The Company has also been very mindful of the impact of the 
cost-of-living challenges on our colleagues, particularly those on the frontline, and have used initiatives such as targeting higher salary increases  
at this population and one-off bonuses to help ease the pressures. See page 133 for further details.

• The outcome of the annual bonus was considered in conjunction with the estimated vesting level of PSP. On balance, it was felt that the formulaic 
outcomes of the PSP and annual bonus combined with the performance rating, fairly reflect overall performance. This took into consideration that 
the largest element of variable incentive, the PSP, directly reflects shareholder experience as the share price performance has impacted the 
estimated vesting of the 2021 PSP. The TSR element is currently below threshold and this element is likely to lapse. 

• The company element of the annual bonus, along with non-TSR element of the PSP recognised the significant strengthening of the underlying 

business and appropriately rewarded the Executive Directors for delivering numbers above analyst consensus set at the start of 2023 in a 
challenging year. The targets also evidence that we set stretching targets as the maximums are well above consensus.

• In addition, both the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer were awarded a PDR rating of 3 to reflect delivery of strong financial results and broad 

based delivery across all their goals balanced with consideration of shareholder experience.

Application of discretion
The Remuneration Committee has not applied discretion to the outcome of the annual bonus.

Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) awards
This section has been audited.

The PSP is the Company’s long-term incentive plan which the Executive Directors, ELT, and more than 1,100 managers and technical experts 
participate in. This participation supports the delivery of the Company’s strategic priorities. The DBP is the long-term incentive plan under which  
40% of any bonus payable to the Executive Directors is deferred in shares.

In-flight PSP target review
In line with the Remuneration Committee’s usual practice for large acquisitions, they reviewed the in-flight PSP targets to take into consideration the 
addition of Terminix. The focus of the review was to ensure that the targets remained as originally intended and had not inadvertently become easier 
or harder as a result of the acquisition. This resulted in the following changes: 

Organic Revenue Growth – the targets have been increased to reflect the inclusion of Terminix in the forecasts.

2021 PSP vesting level
The table below summarises the outcomes for each of the performance conditions. The Remuneration Committee has not applied discretion to the 
estimated outcome of the vesting as the outcome is felt to be fair in the context of the Company performance and experience of wider stakeholders 
over the three-year performance period. However, the targets were reviewed and discretion was applied by the Committee to adjust them to ensure 
that the targets remain as originally intended and have not become inadvertently easier or harder as a result of the Terminix acquisition as described 
in the section above. 

In addition, the Committee carefully considered the outcomes of the additional financial and strategic measures in the PSP to ensure that these had 
not been inadvertently made easier by inflationary increases or other impacts outside of management control.

Vesting is on a straight-line basis between threshold and target and between target and maximum, with the exception of TSR. No shares will vest 
if the performance is below the threshold for that measure. For the TSR, vesting is on a straight-line basis between median and upper quartile 
performance. The TSR performance period for the 2021 award is measured over a three-year period ending during the 2024 financial year. The TSR 
element of the award is therefore estimated using the TSR performance of the Company and comparator group to the end of February 2024.

1.  This estimate will be restated in next year’s Annual Report to reflect actual performance.
2.  The outcome of this metric was reviewed in detail to enable the Committee to fully understand why the performance was much higher than the target range. 

The results were considered excluding inflationary impacts to ensure that the underlying performance was at a consummate level to satisfy maximum vesting. 

2021 PSP awards vesting
Andy Ransom was granted an award of shares worth 250% of base salary in March 2021 and a further top-up grant in May 2021 following approval  
of the 2021 Policy at the AGM. Stuart Ingall-Tombs was granted an award 200% of base salary in March 2021. The aggregate number of shares 
estimated to vest in 2024 is summarised in the table below. The table also includes an estimate of the number of additional shares relating to 
dividends accrued throughout the performance period, which will be added to the final awards. The estimated value of the shares vesting is based 
on an average of the Company’s share price for the three months to 31 December 2023 of 473.2p. The Remuneration Committee has not exercised 
any discretion.

In addition, when determining the level of vesting, the Remuneration Committee will also consider the underlying financial performance of the

be appropriate.

Awards to Executive Directors under the 2023 PSP are set out in the table below and the number of shares awarded are the maximum entitlements 
and the actual number of shares (if any) which vest under the PSP will depend on the performance conditions being achieved as set out above. 
The awards granted were in the form of nil-cost options and may be exercised after vesting up to 10 years from the date of grant. The PSP awards 
are subject to a holding period of two years, which commences from the date of vest.

Use of discretion
The Remuneration Committee is cognisant of its responsibility to  
make informed and thoughtful decisions on remuneration that are  
both balanced and in the long-term interests of the business and 
shareholders and, where necessary, will apply discretion to 
remuneration targets or outcomes that otherwise would be 
inappropriate. The application of discretion over the last five years  
is detailed on page 135 and has mainly focused on the increase of  
EPS targets to take account of material acquisitions and disposals  
and the adjustment of the inflight PSP awards to ensure that the  
targets remain as originally intended and have not become 
inadvertently easier or harder as a result of the acquisition.

Remuneration in context
CEO pay ratio
The CEO pay ratio compares the CEO single figure earnings to the 
single figure earnings of UK colleagues. It has been calculated using 
method A, where the colleagues at each quartile are identified using 
details of their full-time equivalent pay and benefits for the year being 
measured. The effective date for the calculation is 31 December of the 
reporting year. For example, the 2023 colleague figures represent  
the full-time equivalent pay and benefits for 2023 for colleagues 
employed on 31 December 2023 and is calculated once the actual  
data is available, which means that no elements of pay are omitted or 
departures required from the methodology. This method was chosen 
as it best replicates the Chief Executive’s single figure.

The table below shows the ratios at the 25th percentile, median, and 
75th percentile for 2018 to 2023, and the corresponding value of pay 
and benefits:

The CEO ratios for 2023 have remained stable compared to 2022, this 
is due to the CEO’s single figure being lower than historical outcomes. 
The main reason for this is a lower vesting level of the PSP, the share  
price used for the valuation being lower, alongside the employee values 
remaining higher, which is partially due to colleagues being given the 
opportunity to increase their contractual hours and accordingly their pay.

This table will continue to be built on over time to cover a rolling 10-year 
period and will include reasons for the changes to the ratios from year 
to year. However, it is anticipated that variations in the PSP and annual 
bonus outcomes will have the biggest impact on the ratios. For PSP,  
this is due to vesting levels and the share price changing. For the  
annual bonus, although our comparator colleagues are also eligible  
for a bonus, the Chief Executive is targeted on Group-level outcomes, 
whereas our comparator colleagues are based on their specific remit, 
which given the UK makes up only a small percentage of the Group, 
means the outcomes may vary from year to year.

The median pay ratio is consistent with the pay, reward and progression, 
policies for the Company’s UK colleagues taken as a whole.

The Company has a consistent approach to reward across the Group 
and colleagues’ packages are set with reference to the external market.

Gender pay gap
The Company continues to have no material gender pay gap between 
men and women, with a median of -8.6% and a mean -10.0%, which is 
significantly better than the UK average of 14.3% reported by the Office 
for National Statistics, and means the median woman earns marginally 
more than the median man. These are encouraging results overall, and 
the Company is steadily increasing the number of women in senior roles. 
In addition, the Company’s reputation as an Employer of Choice has 
continued to grow with a significant number of female external hires.

The Company continues to be focused on making it an even more  
diverse and inclusive place to work and continues to see the benefits of 
the global DE&I upskilling programme that was rolled out to all middle  
and senior management across the world in 2022, covering around 1,000 
colleagues, and has continued to be rolled out to levels below this in 
2023. The key areas of focus continues to be increasing the number of 
female frontline technicians and improving the proportion of females in 
senior manager roles, in both the head office functions and operations.

Percentage change in remuneration
The table below sets out a comparison of the change in pay versus the previous year for the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Chairman, 
Non-Executive Directors’ and employees of Rentokil Initial plc for 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. This table will continue to be built on over time to 
cover a rolling five-year period. The percentage changes calculated on the actual remuneration received are distorted due to the remuneration 
received not being adjusted for in-year starters and leavers.

The percentage changes calculated on the actual remuneration received are distorted by two factors: firstly, initiatives undertaken in 2020 to help 
mitigate the impact of COVID-19, such as pay waivers in Q2 2020 and cancelling the annual bonus scheme have impacted the percentage changes; 
and secondly, the actual remuneration received is not adjusted for in-year starters and leavers.

Strategic ReportDirectors’ Annual Remuneration Report – Looking forward 2024

Executive Director base salaries from 1 January 2024
Executive Director and ELT salaries are typically reviewed with effect from 1 July each year in accordance with the prevailing Policy.

When reviewing salary levels, the Remuneration Committee takes into account a number of internal and external factors, including Company 
performance during the year, external market data, and the salary review principles applied to the rest of the organisation to ensure a consistent 
approach. The standard salary increases for the Executive Directors for 2024 are expected to be around 4.5% in line with the increases that are 
anticipated to be applied to management. The standard increases of the wider workforce in 2024 are expected to be higher, as the Company 
normally focus more of its pay review budget at the frontline. Due to the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment, this salary increase budget 
remains under review. 

At the same time as the Policy review, and in consultation with shareholders, the Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Executive Directors 
due to the significant growth in size and complexity of the Company following the Terminix acquisition in October 2022. The review took into 
consideration the impact of the changes to the business on the scope of the role, how the CEO’s and CFO’s skills and experience had developed 
since the last review in 2020 and appropriate benchmarks (see page 154). The proposed increases enable us to reward the Executive Directors 
appropriately and differentiate for their skills and experience, with the CEO proposed at median and the CFO at 95% of the median.

The Committee considered phasing the increases, however it felt that the increases had already been phased given the increase in the scope of

2024 annual bonus structure 
The focus of the bonus remains on rewarding sustainable profitable growth and delivery of Adjusted Free Cash Flow in order to align Executive 
Directors’ incentives with the Group’s strategy. Subject to approval of the Policy at the 2024 AGM, the Executive Directors will have the following 
bonus opportunity as a percentage of base salary.

Company performance 
• Gateways: 95% of the Profit target and an Adjusted Free Cash Flow gateway have to be reached at Group level before the financial performance 

element of the bonus can be paid.

• Financial performance: If both these profit and cash flow gateways are achieved, then Executive Directors can earn up to 195% of salary based on 

the achievement of financial targets.

Bonus targets have not been disclosed looking forward for 2024 as the Board believes that this information is commercially sensitive. Disclosing 
bonus targets could provide information about our business plans to our competitors, which could be damaging to our business interests and 
therefore to shareholders. However, retrospective bonus targets for 2024 will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report.

However, the Committee remain dedicated to ensuring that the bonus targets remain stretching and has determined that the uplift in bonus 
opportunity, proposed as part of the Policy review, will be fully based on the achievement of targeted and measurable financial results and for  
2024 will be aligned to the delivery of Organic Revenue Growth and integration synergy targets in our North America business.

Officer, an award of 300% of salary in line with the Policy, subject to confirmation that this remains appropriate at the time of grant.

Shares under the awards will be released no earlier than five years after grant (i.e. following a three-year vesting period and a two-year holding 
period). Vesting of this award will be determined by the Company’s performance as follows and performance between targets will be calculated 
on a straight-line basis:

colleague retention; customer satisfaction will be measured using average CVC scores; and vehicle fuel efficiency will be measured against an average 
reduction across our key countries.

The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that these targets represent a suitably stretching range in light of all relevant factors, including the current 
business plan and analysts’ forecasts.

When determining the level of vesting, the Remuneration Committee will also consider the underlying financial performance of the business, as well 
as the value added to shareholders during the performance periods, and may adjust the vesting outcome if it considers this to be appropriate.

Strategic ReportProposed 2024 Directors’ Remuneration Policy

Proposed changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
In setting the Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee have ensured that the arrangements are in the best 
interests of both the Company and its shareholders, by continuing to take into account the following general principles:
• to ensure that total remuneration packages are simple and fair in design;

• to ensure that total remuneration is highly weighted towards delivery of performance;

• to ensure that incentives balance the achievement of financial performance objectives and delivering sustainable profitable growth in the long 

term; and

• to provide a substantial proportion of performance-linked pay in shares allowing senior management to build a significant shareholding in the 

business and, therefore, aligning management with shareholders’ interests and the Group’s performance, without encouraging excessive 
risk-taking.

The table below summarises the proposed changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy). Details of how the Policy is proposed to be 
applied in 2024 can be found in pages 150 and 151.

Element

Current Policy

Base salary

Salaries are set taking into account a number of factors, including scope and 
responsibility of the role, external economic environment, and individual skills 
and experience, and will be reviewed following a significant change.

Increases are normally broadly in line with those awarded to the wider 
workforce in the UK. Adjustments to this may be made where the 
Remuneration Committee deems it appropriate.

Proposed change

None

Benefits

Pension

Annual 
bonus

Benefits provided at a rate commensurate with the market and include 
life assurance, car or car allowance, family healthcare, permanent health 
insurance, and relocation benefits.

None

Executive Directors may contribute to a defined contribution arrangement or 
receive a cash supplement in lieu of pension. Contributions are 3% of base 
salary in line with the wider workforce in the UK.

Permit alignment of pension provision with 
the wider workforce of the country where 
the Executive is based if it is outside the UK.

Maximum Bonus opportunity of 180% of base annual salary, with up to 150%  
of base salary based on delivery of Company performance and up to 30% of 
base salary on personal performance, against objectives measured through 
the Company’s performance and development review process.

Deferral of 40% of bonus into shares with a minimum three-year  
holding period.

Increased maximum opportunity of up to 
225% of base salary, with up to 195% of 
base salary subject to delivery of Company 
performance and up to 30% of base salary 
subject to personal performance.

Increased bonus deferral to 50% of bonus 
into shares with a minimum three-year 
holding period.

Rationale for change
Throughout the consultation process our shareholders were supportive of the proposal to increase the packages of the CEO 
and CFO to reflect the increase in size and complexity of the Company, they wanted to see a large proportion of any change 
delivered through variable pay.

Increasing the maximum bonus opportunity and the level of deferral at the same time, means that the Committee can align the 
bonus opportunity with market benchmarks, while ensuring the majority of the change will be delivered in the long term.

This is because 50% of any bonus earned would be converted to shares and held for a further three years. Currently, the annual 
bonus potential is 180% of base salary with a 40% deferral i.e., a maximum of 72% of base salary is deferred. Increasing the 
annual bonus potential to 225% with a 50% deferral results in up to 112.5% of base salary being deferred.

Proposed change

Shareholding 
guidelines

300% of salary for the CEO and 200% of salary for the CFO (within five years of 
appointment).

Post-cessation guidelines, which will normally require Executive Directors to 
hold shares, for two years post-cessation, to the value of the shareholding 
guideline that applied at the cessation of their employment; or, in cases where 
the individual has not had sufficient time to build up shares to meet their 
guideline, the actual level of shareholding at cessation.

Rationale for change
This change is proposed to align with best practice for companies of a similar size.

Increase shareholding guidelines to 400% 
of salary for the CEO and 300% of salary for 
the CFO

In addition, the Malus and Clawback Policy has been updated to reflect the Company’s status as a dual listed company. 

Overall rationale
The Remuneration Committee has been very mindful that the external environment continues to be unconducive to material pay increases when 
considering changes to the Policy; however, the Committee also recognises that it is incumbent upon them to ensure that we can effectively reward, 
motivate, and retain the high-performing Executive Directors, so they have worked to create a Policy that balances these considerations and will be 
effective at rewarding the Executive Directors appropriately over the next three years.

Consideration of shareholders’ views
The engagement with the Company’s top shareholders, which hold around 50% of its share capital, along with shareholder representative bodies/
proxy agencies, started in October 2023. The quality of engagement and input has been extremely helpful to the Committee and the Committee are 
grateful for the time invested by these shareholders and the practical suggestions as to how it might structure an appropriate level of remuneration 
potential for the future. 

There was much consistency in the feedback received and the table below shows how the feedback from shareholders was taken into 
consideration.

Shareholder feedback

How it was considered

Recognition of the capabilities 
of our management team and 
support to remunerate them 
competitively and in line with 
the market.

The Committee respected the responsibility the shareholders had given it to ensure that the CEO and CFO 
are rewarded appropriately. It carefully considered a number of benchmarks to support with setting an 
appropriate package. The Committee decided that it should ensure that base salary was set around the 
median and that the overall package should be structured to deliver an opportunity that was above median 
so that the package is set to reward outperformance.

A preference for any incremental 
opportunity to be balanced 
between fixed and performance 
based variable pay, rather than 
just fixed pay, which was initially 
contemplated.

Taking this feedback into consideration, the Committee made changes to the proposed Policy design.  
It considered both increases to short and long-term incentives and concluded that if it combined an increase  
in annual bonus opportunity, bringing it to benchmark levels, with an increase in deferral, the increase in 
short-term incentive would also increase the amount of remuneration that was delivered in the long term. 

The Committee felt that this offered a good balance as it broadly maintains the percentage of long-term 
remuneration at c.81% as a result of the increase in bonus deferral, notwithstanding the increase in annual 
bonus opportunity, supporting the Company’s commitment to deliver the vast majority of Executive Directors 
remuneration over the long term.

Consideration of phasing any 
base salary increases.

The Terminix acquisition was completed in October 2022 and the Committee considered it appropriate to 
maintain the then current packages for the remainder of the three-year policy and is only seeking to reflect 
the transaction as part of the policy renewal some 18 months later. 

Further, the salary increase will only take effect from 1 July 2024 in line with the Company’s annual salary 
review, so the increase will only take effect almost two years after the transaction. 

The Committee considers that this delay in the process inherently involves a phasing of the new package 
and, therefore, that it is appropriate to fully implement the changes from July 2024.

Share the benchmark data.

Details of the benchmarks used have been included in the section below.

Wider workforce engagement
The Remuneration Committee continued their engagement with the Company’s colleagues as part of the wider workforce engagement undertaken 
by the Board of Directors as set out on page 114. These activities have continued to build on practices that were already in place and embedded in 
the way they work. This approach has been undertaken because engaging with the wider workforce and understanding their views was already a 
practice that the Board has undertaken for many years prior to the introduction of these requirements by the Code. The Committee didn’t engage 
with the wider workforce specifically in relation to the proposed Policy design.

The existing approach was a proven way for colleagues’ views to be effectively shared with the Remuneration Committee and wider Board. The 
management team is trusted to bring key issues about colleagues to the Committee’s attention and there is a regular flow of information to the Board. 
Full details can be found on page 114, but these include the YVC survey results and action plans, Regional ‘deep dive’ presentations and Employer of 
Choice updates, which ensure that the Committee gets a rounded view from across the Group and gives a much better representation of our c.62,900 
colleagues’ views than, for example, conducting individual workshops, with a small number of colleagues. That said, in a normal year, the Board takes

Strategic ReportProposed 2024 Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
continued

time to meet colleagues during site visits, undertake ‘ride-alongs’ with specialists and technicians, and attend management meetings. Examples of 
activities that the Remuneration Committee has undertaken include a visit to North America, where the board met with the North American leadership 
team, attended a demonstration of pest control services at a customer site and took a tour of our Des Plains Facility which houses our Ambius, Target 
Specialty Products and Pest Control businesses, where the Committee had an opportunity to meet with colleagues from both businesses. The Chair of 
the Committee and other female Committee members have presented at an International Women’s Day event and attended a Senior Female Leaders 
Forum in the Pacific, where attendees were able to ask questions on a range of subjects, including remuneration. She has also met with members of the 
senior management team both formally and informally.

In addition to this, the Committee takes into account the pay of the wider workforce when making remuneration decisions for the Executive Directors 
and the ELT as was the normal practice prior to the change to the Code. This is achieved through relevant details about the wider workforce being 
disclosed to the Committee to provide context when it is making pay decisions. For example, when making salary decisions, the Committee is 
provided with details of the overall approach for the Group, as well as senior leader and general colleague recommendations for the specific 
countries in which the Executive Directors and ELT reside. This means, for example, that the approach to pay increases for frontline technicians and 
managers in Singapore would be taken into account when making decisions about the pay for the Regional Managing Director for Asia & MENAT, 
who lives and works in Singapore.

Consideration of cost-of-living challenges
As detailed on page 133, the Committee took into consideration how colleagues have been impacted by the cost-of-living challenges and how the 
Company had responded to this.

Benchmark data
The Committee adopted a UK FTSE market benchmark given that many of the largest UK companies are global. The Committee considered how 
best to reflect our significant presence in North America and, notwithstanding the different pay practices and levels there, that the broad-based 
FTSE was suitable given that many UK-based companies have operations in the US. In addition the Company’s Executive Directors are based in 
the UK. 

The Committee used the market data as a reference point for the overall sizing of the proposed packages given the significant changes in the 
business and the associated demands upon its leadership as a consequence. The framework remains unchanged; it aims to deliver the fixed 
element of remuneration around market median and provide the opportunity to achieve up to the upper quartile for outstanding performance. 
This ensures that remuneration is weighted to performance and is variable.

When the Committee started the review in July 2023, the benchmark used was the FTSE 15 – 50, excluding financial services. Given the shareholder 
experience in the second half of 2023, it was felt appropriate to revise the market benchmark downwards accordingly. Therefore, a lower market 
benchmark was adopted of the FTSE 21 – 50, excluding financial services. While the share price has been volatile, in the round, this peer group is 
felt to reflect our overall size and complexity having regard to the increased revenue and increased scope of the Company’s international activities. 

The Committee felt that setting the total opportunity above the median is appropriate for our CEO as it recognises his high level of experience, 
with more than 10 years in position, and his delivery of superior returns for all our stakeholders during his tenure. Over the review period, various 
institutional investor guidelines have been updated to recognised that it may be appropriate to include global (i.e. the US) based companies within 
benchmark data. The Committee consciously decided not to do this and, consequently, the data used includes an element of conservatism.

The graphs below show how the CEO and CFO compared to the benchmarks selected.

Wider workforce remuneration policy
During 2023, the Company had approximately 62,900 colleagues based in 90 countries. We have a broad remuneration policy which reflects the 
diversity of cultures, legislative environments, employment markets, and the types and seniority of roles that this geographic spread requires. 
The Company structures colleagues’ reward to enable it to recruit and retain the right people, doing the right job for its customers. The following 
summary provides additional context but does not formally form part of the Policy and may change from time to time. 

The Remuneration Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the senior remuneration policy and has regard to its impact and 
compatibility with remuneration policies in the wider workforce.

The principles that the Company follows include:
• competitive: setting pay with reference to internal relativity and external market practices;

• simple: helping all employees to understand how they are rewarded;

• fair: achieving consistent outcomes through flexible and transparent policies; and

• sustainable: aligning reward to business strategy and performance.

The table below compares the typical wider workforce policy with the proposed 2024 Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

Wider workforce policy

Comparison with 2024 Directors’ Remuneration Policy

Base salary

No difference.

Salaries are set taking into account:
• scope and responsibilities of the role;
• individual skills and experience;
• pay conditions for other colleagues based in the country; and
• comparable salaries in companies of a similar size and complexity.

Salaries are reviewed on an annual basis and budgets are typically 
set at a country level, taking into account local differences.

Annual salary budgets are set taking into account affordability, 
economic data including price inflation and unemployment, and 
market practices.

Benefits

Benefits are determined at a country level and are aligned with 
typical market practice in that country.

No difference.

Eligibility to benefits differs by work level.

Pension

Pension benefits are provided in countries where this is a typical 
market practice. The level of benefit typically differs by work level.

Executive Directors’ pensions are in line with the wider 
workforce for the country they are based in.

Annual bonus

The management team across the Group are eligible to participate in 
an annual bonus scheme.

The Company element and the Group targets work in 
broadly the same way as the management scheme.

The scheme has a company and personal element. Payout under the 
company element is determined by performance against financial 
targets such as revenue, profit, and cash. Targets are tailored to the 
area of business responsibility for the management team, rather than 
based on Group-level outcomes.

An individual modifier, based on personal performance, is applied to 
the bonus outcome under the financial element.

Bonus opportunities are differentiated by work level, but are 
consistent across all countries in the Group at each level.

Frontline employees in sales and service are eligible to participate in 
monthly or quarterly incentives and/or commission schemes.

The personal element is measured in the same way 
as the wider workforce, but is calculated as part of the 
bonus rather than as a modifier. This change was made 
to align Executive Director bonus design with market 
practice, following feedback from shareholders about 
the complexity of the modifier arrangement.

The modifier arrangement was retained for the wider 
management scheme as it is well understood within the 
Company, and making changes to the bonus scheme at 
this time was not felt to be optimal. However, it may be 
relooked at as part of a broader review in the future.

PSP

The management team across the Group are eligible to participate  
in the Company’s PSP. Executive Directors’ awards are identical,  
but are also subject to a two-year holding period.

No difference to how the PSP award operate,

Executive Directors are subject to an additional  
two-year holding period.

Eligibility is determined by work level and award levels differentiated 
by grade. Awards are based on a percentage of salary and are 
subject to the achievement of performance conditions over the 
three-year performance period.

For North American colleagues only, the Company operates 
a Restricted Share Plan, that was implemented to support the 
integration of Terminix.

In conclusion
As shown above, we have listened carefully to the feedback received from our shareholders. We have actioned many of the changes proposed and believe 
that this proposal offers an approach that recognises the increase in size and complexity of the Company following the Terminix acquisition and rewards our 
Executive Directors appropriately, while ensuring that they remain incentivised to outperform, due to the proportion of the package weighted to incentives.

Strategic ReportProposed 2024 Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
continued

This part of the Remuneration Report sets out the proposed 2024 Directors’ Remuneration Policy and has been developed taking into account the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and the views of the Company’s major shareholders. 

The Policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2024 AGM, to be held on 8 May 2024 and, subject to shareholder approval, will take  
formal effect from the conclusion of the AGM. The proposed Policy is broadly consistent with the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy which was 
approved by shareholders at the 2021 AGM. Key areas of difference between the current and proposed policies are set out in the table on pages 152 
and 153. The current Directors’ Remuneration Policy is available to view on the Company’s website at rentokil-initial.com/investors/governance.

The information provided in this section of the Remuneration Report is not subject to audit.

Base salary

Purpose/link to strategy To attract and retain executives of the calibre required to implement our strategy.
Operation

Base salaries are payable in cash and are normally reviewed annually. Base salaries are set taking into account:
• scope and responsibilities of the role;
• external economic environment;
• individual skills and experience;
• contribution to overall business performance;
• pay conditions for other colleagues based in the UK and other regions which are considered by the Remuneration 

Committee to be relevant for that executive; and

• comparable salaries in a cross-section of companies of a similar size and complexity at the time of review – which will be 

taken into consideration, but not be the key determiner of salary levels.

Base salaries are set at an appropriate level taking into account the factors described under ‘Operation’ above 
and salary increases are considered in this context. The maximum salary level is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee taking into account these factors.

The Remuneration Committee would normally expect percentage pay increases for the Executive Directors to be 
broadly in line with the wider workforce in relevant regions. However, higher increases may be awarded in certain 
circumstances, where the Remuneration Committee considers this appropriate, such as:
• where a new Executive Director has been appointed to the Board at a lower than typical market salary to allow for growth 
in the role, then larger increases may be awarded in following years to move salary positioning closer to typical market 
levels as the executive grows in experience, subject to performance;

• where the Executive Director has been promoted or has had a change in responsibilities, salary increases in excess of the 

above level may be awarded; or

• a substantial change in the Company’s size or market capitalisation leading to the positioning of an Executive Director’s 

salary falling behind market practice.

In exceptional circumstances, where a Non-Executive Director temporarily takes up an executive position, salary 
increases for the Non-Executive Director may be awarded as appropriate.
The payment of salary is not dependent on achieving performance targets, although individual performance is taken 
into account when setting salary levels and determining any salary increases.

Pension

Purpose/link to strategy To facilitate Executive Directors’ planning for retirement.
Operation

Executive Director pension arrangements are by way of a defined contribution arrangement or through a cash 
alternative of a similar value, or a combination of the two.
The maximum contribution will be in line with the wider workforce in the UK, which is currently 3% of base salary, 
although this rate may change from time to time. Should an Executive Director be appointed in a country other than the 
UK, a maximum contribution appropriate to that market would be considered. 
Not applicable.

Benefits

Purpose/link to strategy To provide market-competitive benefits that support the executive to undertake their role.
Operation

The Company pays the cost of providing the benefits on a monthly, annual, or one-off basis. Benefits are determined 
taking into account market practice, the level and type of benefits provided throughout the Group, and individual 
circumstances and the benefits provided may be reviewed from time to time. All benefits are non-pensionable.  
The main benefits for Executive Directors are currently:
• life assurance;
• car or car allowance;
• family healthcare;
• permanent health insurance; and
• relocation benefits – in the event that an executive were required to relocate to undertake their role, the Remuneration 

Committee may provide an additional appropriate level of benefits to reflect the relevant circumstances. Such benefits may 
be one-off or ongoing in nature.

Should an Executive Director be appointed in a country other than the UK, benefits appropriate to that market would 
be considered. The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to change the benefits provided (including offering 
additional benefits) in line with market practice and may include offering participation in any future all-employee share plan.
Levels of benefits are set in line with market practice. The level of benefits provided varies year on year depending on the 
cost of the provision of benefits to the Company and therefore it is not meaningful to identify a maximum level of benefits.

that contribute to Company performance.
To attract and retain executives of the calibre required to implement our strategy and drive business performance.
The deferral of an element of the annual bonus into shares provides alignment with shareholders’ long-term interests 
following the successful delivery of short-term targets and supports the balance of achievement of short-term and long-term 
business performance.
The annual bonus is paid each year after the Remuneration Committee has reviewed performance against targets, which are 
set around the beginning of each year for each Executive Director, taking into consideration the underlying performance of  
the business.
Normally no more than 50% of any bonus is generally paid in cash, with the balance deferred in shares under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan (DBP).
Deferred shares typically vest after a period of three years with no further performance conditions.
Shares awarded under the DBP are typically awarded as nil-cost options and have an exercise period that extends from the 
date of vesting to the 10th anniversary of the award being made, although awards may be structured in other ways. If nil-cost 
options remain exercisable at the 10th anniversary of grant then they will be exercised automatically on a participant’s behalf.
The Remuneration Committee retains the right to exercise discretion to ensure that the level of bonus payable is appropriate 
and a fair reflection of the Company’s performance.
Malus and clawback rules apply to both cash bonus payments and DBP awards (see Malus and Clawback section for details).
Deferred shares may be adjusted in accordance with the rules in the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital, 
demerger, special dividend, or similar event that materially affects the price of shares.
Bonus payouts start to accrue at a level of up to 20% of base salary for meeting threshold levels of performance and 
a maximum opportunity of 225% of base salary, with an on-target bonus opportunity of no more than 50% of the 
maximum opportunity.
Payouts for performance levels in between these levels will typically be paid on a straight-line basis.
Dividend equivalents accrue between grant date and vesting date on shares that vest under the DBP and are normally 
settled in the form of additional shares.
The annual bonus is normally based on the achievement of financial targets and/or personal objectives, although the 
Committee measures and period may include other strategic priorities. Performance is typically tested over a one-year 
performance period.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to set appropriate measures that ensure alignment with business 
strategy and shareholder interest, subject to the financial measures accounting for at least 75% of the total.
Financial measures may be linked to Group performance or the executive’s specific area of responsibility,  
if appropriate.
If events happen which cause the Remuneration Committee to consider that a performance condition would not, without 
alteration, achieve its original purpose, it may amend that performance condition provided that the amended performance 
condition is materially no less challenging than it would have been had the event not occurred.
The Remuneration Committee retains the right to exercise discretion to ensure that the formulaic vesting outcome is 
appropriate and a fair reflection of the Company’s performance.

growth in value for shareholders.
To act as a retention tool for Executive Directors.
The PSP operates under the rules approved by shareholders in 2016 (and as amended).
An award of shares is granted on an annual basis with a face value in line with the multiple of base salary approved by the 
Remuneration Committee, with vesting subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
Shares awarded under the PSP are typically awarded as nil-cost options (although may be structured in other ways) and 
have an exercise period that extends from the date of vesting to the 10th anniversary of the award being made. If nil-cost 
options remain exercisable at the 10th anniversary of grant then they will be exercised automatically on a participant’s 
behalf.
Award levels and performance conditions are set to support the business’s long-term goals and seek to reflect market 
practice and shareholder guidance.
Awards are subject to a two-year holding period post vesting. Directors may sell sufficient shares to pay taxes due related  
to the award, if required, during this period.
Malus and clawback rules apply to shares awarded under the PSP (see Malus and Clawback section for details).
Awards may be adjusted in accordance with the rules in the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital, demerger, 
special dividend, or similar event that materially affects the price of shares.
The maximum regular annual award will be 375% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 300% of base salary for the 
Chief Financial Officer and any other Executive Directors. 
No more than 20% of the award shall vest for meeting threshold levels of performance and 100% of the award shall vest if 
maximum performance is achieved. Performance between these points will typically be measured on a straight-line basis.
Dividend equivalents may accrue between grant date and vesting date or to the end of the holding period on shares that 
vest under the PSP and are normally settled in the form of additional shares.

Awards are subject to the achievement of financial and ESG/strategic measures, with specific measures and weightings  
set by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure alignment with the business strategy at the time of grant.  
However, a minimum weighting of 75% should relate to financial (including TSR) measures. Potential measures include:
• relative TSR performance;
• Organic Revenue Growth;
• Adjusted Free Cash Flow conversion; and
• ESG measures (colleague retention, customer satisfaction, and vehicle fuel intensity).
If events happen which cause the Remuneration Committee to consider that a performance condition would not, without 
alteration, achieve its original purpose, it may amend that performance condition provided that the amended performance 
condition is materially no less challenging than it would have been had the event not occurred.
The Remuneration Committee retains the right to exercise discretion to ensure that the formulaic vesting outcome is 
appropriate and a fair reflection of the Company’s performance.

Shareholding guidelines

Purpose/link to strategy Encourages greater levels of shareholding and aligns Executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders.
Operation

Executive Directors are expected to achieve and maintain a holding of the Company’s shares.

A further post-cessation shareholding requirement will normally apply to Executive Directors (see Termination section 
for details). For two years following cessation of employment, Executive Directors will be required to hold shares to 
the value of the shareholding guideline that applied at the cessation of their employment unless the Remuneration 
Committee exceptionally determines otherwise; or, in cases where the individual has not had sufficient time to build up 
shares to meet their guideline, the actual level of shareholding at cessation.
Chief Executive: 400% of salary; Chief Financial Officer and other Executive Directors: 300% of salary. To be achieved

Illustration of proposed Directors’ Remuneration Policy for 2024

The charts opposite provide an illustration of what could be 
received by each of the Executive Directors in 2024, including 
how a 50% increase in the share price could impact what they 
receive.

These charts are illustrative, as the actual value that will be 
received will depend on business performance in 2024 for the 
bonus and in the three-year period to 2027 for the PSP, as well as 
share price performance to the date of exercise for awards made 
under the DBP and the PSP.

Our remuneration arrangements are designed so that a 
significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of 
short and long-term goals that are aligned with our strategic 
objectives and the creation of shareholder value.

Measures and targets
All the performance measures selected, both in the financial and  
ESG/strategic categories, support the delivery of short and long-term 
financial performance of the business and shareholder value creation. 
Targets are set each year based on stretching internal budgets,  
and achieving or exceeding these targets will both return value  
to shareholders and reward the executive team for delivery.

The annual bonus measures are reviewed annually to focus on delivery 
of key financial targets and strategic goals for the forthcoming year,  
as well as key strategic or operational goals relevant to the individual. 
Over the long term, PSP performance measures are focused on 
generating returns to shareholders through the relative TSR measure 
and other measures focus on improving business performance.

Malus and clawback
Malus and clawback rules apply to the Executive Directors’ incentive 
arrangements. Under these provisions, the Remuneration Committee at 
their discretion may reduce bonus payments in respect of the current 
year or future years and have the ability to scale back awards that have 
not yet vested under the Company’s PSP or DBP (potentially to nil) in the 
event of:
• a material misstatement of the Company’s audited results for the 

current year or prior years;

• the discovery that an assessment of performance connected to the 
award (including relating to the original bonus amount for the DBP) 
was based on misleading or inaccurate information;

• there has been fraud or gross misconduct, or circumstances which, 
in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, would entitle the 
Company or any other member of the Group to summarily dismiss 
the individual; 

• in the case of Malus only, actions which result in serious reputational 

damage or corporate failure affecting any part of the Group; or

• in the case of malus only, circumstances where the Remuneration 

Committee, in its discretion, considers that this treatment is 
appropriate.

For bonus, a clawback provision exists to give the Remuneration 
Committee, in the same circumstances to malus, the ability to recover 
sums already paid for up to two years after bonus determination.

For PSP, a clawback provision exists to give the Remuneration 
Committee, in the same circumstances as malus, the ability to recover 
sums already paid for up to five years from the grant date.

In addition, a separate clawback policy applies as required to comply 
with SEC regulations in the US.

The Committee reserves the right to amend the various malus and 
clawback provisions from time to time where it considers that to be 
appropriate and in line with wider practice elsewhere.

Use of discretion
The Remuneration Committee is cognisant of its responsibility to  
make informed and thoughtful decisions on remuneration that  
are both balanced and in the long-term interests of the business  
and shareholders and, where necessary, will apply discretion  
to remuneration targets or outcomes that would otherwise  
be inappropriate.

In addition, the Remuneration Committee also retains the right to  
apply discretion in the operation and administration of the incentive 
plans. This includes, but is not limited to, the following areas: setting 
appropriate performance conditions, weightings and targets from year 
to year for the PSP and annual bonus, the timing of PSP and DBP grants, 
the timing of annual bonus payments, the size of PSP awards granted, 
and determining the treatment of leavers.

Any discretion applied will be in accordance with the respective plan 
rules (or relevant documentation) and within the limits of the Policy.

Recruitment
Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee’s key principle when determining 
appropriate remuneration arrangements for a new Executive Director 
(whether appointed from within the organisation or externally) is to 
ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company 
and its shareholders, without paying more than is considered necessary 
by the Remuneration Committee to recruit an executive of the required 
calibre to develop and deliver the business strategy. When determining 
appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Remuneration Committee 
will take into account all relevant factors. These factors may include 
(among others):
• the level and type of remuneration opportunity being forfeited;

• the jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from and whether any 

relocation is required;

• the skills, experience, and calibre of the individual;

• the circumstances of the individual; and

• the current external market and salary practice, including market 

practice on additional benefits.

The Remuneration Committee would comply with the terms of the 
Remuneration Policy outlined in the table on pages 156 to 158.

In addition, if necessary, it may make awards on appointing an Executive 
Director to ‘buy out’ remuneration terms forfeited on leaving a previous 
employer. In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will take account  
of relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to 
these awards, the form in which they were granted (e.g. cash or shares) 
and the time over which they would have vested. Generally, buy-out 
awards will be made on a comparable basis to those forfeited but,  
in any event, will reflect those terms in some way (e.g. through a more 
substantial discount to the amount).

In the event of recruitment, the Remuneration Committee may grant 
awards to a new Executive Director under Listing Rule 9.4.2R, which 
allows for the granting of awards, to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, 
the recruitment of an Executive Director, without seeking prior 
shareholder approval or under other appropriate Company share  
plans. The use of Listing Rule 9.4.2R will be limited to granting buy-out 
awards only.

In the event that an internal candidate was promoted to the Board, 
legacy terms and conditions may be honoured, including any 
outstanding incentive awards and the exercise of any discretion in 
connection with such payments. Similarly, if an Executive Director is 
appointed following the Company’s acquisition of or merger with 
another company, legacy terms and conditions would be honoured; 
however, steps would be taken to align with the Policy over time.

In the event of the appointment of a new Chair of the Board or 
Non-Executive Director, remuneration arrangements will normally 
reflect the Policy outlined on page 150.

The Remuneration Committee’s intention is that timely disclosure of the 
remuneration structure of any new Executive Director or Chair of the 
Board will be made by the Company wherever practical.

Directors’ service agreements – Executive Directors
Executive Directors are employed on permanent contracts, which are 
terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party. A description of the 
payment in lieu of notice provisions can be found below. The Company’s 
policy in respect of the notice periods for the termination of Executive 
Directors’ contracts conforms to the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The remuneration and contractual arrangements for the Executive 
Directors and senior management do not contain any matters that are 
required to be disclosed under the Takeover Directive. The contracts  
of service for Executive Directors are available for inspection by 
shareholders at the Company’s registered office.

continued

Termination
When an Executive Director leaves the business on the basis of mutual 
agreement, the Remuneration Committee will determine an appropriate 
payment taking into account the circumstances of leaving, but any 
payment will be no more generous than that for leavers by reason of 
disability, ill health, retirement, redundancy, death, or sale of an 
individual employing business.

Base pay and benefits
Executive Directors are entitled to a payment in lieu of notice equal to 
base pay and the value of benefits only for the duration of the remaining 
notice period, subject to mitigation. The Company has the ability to 
terminate Executive Directors’ employment, in the event of a prolonged 
mental or physical incapacity to carry out his/ her Company duties and 
without notice (summary dismissal), in the event of gross misconduct or 
being disqualified to act as a Director. Appropriate medical benefits may 
still be provided in the case of prolonged mental or physical incapacity.

Other
Executive Directors may be entitled to other payments including, but not 
limited to, costs of appropriate repatriation/relocation, outplacement, 
settlement agreement, non-compete agreement, legal and/or tax and 
other relevant professional costs. The Remuneration Committee would 
look to ensure that the level of these costs/benefits was reasonable and 
in the best interests of shareholders.

Bonus including Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)

Cash bonus
In the event of retirement, death, disability, redundancy, change of 
control, sale of the employing company, or any other circumstance at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, Executive Directors may 
receive a bonus payment for the year in which they cease employment. 
This payment will normally be pro-rated for time and performance; 
however, the Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to review 
overall business and individual performance and determine that a 
different level of bonus payment is appropriate.

Otherwise, generally, Executive Directors must be employed at the  
date of payment to receive a bonus. In certain circumstances, the 
Remuneration Committee may determine that a bonus payment may be 
due to reflect performance and contribution to the point of cessation.

DBP – leaving before date of vest
Deferred bonus shares will normally vest in full following completion of 
the three-year vesting period, unless the Committee determines in its 
absolute discretion that vesting will be accelerated. Participants will 
have six months from the date of vest to exercise.

The vesting of awards will be accelerated in the event of death and 
there will be a period of 12 months from death to exercise (or up to 
24 months if the Remuneration Committee so determines).

DBP – leaving after date of vest
The Executive Director will normally have six months in which to 
exercise their awards from the date of leaving (12 months for death 
(or up to 24 months if the Remuneration Committee so determines)).

Performance Share Plan (PSP)

Leaving before the end of the performance period
In the event of ill health, disability, death, retirement, redundancy, 
change of control, sale of the employing company, or any other 
circumstance at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, awards 
will vest on the original vesting date on a time-apportioned basis (unless 
the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise). Performance will 
be measured at the end of the original performance period. Participants 
will have six months from the end of the holding period to exercise.

At the Remuneration Committee’s discretion in the event of ill health, 
disability, or death (or in the event of any other exceptional circumstance 
if it determines), awards can vest early on a time-apportioned basis.  
In this circumstance, performance will be measured to the early  
vesting date. Participants will have six months from leaving to exercise 
(12 months for death (or up to 24 months if the Remuneration Committee 
so determines)).

160 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

If participants leave for any other reason before the end of the 
performance period, their award will lapse on termination.

Leaving after the end of the performance period
Any awards in the two-year holding period will be available to exercise 
following completion of the two-year holding period. Participants will 
have six months from the latest of the end of the holding period or the 
leaving date to exercise (12 months for death (or up to 24 months if the 
Remuneration Committee so determines)).

Post-cessation shareholding requirement
For two years following the cessation of employment, Executive 
Directors will normally be required to hold shares to the value of  
the shareholding guideline that applied at the cessation of their 
employment; or, in cases where the individual has not had sufficient 
time to build up shares to meet their guideline, the actual level of 
shareholding at cessation.

The post-cessation shareholding requirement is to be satisfied from 
shares vesting under the DBP and PSP from grants from 2021 onwards. 
On exercise, sufficient shares may be sold to cover taxes due, but until 
the shareholding requirement is met the remaining shares will be held 
by the Company in nominee/escrow for the benefit of the Director.

If the Executive Director has met the shareholding requirement through 
other means, with the exception of shares bought with their own funds, 
and the above approach results in a shortfall at the date of leaving, the 
Executive Director will be required to transfer the appropriate number 
of shares into the nominee/escrow in order to meet the requirement.

In the event of ill health, disability, or death (or in the event of any  
other exceptional circumstance that the Remuneration Committee 
determines), the post-cessation shareholding requirement will not apply.

Chair of the Board and Non-Executive 
Directors
Fees

Approach
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is determined by the Board on 
the recommendation of the Non-Executive Directors’ Terms Committee 
of the Board (comprising the Chair of the Board, the Chief Executive, 
and the Chief Financial Officer) within the limits set by the Articles of 
Association. Non-Executive Directors’ fees are set at a level which  
is considered appropriate for the calibre of individual required to 
support the delivery of business strategy and taking into account skills, 
experience, time commitment, and independent surveys of fees paid 
to Non-Executive Directors of similar companies.

Fees for the Chair of the Board are determined by the Board based on 
external remuneration advice and considered by the Remuneration 
Committee taking into account typical fee arrangements at other 
companies of a similar size and complexity, the time commitment 
required to fulfil the role, and the calibre of the individual required. 
Fees are reviewed at appropriate intervals.

Details
Non-Executive Directors’ fees are payable in cash and currently consist 
of a basic fee plus additional fees payable to:
• the Senior Independent Director; and

• the Board Committee Chairs.

Additional fees may be paid to Non-Executive Directors on an ongoing 
or temporary basis if there is a change in their responsibilities or a 
significant increase in the time commitment required from them to  
fulfil their role or to remain competitive.

The fees for Non-Executive Directors, including the Chair of the Board, 
shall not exceed in aggregate £1,000,000 per annum or such higher 
amount as the Company may from time to time by special resolution 
determine, as set out in the Company’s Articles of Association.

Other items
No element of Non-Executive Director remuneration is 
performance-related.

The Chair of the Board and the Non-Executive Directors do not 
participate in any of the Company’s incentive schemes, nor are they 
eligible to join the Company’s pension scheme.

The Non-Executive Directors do not currently receive any other 
benefits. However, benefits may be provided in the future if, in the view 
of the Non-Executive Directors’ Terms Committee (for Non-Executive 
Directors or the Remuneration Committee for the Chair of the Board), 
this was considered appropriate. Non-Executive Directors who are 
based outside the UK may be provided with support in relation to their 
tax reporting.

Letters of appointment 

Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are each appointed by a letter of 
appointment and either party may terminate the appointment on three 
months’ written notice. The Non-Executive Directors are subject to 
annual re-election at the AGM and are generally not expected to serve 
for a period exceeding nine years. See pages 99 to 101 for details of 
their appointment dates.

Chair of the Board
The Chair of the Board has a letter of appointment setting out his 
responsibilities for the management of the Board. The Chairman’s 
contract may be terminated by either party on six months’ notice, 
notwithstanding a requirement for annual re-election at the AGM.

Copies of the Chair of the Board and Non-Executive Directors’ letters 
of appointment are available for inspection by shareholders at the 
Company’s registered office.

Remuneration Policy – other information
Change of control
If the Company is taken over or wound up, PSP awards may vest by 
reference to the extent to which the performance conditions are met 
and on a time pro-rated basis (calculated on a monthly basis) unless, in 
the case of pro-rating, the Remuneration Committee decides otherwise. 
Outstanding PSP awards may be vested automatically on a change of 
control on the participants’ behalf. Typically salaries and bonuses will be 
paid to the date of change of control.

DBP awards shall vest in full. If participants are offered, and consent to, 
an equivalent award in the new company, they will not vest and instead 
will be exchanged for a new award. Participants have one month from 
the change of control date to exercise their award; any options that are 
not exercised at the end of that period will be automatically exercised.

Legacy arrangements
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any 
remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including 
exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such 
payments), notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy 
set out above, where the terms of the payment were agreed:
• before the date the Company’s first Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
approved by shareholders in accordance with section 439A of the 
Companies Act 2006 came into effect;

• before the Directors’ Remuneration Policy set out above came into 
effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with  
the shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy in force at 
the time they were agreed; or

• at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the 
Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, 
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming 
a Director of the Company. For these purposes, ‘payments’ includes 
the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms 
of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. The 
Remuneration Committee may make minor amendments to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or 
administrative purposes, or to take account of a change in legislation) 
without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.

Corporate Governance

Financial Statements

Other Information

UK Corporate Governance Code provisions
As part of the review of the Policy and approving the Directors 
Remuneration Report, the Remuneration Committee has addressed the 
factors set out in Provision 40 of the UK Corporate Governance Code as 
set out below:
• Clarity – When considering and structuring any element of 
remuneration, the Remuneration Committee aimed to be as 
straightforward and transparent as possible. It also looked to ensure 
that the remuneration vehicles used were clear and understandable 
and the targets, outcomes and any other decisions are able to be 
communicated in an open and detailed way. In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee has endeavoured to ensure that, in 
approving the Directors’ Remuneration Report, they are providing an 
extensive and clear picture of the remuneration arrangements and 
decisions undertaken each year. For instance, full details are shared 
about the Committee’s assessment of the consideration given to 
shareholder experience when assessing the incentive outcomes for 
2023 (see pages 142 and 144).

• Simplicity – When determining the structure and mechanisms of 

remuneration packages, consideration was given to ensuring that 
complexity was avoided and that both our colleagues and our 
shareholders would be able to easily understand the rationale for  
and the operation of any incentive. 

• Risk – The Remuneration Committee has a history of restraint and 

closely monitors remuneration structures and outcomes in relation to 
the strategy and financial performance, in order to ensure that only 
appropriate behaviour is incentivised and rewards are not excessive. 
The Committee has shown a willingness to apply discretion to adjust 
targets upwards where it has felt it is appropriate, and outcomes could 
otherwise misalign with performance and therefore create a risk to the 
business and shareholders (see page 135). Risk is also considered in 
the context of the Group’s wider risks (see Risks and Uncertainties on 
pages 87 to 93). 

• Predictability – The Remuneration Committee encourages and 
oversees the use and replication of our annual bonus and PSP 
schemes globally and deep into the organisation, ensuring colleagues 
understand and become familiar with how we recognise and reward 
performance, by keeping plan designs and metrics consistent from 
year to year, and that as many people as possible share in the success 
of the organisation. Remuneration structures, including grading and 
reward programmes, are consistently applied and appropriate at each 
level of the organisation.

• Proportionality – The Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that 
remuneration payouts awarded to the Executive Directors, the ELT, 
and the wider workforce are consistent with performance outcomes 
and with the experience felt by shareholders. The Committee 
considers carefully the stretch built into targets and ensures that 
outcomes linked to certain levels of performance are stretching, 
while achievable, and therefore motivating for colleagues, as well 
as satisfying shareholder expectations.

• Alignment with culture – The Remuneration Committee strives to 
ensure that remuneration arrangements drive both financial and 
non-financial performance, as well as behaviours consistent with our 
purpose, values, and vision. Details of our culture can be found on 
page 5. Our colleagues are integral to our business model as set out 
on pages 14 to 15 and pages 69 to 70 and as such the Remuneration 
Committee has regard to the balance of fixed and variable pay to 
ensure the right level of reward and incentive is available to both recruit 
and retain the talent needed to deliver our long-term strategic plan. 
Relevant ESG focused measures have also been built into the PSP.

Strategic ReportReport on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:

• Rentokil Initial plc’s Group financial statements and Parent Company 
financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2023 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s cash 
flows for the year then ended;

• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 

accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006;

• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 

prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including 
FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and

• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 

requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual 
Report, which comprise: the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance 
Sheets as at 31 December 2023; the Consolidated Statement of Profit or 
Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement for the year then ended; and the Notes to the Group 
and Parent Company financial statements, which include a description 
of the Material accounting policies and the Related Undertakings.

Our audit approach
Overview
Audit scope
• We performed full scope audits at six components across North 

America, Europe (including LATAM), the UK & Sub-Saharan Africa  
and Pacific as well as a full scope audit at one corporate component. 
We performed specific audit procedures at three components in  
North America and Europe (including LATAM).

• The territories where we conducted audit procedures, together  

with work performed at corporate functions and at the Group level, 
accounted for approximately: 72% of the Group’s revenue and 71% of 
the Group’s Adjusted Profit before Tax. One full scope component  
in the US and the full scope component in France comprise sub 
consolidations; in calculating these coverage levels we have taken 
100% coverage from the full scope audits performed in these locations.

• Certain Parent Company account balances were included in scope  
for the audit of the consolidated financial statements. However, we 
determined that the Parent Company did not require a full scope audit 
of its complete financial information for the purposes of the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements.

Key audit matters
• Carrying value of goodwill (Group)

• Valuation of termite damage claims provision (Group)

• Carrying value of investments (Parent Company)

Materiality
• Overall Group materiality: £38.0m (2022: £26.0m) based on 5% of the 

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

Group’s Adjusted Profit before Tax.

Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note Material accounting policies to the financial 
statements, the Group, in addition to applying UK-adopted international 
accounting standards, has also applied international financial reporting 
standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB).

In our opinion, the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements  
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to 
listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit 
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in Note A8, we have provided no non-audit 
services to the Parent Company or its controlled undertakings in the 
period under audit.

• Overall Parent Company materiality: £79.0m (2022: £80.8m) based on 

1% of total assets.

• Performance materiality: £25.0m (2022: £19.5m) (Group) and £51.0m 

(2022: £60.6m) (Parent Company).

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed 
the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters,  
and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements  
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide  
a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Valuation of customer list and indefinite-lived brand intangible assets 
acquired as part of the Terminix acquisition, which was a key audit 
matter last year, is no longer included because the acquisition of 
Terminix completed in 2022 and there have been no changes to the 
initial purchase accounting for the customer list and indefinite-lived 
brand intangible assets in 2023. Otherwise, the key audit matters below 
are consistent with last year.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Carrying value of goodwill (Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report and Note B2 in the financial 
statements.

The Group recorded £5,016m of goodwill at 31 December 2023  
(2022: £5,100m). 

As required by IAS 36, management has performed its annual goodwill 
impairment assessment on the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs). 
Goodwill is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on 
the higher of its value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal.

The value-in-use is dependent on estimates of future cash flows of the 
underlying CGUs which inherently involves management estimation 
and there is a risk that if the Group does not achieve these cash flow 
estimates it could give rise to impairment charges. The estimates 
principally relate to the revenue growth rate, operating profit margin, 
discount rate and long-term growth rate. These assessments also 
include the costs associated with the effects of climate change, 
including the future costs of the Group’s commitment to reach net zero 
by 2040 and costs of compliance with current legal requirements. 

Management has recorded impairment charges totalling £3m in 
2023 (2022: £22m). The charge has been excluded from the Group’s 
adjusted performance measures consistent with the Group’s policy.

Management prepared value-in-use impairment models for all CGUs 
with goodwill in excess of £5m at 31 December 2023. We obtained 
management’s value-in-use models and tested the mathematical 
integrity. We evaluated the determination of the Group’s CGUs and we 
utilised our in-house valuation experts to evaluate the appropriateness 
of the methodology used in both the impairment models and to 
calculate the discount rates. We validated the carrying amounts 
of the net assets subject to impairment testing to the underlying 
accounting records. We have corroborated the long term growth 
rates and tax rates to third party sources and revenue growth rates 
to third party industry research and challenged management where 
inconsistencies were noted. We compared the cash flows used in the 
impairment models to the Board approved budget and strategic plan 
which include the estimated costs associated with climate change. 
We modelled the break even point for revenue growth in the final 
year of the models, terminal operating profit margin and discount 
rate assumptions. We assessed management’s historical accuracy 
of budgeting and forecasting at the Group level. We benchmarked 
implied multiples required to cover the carrying value of the net assets 
of each CGU to Rentokil’s average transaction multiples for acquired 
businesses during the year. 

Based on these procedures, we have performed additional 
procedures on eight CGUs where the headroom between the  
value-in-use and the carrying value of the CGUs was lowest and  
those CGUs that are more sensitive to reasonably possible changes  
in key assumptions that could cause impairment. 

For the eight CGUs, we used our in-house valuation experts to 
challenge the discount rates used by management. At the CGU level, 
we evaluated the historical accuracy of management’s budgeting  
and forecasting and we compared the revenue growth and operating 
profit margins to historical actuals and business cases for those 
entities that were acquired in the past two years. We performed 
additional sensitivities to assess whether further testing was  
required and whether additional disclosures should be provided  
in the financial statements.

Consistent with the prior year, management’s value-in-use model 
shows limited headroom for the India CGU. Management has 
undertaken a fair value less costs of disposal exercise with the support 
of two third party valuation specialists and using internal valuation 
benchmarks. We have reviewed the third party valuation reports 
and held discussions with one of the third parties. We recalculated 
the average multiple historically paid by Rentokil. We challenged 
management on the consistency of the valuations derived as well  
as management’s estimate of the costs of disposal.

We considered whether the disclosures in Note B2 complied with  
IAS 1 and IAS 36.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
arising from our work.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of termite damage claims provision (Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report and Note A6 in the financial 
statements.

With the acquisition of Terminix in October 2022, the Group assumed 
a liability for termite damage claims, based on customers existing at 
the acquisition date, for which a provision has been estimated. The 
liability arises where a termite infestation occurs, resulting in damage 
to a property under a termite contract. An additional provision is 
recognised for all new customers taken on since the acquisition date. 

Given the quantum of the provision for new customers our audit 
procedures focused on the provision for customers existing at the 
acquisition date.

The provision amounted to £260m at 31 December 2023 and £321m 
at 31 December 2022 after a retrospective adjustment to increase 
the acquired provision by £18m to reflect measurement period 
adjustments relating to the Terminix acquisition in accordance  
with IFRS 3.

The valuation of the termite damage claims provision requires 
significant management estimation as it is dependent on a number 
of significant assumptions including the volume and value of future 
claims, customer churn rate and discount rate.

Carrying value of investments (parent)
Refer to Note 4 of the Parent Company financial statements.

The Parent Company holds investments amounting to £4,438m at  
31 December 2023 (2022: £4,415m). 

As required by IAS 36, management has assessed if there is any 
indication that the investments balance may be impaired at the 
reporting date. If any such indication exists, the entity shall estimate 
the recoverable amount of the asset.

The assessment of potential impairment indicators involves 
management judgement. 

No impairment indicators were identified by management at the 
reporting date and no impairment charge has been recorded in 2023. 

We obtained management’s valuation model and tested the 
mathematical integrity. We evaluated the appropriateness of the 
methodology used in the valuation model and utilised our in-house 
valuation experts to challenge the discount rate. 

We challenged whether the retrospective adjustment to the provision 
was in line with the requirements of IFRS 3 including whether it 
reflected new information obtained by management about the 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, 
if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts 
recognised as of that date. 

We tested the completeness and accuracy of the number of customers 
included in the provision and the historical data that is used to 
estimate the volume and value of future claims. We challenged 
management on the appropriateness of the historical period over 
which claim volume and value has been estimated. We performed 
a number of sensitivities including assessing the impact of using 
different historical periods to estimate the volume and value of  
future claims.

We challenged management on the appropriateness of applying a 
consistent customer churn rate as in the prior year and more broadly 
challenged management on the consistency of assumptions used in 
the current year versus the prior year. We performed a number  
of sensitivities. 

We assessed the appropriateness of management’s sensitivity 
disclosures in Note A6 of the financial statements in relation to the 
significant estimates and considered whether the disclosures in  
Note A6 complied with IAS 1 and IAS 37.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
arising from our work.

We obtained management’s assessment of potential impairment 
indicators. We challenged management on the completeness of their 
assessment by comparing the items assessed with those required 
to be considered per the requirements of IAS 36 and our knowledge 
of the business. Management’s assessment included comparing the 
Group’s market capitalisation at 31 December 2023, which we verified 
to an external source, to the Parent Company’s net assets.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
arising from our work.

Annual Report 2023

Independent Auditors’ Report continuedHow we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough 
work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Parent 
Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in 
which they operate.

We performed full scope audits in respect of six components across 
North America, Europe (including LATAM), the UK & Sub-Saharan Africa 
and Pacific as well as a full scope audit at one corporate component.  
Of these, we identified two financially significant components in the US 
(part of the North America segment) and three material components in 
the UK (part of the UK & Sub-Saharan Africa segment), Australia (part  
of the Pacific segment) and the corporate component. The remaining  
full scope component was included in Group audit scope to achieve 
appropriate audit coverage. We also undertook specific audit 
procedures on three components in North America and Europe 
(including LATAM).

In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be performed by us, as the Group 
engagement team, or by component auditors within PwC UK and from 
other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Where the 
work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of 
involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components 
to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole.

In addition to instructing and reviewing the reporting from our 
component audit teams, we conducted file reviews for financially 
significant and material components and participated in key meetings 
with local management. We also had regular dialogue with component 
teams throughout the year.

The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and corporate 
functions were audited by the Group engagement team. This included 
our work over the termite damage claims provision, goodwill, acquisition 
accounting and taxation. Taken together, the components and 
corporate functions where we conducted audit procedures accounted 

for 72% of the Group’s revenue and 71% of the Group’s Adjusted Profit 
before Tax. One full scope component in the US and the full scope 
component in France comprise sub consolidations; in calculating these 
coverage levels we have taken 100% coverage from the full scope 
audits performed in these locations. This provided the evidence we 
needed for our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements taken 
as a whole. This was before considering the contribution to our audit 
evidence from performing audit work at the Group level, including 
disaggregated analytical review procedures, which covered certain of 
the Group’s smaller and lower risk components that were not directly 
included in our Group audit scope.

Our audit of the Parent Company financial statements was undertaken 
in the UK and included substantive procedures overall material balances 
and transactions.

The impact of climate risk on our audit
As part of our audit, we inquired of management to understand and 
evaluate the Group’s risk assessment process in relation to climate 
change including any changes in the assessment compared to the  
prior year. We reviewed management’s paper which sets out their 
assessment of climate change risk to the Group and the impact on  
the financial statements. In evaluating the completeness of the risks 
identified, we considered any changes in management’s paper 
compared to the prior year assessment and we challenged 
management on how they considered the potential financial impacts of 
the Group’s net zero commitment in their assessment. We considered 
the principal risk to relate to the assumptions made in the forecasts 
prepared by management and used in their assessment of the carrying 
value of goodwill. In responding to the risks identified, we specifically 
considered how climate change risk would impact these assumptions 
including the future costs of the Group’s commitment to reach net zero 
by 2040 and costs of compliance with current legal requirements.  
We also read the disclosures in relation to climate change made in  
the Responsible Business section of the Annual Report to ascertain 
whether the disclosures are materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our knowledge from our audit. Our responsibility  
over other information is further described in the reporting on other 
information section of this report.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial 
statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Financial statements – Group

Financial statements – Parent Company

Overall materiality

£38.0m (2022: £26.0m).

£79.0m (2022: £80.8m).

How we determined it 5% of the Group’s Adjusted Profit before Tax

1% of total assets

Rationale for 
benchmark applied

The Group’s principal measure of performance is 
Adjusted Profit before Tax, which excludes one-off and 
adjusting items, amortisation and impairment of intangible 
assets (excluding computer software) and net interest 
adjustments, in order to give management and other 
users of the Annual Report a clearer understanding of the 
underlying profitability of the business over time. We have 
utilised this measure in determining our materiality as it is 
the metric against which the performance of the Group is 
most commonly assessed by management and reported 
to shareholders.

Rentokil Initial plc is the ultimate Parent Company which 
holds the Group’s investments. Therefore, the entity is not 
in itself profit-oriented. The strength of the balance sheet 
is the key measure of financial health that is important to 
shareholders, since the primary concern for the Parent 
Company is the payment of dividends. We therefore 
consider total assets to be an appropriate benchmark. 
Certain account balances were included in scope for the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements and were 
therefore audited to a materiality level set below overall 
materiality established for the Group audit. However, we 
determined that the Parent Company did not require a full 
scope audit of its complete financial information for the 
purposes of the audit of the Group financial statements.

Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023 165

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate Governance 
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a 
materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of 
materiality allocated across components was £5.5m to £35.6m.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use 
performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and  
the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of 
transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample  
sizes. Our performance materiality was 65% (2022: 75%) of overall 
materiality, amounting to £25.0m (2022: £19.5m) for the Group  
financial statements and £51.0m (2022: £60.6m) for the Parent  
Company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of 
factors – the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation 
risk and the effectiveness of controls – and concluded that an amount in 
the middle of our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £2.0m (2022: £1.2m)  
for both the Group and Parent Company audits as well as misstatements 
below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating to going concern
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the 
Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting included:

• Evaluation of management’s base case and downside case scenarios, 

understanding and evaluating the key assumptions;

• Validation that the cash flow forecasts used to support management’s 
impairment, going concern and viability assessments were consistent;

• Assessment of the historical accuracy and reasonableness of 

management’s forecasting;

• Consideration of the Group’s available financing and debt maturity 

profile;

• Testing of the mathematical integrity of management’s liquidity 

headroom, sensitivity and stress testing calculations; and

• Review of the related disclosures in the Annual Report.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any 
material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually 
or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at  
least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised 
for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the Directors’ reporting on how they have applied the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or 
draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect 
to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual 
Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information.  
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form  
of assurance thereon.

166 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,  
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent  
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit,  
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an  
apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material 
misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement  
of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on 
these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also 
considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 
2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions  
and matters as described below.

Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, 
the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for 
the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the financial 
statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable  
legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit,  
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report.

Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.

Corporate governance statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the Directors’ statements in 
relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the 
corporate governance statement relating to the Parent Company’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to 
the corporate governance statement as other information are described 
in the reporting on other information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded 
that each of the following elements of the corporate governance 
statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and  
our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing  
material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

• The Directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust 

assessment of the emerging and principal risks;

• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal 
risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and  
an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

• The Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue 
to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements;

• The Directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group’s and 
Parent Company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and 
why the period is appropriate; and

• The Directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Parent Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of  
its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention  
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Independent Auditors’ Report continuedOur review of the Directors’ statement regarding the longer-term 
viability of the Group and Parent Company was substantially less  
in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and 
considering the Directors’ process supporting their statement; checking 
that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement  
is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and Parent Company and their environment 
obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we  
have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate 
governance statement is materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

• The Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report,  

taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides 
the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s  
and Parent Company’s position, performance, business model  
and strategy;

• The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of 

effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and

• The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the  

Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when 
the Directors’ statement relating to the Parent Company’s compliance 
with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by  
the auditors.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities  
in respect of the financial statements, the Directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the 
applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control  
as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company  
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with  
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, 
outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of 
irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are 
capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified 
that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations 
related to the Listing Rules, health and safety regulations, adherence  
to data protection requirements in the jurisdictions in which the  
Group operates and holds data and compliance with anti-bribery and 
corruption legislation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, 
and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have  
a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered  
those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial 
statements such as the Companies Act 2006 and taxation. We 
evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent 
manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override  
of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to 
posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate the financial 
performance of the Group and management bias in accounting 
estimates and judgements. The Group engagement team shared this 
risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include 
appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. 
Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or 
component auditors included:

• Discussions with management, Internal Audit and the Group’s legal 

counsel, including consideration of known or suspected instances of 
non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud;

• Evaluation of the effectiveness of management’s controls designed to 

prevent and detect irregularities;

• Identification and testing of significant journal entries;

• Assessment of matters reported on the Group’s whistleblowing 

helpline and the results of management’s investigation of  
such matters;

• Testing of assumptions and judgements made by management in 

making significant accounting estimates; and

• Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting 

documentation.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. 
We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance  
with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and 
transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of 
not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate 
concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, 
or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain 
transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. 
However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items  
for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often  
seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk 
characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable  
us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample  
is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of  
the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms  
part of our auditors’ report.

1.  £3m net gain (2022 £6m net loss; 2021: £13m net gain) on cash flow hedge includes £28m loss (2022: £137m gain; 2021: £15m loss) from the effective portion of changes in fair value 

offset by reclassification to the cost of acquisition of £nil (2022: £118m gain; 2021: £nil) and reclassification to the income statement of £31m loss (2022: £25m gain; 2021: £28m loss) due 
to changes in foreign exchange rates.

Shares of £nil (2022: £nil; 2021: £nil) have been netted against retained earnings. This represents 13.0m (2022: 19.6m; 2021: 9.4m) shares held 
by the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust, which is not consolidated. The market value of these shares at 31 December 2023 was £57m 
(2022: £100m; 2021: £55m). Dividend income from, and voting rights on, the shares held by the Trust have been waived.

1.  £3m net gain (2022 £6m net loss; 2021: £13m net gain) on cash flow hedge includes £28m loss (2022: £137m gain; 2021: £15m loss) from the effective portion of changes in fair value 
offset by reclassification to the cost of acquisition of £nil (2022: £118m gain; 2021: £nil) and reclassification to the income statement of £31m loss (2022: £25m gain; 2021: £28m loss)  
due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

The capital reduction reserve arose in 2005 as a result of the scheme of arrangement of Rentokil Initial 1927 plc, under section 425 of the 
Companies Act 1985, to introduce a new holding company, Rentokil Initial plc, and the subsequent reduction in capital approved by the 
High Court whereby the nominal value of each ordinary share was reduced from 100p to 1p.

The legal reserve represents amounts set aside in compliance with local laws in certain countries in which the Group operates. An assessment 
of this reserve was completed during 2021 and determined that these amounts are no longer required to be set aside. Accordingly, the balance 
of £10m was transferred back to the retained earnings reserve. 

The excess of the fair value of shares issued to fund the acquisition of Terminix over their par value gave rise to a new reserve called a Merger 
Relief Reserve. Under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, merger relief is available if certain circumstances are met when a business is 
acquired by issuing shares to replace already issued shares. This reserve is unrealised (and therefore not distributable), but it may become 
realised at a later date, for example on disposal of the investment to which it relates or on impairment of that investment (which may occur 
after payment of a dividend by the investment).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Material accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (IAS) 
and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable 
to companies reporting under those standards. The Consolidated 
Financial Statements also comply fully with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB). The Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by 
the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including 
derivative instruments). Certain financial and equity instruments have 
been measured at fair value.

Climate change
The Group has engaged in a detailed review of expected climate 
change impacts on the business and its assets and liabilities, to 
establish any adjustments required and what disclosure is necessary 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2023 under a 1.5-2.0°C 
pathway. The explanation below of how this has been included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction  
with the climate change evaluation and risk assessment on page 77.

This process has been completed to ensure material accuracy of  
the financial reporting, and that disclosure of relevant information 
complies with the requirements of IAS 1.

The process has involved a detailed review of material revenue 
segments, all balance sheet line items and each element of the  
Group target to reach net zero by 2040, to identify if any of these  
items is expected to be materially impacted in a negative or positive 
way by weather, legislative, societal, or revenue/cost changes.  
The conclusions of this process have been reviewed and agreed  
by the Audit Committee and Board on 27 February 2024.

Overall the conclusion of the review was that, while there will 
undoubtedly be impacts on the Group, the highly disaggregated 
nature of the operations significantly reduces the risk profile of the 
Group to impacts from weather-related changes. The changes 
necessary to achieve net zero will not have a materially adverse 
impact on the cash flows of the Group and indeed, warmer climates 
may present some opportunities as disclosed on page 79 of this 
report. Societal and legislative impacts are not felt to have a material 
impact on any one segment such that we need to break out reporting 
in a different way to previous years. Judgements are not felt to be 
significant, though clearly understanding of climate change is 
developing with time. The area with the most judgement is goodwill 
impairment testing and a description is given in Note B2 of the 
incremental processes undertaken to give extra comfort on the 
valuations. Management review has concluded that this is the only 
area that has judgement and potential for material impact, though we 
conclude that none are necessary, and that no further disclosures are 
needed beyond this note.

Going concern
The Directors have prepared Board-approved cash flow forecasts  
that demonstrate that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its 
obligations as they fall due for the period of at least 12 months from 
the date of approval of these Consolidated Financial Statements.

Additionally, the Directors have assessed severe but plausible 
downside scenarios. The downside scenarios include i) a revenue 
decline of 20% against base budget for six months; ii) a 20% revenue 
decline for 12 months; and iii) a one-off loss in the form of a cash loss 
of £200m. All of these scenarios are considerably worse than the 
actual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Starting with 
approximately £1.6bn of headroom at December 2023, none of the 
scenarios required additional external funding above and beyond 
existing committed facilities, and in the most severe downside 
scenario, a combination of a 20% revenue decline for 12 months  
and a one-off loss in the form of a cash loss of £200m, the minimum 
headroom modelled was c.£1bn before the inclusion of mitigating 
actions, such as cost savings, adjusting the level of M&A activity,  
and/or dividends paid, which are all within the Group’s control and 
were used during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Directors have therefore concluded that the Group will have 
sufficient liquidity to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for 
this period and therefore have prepared the Consolidated Financial 
Statements on a going concern basis.

Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls 
an entity when it (i) has power over the entity; (ii) is exposed or has 
rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and (iii) 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls a subsidiary if facts 
and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
these three elements of control.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. Inter-company 
transactions, balances, and gains and losses on transactions between 
Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. When less than 
100% of the issued share capital of a subsidiary is acquired, and the 
acquisition includes an option to purchase the remaining share capital 
of the subsidiary, the anticipated acquisition method is applied where 
judged appropriate to do so. The judgement is based on the risks  
and rewards associated with the option to purchase, meaning that  
no non-controlling interest is recognised. A liability is carried on  
the balance sheet equal to the fair value of the option to purchase. 
This is revised to the fair value at each reporting date with differences 
being recorded in equity.

Where the Group ceases to have control of a subsidiary, the assets 
and liabilities are derecognised along with any related non-controlling 
interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in the income statement. Any interest retained in the 
former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control ceases. 
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result 
in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. 

Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary  
are allocated to the non-controlling interests, which may cause the 
non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. Consideration in 
excess of net identifiable assets acquired in respect of non-controlling 
interests in existing subsidiary undertakings is taken directly to equity.

(b) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant 
influence over the financial and operating policies, but not control. 
Significant influence is usually presumed to exist when the Group 
holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. 

Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are  
initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill 
identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s share  
of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of  
equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence 
commences until the date that significant influence ceases. When the 
Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted 
investee, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of 
further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group  
has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on 
behalf of an investee.

Gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its 
associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest  
in the associates.

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceForeign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). 
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, 
which is the functional currency of Rentokil Initial plc. 

(b) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i)  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are 

translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet;
(ii)  income and expenses for each income statement are translated 

at average exchange rates; and

(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate 

component of equity.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation 
of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other 
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments or 
deemed to be quasi-equity, are taken to other comprehensive income. 
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are 
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

(c) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions, or from the translation of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at reporting 
period end exchange rates, are recognised under the appropriate 
heading in the income statement; except when deferred in equity  
as qualifying net investment hedges or where certain intra-group 
loans are determined to be quasi-equity (normally not expected to  
be repaid).

(d) Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies
During 2023, Ghana, a country in which the Group has operated for 
many years, was designated as hyperinflationary. The Group also  
has operations in Argentina, Lebanon, and Turkey, which remain 
hyperinflationary in 2023.

The IAS 29 rules are applied as follows:
(i)  adjustment of the income statement at the end of the reporting 

period using the change in general price index;

(ii)  adjustment of historical cost non-monetary assets and liabilities for 
the change in purchasing power caused by inflation from the date 
of initial recognition to the balance sheet date; and

(iii) adjustment of the income statement to reflect the impact of 

inflation and exchange rate movement on holding monetary assets 
and liabilities in local currency.

Consumer Price Indices have been used for the relevant 
hyperinflationary adjustments. The indices used for these adjustments 
are as follows:

Index at 1 January 2023

Index at 31 December 2023

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the 
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant 
instrument, and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such 
provisions.

Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets depending on the purpose 
for which the financial assets were acquired. At initial recognition 
the Group carries out a solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) 
test and a business model test to establish the classification and 
measurement of its financial assets. Financial assets are classified 
in the following categories:

(a) Amortised cost 
Financial assets under this classification are non-derivative financial 
assets held to collect the contractual cash flows until maturity and the 
cash flows are SPPI. Assets measured at amortised cost include trade 
and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents (excluding money 
market funds which are classified as fair value through profit and loss), 
and other investments. 

(b) Fair value through other comprehensive income
These are non-derivative financial assets which can be for sale with 
cash flows that are SPPI. These assets are measured at fair value and 
changes to market values are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. The Group has no assets classified under this category. 

(c) Fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets under this classification are assets that cannot be 
classified in any of the other categories. These assets are measured 
at fair value and changes to market values are recognised in profit 
and loss. 

Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method except for derivatives, which are classified as 
held for trading (except where they qualify for hedge accounting) and 
are held at fair value.

Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, 
deferred consideration, and borrowings.

Sources of estimation uncertainty and significant accounting 
judgements
The use of estimates, assumptions and judgements in the application 
of the Group’s accounting policies is explained below, with major 
sources of estimation uncertainty and significant judgements 
separately identified.

Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. 
Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based 
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations  
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and 
revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively. Sensitivities to 
the estimates and assumptions are provided, where relevant, in the 
notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Annual Report 2023

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statementscontinued(a) Termite damage claim provisions
With the acquisition of Terminix in October 2022, the Group assumed 
a liability for termite damage claims, based on termite customers 
existing at the acquisition date, for which a provision has been 
estimated. The cash outflow arises when a termite infestation occurs, 
resulting in damage to a property under a termite contract, that is 
subsequently remediated by the Group. The assumptions used to 
estimate the historical termite damage claim provisions are based  
on an assessment of the volume and value of future claims (based  
on historical information), customer churn rate, and discount rates. 
Starting from the acquisition date, an additional provision is 
recognised for all new termite customers upon commencement  
of their contract, based on the estimated average claim cost per 
customer over the lifetime of the contract. The trend of volume  
and value of claims will be monitored and reviewed over time  
and as such the value of the provisions are also likely to change. 
Sensitivity analysis is provided in Note A6.

Significant accounting judgements
Judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most 
significant effects on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements are discussed below:

(a) Useful economic life of brands
The Terminix US brand, acquired in October 2022, has been  
assessed as having an indefinite useful life. Prior to this acquisition all 
brands were considered by management to have finite useful lives. 
Indefinite-lived assets do not get amortised and therefore if 
management had judged that the Terminix brand had a finite life  
then there would be a significant amortisation expense recognised 
annually in the income statement. At acquisition, the Terminix brand 
was valued at £1,292m, which based on a typical 15-year life would 
result in an annual amortisation charge of £86m.

Other accounting estimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements include other areas of 
accounting estimates that do not meet the definition of significant 
accounting estimates or accounting judgements under IAS 1. 
The recognition and measurement of certain material assets and 
liabilities are based on assumptions and/or are subject to longer-term 
uncertainties as follows:

(a) Impairment of goodwill and other assets
The annual review for potential impairment of goodwill and other 
indefinite-lived intangible assets is primarily based on a value-in-use 
model. This model uses discounted cash flows to assess whether the 
goodwill carrying value can be supported or whether impairment is 
required. The model uses the following assumptions about the future:
• Revenue growth rate
• Operating profit margin
• Discount rate
• Long-term growth rate (inflation)

If the actual outcome is different to the estimated performance, or 
there is an unfavourable movement in the timing or amount of any of 
the assumptions used, this could lead to a material adjustment to the 
carrying amount of the asset within the next financial year. Note B2 
explains the impairment review process undertaken in the year.

(b) Self-insurance provisions
The Group self-insurance provision increased significantly through the 
acquisition of Terminix in October 2022. Self-insurance provisions are 
valued annually by external actuaries. Although the carrying value of 
the provision is significant, it is not expected that there would be any 
change to assumptions that would cause a significant adjustment to 
the carrying value in the next financial year and any impact would be 
expected to crystallise over the long term. Self-insurance provisions 
are disclosed in Note A6.

(c) Provisions for uncertain tax positions
The Group holds significant provisions for uncertain tax positions 
on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. 
The Group’s current tax liabilities reflect management’s best  
estimate of the future amounts of corporation tax that will be settled. 
However the actual outcome could be significantly different to the 
estimate made, as the ultimate tax liability cannot be known until a 
resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority, or the 
issue becomes time-barred. Note A13 discusses in detail why the 
provisions are taken and explains the estimation uncertainty.

Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards 
that are mandatorily effective for the current year
Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in these 
Consolidated Financial Statements are the same as those applied in 
the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended  
31 December 2022. 

The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments 
to standards, including any consequential amendments to other 
standards, with effect from 1 January 2023:
• introduction of IFRS 17 Insurance contracts (for non-issuers);
• amendments to IAS 8 Definition of accounting estimates;
• amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure of accounting policies; and
• amendments to IAS 12 Deferred tax.

The application of these amendments has had no material impact 
on the disclosures of the amounts recognised in the Group’s 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Consequently, no adjustment  
has been made to the comparative financial information at  
31 December 2022.

Certain new accounting standards, amendments to accounting 
standards and interpretations have been published that are not 
mandatory for 31 December 2023 reporting periods and have not 
been early adopted by the Group. These standards, amendments 
or interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the 
Group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable 
future transactions.

Retrospective adjustments to prior year comparatives
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, 
2022 comparative information has been retrospectively adjusted to 
show the effect of measurement period adjustments arising on the 
Terminix acquisition during 2023. Further details can be found in note 
B1 on page 195.

Annual Report 2023 177

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceA. Operating
A1. Revenue recognition and operating segments

Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group 
expects to be entitled. All revenue is considered revenue from contracts with customers as defined by IFRS 15, including job work and sales 
of goods. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of goods or services in line with identifiable performance 
obligations. In the majority of cases the Group considers that the contracts it enters into are contracts for bundled services which are accounted 
for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly the majority of revenue across the Group is recognised on an output basis evenly over the 
course of the contract because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as it 
performs. Job work is short-term contract revenue whereby the period of service is typically less than one month in duration. The performance 
obligations linked to this revenue type are individual to each job due to their nature, with revenue being recognised at a point in time on 
completion. Where consumables are supplied separately from the service contract, revenue is recognised at the point the goods transfer.

The transaction price reported for all contracts is the price agreed in the contract and there are no material elements of variable consideration, 
financing component or non-cash consideration. The Group applies the practical expedient in paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 and does not disclose 
information about remaining performance obligations because the Group has a right to consideration from customers in an amount that 
corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance obligations completed to date.

Disaggregation of revenue into region, category and major type of revenue stream is shown below under segment reporting.

Performance obligations
Revenue recognised over time – contract service revenue
These are mainly full-service contracts, inclusive of equipment, maintenance and consumables as required. The inclusive service is treated 
as a single performance obligation.

• Pest Control: the Group offers a range of services with the most common being general pest maintenance contracts. Under this type of contract 
the Group promises to provide a pest control service for the duration of the contract. In order to fulfil this promise, equipment is supplied (such 
as bait boxes) and a technician maintains and monitors the equipment at a set number of visits per year, plus any additional call-outs as required; 
so there is a stand-ready element to the service as well as an ongoing service. The Group considers that this type of contract is a bundled service 
as the goods and services are not distinct in the context of the contract; equipment is not supplied without the service.

The Group offers certain termite contracts across a limited number of countries (including North America) where there is a single performance 
obligation. In these contracts revenue is recognised as the performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally over a short time period of 
a few days. These contracts include assurance warranties that last for a period of 12 months from the date of service, but the warranty is not 
considered to be a performance obligation under IFRS 15. These contracts are annual contracts and are therefore recognised as contract 
service revenue. Some smaller acquired businesses have legacy termite contract terms that do offer service warranties, resulting in a spread 
of revenues over the contractual year.

• Hygiene & Wellbeing: the Group offers a similar type of service to Pest Control, providing washroom equipment, consumables, and a technician 
to service the washroom. This type of contract will include a set number of visits. Dispensers are replenished by the technician. Management 
considers that the supply of goods and services are not distinct in the context of the contract. Dispensers and other equipment would not be 
supplied without providing the full service; the equipment is controlled by the Group and ownership does not transfer to the customer. Also 
included are contracts relating to interior landscaping, specifically the supply and maintenance of interior plants. Maintenance is only offered for 
plants that were supplied by the Group and therefore the services are not distinct in the context of the contract. The assets are positioned and 
situated by our technicians and the customer is not permitted to relocate them. At the end of the contract, any assets on the customer’s site  
are recovered. 

• France Workwear: the main type of contract is for supply and laundering of garments for commercial organisations. Supply and laundry are not 

offered separately, therefore management considers the services not to be distinct in the context of the contract. The service is treated as a bundle 
and a single performance obligation. Any equipment remains under ownership and control of the Group.

Revenue recognised at a point in time – job work
These services are short-term in nature and only an immaterial amount would straddle an accounting period end. There is usually only one 
performance obligation, with revenue recognised at the point of completion of the work.

• Pest Control: an example of this type of revenue in the Pest Control category is bird-proofing which is a one-off installation that, depending on the 
size of the site, may take between a few days and several weeks to complete. There is a single performance obligation (to install bird-proofing) and 
the customer is billed, and revenue recognised, at the end of the job.

• Hygiene & Wellbeing: this type of revenue is generated, for example, by our Specialist Hygiene team which performs specialist cleaning services 
such as graffiti removal, deep cleaning of kitchens and washrooms, trauma cleaning, flood or fire damage cleaning, and specialist deep cleaning 
services. These are usually short-term jobs (less than one week) and usually there is a single performance obligation with revenue recognised on 
completion of the job.

178 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementscontinuedRevenue recognised at a point in time – sale of goods
Sale of products and consumables relates mainly to the pest distribution businesses, which sell pest control products to retailers and the pest 
control industry. In the Hygiene & Wellbeing business there are some sales of consumables to customers. In all cases, revenue is recognised 
at the point in time that ownership transfers to the customer.

The Group does not consider that any judgements were made that would have a significant impact on the amount or timing of revenue 
recognised. Those contracts in the business where revenue is recognised over time are repetitive and are based on short cycles that repeat 
many times per year. Therefore, if revenue had been considered to be recognised at a point in time rather than over time, the in-year impact 
would be immaterial.

The Group makes a charge against revenue for credit notes not yet issued at the balance sheet date.

Contract costs
Contract costs are mainly incremental costs of obtaining contracts (primarily sales commissions directly related to contracts obtained), and to 
a lesser extent costs to fulfil contracts which are not within the scope of other standards (mainly incremental costs of putting resources in place 
to fulfil contracts).

It is anticipated that these costs are recoverable over the life of the contract to which they relate. Accordingly, the Group capitalises them as 
contract costs and amortises them over the expected life of the contracts. Management takes a portfolio approach to recognising contract costs, 
and the expected length of contracts across the Group and associated amortisation periods are between three and seven years.

The contract costs recognised in the balance sheet at the period end amounted to £224m (2022 retrospectively adjusted: £215m; 2021: £75m). 
The amount of amortisation recognised in the period was £121m (2022: £39m; 2021: £30m) and impairment losses were £nil (2022: £nil; 2021: £nil).

Applying the practical expedient in paragraph 94 of IFRS 15, the Group recognises the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense 
when incurred if the amortisation period of the assets that the Group otherwise would have recognised is one year or less.

Contract assets and accrued income
Contract assets relate to the Group’s right to consideration for performance obligations satisfied, but where further performance obligations need 
to be satisfied before the customer can be invoiced. Accrued income is recognised where all performance obligations have been satisfied but the 
customer has yet to be invoiced. A receivable is recognised when all rights to consideration become unconditional, which usually occurs when 
the Group issues an invoice to the customer. All opening balances have been invoiced during the year.

Contract liabilities
Contract liabilities relate to advance consideration received from customers where the performance obligations have yet to be satisfied. 
All opening balances have subsequently been satisfied in the year. In most business categories where revenue is recognised over time, 
customers are invoiced in advance or simultaneously with performance obligations being satisfied.

Segment reporting
Segmental information has been presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments on page 180. The Group’s operating segments are 
regions and this reflects the internal management reporting structures and the way information is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker 
(the Chief Executive). Each region is headed by a Regional Managing Director who reports directly to the Chief Executive and is a member of the 
Group’s Executive Leadership Team responsible for the review of Group performance. The businesses within each operating segment operate 
in a number of different countries and sell services across three business segments.

The LATAM region is combined with Europe in the Group’s segment reporting. It is the Group’s smallest region and not considered reportable 
under the quantitative thresholds in IFRS 8. It is combined with Europe as they are similar with respect to economic characteristics, the nature of 
services provided, the type of customers, methods used to provide services, and language and cultural similarities.

Disaggregated revenue under IFRS 15 is the same as the segmental analysis below. Restructuring costs, one-off and adjusting items, amortisation 
and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software), and central and regional costs are presented at a Group level as they are not 
targeted or managed at reportable segment level. The basis of presentation is consistent with the information reviewed by internal management.

Operating Profit

1.  Central and regional overheads revenue relates to the wholesale of metalwork and consumables, including hygiene and pest control products. It is managed centrally rather than in any 
region. During 2023, internal management reporting structures changed and revenue and profit have been represented for 2022 and 2021 under the new structure. As a result of this 
change, revenue of £5m and operating profit of £1m was moved from UK & Sub-Saharan Africa – Pest Control to central and regional overheads for each year.

2.  During 2023 there were impairment losses recognised in North America related to ROU assets of £nil (2022: £17m; 2021: £nil) and related to property, plant and equipment of £nil 

(2022: £8m; 2021: £nil).

3.  Excluding computer software which is included in our segment operating profit measure.

Revenue and operating profit relate to the main groups of business segment and activity: Pest Control, Hygiene & Wellbeing and France 
Workwear. Central and regional overheads represent corporate expenses that are not directly attributable to any reportable segment.

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceA2. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust (see note at the bottom of the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity) which are treated as cancelled, and including share options for which all conditions have been met.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all potential dilutive ordinary 
shares. The Group’s potentially dilutive ordinary shares relate to the contingent issuable shares under the Group’s long-term incentive plans 
(LTIPs) to the extent that the performance conditions have been met at the end of the period. These share options are issued for nil consideration 
to employees if performance conditions are met.

For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, 18,422 share options were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of the dilutive effect 
as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 1,290,294; 31 December 2021: nil).

Details of the calculation of earnings per share are set out below:

A3. Trade and other receivables
The Group’s trade receivables are recognised at the transaction price less provision for impairment. They are generally due for settlement within 
30 days and are all classified as current. The amount of the provision for impairment is recognised in the income statement and movements on 
provisions for impaired trade receivables are recognised within operating expenses in the income statement. Amounts are generally charged 
to the provision for impairment of trade receivables when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.

Expected credit loss (ECL) calculations are performed and are used to calculate the provision for impairment of trade receivables. 
ECL calculations are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses and are performed at country level. The Group applies the simplified method 
of applying lifetime ECLs to trade receivables using an allowance matrix to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from its customers, which 
comprise customer portfolios across several countries. Credit risk factors that are considered as part of ECL calculations may include, but are not 
limited to: payment history, customer size, customer type (national/residential/commercial/government), age of debt, industry strength, economy, 
environmental factors such as climate change, and product or service provided.

Loss allowances are also calculated on other financial assets, although the amounts are generally not significant and the asset is recognised net 
of the allowance.

There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the Group’s customer base being large and diverse. 
The amount of credit risk with respect to customers is represented by the carrying amount on the balance sheet. The Group policy is that credit 
facilities for new customers are approved by designated managers at regional level. Credit limits are set with reference to trading history and 
reports from credit rating agencies where they are available. Where this is not feasible the Group may request payment in advance of work being 
carried out, or settlement by credit card on completion of the work. There are no trade receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired 
whose terms have been renegotiated.

period adjustments made relating to the Terminix acquisition (see Note B1).

2.  Contract liabilities represents customer invoices where performance obligations have not yet been satisfied. All opening balances have subsequently been satisfied in the year. 

In most business categories our customers are invoiced in advance or simultaneously with performance obligations being satisfied.

3.  Contingent consideration includes put option liability of £32m (2022: £45m). 

Other than the put options, there are no liabilities in the table above that bear interest or are discounted, and therefore the cash flows are equal to 
the carrying value of the liabilities. Cash is due to flow between one and five years for all non-current liabilities and not beyond. Fair value is equal 
to carrying value for all trade and other payables. There is no material difference between the fair value and carrying value for all trade and other 
payables.

Put options are held following the acquisition of PCI in 2017, where the seller may require the Group to purchase the remaining shares of the 
business in stages over a fixed term between 2023 and 2027. The put options are accounted for as an anticipated acquisition of the remaining 
shares and no non-controlling interest is recognised. The Group recognised a put option liability for the anticipated acquisition of these shares 
in contingent consideration, and any movements in the carrying value are recognised through equity. During the year, the seller exercised the 
first put option, selling 8% of the share capital of the company to the Group, making the Group’s total shareholding in PCI 65%.

Given the volume of acquisitions and the variety of inputs to the valuation of contingent consideration (depending on each transaction), there is 
not considered to be any change in input that would have a material impact on the contingent consideration liability.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementscontinuedA6. Provisions for liabilities and charges
The Group has provisions for termite damage claims, self-insurance, environmental, and other. Provisions are recognised when the Group has 
a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount 
is capable of being reliably estimated. If such an obligation is not capable of being reliably estimated it is classified as a contingent liability (Note D3).

Future cash flows relating to these obligations are discounted when the effect is material. The effect of discounting environmental provisions 
and other provisions is not considered to be material due to the low level of expected future cash flows. Termite damage claim provisions 
and self-insurance provisions are discounted, and the majority of these provisions are held in the US. The discount rate used is based 
on US government bond rates, and was 3.88%-5.25% (2022: 3.5%-5.875%).

1.  Termite damage claim provisions and environmental provisions have been retrospectively adjusted in 2022 by an increase of £18m and £4m respectively, in accordance with IFRS 3, 

to reflect measurement period adjustments made relating to the Terminix acquisition (see Note B1).

Termite damage claims
The Group holds provisions for termite damage claims covered by contractual warranties. Termite damage claim provisions are subject to 
significant assumptions and estimation uncertainty. The assumptions included in valuing termite provisions are based on an estimate of the 
volume and value of future claims (based on historical and forecast information), customer churn rates and discount rates. These provisions are 
expected to be substantially utilised within the next 20 years at a declining rate. The trend of volume and value of claims is monitored and 
reviewed over time (with the support of external advisers) and as such the value of the provision is also likely to change.

The sensitivity of the liability balance to changes in the inputs is illustrated as follows:

• Discount rate – The exposure to termite damage claims is largely based within the United States, therefore measurement is based on a seven-year 

US bond risk-free rate. During 2023, interest rates (and therefore discount rates) have moved up and are at their highest level in over a decade. 
Rates could move in either direction and management has modelled that an increase/decrease of 5% in yields (would decrease/increase the 
provision by £3m (2022: £3m). Over the 12 months to 31 December 2023, seven-year risk-free rate yields have decreased c.4% from 4.03% to 
3.88%.

• Claim value – Claim value forecasts have been based on the latest available historical settled Terminix claims. Claims values are dependent on a 
range of inputs including labour cost, materials costs (e.g. timber), whether a claim becomes litigated or not, and specific circumstances including 
contributory factors at the premises. Management has determined the historical time period for each material category of claim, between three 
months and one year, to determine an estimate for costs per claim. Recent fluctuations in input prices (e.g. timber prices) means that there is 
potential for volatility in claim values and therefore future material changes in provisions. Management has modelled that an increase/decrease  
of 5% in claim values would increase/decrease the provision by c.£15m (2022: £14m). Over the 12 months to 31 December 2023, as a result of 
accelerating the clear down of legacy longstanding claims and other macroeconomic factors, in-year costs per claim rose by c.32% (2022: 17%).

• Claim rate – Management has estimated claim rates based on statistical historical incurred claims. Data has been captured and analysed by a 
third-party agency, to establish incidence curves that can be used to estimate likely future cash outflows. Changes in rates of claim are largely 
outside the Group’s control and may depend on litigation trends within the US, and other external factors such as how often customers move 
property and how well they maintain those properties. This causes estimation uncertainty that could lead to material changes in provision 
measurement. Management has modelled that an increase/decrease of 5% in overall claim rates would increase/decrease the provision by  
c.£15m (2022: £14m), accordingly. Over the 12 months to 31 December 2023 claim rates fell by c.7% (2022: 16%).

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate Governance• Customer churn rate – If customers choose not to renew their contracts each year, then the assurance warranty falls away. As such there is 

sensitivity to the assumption on how many customers will churn out of the portfolio of customers each year. Data has been captured and analysed 
by a third-party agency, to establish incidence curves for customer churn, and forward looking assumptions have been made based on these 
curves. Changes in churn rates are subject to macroeconomic factors and to the performance of the Group. A 1% movement in customer churn 
rates, up or down, would change the provision by c.£11m up or down (2022: £10m), accordingly. On average over the last 10 years churn rates have 
moved by +/– c.1.8% per annum (2022: +/-1.2%).

Self-insurance
The Group purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks, mainly employee-related risks. 
Self-insured deductibles within these insurance policies have changed over time due to external market conditions and scale of operations. 
These provisions represent obligations for open claims and are estimated based on actuarial/management’s assessment at the balance sheet 
date. The Group expects to continue self-insuring the same level of risks and estimates that all pending claims should settle within the next five 
years.

Self-insurance provisions are also subject to estimation uncertainty based on volume and value of expected future claims and discount rate 
assumptions; however it is not expected that there would be any change to assumptions that would cause a significant adjustment to the carrying 
value in the next financial year.

The amount of expected reimbursement from third-party insurers is £21m and this is included within other receivables in Note A3.

Environmental
The Group owns, or formerly owned, a number of properties in Europe and the US where environmental contamination is being managed.  
These issues tend to be complex to determine and resolve and may be material, although it is often not possible to accurately predict future  
costs of management or remediation reliably. Provisions are held where liability is probable and costs can be reliably estimated. Contingent 
liabilities exist where the conditions for recognising a provision under IAS 37 have not been met. The Group monitors such properties to 
determine whether further provisions are necessary. The provisions that have been recognised are expected to be substantially utilised within 
the next five years.

Other
Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising and costs relating to disposed businesses and restructuring 
costs. Other provisions also includes costs relating to onerous contracts and property dilapidations settlements. Existing provisions are expected 
to be substantially utilised within the next five years.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementscontinuedA9. Employee benefit expense
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on calculations of achievements of financial performance 
targets and the best estimate of the obligation to employees related to personal performance criteria being achieved. A liability is recognised 
where a contractual obligation exists or where past practice indicates that there is a constructive obligation to make such payments in the future.

Holiday pay
Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the benefits are earned. An accrual 
is made at the balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays earned but not yet taken.

Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when an employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts 
voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: 
terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; or providing termination 
benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date 
are discounted to present value where the effect of discounting is material.

Annual Report 2023 187

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceA10. Retirement benefit obligations
Apart from contributions to legally required social security state schemes, the Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world 
covering many of its employees.

Defined contribution pension plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.

The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has 
no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when 
they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

Defined benefit pension plans
A defined benefit pension plan is a plan that defines the amount of future pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually 
dependent on one or more factors such as years of service, compensation and age.

The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair value of plan assets, less the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. The Group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit asset for the 
period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined 
benefit asset. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present 
value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality 
corporate bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA, are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms 
to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. The Group will recognise a pension surplus as an asset where there is an 
unconditional right to a refund or where the Group has a right to reduce future pension contributions, taking into account the adverse effect of 
any minimum funding requirements.

Current and past service costs, to the extent they have vested, and curtailments are recognised as charges or credits against operating profit in 
the income statement. Interest income on the net defined benefit asset is recognised in finance income. Remeasurement gains and losses arising 
from experience adjustments, return on plan assets, and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income.

The largest retirement benefit obligation in the Group is the Rentokil Initial Irish Pension Scheme (which is in a surplus position).

A number of smaller defined benefit and defined contribution schemes operate elsewhere, which are also funded through payments 
to trustee-administered funds or insurance companies.

Defined benefit schemes are reappraised annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions. Judgement is required 
in determining these actuarial assumptions, but this is not considered by management to be a significant accounting judgement as defined 
under IAS 1.

The assumptions used for the Rentokil Initial Irish Pension Scheme are shown below:

Risks
The scheme exposes the Company to a number of risks, the most significant of which are:

Asset volatility – Scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this 
yield, this will create a reduction in the current surplus position. The scheme holds a small proportion of growth assets (equities) which, though 
expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored 
to ensure it remains appropriate given the long-term scheme objectives.

Changes in bond yields – A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the scheme’s liabilities for accounting purposes, 
although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.

Inflation risk – A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the scheme’s liabilities for accounting purposes, although 
this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.

Life expectancy – The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will 
result in an increase in the liabilities.

For the Rentokil Initial Irish Pension Scheme the expected duration is 16-17 years.

1.  Service costs and administration expenses are charged to operating expenses, and interest cost and return on plan assets to finance cost and finance income.
2.  The actuarial movement on the UK scheme comprises remeasurement gain arising from changes in demographic assumptions of £nil (2022: £nil), remeasurement gain arising from 

changes in financial assumptions of £nil (2022: gain of £82m), and a remeasurement loss arising from experience of £nil (2022: loss of £7m).

3.  Benefit plans in an obligation position include plans situated in Thailand, the UK, Martinique, Trinidad and Tobago, Norway, South Africa, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, South Korea, 

Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, and Saudi Arabia.

4.  Benefit plans in an asset position include plans situated in Australia, Barbados, and Ireland.

Of the £60m (2022: £65m) of obligations in the table above, £20m (2022: £20m) is unfunded.

Total contributions payable to defined benefit pension schemes in 2024 are expected to be less than £1m.

Where available the fair values of assets are quoted prices (e.g. listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds). In other cases the market 
value as provided by the fund managers has been used in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement:
• unquoted debt instruments (level 2);
• interest and inflation rate hedging instruments (level 2); and
• pooled investment funds (level 3).

Other significant assets are valued based on observable market inputs. Other assets primarily consist of cash.

The cumulative actuarial gain recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income was £34m (2022: £34m). No remeasurement 
gain or loss was recognised during the year (2022: £2m gain).

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceA11. Share-based payments
Share-based compensation
The Group operates two equity-settled share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIPs): the Performance Share Plan and the Restricted Share  
Plan. The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement, equivalent  
to the fair value of the benefit awarded. The fair value of the Performance Share Plan is determined by reference to option pricing models, 
principally stochastic and adjusted Black-Scholes models. The fair value of the Restricted Share Plan is determined by reference to an adjusted 
Black-Scholes model. The charge for both plans is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the award. At each balance 
sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of shares that vest or options that are expected to become exercisable. Any revision to 
the original estimates is reflected in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately to the extent it relates to past 
service, and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.

Performance Share Plan and Restricted Share Plan
The Company has operated a share-based incentive for senior managers worldwide since 2006, initially through a Performance Share Plan, and 
then in 2023 a Restricted Share Plan was introduced. The main features of the schemes are as follows:
• For Performance Share Plan awards made in 2021, 2022, and 2023, 50% of the award is based on total shareholder return (TSR) and 50% is based 

on performance against certain strategic and financial measures over the vesting period.

• For Restricted Share Plan awards made in 2023, there are no performance conditions attached.
• The value of dividends paid during the vesting period is paid on the number of shares that ultimately vest in the form of additional shares. 

For awards that are nil-cost options made prior to May 2021, this is the value of dividends between grant and exercise.

The total charge for the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment plans was £27m (2022: £18m; 2021: £10m). This includes charges for 
the Performance Share Plan and Restricted Share Plan of £17m (2022: £9m; 2021: £10m), as well as a transfer of existing long-term incentive plans 
in Terminix and a non-recurring retention award that were expensed during the period totalling £10m (2022: £9m; 2021: £nil).

The fair value of the 2023 awards made under the Performance Share Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based 
on values derived from a Monte Carlo model prepared by external remuneration consultants. This is a closed-form solution which takes account 
of the correlation between share price performance and the likelihood of a TSR performance condition being met. For the shares awarded 
in March 2023, the significant inputs into the model were a share price of 581.4p (2022: 480.5p), an expected share price volatility of 26.3% 
(2022: 23.9%), a median share price correlation between the companies in the comparator group of 84.1% (2022: 84.0%), and an expected life 
commensurate with the three-year performance/vesting period. The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share 
prices. As the awards are nil-cost (i.e. there is no exercise price), the assumed risk-free rate of return has minimal impact on the fair value of the 
awards. Similarly, as dividend equivalents are paid on the vesting portion of awards, the fair value of these awards is not reduced to reflect 
dividends paid during the vesting period. The fair value of the 2023 awards made under the Restricted Share Plan is charged to the income 
statement over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on grant date. 

The fair value of awards granted during 2023 was £36m (2022: £19m) and the weighted average fair value per award granted during the year was 
506.7p (2022: 385.9p). The weighted average share price for options exercised in the year was 568.6p (2022: 499.9p) and the weighted average 
contract term remaining on shares unexercised at the year end was 497 days (2022: 527 days).

A12. Income tax expense
The income tax expense for the period comprises both current and deferred tax. Current tax expense represents the amount payable on this 
year’s taxable profits and any adjustment relating to prior years. Taxable profits differ from accounting profits as some items of income or 
expenditure are not taxable or deductible, or may be taxable or deductible in a different accounting period. The current income tax charge is 
calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group’s subsidiaries 
and associates operate and generate taxable income.

Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences between accounting and tax 
bases. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected to apply when the timing difference reverses based on tax rates which are 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income or equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity 
as appropriate.

Annual Report 2023 191

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceThe Group’s effective tax rate (ETR) for 2023 on reported profit before tax was 22.7% (2022: 21.6%). This compares with a blended rate of tax for 
the countries in which the Group operates of 25.1% (2022: 23.7%). The Group’s low tax rate in 2023 is primarily attributable to net prior-year tax 
credits of £12m (2022: £9m). 

On 20 June 2023, Finance (No.2) Act 2023 was substantively enacted in the UK, introducing a global minimum effective tax rate of 15%. The 
legislation implements a domestic top-up tax and a multinational top-up tax, effective for accounting periods starting on or after 31 December 
2023. The legislation will be effective for the Group’s financial year beginning 1 January 2024. 

The Group is in scope of the substantively enacted legislation and has performed an assessment of the Group’s potential exposure to Pillar 2 
income taxes, mainly focusing on the transitional country-by-country reporting safe harbours which apply until 2026. Various jurisdictions the 
Group operates in have also brought in legislation or are bringing in legislation to implement Pillar 2 and domestic top-up taxes. Given these local 
rules and the UK rules are based on the same Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2 model rules, we have 
assumed that any variations between the local country domestic top-up tax calculation and the UK multinational top-up tax calculation for that 
country will be immaterial. As such, the Group’s assessment has focused on the application of the UK multinational top-up tax to the Group. 

The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar 2 income taxes has been undertaken both on the 2022 tax filings, country-by-country report 
and financial statements, and on the 2023 financial data included in these Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on the assessment, the 
majority of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates would meet the conditions for the transitional safe harbour provisions and would not 
require full Pillar 2 calculations, nor would a top-up tax charge be levied. The Pillar 2 effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions in which the 
Group operates are above 15% (calculated under the safe harbour provisions). However, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the 
transitional safe harbour relief would not have applied and the Pillar 2 effective tax rate is close to 15%. Within the assessment, the aggregate of 
the estimated top-up tax charge for those countries is immaterial. Therefore, based on the assessment undertaken, the Group does not expect  
a material exposure to Pillar 2 income taxes in those jurisdictions for periods in which the Pillar 2 legislation will be effective.

Given the complexity of the Pillar 2 rules, the OECD and UK government are expected to continue issuing additional guidance regarding the 
implementation of Pillar 2 throughout 2024. Various other jurisdictions the Group operates in are also expected to bring in Pillar 2 rules and issue 
new or amended guidance throughout 2024. The Group will continue to monitor these updates as the Pillar 2 legislation and guidance evolve.

On 23 May 2023, the International Accounting Standards Board issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes, introducing a mandatory temporary 
exception to the requirements of IAS 12 under which a company does not recognise or disclose information about deferred tax assets and 
liabilities related to the Pillar 2 rules. The Group applied the temporary exception at 31 December 2023. 

A tax credit of £6m has been recognised in other comprehensive income (2022: £11m), which mainly relates to the recognition of tax losses arising 
on prior year mark-to-market movements on cross-currency and interest rate swaps recorded within other comprehensive income.

A13. Current tax liabilities
Tax liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless there is a right to defer the payment of the liability for at least one year after the balance 
sheet date. As at 31 December 2023, all the Group’s tax liabilities have been classified as current as there is no legally enforceable right to defer 
payment for more than 12 months.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the asset and liability, and there is an intention 
to either settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Where required by accounting standards, management establishes provisions for uncertain tax positions on the basis of amounts expected to be 
paid to the tax authorities. The Group’s current tax liabilities reflect management’s best estimate of the future amounts of corporation tax that will 
be settled.

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. There are various uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities 
where the ultimate tax liability cannot be known until a resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority, or the issue becomes 
time-barred. Issues can take many years to resolve and therefore assumptions on the likely outcome have to be made by management.  
Each country and tax risk is considered separately when deciding whether it is appropriate to set up an uncertain tax provision. If risks are 
considered to be linked, the Group will consider the tax treatment in aggregate where appropriate. 

This assessment of uncertain tax positions is based on management’s interpretation of relevant tax rules and decided cases, external advice 
obtained, the statute of limitations and the status of the negotiations, and past experience with tax authorities. In evaluating whether a provision 
is needed it is assumed that tax authorities have full knowledge of the facts and circumstances applicable to each issue. 

Tax provisions can be built up over a number of years, but in the year of resolution there could be adjustments to these provisions which could 
have a material positive or negative impact on the tax charge for a particular year. The settlement of a significant issue could also have a material 
impact on the amount of cash tax payable in any one year. Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes, 
particularly in relation to the pricing of intra-group goods and services as well as debt financing.

The majority of the tax provisions relate to transfer pricing exposures where the Group faces a number of risks in jurisdictions around the world, 
and is subject to audits by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates. These tax audits have an uncertain outcome and can take several 
years to resolve, which in some cases may be dependent on litigation. The actual outcome could vary from management’s estimates, but these 
are updated at each reporting period in the light of the latest available information.

Total uncertain tax provisions (including interest thereon) amounted to £41m as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £54m). Included within this amount 
is £5m (2022: £6m) in respect of interest arising on tax provisions which is included within other payables. These tax provisions relate to multiple 
issues across the countries in which the Group operates. The net decrease in the provisions for the year is mainly attributable to issues which 
have been settled in the year or have become statute-barred.

The cash tax paid for the year was £100m (2022: £77m). The cash tax paid is expected to increase in future periods due to the acquisition 
of Terminix.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementscontinuedA14. Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities in transactions other than a business combination that at the time of the transactions affects neither the 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted (or substantively enacted) 
at the balance sheet date, and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is 
settled. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when the timing differences relate to income taxes levied by the same tax 
authority on an entity or different entities which are part of a tax consolidation and there would be the intention to settle on a net basis.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. The amount of deferred tax assets recognised at each balance sheet date is adjusted to reflect changes 
in management’s assessment of future taxable profits. In recognising the deferred tax asset in respect of losses, management has estimated 
the quantum of future taxable profits, applying a risk weighting to future profits to reflect the uncertainties.

The movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows:

Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023 193

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceA deferred tax asset of £38m has been recognised in respect of losses which are expected to be utilised within 10 years (2022: £23m), of which 
£28m (2022: £18m) relates to UK losses carried forward at 31 December 2023. This amount has been calculated by estimating the future UK 
taxable profits, against which the UK tax losses will be utilised, progressively risk-weighted, and applying the tax rates (substantively enacted as 
at the balance sheet date) applicable for each year. Remaining UK tax losses of £34m (2022: £120m) have not been recognised as at 31 December 
2023 as it is not considered probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the tax losses can be offset. The estimates of 
future profits are based on management’s financial forecasts which are used to support other aspects of the financial statements, such as 
impairment testing. At the balance sheet date the Group had tax losses of £169m (2022: £230m) on which no deferred tax asset is recognised 
because it is not considered probable that future taxable profits will be available in certain jurisdictions to be able to benefit from those tax losses. 
Of the losses, £95m (2022: £74m) will expire at various dates between 2024 and 2040. Deferred tax assets recognised on tax losses are 
expected to be substantially utilised within the next 10 years.

In addition, the Group has UK capital losses carried forward of £276m (2022: £276m) on which no deferred tax asset is recognised. These losses 
have no expiry date, but management considers the future utilisation of these losses to be unlikely.

Dividends received from subsidiaries are largely exempt from UK taxation but may be subject to dividend withholding or other taxes levied by  
the overseas tax jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate. A deferred tax liability of £4m (2022: £5m) has been recognised in respect of this 
liability as it is anticipated that these profits will be distributed to the UK in the foreseeable future. At the balance sheet date there is no material 
unprovided deferred tax liability were overseas earnings to be distributed to the UK.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementscontinuedB. Investing
B1. Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method (acquisition accounting) in accordance with IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations. The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred 
or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group. The cost of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date by recognising 
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria at their fair values. Any excess of the 
purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill. The acquisition date is the date on which 
the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree.

An intangible asset is recognised if it meets the definition under IAS 38 Intangible Assets. The intangible assets arising on acquisition are 
goodwill, customer lists, and brands. Goodwill represents the synergies, workforce, and other benefits expected as a result of combining the 
respective businesses. Customer lists and brands are recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisition using an income-based approach, 
which involves the use of assumptions including customer termination rates, profit margins, contributory asset charges, and discount rates.

At the date of acquisition, deferred and contingent consideration represents its fair value, with subsequent changes after the measurement 
period being recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Costs directly attributable to business combinations are charged 
to the income statement as incurred and presented as one-off and adjusting items.

Disclosures required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations are provided separately for those individual acquisitions that are considered to be 
material, and in aggregate for individually immaterial acquisitions. An acquisition would generally be considered individually material if the 
impact on the Group’s revenue and Adjusted Operating Profit measures (on an annualised basis) is greater than 5%, or the impact on goodwill 
is greater than 10% of the closing balance for the period. There were no individually material acquisitions in the year.

During the year, measurement period adjustments have been made in relation to the Terminix acquisition. These have been reflected as  
a retrospective adjustment of 2022 comparatives in accordance with IFRS 3 as follows:

Non-current assets

– Intangible assets
– Property, plant and equipment1

During the year the Group purchased 100% of the share capital or trade and assets of 41 companies and businesses (2022: 53). The total 
consideration in respect of these acquisitions was £261m (2022: £4,369m), and the cash outflow from current and past period acquisitions 
net of cash acquired was £242m (2022: £1,018m).

Goodwill on all acquisitions represents the synergies and other benefits expected to be realised from integrating acquired businesses into the 
Group, such as improved route density, expansion in use of best-in-class digital tools, and back office synergies. Details of goodwill and the fair 
value of net assets acquired in the year are as follows:

retrospectively adjusted in 2022, in accordance with IFRS 3, to reflect measurement period adjustments made relating to the Terminix acquisition.

Deferred consideration of £15m and contingent consideration of £43m are payable in respect of the above acquisitions (2022: £22m and £23m 
respectively). Contingent consideration is payable based on a variety of conditions, including revenue and profit targets being met. Amounts 
for both deferred and contingent consideration are payable over the next five years. The Group has recognised contingent and deferred 
consideration based on fair value at the acquisition date. A range of outcomes for contingent consideration payments cannot be estimated due 
to the variety of performance conditions and the volume of businesses the Group acquires. During the year there were releases of contingent 
consideration liabilities not paid of £nil (2022: £10m).

7.  The fair values of assets and liabilities from acquisitions in the current year will be finalised in the 2024 Financial Statements. These fair values are provisional as the acquisition 

accounting has not yet been finalised, primarily due to the proximity of many acquisitions to the year end.

From the dates of acquisition to 31 December 2023, new acquisitions contributed £75m to revenue and £10m to operating profit (2022: £422m 
and £3m respectively).

If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2023, the revenue and operating profit of the combined Group would have amounted to £5,414m 
and £628m respectively (2022: £5,109m and £444m respectively).

1.  Goodwill has been retrospectively adjusted by a decrease of £16m in 2022, in accordance with IFRS 3, to reflect measurement period adjustments made relating to the Terminix 

acquisition (see Note B1).

The main categories of intangible assets are as follows:

Intangible assets – finite useful lives
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are initially measured at either cost or fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The fair value attributable to intangible assets acquired 
through a business combination is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to be generated from that asset at the risk-adjusted 
weighted average cost of capital for the Group. The residual values of intangible assets are assumed to be £nil.

The estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows:

Customer lists: 
Other intangibles: 
Product development: 
Computer software: 

3 to 15 years
2 to 15 years
2 to 5 years
3 to 5 years

The following are the main categories of intangible assets with finite useful lives:

(a) Customer lists 
Customer lists are acquired as part of business combinations. No value is attributed to internally generated customer lists.

Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023 197

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate Governance(b) Other intangibles
Other intangibles consists of brands with finite useful lives and intellectual property. Brands are acquired as part of business combinations. 
No value is attributed to internally generated brands as expenditure incurred to develop, maintain and renew brands internally is recognised as an 
expense in the period incurred. Intellectual property costs are incurred in acquiring and maintaining patents and licences. These are recognised 
only if the cost can be measured reliably, and they are expected to generate economic benefits beyond one year, in excess of their cost.

(c) Product development
Costs incurred in the design and testing of new or improved products are recognised as intangible assets only if the cost can be measured 
reliably, and it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility. Capitalised product 
development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation.

Other development expenditure and all research expenditure are recognised as an expense as incurred and amount to £2m in the year 
(2022: £3m).

Development costs recognised as an expense are never reclassified as an asset in a subsequent period. Development costs that have been 
capitalised are amortised from the date the product is made available.

(d) Computer software
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products that are controlled by the Group (including 
employee costs and external software development costs) are recognised as intangible assets, if they are expected to generate economic 
benefits beyond one year in excess of their cost. Purchased computer software is initially recognised based on the costs incurred to acquire 
and bring it into use.

Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

Intangible assets – indefinite useful lives
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired 
business at the date of acquisition. It is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included in 
investments in associates.

(b) Brands with indefinite useful lives
Brands with indefinite useful lives are acquired as part of business combinations. No value is attributed to internally generated brands as 
expenditure incurred to develop, maintain and renew brands internally is recognised as an expense in the period incurred.

The Terminix US and Terminix International brands are considered to have indefinite useful lives due to their long history in the US (being founded 
in 1927), and having a strong brand equity in the US for much of its history and now internationally. The Group plans to continue to support and 
invest in the Terminix brand; it controls all the associated assets that support the underlying business, and therefore it is considered that there 
is no foreseeable limit on the period over which these brands will continue to generate net cash inflows. 

Goodwill and brands with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to country of operation and 
reportable business unit. The way in which CGUs are identified has not changed from prior periods. Newly acquired entities might be a single 
CGU until such time that they can be integrated. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating 
to the entity sold.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections, and fair value less 
costs to sell. The cash flow projections in year one are based on financial budgets approved by management, which are prepared as part of the 
Group’s normal planning process. Cash flows for years two to five use management’s expectation of revenue growth and operating profit margin, 
based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability for each CGU. Cash flows beyond the five-year period 
are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates (LTGR).

Cash flow projections included in the impairment review models include management’s view of the impact of climate change, including costs 
related to the effects of climate change, as well as the future costs of the Group’s commitment to reach net zero by 2040 and costs of compliance 
with current legal requirements. The potential increased costs, to meet these commitments less any benefits that may occur, are not expected 
to be material and therefore have resulted in no impairments during 2023.

2.  North America has been retrospectively adjusted in 2022, in accordance with IFRS 3, to reflect measurement period adjustments made relating to the Terminix acquisition.

Impairment tests for goodwill and brands with indefinite useful lives
For the India and Argentina CGUs, a fair value less costs to sell approach has been taken to support the carrying value of goodwill and brands 
with indefinite useful lives. During the year the Group recognised total impairments of £3m (2022: £22m). For all other goodwill balances it can  
be demonstrated that there is sufficient headroom in the recoverable amount of the CGU goodwill balances based on the assumptions made,  
and there is no reasonably likely scenario under which material impairment could be expected to occur in the next 12 months based on the  
testing performed.

1.  Source: imf.org.
2.  Key assumptions used by the US Terminix and US Pest Control CGUs were a long-term growth rate of 2.1% (2022: 2.0%) and a pre-tax discount rate of 10.1% (2022: 10.3%). 

For US Terminix CGU the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by £1,212m (2022: not applicable) and for the US Pest Control CGU the recoverable amount exceeds 
the carrying amount by £1,657m (2022: £1,692m).

The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the LTGR predicted for the relevant sector and country in which a business operates. 
They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that industry or country. The pre-tax discount rates are internally calculated weighted 
average cost of capital for each category and country. The pre-tax discount rates are based on current prices therefore future cash flow 
projections include inflation linked measures.

B3. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less depreciation with the exception of freehold land and assets under construction which 
are not depreciated. Historic cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023 199

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceDepreciation of assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between their cost and their residual values over 
their estimated useful lives, as follows:

50 to 100 years
Freehold buildings: 
Shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life
Leasehold improvements: 
Vehicles: 
4 to 10 years
Plant and equipment (including service contract equipment):  3 to 10 years
3 to 10 years
Office equipment, furniture and fittings: 

Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually and amended as necessary. Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may exceed its recoverable amount. There were no 
impairments in the year (2022: £8m).

When assets are sold, the gain or loss between sale proceeds and net book value is recognised in the income statement.

The category of service contract equipment represents the pool of assets used by the Group in delivering contracted services to customers. 
Land and buildings comprise mainly offices and warehouses.

B4. Leases
The Group leases land and buildings, vehicles, and other equipment. The lease durations vary from lease to lease according to the asset leased 
and local practices. Some of the Group’s leases have extension and termination options attached to them. Lease extension options and lease 
termination options are only included in the calculation of the lease liability if there is reasonable certainty that they will be exercised. 
Judgement is required to determine the level of certainty.

The value of leases to which the Group is committed but have not yet commenced is not material.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementscontinuedC. Financing
C1. Financial risk management
The Group’s central treasury function manages cash, borrows on behalf of the Group, and provides finance to Group companies in their local 
currencies. Treasury activity is governed by a Treasury Committee which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. 

The main financial risks faced by the Group are set out below.

(a) Liquidity risk
The Group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its business needs, and appropriate reserves to cover operational 
underperformance or dislocation in the financial markets. It is the Group’s policy to have headroom of unrestricted cash and available committed 
facilities of at least £600m, and the Treasury Committee manages financing requirements and associated headroom at least 12 months forward. 
Available commitments of $1,000m (£785m) under the revolving credit facility (RCF), together with unrestricted cash of £818m, gives the Group 
combined headroom of £1,603m at 31 December 2023 (2022: £1,694m).

The RCF and other Group debt facilities have no financial covenants and the Group is compliant with other terms, conditions, and undertakings 
of its debt facilities.

The Group targets an investment grade credit rating for debt issuance of BBB over the medium term. The Group was rated BBB by both S&P 
Global (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). In line with ratings criteria, debt maturities are covered at least 12 months in advance using available cash 
or committed facilities, or by issuance of new debt. Management maintains an active dialogue with both S&P and Fitch, as well as the Group’s 
relationship banks, to ensure that any changes to the Group’s financing and acquisition strategies are understood.

The Group has one debt maturity of €400m falling due in November 2024. The Group has sufficient headroom to cover this maturity without 
issuing new debt.

The following bonds: €400m due November 2024, €500m due May 2026, and €600m due October 2028; issued under the Group’s Euro 
Medium-Term Notes (EMTN) Programme, contain a coupon step-up which increases the coupon payable by 1.25% in the event that the Group 
is downgraded to BB+ or below (sub-investment grade). The Group’s bonds may be called by their investors at par in the event of a change 
of control of the Group. They may also be called within 120 days if the Group’s debt is downgraded below investment grade, or if the rating is 
withdrawn and the rating agency confirms in writing, either publicly or to the Group or the Trustee, that the rating action occurred either wholly 
or in part due to a change of control. All other bonds issued under the EMTN Programme do not contain the coupon step-up.

(b) Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. Sales are typically low-value, high-volume, spreading the risk across a large number 
of customers and geographies. Policies are in place to ensure that credit sales are only made to customers with an appropriate credit history. 
The Group operates in some territories where there is increased exposure to trade credit risks, and in those territories the Group puts in place 
appropriate measures to manage its credit risk exposure.

In order to protect the liquid assets and funding relationships of the Group, management aims to maintain banking relationships with 
counterparties that carry a long-term credit rating of at least A-, or equivalent rating with one of the major credit rating agencies. In countries 
where no banks are rated A- or above, balances are monitored monthly and kept to a minimum. In addition, funds held with all counterparties are 
subject to limits. All exposures are monitored and reported to the Treasury Committee each month. The Group also monitors the creditworthiness 
of its lenders to ensure that commitments under its facilities are available as needed.

At 31 December 2023 the Group had a total of £16m of cash held on bank accounts with banks rated below A- (2022: £36m). The highest 
concentration with any single bank rated below A- was £1m (2022: £14m).

(c) Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s worldwide operations generate profits and cash flows in foreign currencies. Sales and purchases are typically denominated in the 
currency of the country in which they are transacted, and the Group’s cross-border procurement is considered insignificant. Sterling-denominated 
profits from UK operations are exceeded by sterling-denominated Group central costs. This means that approximately 110% of Group operating 
profit is generated in foreign currencies.

The Group’s primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is in relation to the translation of assets and liabilities, and the Group aims to hold debt 
in currencies in proportion to its forecast foreign currency profits and cash flows. Foreign exchange derivatives are used to manage foreign 
currency exposures in excess of £10m that are not covered by debt or assets in the same (or another highly correlated) currency, as long as it 
makes sense from an economic perspective to do so. The Treasury Committee monitors foreign exchange exposures on a monthly basis. Dealing 
in foreign exchange products is controlled by dealing mandates approved by the Treasury Committee, and all foreign exchange transactions are 
covered by ISDA documentation.

The most significant foreign currency groups are US dollars and euros, which make up 62% and 29% of Group operating profit respectively.

At 31 December 2023 the Group’s net debt was approximately 74% US dollar (2022: 66%), 28% euro (2022: 23%), and offset by cash 2% (2022: 11% 
debt) in other currencies, including sterling. The translation of the interest element of euro and US dollar debt provides a partial income statement 
offset to the translation of earnings.

The Group calculates a hypothetical foreign exchange impact on the income statement and foreign currency translation of net investments in 
foreign subsidiaries for a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s principal foreign currency exposure is the US dollar. For US 
dollars, a 10% movement in £/$ would result in a £35m increase/decrease (2022: £25m) in operating profit, offset by a £12m decrease/increase 
(2022: £3m) in interest payable and a £349m increase/decrease (2022: £377m) in other comprehensive income. A 10% movement in £/€ would 
result in a £16m increase/decrease (2022: £15m) in operating profit, offset by a £5m decrease/increase (2022: £3m) in interest payable and a £17m 
increase/decrease (2022: £nil) in other comprehensive income. The other comprehensive income impact also includes the offsetting impact from 
financial instruments used to hedge the retranslation of the net investment in subsidiaries, which for US dollar is £182m (2022: £210m) and euro  
is £27m (2022: £46m). Where possible, currency cash flows are used to settle liabilities in the same currency in preference to selling currency in 
the market.

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceInterest rate risk
The Group seeks to manage interest rate risk to ensure reasonable certainty of its interest charge while allowing an element of risk exposure 
consistent with the variability of its cash flows. Interest rate risk is managed by the use of fixed interest debt and interest rate derivatives, which 
are approved in advance by the Treasury Committee. The Group policy is to fix a minimum of 50% of its estimated future interest rate exposures 
(excluding pensions) for a minimum period of 12 months forward. The Treasury Committee reviews this exposure monthly.

A hypothetical 1.0% increase in euro interest rates would reduce the market value of the Group’s bond liabilities by £86m at 31 December 2023 
(2022: £128m). The income statement impact is £nil as changes in interest rates do not change the expected cash flows on the bonds.

A hypothetical 1.0% increase in pound sterling interest rates would reduce the market value of the Group’s bond liabilities by £26m at 
31 December 2023 (2022: £34m). The income statement impact is £nil (2022: £nil).

A hypothetical 1.0% increase in US dollar interest rates would have an income statement impact of £6m (2022: £6m) as 50% of the $700m term 
loan was hedged in 2023 (2022: nil) and certain leases are denominated in US dollars with floating interest rates. 

The Group had outstanding bond debt issues at 31 December 2023 with a fair market value of £2,959m (2022: £2,826m). This is above the book 
value of £2,943m (2022: £2,987m) as a result of changes in interest rates in the UK and Europe. There are no circumstances where the Group 
would be obliged to pay the fair market value. The Group could however decide to redeem some or all of its bonds early, and the fair market value 
is indicative of the price that would be required to do so.

(d) Capital risk
The Group is committed to maintaining a debt/equity structure that allows continued access to a broad range of financing sources and sufficient 
flexibility to pursue commercial opportunities as they present themselves, without onerous financing terms and conditions. The Group’s policy is 
to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor, and market confidence, and to support the Group’s strategy. The Group uses 
S&P’s and Fitch’s ratings methodologies for a BBB issuer to manage its capital risk. In the event that a ratings downgrade is likely, net debt could 
be managed by reducing or suspending dividends, M&A spend, and capital expenditure. The Group would also consider raising additional equity 
to protect its BBB rating.

(e) Treasury risk
The Group’s treasury activities are governed by a treasury policy, which is reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis. The treasury 
policy covers all activities associated with managing the above risks. The policy requires that financial instruments are only utilised to manage 
known financial exposures, and speculative derivative contracts are not entered into. The treasury policy requires that treasury must approve 
opening and closing of all bank accounts, and that funds transfers and other payments are only made in accordance with bank mandates.

To ensure an appropriate control environment exists in the treasury function, duties are segregated between front and back office teams. 
In addition, a number of controls are in place to protect against potential cyber security and other risks.

C2. Net debt
Net debt is used to assess the Group’s financial capacity. Net debt is not a measure defined by IFRS. Management defines net debt as the total of 
bank and other borrowings, lease liabilities, other investments, fair value of debt-related derivatives, and cash and cash equivalents (as presented 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet). Closing net debt comprises:

1.  Bank and other short-term borrowings (decrease £9m) and lease liabilities (decrease £7m) have been retrospectively adjusted in 2022, in accordance with IFRS 3, to reflect 

measurement period adjustments made relating to the Terminix acquisition (see Note B1).

The foreign exchange gain on debt and derivatives amounted to £146m (2022: £74m loss). The gain primarily resulted from a weakening 
of the euro by 2 cents and a weakening of the US dollar by 6 cents. Included within the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents is £3m 
(2022: £4m) cash paid on debt-related foreign exchange forward contracts (which is included within financing activities in the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement).

The total cash outflow in borrowings of £664m (2022: £2,378m decrease) includes £nil proceeds from new debt (2022: £2,383m) (included in 
financing activities), £562m decrease in overdraft (2022: £865m increase), £nil debt repayment (included in financing activities) (2022: £844m), 
and £102m settlement of interest accrued (included within operating activities) (2022: £26m).

The derivatives cash outflow of £39m (2022: £7m decrease) includes £3m (2022: £26m inflow) of cash paid on debt-related foreign exchange 
swaps (included in financing activities) and £36m (2022: £19m) interest paid (included in operating activities).

The cash outflow of £182m from leases liabilities (2022: £114m) includes £157m (2022: £104m) capital paid (included within financing activities) 
and £25m (2022: £10m) interest paid (included in operating activities).

Fair value is equal to carrying value for all elements of net debt, with the exception of bond debt which has a carrying value of £2,943m 
(2022: £2,987m) and a fair value of £2,959m (2022: £2,826m).

C5. Derivative financial instruments
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their 
fair value at the balance sheet date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as 
a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. At the inception of the transaction the Group documents the relationship 
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge 
transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that 
are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items.

Certain financial instruments are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting. Typically the Group will not designate financial 
instruments for hedge accounting where a perfect or near-perfect offset is expected between the change in value of assets and liabilities. 
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments in this category are immediately recognised in the income statement. Where financial 
instruments are designated for hedge accounting they are designated as either fair value hedge, net investment hedge, or cash flow hedge. 
When designating cross-currency swaps, the cost of hedging has been excluded from the relationship and any movement in the fair value 
related to the cost of hedging is deferred in equity and amortised over the life of the hedged item.

(a) Fair value hedge
These instruments are used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value 
of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement, together with any changes in the 
fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. There were no fair value hedges as at the year end date.

(b) Net investment hedge
These instruments are used to hedge exposure on translation of net investments in foreign operations. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument related to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income; the gain or loss related to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. In the event of disposal of a foreign operation, the gains and losses accumulated 
in other comprehensive income are recycled through the income statement. All currencies are directly hedged, therefore the hedge ratio 
is considered to be 1:1.

The Group expects that the values of the hedged item and hedging instrument will move in opposite directions in response to movements in the 
same hedged risk. Where there are sufficient levels of denominated net assets, the critical terms are deemed to match.

The following net investment hedges were in place at 31 December 2023:

US dollar net investment hedge relationship: $2,091m (2022: $2,091m) cross-currency swaps notional, $459m (2022: $700m) loan notional, and 
$206m (2022: $274m) cross-currency swaps future interest cash flows have been used to hedge $2,756m (2022: $3,065m) of the net assets 
of the US operating subsidiaries. The movement in the cross-currency swaps due to changes in $/£ exchange rates are in the opposite direction 
of the changes due to $/£ in the subsidiaries’ assets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically change in the opposite direction 
of each other. Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an economic relationship.

Euro net investment hedge relationship: €343m (2022: €577m) bonds are used to hedge the net assets of the euro operating subsidiaries 
totalling €343m (2022: €577m). The movement in the bonds due to changes in €/£ exchange rates are in the opposite direction of the changes 
due to €/£ in the subsidiaries’ assets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically change in the opposite direction of each other. 
Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an economic relationship.

Australian dollar (AUD) net investment hedge relationship: AUDnil (2022: AUD8m) overdraft is used to hedge AUDnil (2022: AUD8m) of the net 
assets of the AUD denominated operating subsidiaries. The movement in the overdraft balance due to changes in AUD/GBP exchange rates are 
in the opposite direction of the changes due to AUD/GBP in the subsidiaries’ assets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically 
change in the opposite direction of each other. Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an economic relationship.

Japanese yen (JPY) net investment hedge relationship: JPY1,925m (2022: JPY1,925m) cross-currency swap notional and JPY27m (2022: JPY55m) 
cross-currency swaps future interest cash inflows have been used to hedge JPY1,898m (2022: JPY1,870m) of the net assets of the Japanese 
associate. The movement in the cross-currency swaps due to changes in JPY/GBP exchange rates are in the opposite direction of the changes 
due to JPY/GBP in the associate’s assets. As the critical terms match, their values will systematically change in the opposite direction of each 
other. Thus we consider that this demonstrates the existence of an economic relationship.

Annual Report 2023 207

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceDuring the year there was no gain or loss (2022: £1m loss) relating to ineffectiveness of net investment in foreign entity hedges. The main source 
of ineffectiveness of the net investment hedge is the off-market value of the cross-currency swaps used to hedge US dollar net assets at the 
hedge designation date. Ineffectiveness due to changes in the counterparty credit risk was not material in the year and is expected to remain 
so due to the Group’s policy of only using counterparties with a credit rating of A- and above.

For the year ended 31 December 2023, the amount in comprehensive income related to net investment hedge accounting was a gain of £109m 
(2022: £68m loss).

The amount in net investment hedge reserves related to continuing hedges is a gain of £16m (2022: £91m loss), and the amount related to 
discontinued hedges is £nil (2022: £nil).

The change in fair value of the outstanding hedging instrument differs from the amount recognised in OCI during the year due to the impact  
of currency basis (excluded from the hedge relationship) and the foreign exchange impact of realised interest on the hedging instrument  
(not reflected in the fair value change).

(c) Cash flow hedge
These instruments are used to hedge a highly probable forecast transaction, or a change in the cash flows of a recognised asset or liability. 
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive 
income. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement. The gains or losses that are recognised in comprehensive 
income are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement. In the event 
that the hedged item occurs or is no longer expected to occur, accumulated gains or losses held in the cash flow hedge reserve are immediately 
recognised in the income statement. In the event that the hedged item is expected to occur but no longer meets the requirements of hedge 
accounting, accumulated gains or losses remain in other comprehensive income and are only recognised in the income statement when the 
forecast transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur. All cash flow hedge relationships are hedges of a foreign currency risk and all 
currencies were directly hedged, therefore the hedge ratio is considered to be 1:1.

Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to derivatives (marked as ‘cash flow hedge’ in the table on page 210) in accordance with IFRS 9. 
Where no hedge accounting has been applied, related derivatives have been marked as ‘non-hedge’.

The hedged item, a euro bond, creates an exposure to pay interest annually and the principal at maturity. By receiving the same amount at the 
same dates through a cross-currency swap, this exposure is eliminated. Since the critical terms of the derivative and the hedged debt match 
(i.e. matching currencies, payment dates and interest rate on the leg of the swap offsetting the bond), the change in value of the derivative, 
excluding any basis risk, will be considered to completely offset the changes in the hedged cash flow.

208 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementscontinuedAny ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedge is taken directly to finance costs. During the year there was a gain of £1m (2022: loss of £1m) from 
those derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship. Ineffectiveness due to changes in the counterparty credit risk was not material in the year 
and is expected to remain the same because the Group’s counterparties credit rating is A- and above.

Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to €400m (2022: €400m) of the €400m 2024 bond, €500m (2022: €500m) of the €500m 2026 
bond, €421m (2022: €421m) of the €850m 2027 bond, and €600m (2022: €600m) of the €600m 2028 bond. The cross-currency interest rate 
swaps are used as hedging instruments to hedge the volatility in the £/€ exchange rate of the bonds. For the year ended 31 December 2023, 
the amount in comprehensive income related to cash flow hedge accounting was a gain of £3m (2022: £6m loss).

Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to $350m (2022: $nil) of the $700m term loan. The interest rate swaps are used as hedging 
instruments to hedge the volatility in the SOFR interest rate of the term loan. For the year ended 31 December 2023, the amount in 
comprehensive income related to cash flow hedge accounting was £nil (2022: £nil).

The amount in cash flow hedge reserves related to continuing hedges is a gain of £6m (2022: £3m gain), and the amount related to discontinued 
hedges is £nil (2022: £nil).

The change in fair value of the outstanding hedging instrument differs from the amount recognised in OCI during the year due to the impact of 
currency basis (excluded from the hedge relationship) and the spot retranslation element of the fair value movement (which offsets the hedged 
item in the profit or loss).

C6. Fair value estimation
All financial instruments held at fair value are classified by reference to the source of inputs used to derive the fair value. The following hierarchy 
is used:

Level 1 –  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 –   inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly through modelling 

based on prices; and

Level 3 –    inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

Certain interest rate swaps have been bifurcated to manage different foreign exchange risks. The interest rate swaps are shown on the balance 
sheet as net derivative assets £71m (2022: £21m) and net derivative liabilities £48m (2022: £92m).

The effective nominal value of foreign exchange swaps is £27m asset (2022: £17m liability) and foreign exchange forwards is £nil (2022: £nil).

Given the volume of acquisitions and the variety of inputs to the valuation of contingent consideration (depending on each transaction), there are 
not considered to be any changes in input that would have a material impact on the contingent consideration liability.

The effective hedged interest rate reflects the interest rate payable after the impact of interest due from cross-currency swaps. The Group’s 
hedging strategy is to hold foreign currency debt in proportion to foreign currency profit and cash flows, which are mainly in euro and US dollar. 
As a result, the Group has swapped a portion of the bonds it has issued into US dollars, thus increasing the effective hedged interest rate.

The Group considers the fair value of other current liabilities to be equal to the carrying value.

D3. Contingent liabilities
The Group has contingent liabilities relating to guarantees in respect of leasehold properties, pensions, third parties, tax, and litigation.  
The Group also has contingent liabilities for the management or remediation of environmental issues. These issues tend to be complex to 
determine and resolve and may be material, although it is often not possible to accurately predict future costs reliably. The possibility of any 
significant outflows in respect of these items is considered to be remote.

1. Accounting convention
These Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, using the historical cost convention (as modified to include the revaluation 
of certain financial instruments), and are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company applies the recognition, 
measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (IAS) in conformity with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (‘Adopted IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has  
set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. The results of Rentokil Initial plc are included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of Rentokil Initial plc, which are presented on pages 170 to 220.

The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101, all of which have equivalent disclosures included 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements:
• the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46–52 of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment;
• the requirements of paragraphs 62, B64(d), B64(e), B64(g), B64(h), B64(j) to B64(m), B64(n)(ii), B64(o)(ii), B64(p), B64(q)(ii), B66, and B67 

of IFRS 3 Business Combinations;

• the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures;
• the requirements of paragraphs 91–99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement;
• the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to present comparative information in respect of: (i) paragraph 79(a)
(iv) of IAS 1; (ii) paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment; (iii) paragraph 118(e) of IAS 38 Intangible Assets; (iv) paragraphs 76 and 
79(d) of IAS 40 Investment Property; and (v) paragraph 50 of IAS 41 Agriculture;

• the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 39(c), and 134–136 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements;
• the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows;
• the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors;
• the requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures;
• the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, 

provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member; 

• the requirements of paragraphs 134(d)–134(f) and 135(c)–135(e) of IAS 36 Impairment of Asset; and
• the requirements of paragraphs 88C and 88D of IAS 12 Income Taxes. 

2. Material accounting policies
Judgements and key areas of estimation
The preparation of Financial Statements in compliance with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
the Company’s Directors to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas where significant judgements and 
estimates have been made in preparing the Financial Statements and their effect are disclosed in Note 3.

Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment. In the opinion of the Directors, the value of such investments 
are not less than shown at the balance sheet date.

Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost (where 
hedge accounting is not applied); any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 
profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has a continuing right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the balance sheet date under its committed bank credit facilities.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs 
from its tax base, except for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither 

accounting nor taxable profit; and

• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and 

it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
difference can be utilised.

The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are 
expected to apply when the deferred tax assets/liabilities are settled/recovered.

Financial instruments and risk management
The Company policy in respect of financial instruments and risk management is disclosed in Section C of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements on pages 203 to 212. Disclosures have been made on financial instruments as required by the Companies Act 2006.

Expected credit loss calculations are performed annually for intercompany debtors and are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses based 
on the Company’s historical credit loss experience adjusted for debt-specific factors.

Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity.

Plan. The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement, equivalent  
to the fair value of the benefit awarded. The fair value of the Performance Share Plan is determined by reference to option pricing models, 
principally stochastic and adjusted Black-Scholes models. The fair value of the Restricted Share Plan is determined by reference to an adjusted 
Black-Scholes model. The charge for both plans is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the award. At each balance 
sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of shares that vest or options that are expected to become exercisable. Any revision to 
the original estimates is reflected in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately to the extent it relates to past 
service, and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.

Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends 
are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. See Note D1 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for details of dividends proposed in the year.

3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Company makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based 
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
In the future actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Estimates and assumptions have been reviewed to assess 
whether significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is present; 
there were no estimates nor assumptions found to have such significant risk.

The Company is within the scope of the OECD Pillar 2 model rules. Pillar 2 legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom, the jurisdiction in which 
the entity is incorporated, and will come into effect from 1 January 2024.

Since the Pillar 2 legislation was not effective at the reporting date, the Company has no related current tax exposure. The Company applies the 
exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar 2 income taxes, as provided in the 
amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023. Further information about Pillar 2 legislation can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Note A12.

FRS 101 provides exemption from the disclosure requirements of paragraphs 88C and 88D of IAS 12 Income Taxes provided that equivalent 
disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group in which the Company is consolidated.

Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to derivatives (marked as cash flow hedge in the table above) in accordance with IFRS 9.  
Where no hedge accounting has been applied, related derivatives have been marked as ‘non-hedge’. Any ineffectiveness on the cash flow  
hedge is taken directly to finance costs. During the year there was a gain of £1m (2022: £nil) from those derivatives relating to ineffectiveness in a 
cash flow hedge relationship. Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to €nil (2022: €nil) of the €400m 2024 bond, €179m (2022: €179m) 
of the €500m 2026 bond, and €175m (2022: €175m) of the €600m 2028 bond. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are used as hedging 
instruments to hedge the volatility in the £/€ exchange rate of the bonds. For the year ended 31 December 2023, the amount in comprehensive 
income related to cash flow hedge accounting was a gain of £1m (2022: £8m loss).

Annual Report 2023

 Notes to the Parent Company Financial StatementscontinuedThe following discussion should be read together with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto, included 
elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, 
including information with respect to the Group’s plans and strategy for its business, includes forward-looking statements that reflect plans, 
estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the ‘Risk Factors’ and sections 
of this Annual Report, including ‘Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements’. Therefore, actual results may differ materially 
from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

The impact of macroeconomic factors on the Group’s business
Macroeconomic factors
Inflation – The Group’s cost base is largely driven by the cost of compensation for employees, the costs of required equipment (including service 
equipment and uniforms, vehicles and fuel, and technology necessary to deliver the high-quality services), and the cost of the products being 
used on customer premises including service contract equipment and consumables. All of these costs are subject to inflationary pressures and 
as such, sustained elevated increases in such costs may not always be possible to pass on to customers.

As a result of the invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, inflation levels globally have risen to their highest in two decades, particularly 
impacting fuel prices, timber prices, energy prices and labour costs. This compares with the period from 2020 to 2021, when inflationary 
pressures were typically low in the countries in which the Group operated, and therefore passing these costs onto customers has been 
achievable. In contrast, the Group also has operations in Lebanon, a hyperinflationary country. The business in Lebanon implements frequent 
price increases to offset the increases in costs it incurs. This demonstrates that the Group has operations in both low and high inflationary 
markets, and is accustomed to a range of inflationary environments.

During 2023, the Group has been able to pass along the incurred inflationary impacts in the form of increased prices to its customers. However, 
the Group cannot predict the extent to which it may experience future cost increases. The Group may be prevented, in whole or in part, from 
passing these cost increases on to its existing and prospective customers, which could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business.

Shortage of products or supply chain impacts – The Group does not have significant exposure to international logistics as the majority of its 
purchased products and services are sourced in the country where they are consumed. Where there are local shortages, products are typically 
able to be imported quickly from neighbouring markets. Where global shortages exist, such as recent microchip shortages impacting IT and 
vehicle supply chains, the Group has been able to generally extend the life of the asset until supply chains catch up. However, should there be 
long-term shortages of critical products or services in the future, then this may adversely impact the operational performance of the Group.

Labour shortages – The goods and services of the Group are sold by front line sales employees and delivered by a highly skilled technician 
workforce. These employees are supported by functional support employees in the Group’s offices around the world. The Group typically retains 
around 85% of employees each year, although this can vary from year to year and by market. As a result of employees leaving each year and the 
need to replace and hire additional employees for growth, The Group has established experienced recruitment teams and processes, allowing 
access to many different labour marketplaces. The Group has a very strong recruitment brand and offers attractive remuneration packages and 
career development opportunities. In the future, a very significant shortage of labour in a specific geography may limit the Group’s ability to 
service revenue opportunities while finding qualified employees and adversely impact the operational performance of the Group.

Key indicators of performance and financial condition
The Group focuses on a variety of indicators and key operating and financial metrics, including certain non-IFRS measures, to monitor the 
financial condition and performance of its business. These metrics include Revenue, Operating profit, Adjusted Operating Profit (at CER), 
Adjusted Profit Before Tax, Adjusted Profit after Tax, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Interest, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, 
Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion, Customer Retention, Colleague Retention and Lost Time Accident Rate.

Revenue – Revenue results are primarily a function of the volume and pricing of the services and products provided to the Group’s customers 
by the business, as well as the mix of services and products provided across the business. The volume of revenue is impacted by new unit sales, 
the retention of existing customers and acquisitions. The Group serves both residential and commercial customers. During 2023, sales were 
generated across 90 countries, with the only country accounting for greater than, or equal to, 10% of revenue from external customers being the 
US (60%).

Operating profit – This measure is calculated as revenue less operating expenses, with operating expenses consisting of employee costs, direct 
materials and services, vehicle costs, property costs, depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment, amortisation and impairment 
of intangible assets, one-off and adjusting items and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include professional fees, marketing 
costs, amortisation of contract costs and movements in bad debt provision.

Adjusted Operating Profit (at CER) – This is an adjusted measure and is presented before the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets 
(excluding computer software), one-off and adjusting items (see below) and gain or loss on disposal of businesses. Given the international nature 
of the Group’s operations, foreign exchange movements can have a significant impact on the reported results of the Group when they are 
translated into sterling (the functional currency of the Group). In order to help understand the underlying trading performance of the business, 
revenue and profit measures are often presented at constant exchange rates (CER). CER is calculated by translating current-year reported 
numbers at the full-year average exchange rates for the prior year. See ‘Constant Exchange Rates (CER)’ below (page 236).

Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023 227

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and Results of OperationsStrategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceAdjusted Profit Before and After Tax – This non-IFRS measure is used to give management and investors an understanding of the underlying 
profitability of the business over time. Adjusted Profit Before Tax is calculated by adding the following items back to profit before income tax: 
amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software), one-off and adjusting items and net interest adjustments. 
Intangible assets (excluding computer software) are recognised on acquisition of businesses which, by their nature, can vary by size and amount 
each year. As a result, amortisation of intangibles is added back to assist with understanding the underlying trading performance of the business 
and to allow comparability across regions and segments. One-off and adjusting items are significant expenses or income that will have a 
distortive impact on the underlying profitability of the Group. Typical examples are costs related to the acquisition of businesses (including 
aborted acquisitions), gain or loss on disposal or closure of a business, material gains or losses on disposal of fixed assets, adjustments to  
legacy property-related provisions (environmental liabilities), and payments or receipts as a result of legal disputes. 

Net interest adjustments are other non-cash or one-off accounting gains and losses that can cause material fluctuations and distort 
understanding of the performance of the business, such as amortisation of discount on legacy provisions and gains and losses on hedge 
accounting. These adjustments are made to aid year-on-year comparability. Adjusted Profit After Tax is calculated by adding back amortisation 
and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software), one-off and adjusting items and net interest adjustments, and the tax effect 
on these adjustments to profit before income tax.

Adjusted Earnings Per Share – Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the 
Company by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust 
which are treated as cancelled, and including share options for which all conditions have been met. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all potential dilutive ordinary shares. The Group’s potentially dilutive ordinary 
shares relate to the contingent issuable shares under the Group’s long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) to the extent that the performance conditions 
have been met at the end of the period. These share options are issued for nil consideration to employees if performance conditions are met. 
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, 18,422 share options were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of the dilutive effect 
as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 1,290,294). Adjusted Earnings Per Share is a non-IFRS measure that is calculated by dividing 
adjusted profit after tax by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue. This supplemental measure is also used by management 
to gain an understanding of the underlying earnings per share performance of the business over time and enable company-to-company 
comparisons.

Adjusted Interest – Adjusted Interest is calculated by adjusting the reported finance income and costs by net interest adjustments (amortisation 
of discount on legacy termite provision and foreign exchange and hedge accounting ineffectiveness).

Free Cash Flow – Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure that is measured as net cash from operating activities, adjusted for cash flows related 
to the purchase and sale of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets, cash flows related to leased assets, cash flows related to one-off 
and adjusting items and dividends received from associates. These items are considered by management to be non-discretionary, as continued 
investment in these assets is required to support the day-to-day operations of the business. This measure is also used by management to assess 
how much cash there is to reinvest into the business for future growth through people, technology and M&A.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion – Adjusted Free Cash Flow is measured as Free Cash Flow adjusted for 
product development additions and net investment hedge cash interest through other comprehensive income. This measure is also used by 
management to determine the efficiency at which the business is able to convert profits into cash. Free Cash Flow Conversion is calculated  
by dividing Adjusted Free Cash Flow by Adjusted Profit After Tax, expressed as a percentage. Adjusted Profit After Tax is defined as Adjusted 
Profit Before Tax adjusted for the tax effect of amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) and one-off and 
adjusting items and net interest adjustments.

Customer Retention – Customer Retention is used to track the retention of the Group’s renewable customers and is calculated on a rolling, 
12-month basis in order to avoid seasonal anomalies. It is defined as the total portfolio value of customers retained as a percentage of the 
opening portfolio. The Group views Customer Retention as one of the key indicators of the long-term success of the business. Customer 
Retention was 82.3% in the year ended 31 December 2023 and 82.4% in the year ended 31 December 2022.

Colleague Retention – Defined as total Sales and Service employees retained in the year as a percentage of Sales and Service headcount  
at the start of the year. The Group considers Colleague Retention to be a key driver of Customer Retention. Colleague Retention was 84.2%  
in the year ended 31 December 2023 and 79.5% in the year ended 31 December 2022. The increase of 4.7 percentage points in the year ended  
31 December 2023 as compared to the year ended 31 December 2022 was a result of a wide-ranging programme including: the launch of a 
retention dashboard and manager training; monitoring for potential issues before escalation; additional mentoring resources; and an enhanced 
new hire and onboarding experience.

Lost Time Accident Rate – Defined as the number of lost time accidents per 100,000 standard working hours. The Group views Lost Time 
Accident Rate as a key measure of the Group’s employees’ injury prevention. The rate was 0.31 in the year ended 31 December 2023 and  
0.39 in the year ended 31 December 2022.

Annual Report 2023

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationscontinuedCertain components of results of operations
Profit before income tax – This is calculated as revenue less operating expenses and net finance costs plus share of profit from associated 
undertakings (net of tax).

Income tax expense – The income tax expense for the period comprises both current and deferred tax. Current tax expense represents the 
amount payable on this year’s taxable profits and any adjustment relating to prior years. Taxable profits differ from accounting profits as some 
items of income or expenditure are not taxable or deductible or may be taxable or deductible in a different accounting period. 

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws, enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, in the 
countries where the Group’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to 
provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences between accounting and tax bases. Deferred tax is determined using 
tax rates that are expected to apply when the timing difference reverses based on tax rates which are enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.

Profit for the year – This measure is calculated as profit before income tax less income tax expense.

For definitions of revenue and operating profit (including operating expenses), see ‘Key Indicators of Performance and Financial Condition’ above.

Revenue
Revenue increased by £1,661m, or 44.7%, to £5,375m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £3,714m in the year ended 31 December 2022. 
Foreign exchange had an adverse effect of £39m. Revenue was favourably impacted by revenues from acquisitions completed during the year 
ended 31 December 2023 by £75m. The remaining growth of £1,625m is driven by the flow through of a full year of revenues from acquisitions 
completed in the year ended 31 December 2022, alongside organic actions taken to increase the existing revenues of the Group. The £1,625m 
of growth above consists of £1,578m from the Pest Control segment, £23m from the Hygiene & Wellbeing segment and £25m from the France 
Workwear segment partially offset by a decrease of £1m from the Central segment. See ‘Revenue by Geographical Locations’ and ‘Revenue 
by Business Segment’ for further discussion.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by £1,338m, or 39.7%, to £4,711m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £3,373m in the year ended 
31 December 2022.

Employee costs
Employee costs increased by £770m, or 44.4%, to £2,506m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £1,736m in the year ended 31 December 
2022. This was as a result of an increase in the number of employees due to the acquisition of Terminix in the year ended 31 December 2022 and 
other businesses acquired during the year ended 31 December 2023, growth during the year ended 31 December 2023, and globally higher 
wage inflation.

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceDirect materials and services
Direct materials and services increased by £196m, or 27.8%, to £900m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £704m in the year ended 
31 December 2022. The increase was a result of the increase in sales of products and services due to the acquisition of Terminix in the year 
ended 31 December 2022 and other businesses acquired during the year ended 31 December 2023.

Vehicle costs
Vehicle costs increased by £84m, or 41.6%, to £285m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £201m in the year ended 31 December 2022, 
which was a result of the increase in the number of employees due to the acquisition of Terminix in the year ended 31 December 2022 and other 
businesses acquired during the year ended 31 December 2023 and higher fuel prices.

Property costs
Property costs increased by £24m, or 29.4%, to £106m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £82m in the year ended 31 December 2022 as a 
result of the acquisition of Terminix in the year ended 31 December 2022 and other businesses acquired during the year ended 31 December 2023.

Depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment
Depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment increased by £14m, or 10.0%, to £154m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from 
£140m in the year ended 31 December 2022 mainly as a result of the acquisition of Terminix in the year ended 31 December 2022 and other 
businesses acquired during the year ended 31 December 2023.

Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets increased by £61m, or 44.1%, to £201m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £140m in

the acquisition of Terminix.

One-off and adjusting items decreased by £38m, or 28.2%, to £98m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £136m in the year ended 
31 December 2022 mainly as a result of the fees incurred relating to the Terminix acquisition decreasing by £67m to £1m in the year ended 
31 December 2023 from £68m in the year ended 31 December 2022 partially offset by an increase in Terminix integration costs by £19m 
to £81m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £62m in the year ended 31 December 2022.

Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses increased by £227m, or 97.0%, to £461m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £234m in the year ended

2023 from £3,714m in the year ended 31 December 2022 offset by the increase in operating expenses of £1,338m, or 39.7%, to £4,711m in the year 
ended 31 December 2023 from £3,373m in the year ended 31 December 2022. This increase in operating profit reflected core business growth 
across major regions, in addition to effective ongoing capture of early synergies from the Terminix transaction. Price increases have also been 
successfully implemented over the course of the year to offset the impacts of inflation on the cost base.

2023 from £296m in the year ended 31 December 2022 and the increase in income tax expenses of £48m, or 75.6%, to £112m in the year ended

Operating expenses increased by £8m, or 2.8%, to £306m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £298m in the year ended 31 December 
2022. The main driver of this increase was employee costs which increased by £8m, or 5.1%, to £174m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from 
£166m in the year ended 31 December 2022, as a result of an increase in the number of employees due to businesses acquired during the year 
ended 31 December 2023, growth during the year ended 31 December 2023, and inflationary cost increases. Another driver of the increase 
was direct materials and services which increased by £5m, or 7.2%, to £65m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £60m in the year ended 
31 December 2022, as a result of an increase in revenue. This was partially offset by a reduction in the amortisation and impairment of intangible 
assets of £9m, or 46.2%, to £11m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £20m in the year ended 31 December 2022, due to a £9m impairment 
of Lebanon goodwill in the year ended 31 December 2022.

Operating expenses increased by £15m, or 8.0%, to £202m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £187m in the year ended 31 December 
2022. The main driver of this increase was employee costs which increased by £9m, or 8.2%, to £117m in the year ended 31 December 2023 
from £108m in the year ended 31 December 2022, as a result of an increase in the number of employees due to businesses acquired during the 
year ended 31 December 2023, growth during the year ended 31 December 2023, and wage inflationary impacts. A further driver of this was 
direct materials and services which increased by £5m, or 17.4%, to £31m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £26m in the year ended 
31 December 2022 as a result of an increase in revenue.

31 December 2022. The main driver of this was employee costs which increased by £704m, or 55.6%, to £1,970m in the year ended 31 December 
2023 from £1,266m in the year ended 31 December 2022 as a result of an increase in the number of employees due to the acquisition of Terminix 
in the year ended 31 December 2022 and other businesses acquired during the year ended 31 December 2023, and globally higher wage 
inflation. Direct materials and services increased by £173m, or 37.0%, to £639m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £466m in the year 
ended 31 December 2022. The increase was as a result of the increase in sales of products and services. Vehicle costs increased by £79m, 
or 53.5%, to £228m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £149m in the year ended 31 December 2022, which was a result of the increase 
in the number of employees due to the acquisition of Terminix in the year ended 31 December 2022 and other businesses acquired during the 
year ended 31 December 2023, and higher fuel prices. Other operating expenses increased by £267m, or 121.1%, to £488m in the year ended 
31 December 2023 from £221m in the year ended 31 December 2022 due to the acquisition of Terminix in the year ended 31 December 2022 and 
other businesses acquired during the year ended 31 December 2023. One-off and adjusting items decreased by £54m, or 77.1%, to £16m in the 
year ended 31 December 2023 from £70m in the year ended 31 December 2022 as a result of Terminix related integration costs incurred during 
the year having been reported in our Central and Regional overheads segment for 2023.

Operating expenses increased by £22m, or 13.7%, to £184m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £162m in the year ended 31 December 
2022. The main driver of this was employee costs which increased by £11m, or 11.0%, to £99m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £88m 
in the year ended 31 December 2022 as a result of strong growth in the period requiring more processing and delivery employees and higher 
depreciation on garments.

Non-IFRS measures
The Group uses a number of non-IFRS measures to present the financial performance of the business. These are not measures as defined under 
IFRS, but management believe that these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the Financial Statements, in order to 
better understand the underlying trading performance in the year from activities that will contribute to future performance. The Group’s internal 
strategic planning process is also based on these measures and they are used for management incentive purposes. They should be viewed as 
complements to, and not replacements for, the comparable IFRS measures. Other companies may use similarly labelled measures which are 
calculated differently to the way the Group calculates them, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. Accordingly, investors should 
not place undue reliance on these non-IFRS measures.

The following sets out an explanation and the reconciliation to the nearest IFRS measure for each non-IFRS measure.

Constant exchange rates (CER)
Given the international nature of the Group’s operations, foreign exchange movements can have a significant impact on the reported results 
of the Group when they are translated into sterling (the presentation currency of the Group). In order to help understand the underlying trading 
performance of the business, revenue and profit measures are often presented at constant exchange rates. CER is calculated by translating 
current-year reported numbers at the full-year average exchange rates for the prior year. It is used to give management and other users of 
the accounts clearer comparability of underlying trading performance against the prior period by removing the effects of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The major exchange rates used for 2023 are £/$ 1.2441 (2022: 1.2421) and £/€ 1.1503 (2022: 1.1717). Comparisons are with the 
year ended 31 December 2022 unless otherwise stated.

Annual Report 2023

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationscontinuedAdjusted expenses and profit measures
Adjusted expenses and profit measures are used to give investors and management a further understanding of the underlying profitability 
of the business over time by stripping out income and expenses that can distort results due to their size and nature. Adjusted profit measures 
are calculated by adding the following items back to the equivalent IFRS profit measure:

• amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software);

• one-off and adjusting items; and

• net interest adjustments.

Intangible assets (such as customer lists and brands) are recognised on acquisition of businesses which, by their nature, can vary by size and 
amount each year. Capitalisation of innovation-related development costs will also vary from year to year. As a result, amortisation of intangibles 
is added back to assist with understanding the underlying trading performance of the business and to allow comparability across regions and 
categories (see table on page 181).

One-off and adjusting items are significant expenses or income that will have a distortive impact on the underlying profitability of the Group. 
Typical examples are costs related to the acquisition of businesses, gain or loss on disposal or closure of a business, material gains or losses 
on disposal of fixed assets, adjustments to legacy environmental liabilities, and payments or receipts as a result of legal disputes. An analysis 
of one-off and adjusting items is set out below.

Net interest adjustments are other non-cash or one-off accounting gains and losses that can cause material fluctuations and distort 
understanding of the performance of the business, such as amortisation of discount on legacy provisions and gains and losses on hedge 
accounting.

Adjusted expenses are one-off and adjusting items, and Adjusted Interest. Adjusted profit measures used are Adjusted Operating Profit, 
Adjusted Profit Before and After Tax, and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Earnings Per Share is also reported, derived from Adjusted Profit After Tax.

Adjusted cash measures
The Group aims to generate sustainable cash flow in order to support its acquisition programme and to fund dividend payments to shareholders. 
Management considers that this is useful information for investors. Adjusted cash measures in use are Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, 
and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion.

Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow is measured as net cash flows from operating activities, adjusted for cash flows related to the purchase and sale of property, 
plant, equipment and intangible assets, cash flows related to leased assets, cash flows related to one-off and adjusting items and dividends 
received from associates. These items are considered by management to be non-discretionary, as continued investment in these assets is 
required to support the day-to-day operations of the business. Free Cash Flow is used by management for incentive purposes and is a measure 
shared with and used by investors. A reconciliation of net cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement to  
Free Cash Flow is provided in the table below.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion is provided to demonstrate to investors the proportion of Adjusted Profit After Tax that is converted to cash. 
It is calculated by dividing Adjusted Free Cash Flow by Adjusted Profit After Tax, expressed as a percentage. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is measured 
as Free Cash Flow adjusted for product development additions and net investment hedge cash interest through Other Comprehensive Income. 
Product development additions are adjusted due to their variable size and non-underlying nature. Net investment hedge cash interest through 
Other Comprehensive Income is adjusted because the cash relates to an item that is not recognised in Adjusted Profit After Tax.

The nearest IFRS-based equivalent measure to Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion would be Cash Conversion, which is shown in the table below 
to provide a comparison in the calculation. Cash Conversion is calculated as net cash flows from operating activities divided by profit attributable 
to equity holders of the Company, expressed as a percentage. Management considers that this is useful information for investors as it gives an 
indication of the quality of profits, and ability of the Group to turn profits into cash flows.

The Group’s effective tax rate (ETR) for 2023 on reported profit before tax was 22.7% (2022: 21.6%). The Group’s Adjusted ETR before 
amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software), one-off and adjusting items, and the net interest adjustments for 2023 
was 23.8% (2022: 19.7%). This compares with a blended rate of tax for the countries in which the Group operates of 25.1% (2022: 23.7%). 
The Group’s low tax rate in 2023 is primarily attributable to net prior-year tax credits of £12m (2022: £9m). 

The Group’s tax charge and Adjusted ETR will be influenced by the global mix and level of profits, changes in future tax rates and other tax 
legislation, foreign exchange rates, the utilisation of brought-forward tax losses on which no deferred tax asset has been recognised, the 
resolution of open issues with various tax authorities, acquisitions and disposals.

Liquidity and capital resources
The primary source of the Group’s liquidity over the past two years was cash generated from operations. These funds were generally used to pay 
interest, taxes and dividends, and to fund capital expenditure and acquisitions, and the Group expects to continue to fund future operating and 
capital needs. The Group considers its working capital to be sufficient for its present requirements.

Cash flow activity
Following is a discussion of the Group’s cash flows for the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022.

Operating activities
Net cash inflows from operating activities increased by £137m, or 22.8%, to £737m in the year ended 31 December 2023, from £600m in the year 
ended 31 December 2022. Operating Profit increased by £308m, to £625m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £317m in the year ended 
31 December 2022. Within Operating Profit, non-cash items moved as follows: (i) depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment 
increased by £6m to £154m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £148m in the year ended 31 December 2022, due to businesses acquired 
during the period; (ii) depreciation of leased assets increased by £14m to £120m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £106m in the year 
ended 31 December 2022; (iii) amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) increased by £57m to £175m  
in the year ended 31 December 2023, from £118m in the year ended 31 December 2022, due to businesses acquired during the period; (iv) 
amortisation and impairment of computer software increased by £4m to £26m in the year ended 31 December 2023, from £22m in the year  
ended 31 December 2022, due to businesses acquired during the period; and (v) other non-cash items increased by £18m to £26m in the year 
ended 31 December 2023, from £8m in the year ended 31 December 2022, mainly due to higher share-based payment costs as a result of the 
Terminix transaction.

Working capital flow decreased £120m to a £123m outflow in the year ended 31 December 2023, from a £3m outflow in the year ended 
31 December 2022, due to termite provision payments and overall growth in the business. This is reflected in the trade and other receivables 
outflow, increasing by £34m to £29m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from a £5m inflow in the year ended 31 December 2022, and the trade 
and other payables and provisions outflow increasing by £66m to a £60m outflow in the year ended 31 December 2023, from a £6m inflow in the 
year ended 31 December 2022. The net impact of interest and tax paid was an increase of £150m to £266m in the year ended 31 December 2023 
from £116m in the year ended 31 December 2023, due to higher debt because of the funding of the Terminix transaction and higher profits.

Investing activities
Net cash outflows from investing activities decreased by £781m, or 65.2%, to £416m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £1,197m in the year 
ended 31 December 2022. The main driver of this decrease was acquisitions of companies and businesses decreasing by £776m to £242m for 
the year ended 31 December 2023 from £1,018m in the year ended 31 December 2022, due to the non-repeat of the acquisition of Terminix in the 
year ended 31 December 2022.

Financing activities
Net cash flows from financing activities decreased by £1,684m to a £361m outflow in the year ended 31 December 2023 from a £1,323m inflow  
in the year ended 31 December 2022. The main drivers of this decrease were inflows from proceeds from new debt decreasing by £2,383m to 
£nil for the year ended 31 December 2023, from £2,383m in the year ended 31 December 2022, dividends paid increasing by £79m to £201m in 
the year ended 31 December 2023 from £122m in the year ended 31 December 2022, and outflows from the capital element of lease payments 
increasing by £53m to £157m in the year ended 31 December 2023 from £104m in the year ended 31 December 2022, largely as a result of a  
full year of the Terminix acquisition within the Group in 2023. Further, outflows from debt repayments decreased by £844m to £nil in the year 
ended 31 December 2023, from £844m in the year ended 31 December 2022, due to the non-repeat of debts settled that were acquired with  
the Terminix transaction in the year ended 31 December 2022.

undertakings in 82 countries (the Group operates in 90 countries).  
The Company’s related undertakings are listed on pages 214 to 220.

Articles of association
The articles of association set out the internal regulations of the 
Company and cover such matters as the rights of shareholders, the 
conduct of the Board, and general meetings. The articles themselves 
may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders (by at  
least 75% of the votes cast by those voting in person or by proxy). 
Subject to company law and the articles of association, the Directors 
may exercise all the powers of the Company and may delegate 
authority to committees, and day-to-day management and decision 
making to individual Executive Directors. The Company’s objects are 
unrestricted. The articles of association are available upon request 
and are displayed on our website at rentokil-initial.com.

Re-election of Directors and service contracts
In accordance with the articles of association, Directors can be 
appointed by the Board and must be subsequently elected by 
shareholders at a general meeting. In accordance with the articles  
of association and the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code), 
Directors submit themselves for re-election annually. Directors can  
be removed, and their replacements appointed, by shareholders in  
a general meeting. 

Information on our Board of Directors, including their biographical 
details, and changes during 2023, can be found in the Corporate

242 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

Directors’ powers
Under the articles of association, the Directors are responsible for the 
management of the business of the Company and may exercise all the 
powers of the Company subject to the provisions of relevant statutes 
and the Company’s articles of association. For example, the articles 
contain specific provisions and restrictions regarding the Company’s 
power to borrow money. The articles of association also give power 
to the Board to appoint and replace Directors as detailed above. 

Powers relating to the issuing of shares are also included in the 
articles of association and such authorities are renewed by 
shareholders each year at the AGM, as detailed on page 243. 

Directors’ interests
The beneficial interests of the Directors, including the interests of any 
connected persons, in the share capital of the Company are shown  
on page 146. During the year, no Director had any material interest  
in any contract of significance to the Group’s business. There have 
been no changes to the beneficial interests of the Directors between 
31 December 2023 and the date of this report.

General meetings
AGMs require 21 clear days’ notice to shareholders. Subject to the 
Companies Act 2006, other general meetings require 14 clear  
days’ notice.

For all general meetings, a quorum of two shareholders present in 
person or by proxy representing at least one-third in nominal value 
of the Company’s share capital, is required.

An ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the 
votes of those persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum. 
A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of not less than 
three-quarters of the persons voting at a meeting at which there is 
a quorum.

Dividend
The Directors have recommended a final dividend of 5.93p per share 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. Payment of this 
dividend is subject to shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM. Further 
information on the Company’s dividend policy can be found on page 
62 and the key dates for the final dividend can be found on page 246. 

Share capital
The Company’s share capital during the year consisted of ordinary 
shares of 1p each. There were 2,522,539,885 shares in issue at 
31 December 2023, which represents 100% of the Company’s issued 
share capital (2022: 2,520,039,885). The principal markets for trading 
in our securities are the London Stock Exchange and the New York 
Stock Exchange. Our securities are listed on both markets under the 
stock symbol ‘RTO’.

At 31 December 2023, the proportion of ordinary shares represented 
by American Depositary Shares (ADSs) was 10.75% of the issued share 
capital of the Company. At 31 December 2023, there were 10,626 
registered holders of ordinary shares, of which 99 were based in the 
US, and there were seven record holders of ADSs, all of which were 
based in the US.

All ordinary shares carry the same rights and no shareholder enjoys 
any preferential rights, regardless of the size of their holding. Each 
ordinary share (other than treasury shares, which have no voting 
rights) carries the right to vote at a general meeting of the Company. 
The Company did not hold any treasury shares between 31 December 
2022 and 31 December 2023 and accordingly the Company did not 
sell any treasury shares. The Company’s articles of association provide 
that, on a show of hands, every member who is present in person or 
by proxy at a general meeting of the Company shall have one vote. 
On a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall 
have one vote for every share of which they are a holder. 

The articles do not contain special control rights or restrictions on 
transfer or limitations on the holding of ordinary shares and no 
requirements for the prior approval of any transfers. There are no 
restrictions under the Articles that would limit the rights of persons 
not resident in the UK to own or vote in relation to ordinary shares. 
No person holds securities in the Company carrying special rights 
with regard to control of the Company. The Company is not aware 
of any agreements between holders of securities that may result 
in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. 

Authority for the Company to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe 
for shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £16,800,000 was 
obtained at the AGM on 10 May 2023. The authority remains in force 
and approval will be sought from shareholders at the 2024 AGM to 
renew the authority for a further year. 

During the year, a total of 2.5 million ordinary shares with an aggregate 
nominal value of £25,000 were allotted to Computershare Nominees 
(Channel Islands) Limited, the account nominee of Computershare 
Trustees (Jersey) Limited, which acts as trustee for the Rentokil Initial 
Employee Share Trust (the Trustee). The shares were issued to satisfy 
awards that vested in 2023 under the Company’s Performance  
Share Plan.

Details of the shares held by the Trustee are contained beneath the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity table on page 172. 
As at 31 December 2023, the Trustee holds on trust 0.52% of the 
issued share capital of the Company to satisfy awards that vest under 
the Company’s Performance Share Plan, the Deferred Bonus Plan, and 
the Terminix Share Plan. The Trustee has agreed to waive any right to 
all dividend payments on shares held by it, and the voting rights in 
relation to these shares are exercised by the Trustee. The Trustee may 
vote or abstain from voting with the shares, or accept or reject any 
offer relating to the shares, in any way it sees fit, without incurring any 
liability and without being required to give reasons for its decision. 

Repurchase of shares
Authority for the Company to make purchases of its own shares of 
up to 252,000,000 shares was obtained at the AGM on 10 May 2023 
and such authority will be valid until the 2024 AGM. No purchases 
of its shares were made by the Company during 2023. The authority 
is normally renewed annually and approval will be sought from 
shareholders at the 2024 AGM to renew the authority for a 
further year.

Change of control provisions
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter, or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company, such as some financial and 
commercial agreements, and employee long-term incentive or share 
plans. None of these are deemed to be significant in terms of their 
potential impact on the Group as a whole. A description of the Group’s 
debt funding arrangements is set out in Note C7 to the Financial 
Statements. Note C1 describes the change of control provisions 
relating to the Group’s Euro Medium-Term Notes Programme.

Substantial shareholders
The Company has been notified pursuant to the Disclosure Guidance 
and Transparency Rules (DTR 5) that the following shareholders held, 
or were beneficially interested in, 3% or more of the Company’s issued 
share capital at 31 December 2023. The information provided below 
was correct at the date of notification, which may not have been within

Financial risk management
Details of financial risk management and the relevant policies and 
certain exposures of the Company are disclosed in Note C1, on  
pages 203 and 204 of the Financial Statements.

Post balance sheet events
There were no significant post balance sheet events affecting the 
Group since 31 December 2023.

Political donations
It is the Company’s policy not to make payments to political 
organisations. The Company does, however, maintain a shareholder 
authority to make payments of a political nature but does so only in 
order to ensure that the Company has authority from shareholders for 
the limited number of activities associated with the operation of the 
business which might be caught by the broad definition of payments 
of a political nature contained within current legislation. There were 
no payments to political organisations during 2023 (2022: £nil). 

Equal opportunities 
The Company regards equality and fairness as a fundamental right 
of all of its colleagues. Every colleague is required to support the 
Company to meet its commitment to provide equal opportunities in 
employment and avoid unlawful discrimination. People with disabilities 
have full and fair consideration for all vacancies, and disability is  
not seen to be an inhibitor to employment or career development. 
Appropriate arrangements are made for the continued employment 
and training, career development, and promotion of disabled persons 
employed by the Company. In the event of any colleague becoming 
disabled while with the Company, their needs and abilities would be 
assessed and, where possible, we would work to retain them and seek 
to offer alternative employment to them if they were no longer able to 
continue in their current role. 

Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023 243

Strategic ReportOther InformationFinancial StatementsCorporate GovernanceEngagement with employees, suppliers, 
customers, and others 
We have 62,900 colleagues in our workforce. We consider our 
workforce to be those colleagues who are employed directly by us, 
and we do not include contractors or agency workers in this group.  
We employ our colleagues directly wherever possible in order  
to invest in their training, to ensure their full understanding and 
compliance with our policies, including health and safety procedures, 
to allow them to build relationships with our customers and to  
become more efficient. The number of contractors or agency  
workers throughout the business is not sufficiently material to  
identify and engage with them as a separate stakeholder group. 

However, like our colleagues, our contractors and agency workers 
must operate under our Code of Conduct and we will engage with 
them wherever practicable. 

A summary of the methods we use to engage with our colleagues 
(including UK employees), suppliers, customers, and our other key 
stakeholders, is provided on pages 84 and 85, while details of Board 
engagement are provided throughout the Corporate Governance 
Report, principally on pages 114 and 115. The section 172(1) statement 
can be found on page 83 and details of principal decisions taken by 
the Board during 2023 can be found on page 111. Examples of how the 
Board had regard for stakeholders in its decisions and the effect of 
that regard are shown on pages 108 to 111. More than 1,100 managers 
and technical experts participate in our Performance Share Plan (see 
page 155). We do not currently offer an all-employee share scheme  
but we will continue to keep this under review. 

Branches 
The Company, through various subsidiaries, has branches in several 
different jurisdictions in which the business operates outside the UK. 

Directors’ indemnity and insurance 
The Directors are ultimately responsible for most aspects of the 
Company’s business dealings. They can face significant personal 
liability under criminal or civil law, or the UK Listing, Prospectus, 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, and equivalent US 
regulation, and can face a range of penalties, including censure,  
fines, and imprisonment. The Company considers that it is in its  
best interests to protect individuals who serve as Directors from  
the consequences of innocent error or omission, since this enables  
the Company to continue to attract prudent, appropriately qualified 
individuals to act as Directors. 

The Company maintained at its expense a directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance policy throughout the year to afford an indemnity 
in certain circumstances for the benefit of Group personnel, including 
the Directors. This insurance cover remains in place. The policy does 
not provide cover where the Director or officer has acted fraudulently 
or dishonestly. 

In addition, the Company has granted indemnities in favour of 
Directors which were in force throughout 2023 and up to the signing 
of this report, as permitted by sections 232 to 235 of the Companies 
Act 2006. In general terms, the indemnities protect Directors to the 
extent permissible by law from all costs and expenses incurred in the 
defence of any civil or criminal proceedings in which judgement is 
given in their favour, or the proceedings are otherwise disposed of 
without finding fault or where there is a successful application to  
court for relief from liability. The indemnity operates to the extent  
that the Director is not able to recover the relevant amounts under  
the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. 

Related party transactions 
Other than in respect of arrangements relating to the employment of 
Directors, details of which are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, or as set out in Note D4 on page 213 of the Financial 
Statements, which also provides details of transactions with joint 
ventures and associate entities, there is no indebtedness owed to or 
by the Company to any colleague or any other person considered to 
be a related party. 

244 Rentokil Initial plc 

Annual Report 2023

Disclosure of information to the auditor 
The Directors confirm that, insofar as each of them is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
each Director has taken all of the steps that should have been taken  
to ensure that they are each aware of any relevant audit information 
(as defined by section 418(3) of the Companies Act 2006) and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 

Going concern 
The Directors, having made enquiries as set out on page 175, 
consider that the Company and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operation for a period of at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of these annual Financial Statements. For this reason, 
they consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Financial Statements. 

Further details on the Group’s net debt, borrowing facilities, and 
financial risk management policies are provided in Section C Financing 
of the Notes to the Financial Statements on pages 203  
to 212. 

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the financial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulation.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have prepared  
the Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards and the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable 
law). In preparing the Group financial statements, the Directors  
have also elected to comply with International Financial Reporting 
Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IFRSs as issued by IASB).

Under company law, Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company, and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 

• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

• state whether applicable UK-adopted international accounting 

standards and IFRSs issued by IASB have been followed for the Group 
financial statements, and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the Parent Company 
financial statements, subject to any material departures disclosed  
and explained in the financial statements;

• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 

prudent; and

• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Parent Company will 
continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and Parent Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are also responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at  
any time the financial position of the Group and Parent Company,  
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the Parent Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 

Directors’ ReportcontinuedDirectors’ confirmations 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in  
pages 99 to 101 of the Annual Report confirm that, to the best of  
their knowledge: 

• the Group Financial Statements, which have been prepared in 

accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and 
IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit 
of the Group;

• the Parent Company Financial Statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 101, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial 
position of the Parent Company;

• the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and 

performance of the business and the position of the Group and Parent 
Company, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces; and

• the Directors consider that the Annual Report, which includes the 

Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced, and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s and the 
Company’s position and performance, business model, and strategy. 

The Directors’ Report on pages 96 to 161 and pages 242 to 245 and 
the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 94 were approved by a duly 
authorised Committee of the Board of Directors and signed on its 
behalf by Catherine Stead, the Company Secretary, on 7 March 2024.

Dividend payments
Please note that we no longer pay dividends by cheque. All dividend 
payments are now credited directly into a shareholder’s UK bank or 
building society account. Shareholders who historically received 
dividends by cheque and have not yet completed a Dividend Mandate 
Form will need to contact our Registrar to request a form for 
completion (see opposite for contact details). For any shareholder who 
has not submitted their dividend mandate by the deadline of 29 April 
2024, cash will be held in an account and they will need to contact our 
Registrar for the cash to be distributed to their UK bank or building 
society account. If you do not have a UK bank or building society 
account you may be able to arrange for payments to be converted 
and paid in your local currency. Please contact our Registrar for 
more information.

Dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)
The Company has a DRIP provided by Equiniti Financial Services 
Limited (Equiniti FS), which is a convenient, easy and cost-effective 
way to build a shareholding by using cash dividends to buy additional 
shares. Rather than having a bank account credited with a cash 
dividend, Equiniti FS will use the dividends payable to DRIP 
participants to purchase shares on your behalf in the market. 
Please go to shareview.co.uk for further information.

How to avoid share fraud
Reject cold calls: If you’ve been cold called with an offer to buy or 
sell shares, the chances are it is a high-risk investment or a scam. 
You should treat the call with extreme caution. The safest thing to 
do is to hang up.

Check the firm on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) register at 
fca.org.uk/register. The Financial Services Register is a public record 
of all the firms and individuals in the financial services industry that are 
regulated by the FCA.

Get impartial advice: Think about getting impartial financial advice 
before you hand over any money. Seek advice from someone 
unconnected to the firm that has approached you.

If you suspect that you have been approached by fraudsters, please 
tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at fca.org.uk/scams, 
where you can find out more about investment scams. You can also 
call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.

If you have lost money to investment fraud, you should report it to 
Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online at actionfraud.police.uk.

Find out more at fca.org.uk/scamsmart.

ALWAYS REMEMBER: If it seems too good to be true, it probably is!

Unsolicited mail
The Company is legally obliged to make its register of members 
available to the public, subject to a proper purpose test. As a 
consequence of this, some shareholders may receive unsolicited mail. 
Shareholders wishing to limit the amount of such mail should contact

Annual Report 2023

GlossaryIn order, among other things, to utilise the ‘safe harbour’ provisions  
of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are 
providing the following cautionary statement: 

• extraordinary events that impact our ability to service customers 
without interruption, including a loss of our third-party distributors;
• our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary 

This Annual Report 2023 contains statements that are, or may be, 
forward-looking regarding the Group’s financial position and results, 
business strategy, plans, and objectives, including, among other 
things, statements about expected revenues, margins, earnings  
per share, or other financial or other measures. These statements  
are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases 
such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “could,” “may,” “would,” “is likely to,” 
“should,” “intend,” “seek”, “aim”, “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “will,” 
“expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “positioned,” “strategy,” “outlook”, 
“target”, and similar expressions.

Although we believe that the forward-looking statements in this 
Annual Report 2023 are based on reasonable assumptions, such 
statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future 
events and circumstances. There are accordingly a number of factors 
which might cause actual results and performance to differ materially 
from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, but 
not limited to, uncertainties related to the following:

• our ability to integrate acquisitions successfully, or any unexpected 

costs or liabilities from our disposals;

• difficulties in integrating, streamlining, and optimising our IT systems, 

processes, and technologies;

• the availability of a suitably skilled and qualified labour force to 

maintain our business;

• our ability to attract, retain, and develop key personnel to lead our 

business;

• the impact of ESG matters, including those related to climate change 
and sustainability, on our business, reputation, results of operations, 
financial condition, and/or prospects;

• inflationary pressures, such as increases in wages, fuel prices, and 

other operating costs;

• supply chain issues, which may result in product shortages or other 

disruptions to our business;

• weakening general economic conditions, including changes in the 
global job market, or decreased consumer confidence or spending 
levels especially as they may affect demand from our customers;

• our ability to implement our business strategies successfully, including 

achieving our growth objectives;

• our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers;
• the highly competitive nature of our industries;
• cyber security breaches, attacks, and other similar incidents as well as 
disruptions or failures in our IT systems or data security procedures 
and those of our third-party service providers;

rights that are material to our business;

• our reliance on third parties, including third-party vendors for business 

process outsourcing initiatives, investment counterparties, and 
franchisees, and the risk of any termination or disruption of such 
relationships or counterparty default or litigation;

• the identification of material weaknesses in our internal control over 

financial reporting within the meaning of Section 404 of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act;

• any future impairment charges, asset revaluations, or downgrades;
• failure to comply with the many laws and governmental regulations to 
which we are subject or the implementation of any new or revised  
laws or regulations that alter the environment in which we do business, 
as well as the costs to us of complying with any such changes;

• termite damage claims and lawsuits related thereto and any associated 

impacts on the termite provision;

• our ability to comply with safety, health, and environmental policies, 

laws and regulations, including laws pertaining to the use of pesticides;
• any actual or perceived failure to comply with stringent, complex, and 
evolving laws, rules, regulations, and standards in many jurisdictions, 
as well as contractual obligations, including data privacy and security;

• changes in tax laws and any unanticipated tax liabilities;
• adverse credit and financial market events and conditions, which 
could, among other things, impede access to or increase the cost  
of financing;

• the restrictions and limitations within the agreements and instruments 

governing our indebtedness; 

• a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings, outlook, or watch assigned to 

our debt securities by rating agencies;

• an increase in interest rates and the resulting increase in the cost of 

servicing our debt; and

• exchange rate fluctuations and the impact on our results, or the foreign 

currency value of our ADSs and any dividends.

Further details on the principal risks that may affect the Group can 
be found in the Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 87 to 93, 
as well as page 78 (in relation to climate-related risk) and pages 203 
and 204 (in relation to financial risks), of this Annual Report 2023. 

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are  
made and no representation or warranty, whether express or implied, 
is given in relation to them, including as to their completeness or 
accuracy, or the basis on which they were prepared. Other than in 
accordance with the Company’s legal or regulatory obligations 
(including under the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance  
and Transparency Rules), the Company does not undertake any 
obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
Information contained in this Annual Report 2023 relating to the 
Company or its share price, or the yield on its shares, should not be 
relied upon as an indicator of future performance. Nothing in this 
Annual Report 2023 should be construed as a profit forecast.
