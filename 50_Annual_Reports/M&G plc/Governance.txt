Basis of preparation

The Strategic Report presented in our Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023 has been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR) issued by the FCA. In accordance with 
Section 414C of the Companies Act 2006, DTR 4.1.8 and DTR 4.1.9, the Group is required to provide a fair, balanced and understandable 
review of the business, including key performance indicators to the extent necessary, and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group.

The risk management section of the Strategic Report describes the principal risks and uncertainties on pages 60-68. 

In preparing this Strategic Report we have considered the Guidance on the Strategic Report as issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in June 2022. 

In addition the Board has also considered the guidelines with respect to alternative performance measures (APMs) as issued by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in October 2015 and the guidance on APMs included in the thematic review published 
by the Financial Reporting Council titled IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ Interim Disclosures in the First Year of Application 
in November 2023.

Our Board believes that the APMs identified within the Strategic Report are useful for management and investors in assessing the 
performance of the business during the year, in conjunction with the relevant IFRS results included within the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.

Chair’s introduction to governance

Governance that supports our business

The Board is responsible for our long-term sustainable success, 
generating stakeholder value and contributing to wider society

The purpose of those sessions is for 
Board members to have the opportunity 
to directly engage with, and listen to, 
colleagues from different cross sections 
of the business and to ensure we are 
reflecting feedback into planning and 
decision-making.

Stakeholders
The Board takes active steps to 
understand the interests, needs and 
concerns of other key stakeholders. 
Ongoing engagement and active 
listening are vital to ensuring that 
stakeholder views are properly 
understood and appropriately 
represented. In particular, the Board 
regularly discusses and advocates for a 
client-focused mindset and 
consideration of clients in everything we 
do. The Board strategy offsite included a 
client panel discussion, covering client 
expectations and how M&G can best 
serve them. 

Ensuring that management is spending 
time to understand our clients has been 
a Board priority this year. As part of 
developing the new purpose, 
management held meetings with clients 
to discuss M&G's products, service and 
wider proposition. 

Board evaluation review
The Board reflects on its performance 
and effectiveness annually. This year, our 
evaluation was facilitated externally by 
Boardroom Review Limited. The 
evaluation process was comprehensive 
and rigorous. It involved initial briefing 
meetings with a range of key 
stakeholders, followed by in-depth 
structured one-to-one interviews with 
members of the Board and a workshop 
during October 2023. 

Key themes emerging from the sessions 
and review were used to develop an 
action plan, which was reviewed 
and endorsed by the Board in 
December 2023. The Board will continue 
to track the actions through 2024 and 
progress will be reviewed regularly at 
Board meetings through the year.

More information about the Board 
evaluation and action plan is 
on pages 106-107.

Board composition and 
succession planning
Board composition and succession 
planning was a key area of focus for the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
during 2023, helping us ensure we have 
the appropriate balance of the desired 
skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge. 

The Board also played a key role in the 
changes at executive management level. 
As Chair, I consider each Director’s 
individual contribution to the Board, 
together with feedback and insights 
from the 2023 Board effectiveness 
review, to confirm that all Directors 
are discharging their roles effectively. 
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee keeps the skills required 
by the Board under review as part of 
succession planning.

Fiona Clutterbuck stepped down from 
the Board and her role as Senior 
Independent Director (SID) at the 2023 
AGM. I would like to thank her for her 
significant contribution to the Board and 
her years of service to M&G. I am 
grateful to Clare Thompson, Chair of the 
Audit Committee, who has acted as 
interim Senior Independent Director 
since then.

I have set out the key areas of 
governance on which the Board has 
focused over 2023. We have complied 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
throughout the financial year. The table 
on the next page sets out examples of 
how the Board has done this for each 
Principle and signposts to where you can 
find more information.

Governance and strategy
The Board is responsible for M&G's long-
term sustainable success, generating 
value for shareholders and contributing 
to wider society.

A critical element of the Board’s activity 
in early 2023 was approval of our 
refocused strategy, which builds on our 
financial strengths, drives simplification 
and efficiencies that benefit our clients, 
and delivers growth. The Board 
continues to oversee the delivery of 
the strategy.

Culture
Having the right culture at M&G is a vital 
underpin to our strategy and the Board 
is committed to ensuring that our 
colleagues are engaged in creating 
the right work environment and 
a positive culture. 

During 2023, the Board approved the 
new purpose, together with values and 
behaviours aligned to our strategy and 
business plan. I believe that our 
approach will set M&G up to achieve our 
strategic goals, delivering for our 
customers. Key to our success is 
maintaining our strong culture. The 
Board strongly believes in the value of 
culture and demonstrating the right tone 
from the top in everything that we do. 

The Board monitors this in a number of 
ways and receives regular updates on 
people and culture, as well as insights 
from regular colleague surveys. We also 
draw on regular formal and informal 
sessions with colleagues to gain deeper 
insights into our culture.

Diversity
The Board is fully committed to 
leveraging the benefits of diversity of 
thought and life experience in our 
discussions. We have committed to 
achieving the gender and ethnic 
diversity targets contained in Listing Rule 
9.8.6(9). I am pleased that 50% of our 
senior Board positions (Chair, Group 
CEO, SID, and CFO) are held by a woman 
and we have met the target to have at 
least one director from an ethnic 
minority background. Whilst the 
percentage of women on the Board began 
the year at 44%, the departure of Fiona 
Clutterbuck after the AGM in May 2023 has 
meant that the Company did not meet the 
40% gender diversity target. As at 31 
December 2023 gender diversity on the 
Board was 37.5% However, the Board 
remains committed to achieving the 
gender targets for the Board contained in 
the Listing Rules as soon as 
reasonably practicable.

AGM
The Board would like to thank our 
shareholders who participated in our 
AGM in 2023. The Board continues to 
view the AGM as a key point in our 
governance calendar. It is an opportunity 
to listen to views from our shareholders 
and for shareholders to meet and ask 
questions of our Board members, 
including Committee Chairs. We look 
forward to welcoming you again in 2024.

Finally, I would like to thank our 
colleagues for all of their hard work 
during 2023 and the commitment 
they have shown to deliver for 
our stakeholders.

Chair

UK Corporate Governance Code 
The Company has complied with the principles of the Code throughout the financial 
year ended 31 December 2023 and to the date of this report, and complied with all 
provisions of the Code. 

The table below sets out examples of how the Board has done this for each principle, 
enabling our shareholders to evaluate our Code compliance. We have also signposted 
to different parts of the Annual Report where you can find more information.

Corporate Governance Report

Board leadership and company purpose

Board responsibilities 

The M&G Board is collectively 
responsible for our long-term, 
sustainable success, the delivery of 
sustainable value to our stakeholders, 
and contributing to wider society. 

The responsibilities of the Board include: 

– providing leadership, setting the 
strategy and maintaining high 
standards of governance

– leading the development of our 
culture, values and behaviours

– providing oversight of the execution of 
our strategy and holding management 
to account for financial and business 
performance

– ensuring the necessary resources are 
in place for the Group to be able to 
meet its objectives and measure 
performance against these

– being responsible for ensuring there is 
a framework of prudent and effective 
controls, which enable risk to be 
assessed and managed

– ensuring that its responsibilities to 
shareholders and stakeholders are 
met, including through effective 
engagement and dialogue with key 
stakeholders, particularly 
shareholders, customers, colleagues 
and the regulators.

Culture, values 
and behaviours 
The Board understands the importance 
of culture and setting the tone of the 
organisation from the top and 
embedding it throughout M&G. During 
the year, the Board approved a new 
purpose statement, together with a set 
of behaviours. Our purpose is aligned 
with our culture and strategy, and 
positions us to achieve our strategic 
priorities: profitable growth, 
simplification, and financial 
strength targets. 

The Board has approved the approach to 
culture measurement, which includes 
consideration of a culture insights report 
at least twice a year, and a culture 
dashboard as a primary method for 
monitoring culture. 

Additionally, the Board assesses culture 
when reviewing and discussing the 
outputs and themes from regular 
colleague surveys. The culture 
dashboard includes colleague and 
culture insights on a range of matters 
including: safe; respectful; inclusive; 
client-centric, accountable; and one 
team. 

In 2023, the Board considered and 
endorsed the actions proposed by 
management to further improve culture, 
which included: 

– additional actions to embed 

constructive challenge and sharing 
a broader range of perspectives 
across M&G 

– a top-down focus on addressing 
complexity and obstacles to drive 
improvements in accountability and 
remove barriers to execution

– events to drive conversations across 
M&G, creating behavioural change 
and driving commitment to our 
new purpose.

Stakeholder engagement
The Board seeks to understand the 
interests, needs and concerns of 
shareholders and other key stakeholders 
(including customers, colleagues, and 
regulators) to enable M&G to pursue 
long-term sustainable success. 

For more information on how we engage 
with our stakeholders as well as how the 
Board has discharged its duties under 
Section 172 of the Companies Act, see 
pages 40-45 of the Strategic Report.

Shareholder engagement

We believe that regular, ongoing 
engagement with key stakeholders and, 
in particular, our shareholders is central 
to good corporate governance. Our 
Investor Relations (IR) team, reporting to 
our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible 
for managing shareholder engagement 
and ensuring it is effective and 
comprehensive. 

Throughout 2023, management 
regularly met and engaged with 
shareholders as part of results 
roadshows, at investor conferences and 
at sell-side analyst events. 

We held a mix of in-person and virtual 
meetings to maximise investor 
engagement, encourage the 
participation of overseas investors and 
manage time efficiently. Across 2023, we 
held over 170 engagements with 
institutional equity and debt investors, 
primarily from the UK. We achieved 
broad coverage of our existing register, 
meeting with over 50.3% of our active 
shareholder base.

The Chair, Senior Independent Director 
and Chairs of each Board Committee are 
always available to engage with major 
investors, typically to discuss corporate 
governance matters. 

In 2023, the Chair engaged with 
shareholders on matters including 
sustainability, remuneration and Board 
composition, as well as performance 
against the Company’s strategy. The 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
consulted with major shareholders and 
proxy voting agencies to understand 
their views on the proposed approach 
for our Remuneration Policy and key 
executive remuneration decisions. 
Further details and the outcome of this 
engagement are included within the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report from 
page 120.

Board leadership and company purpose continued

Engagement during 2023 included 
seven sessions between Non-Executive 
Directors and colleagues, together with 
various sessions with colleagues as part 
of the Board’s site visit to Milan in 
October 2023. The engagement 
sessions in Milan between the Board and 
colleagues included: a corporate 
responsibility roadshow; discussion 
groups between Non-Executive 
Directors and colleagues; a session on 
diversity and inclusion; and a Townhall 
with colleagues hosted by the Chair and 
Group CEO. 

Feedback on themes from direct 
engagement sessions between the 
Board and colleagues are documented 
and shared with the Non-Executive 
Directors and the Chief People Officer, to 
ensure appropriate follow-up and action 
as applicable. Management regularly 
reports to the Board on a range of 
people matters, topics and themes, 
which the Board takes into account 
when making decisions.

Further information on colleague 
engagement is in the stakeholder 
engagement section on page 43. 

The Board receives a report on investor 
relations matters at least quarterly, 
including feedback from investors, 
market expectations of financial 
performance and updates on share 
register composition. Our Corporate 
Brokers also provide the Board with 
advice on market sentiment, input on 
market communications and share 
register analysis.

In addition to information on strategic, 
financial, and operational performance, 
the Group engages with shareholders 
and relevant shareholder advisory 
agencies on sustainability matters. The 
Group produces regular sustainability 
reporting detailing our approach. This 
can be found on our website.

Our AGM provides the opportunity for all 
shareholders to meet and to put 
questions to the Board. We were 
delighted to host a hybrid AGM in 2023. 
We encourage shareholders to use 
virtual meeting technology to ask 
questions ‘live’ and to pre-register 
questions in advance. The virtual 
meeting technology enables 
shareholders to vote on AGM resolutions 
‘live’ in the meeting.

The investors section of the Group’s 
website is our primary source of 
regularly updated information about the 
Group. All financial reports and 
statements, regulatory news service 
announcements and disclosures, 
presentations and other relevant 
documents are available on the website, 
together with a summary of financial 
analysts’ forecasts of performance. 
Recognising that joining our full year and 
half year results conference calls is not 
always possible, we ensure that 
recordings of these presentations are 
accessible to all shareholders via our 
website. We provide additional 
dedicated services to our retail 
shareholders via the Group Secretariat 
team and our registrar, Equiniti.

As part of the Group CEO induction, 
Andrea Rossi met with a number of our 
major shareholders between November 
2022 and January 2023. The 10 investors 
he met with jointly accounted for 34% of 
the register as of December 2022. This 
corresponds to c.42% of the 
‘addressable’ register, ie removing 
passive holdings and shares held by the 
employee trust. 

Investors' areas of focus were capital 
management, strategy, and growth.

Workforce engagement

The Board believes that having a diverse 
team of colleagues makes us more 
dynamic, fosters innovation and boosts 
performance. The Board continues to 
support senior leadership goals for 
ethnic and gender diversity. The Board 
regularly tracks progress against these 
through diversity and inclusion (D&I) 
reporting. Information on D&I can be 
found in Colleagues section on pages 
51-53. 

To comply with the provision of the Code 
relating to workforce engagement, the 
Board has determined it would have 
collective responsibility for employee 
engagement. The Board believes that 
Non-Executive Directors' regular 
meetings with colleagues across 
different geographies and seniority, 
supplemented by colleague surveys and 
culture insight reporting, are effective. 
These methods facilitate meaningful, 
two-way dialogue between the Board 
and colleagues to gain insights into 
culture, and to understand colleague 
views and interests. It also inputs into 
the Board’s decision-making process 
by ensuring meaningful engagement 
on how feedback is considered and 
acted upon.

which is comprised of a majority of 
independent non-executives. 

The legal entity structure of the Wealth 
business and the composition of the 
boards of the subsidiaries in the Wealth 
business is being reviewed in 
conjunction with strategy work.

The Nomination and Governance 
Committee provides oversight of the 
governance arrangements for the 
material subsidiaries.

Executive governance 
There is an executive governance 
framework, which includes details of 
how the members of the Group 
Executive Committee discharge their 
duties and regulatory responsibilities, 
make decisions in adherence with the 
Delegated Authority framework, and 
how the management committees in 
their business or function support 
their decision-making and 
governance processes. 

The members of the Group Executive 
Committee are:

– Group Chief Executive Officer

– Chief Financial Officer 

– M&G Asset Management Chief 

Executive Officer

– M&G Life Chief Executive Officer 

– Director of Corporate Affairs 

– Chief Risk and Compliance Officer 

– Chief Strategy and Transformation 

Officer

The Chief Auditor is an invitee to all 
Executive Committee meetings.

Our governance structure is designed to 
support delivery of our strategy. The 
Board has responsibility for the 
oversight, governance, direction, long-
term sustainability and success of the 
business and affairs of M&G, and is 
responsible to shareholders for creating 
and delivering sustainable shareholder 
value.

Board
The Board is specifically responsible for 
a range of matters, which include: 

– approving M&G's strategic aims 

and objectives

– setting our purpose, standards, 

and culture

– approving the annual Group financial 

budgets

– approval of effective risk management 

and internal control processes

– taking strategic decisions 

– the approval of specific matters. 

The matters that require Board approval 
are contained in a Schedule of Matters 
Reserved for the Board.

Chair, Group CEO and Non-
Executive Directors
In discharging its responsibilities, the 
Board is supported by management and 
ensures a clear division of 
responsibilities between the Chair, the 
Group Chief Executive Officer, the 
Senior Independent Director, and the 
Non-Executive Directors. 

Day-to-day management of M&G is 
delegated to the Group Chief Executive 
Officer. There is a document that sets 
out the division of responsibilities 
between the roles of the Chair and Chief 
Executive Officer in accordance with the 
principles and provisions of the Code, 
and the responsibilities of the Senior 
Independent Director. 

The role of the Non-Executive Directors 
includes providing constructive 
challenge, strategic guidance, offering 
specialist advice, and holding 
management to account.

During the year, the Chair of the Board 
engaged with Directors between Board 
meetings to discuss business and 
strategic issues. The Chair and the Non-
Executive Directors met regularly during 
the year without the Executive Directors 
being present. 

The Board spent significant time getting 
to know the new members of the 
executive management team. 
Comprehensive Board and Committee 
papers, comprising an agenda and 
formal reports and briefing papers are 
sent to Directors in advance of each 
meeting. 

Board Committees
The Board delegates specific 
responsibilities to Board Committees, 
which operate within clearly defined 
terms of reference approved by the 
Board. In compliance with the Code, 
the Board has established an Audit 
Committee, a Nomination and 
Governance Committee and a 
Remuneration Committee. We have also 
established a separate Risk Committee. 

The Terms of Reference for each Board 
Committee are reviewed and approved 
annually by the Board and are available 
to view on our website. 

The Committee Chairs are responsible 
for reporting to the Board on the 
Committees’ activities and do so 
following each Committee meeting.

Chairs’ Forum
The Chairs’ Forum is composed of the 
Chairs of M&G Group Limited (MGG), 
The Prudential Assurance Company 
Limited (PAC) and the Group Chair, with 
the Group CEO being invited to meetings 
as needed. This provides an opportunity 
to engage on common themes, matters 
of escalation, and other topics of 
interest. During the year, this included: 
strategic matters; Board effectiveness 
and succession planning; customer 
outcomes; people and culture; 
regulatory matters; sustainability; and 
financial performance and business plan. 

Subsidiaries
Independent Non-Executive Directors 
are appointed to the Boards of MGG and 
PAC relating to the Asset Management 
and Life businesses respectively. 

MGG and PAC both have a Board of 
Directors led by an independent Chair, 
and Audit and Risk Committees, 
comprised entirely of independent Non-
Executive Directors. During the year, the 
Board of the Company and the Boards of 
the material subsidiaries had a full day 
meeting discussing strategic topics 
and priorities.

Board composition 
and diversity 
The Board has eight Directors: a Non-
Executive Chair, a Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, four Non-
Executive Directors, and two Executive 
Directors (Group Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer). 

The Board considers all its Non-
Executive Directors to be independent 
and that it has complied with the 
requirements of the Code in relation to 
the balance of executive and 
independent Non-Executive Directors on 
the Board, and the composition of the 
Company’s Board Committees. 

Three of the Directors are women, one of 
the Directors is from a minority ethnic 
background; and two senior positions 
are held by women (Senior Independent 
Director and Group Chief 
Financial Officer).

The Nomination and Governance 
Committee regularly reviews the Board’s 
composition to ensure there is a diverse 
mix of skills, knowledge, and experience. 
During the year, this Committee also 
reviewed the board composition, tenure, 
mix of skills, and diversity on a number of 
principal subsidiary boards.

You can find further details on diversity 
and inclusion, including statistical data 
on gender and ethnic diversity, in our 
Colleagues section which starts 
on page 50.

Time commitment
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee at least annually considers 
the time commitment required of the 
Non-Executive Directors to ensure that 
they have sufficient time to meet their 
board responsibilities, together with 
reviewing their external appointments, 
potential or actual conflicts of interest, 
and assessing their independence.

Board independence
The Board has evaluated the 
independence of all the Non-Executive 
Directors.

In assessing each Director, the Board 
considers whether there are 
relationships or circumstances which are 
likely to affect or could appear to affect a 
Director’s judgement. 

At each Board meeting, we give regular 
updates on market and industry 
activities, and legal and regulatory 
changes relevant to M&G. The Board 
holds an annual Strategy Offsite. 

The Board has concluded that each of 
the Non-Executive Directors are 
independent in character and 
judgement. The Chair was independent 
on appointment. In line with the Code, at 
least half the Board, excluding the Chair, 
are independent Non-Executive 
Directors. All Directors are subject to 
annual re-election at the 
Company’s AGM.

Succession planning
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee is responsible for succession 
planning and for making 
recommendations to the Board 
regarding Board composition. During the 
year, this Committee reviewed and 
discussed Board composition and 
succession planning, and executive 
succession planning. You can find 
further details on succession planning in 
the Nomination and Governance 
Committee report which starts 
on page 109.

Directors are appointed by the Board 
and then put forward for election or re-
election by shareholders at the AGM. 

All Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed for initial terms of three years 
and the appointment may be terminated 
by either party upon six months’ written 
notice or by shareholder vote at 
the AGM. 

The Non-Executive Directors do not 
have any entitlement to compensation if 
their office is terminated. Find out more 
about the remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors on page 158.

Directors’ inductions, training, 
and development 
All new Board members have a 
structured induction programme on 
appointment, which includes an overview 
of our business areas and functions. 

During 2023, the Board received training 
and/or undertook deep dives on the 
following areas: Balance Sheet, Capital 
and Liquidity; Cyber Resilience; Bulk 
Purchase Annuities and Capital; and 
Artificial Intelligence. 

The Audit Committee undertook training 
sessions and/or deep dives on IFRS 17, 
Financial Controls Framework, and 
Asset Valuations, and the Risk 
Committee held sessions on: Third-Party 
Supplier and Outsourcing risks; Data 
Privacy risks; Cyber Security risks; and 
Conflicts of Interest. 

All Board members are invited to 
participate in all sessions, regardless of 
Committee membership. Where 
appropriate, we extend invitations to 
relevant training sessions to Non-
Executive Directors on our subsidiary 
boards.

Information to the Board
Board members receive formal papers in 
advance of each Board or Committee 
meeting, which provides them with the 
opportunity to review and challenge, and 
facilitates more informed decisions on 
the issues under consideration. The 
Chair and Company Secretary oversee 
an ongoing programme to ensure Board 
and Committee papers are of high 
quality and meet internal standards and 
requirements. In addition to formal 
Board meetings, the Chair maintains 
regular contact throughout the year with 
the Group Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer, and members of the 
Group Executive Committee to discuss 
specific issues. The Company Secretary 
acts as an adviser to the Board on 
matters concerning governance and 
ensures compliance with Board 
procedures. All Directors had access to 
the Company Secretary’s advice during 
2023. Directors may also take 
independent professional advice at 
M&G’s expense, if required.

2023 Effectiveness Review

Background

In 2023, the Board commissioned an externally facilitated Board effectiveness review in accordance with the Code and best 
practice. The Board’s last externally facilitated review was performed in 2020. The review was conducted between July 2023 and 
October 2023 and was led by the Chair with support from the General Counsel and Company Secretary. 

Appointment

Following a selection process led by the Chair, with support from the General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Board 
appointed Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review, an experienced external board evaluation specialist to facilitate the review. Neither 
Dr Long nor Boardroom Review has any other connection with the M&G plc Group. The engagement with Boardroom Review 
includes a follow-up review to be conducted in 2024.

Process

The methodology for the review included a review of information by Dr Long and built on the insights and findings from the 2022 
Board evaluation and assessed progress against the actions that the Board committed to take as a result. The review involved in-
depth, structured one-to-one interviews by Dr Long with each Board member, ending with a workshop session for the Board in 
October 2023. The interviews anchored around the following key themes:

Themes
Use of time and information

Topics
– Executive / Non-Executive Director preparation and priorities

– Agenda design and schedule use of time (formal & informal)

– Quality of information

Meetings

– Context setting and framing of issues

– Case study on coverage of specific Board topics, with a particular focus on 

the Board’s visit to the Milan office in September

– Balance of executive presentation vs Board debate

– Clarity of conclusions and actions

Culture and dynamics

– Quality of debate and blend of voices

– Contribution of critical executives and attendees

– Contribution to knowledge and understanding – opportunities and challenges

– Board support

Summary of 2023 review findings
The key findings and proposed actions were presented to the Board in December 2023, which prompted an open and constructive 
debate on the insights and findings, and actions were agreed. 

There had been strong progress since the previous evaluation, with an open Board culture that is low ego and respectful, allowing 
a good blend of voices and perspectives to be represented, and with a good level of openness and transparency with the senior 
executive team. The Board welcomed the progress that has been made in strengthening relationships with stakeholders, building 
the Group CEO's relationship with regulators and the positive momentum that has been achieved. Board members have also 
valued the informal discussions outside meetings and the opportunities to spend time with local teams and customers.

Key themes emerging from the Board discussion were used to develop a number of agreed action points which are summarised on 
the next page.

tenure. 

During 2023, the Boards of our principal subsidiaries also took part in an 
assessment to identify their blend of skills, knowledge and experience, to 
recognise potential areas where they might be enhanced and reflect those in 
succession plans, where appropriate. 
During 2023, the Board received monthly reports from the executive team to 
supplement formal Board reporting. In addition, the Executive Directors hold 
an informal monthly call to discuss the report with the Non-Executive 
Directors.

Board members are invited to feedback any comments on papers at the end 
of every meeting.

Progress here was assessed as a key part of the 2023 Board effectiveness 
review. 

Progress has been made by the Group Chief Executive Officer in establishing 
effective relationships with both the FCA and PRA.

maintained and remains effective. 

Our internal control systems ensure the 
quality and integrity of our internal and 
external financial and sustainability  
reporting, as well as operational, legal

Group and its businesses within the 
Board’s risk appetite, rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve our 
objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatements. 

M&G currently operates the ’three lines 
of defence’ model to govern its approach 
to risk management. In the three lines of 
defence model, the first line is 
responsible for the ownership and day-
to-day management of risks and is 
overseen by the second line Risk and 
Compliance function. The second line is 
structurally independent of the first line, 
and provides oversight, advice and 
challenge. The third line Internal Audit 
function is empowered by the Audit 
Committee to audit the design and 
operating effectiveness of our system of 
internal controls, including governance, 
risk management and control processes.

The Board remains committed to 
instilling an appropriate risk culture and 
operating within a strong internal control 
system, with a view to continuously 
maturing, embedding, and enhancing 
risk management throughout the Group. 
The Board delegates some of its 
responsibilities to the Audit Committee 
and Risk Committee. 

The Board is responsible for setting the 
Group’s risk appetite and tolerance, 
following recommendation from the Risk 
Committee. Detail on our Risk 
Management Framework, risk appetite 
and limits, principal risks and 
uncertainties, and emerging risks are 
in the Risk Management section on 
pages 58-68.

The Audit Committee regularly works 
alongside the Risk Committee to monitor 
the adequacy and effectiveness of our 
internal control systems and risk 
management systems. The Audit 
Committee reports regularly to the 
Board on its activities. Details on the 
Audit Committee's activities in 2023 are 
on pages 111-117.

The Risk Committee assists the Board in 
fulfilling its responsibilities by advising 
on risk strategy and overseeing the 
development, implementation, and 
maintenance of the Group’s Risk 
Management Framework (RMF) and the 
Group Risk Appetite statements. The 
Risk Committee reports regularly to the 
Board on its activities. Further details on 
the activities of the Risk Committee can 
be found on pages 118-119. 

The Remuneration Committee ensures 
that our compensation structures place 
appropriate weighting on colleagues 
adopting our behaviours and risk culture 
to deliver the Group’s strategy and 
achieve the objectives to deliver long-
term, sustainable success for the Group. 
Further details on the activities of the 
Remuneration Committee can be found 
on pages 120-124.

Remuneration
The Board has established a 
Remuneration Committee comprised of 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Details of its responsibilities, activities, 
and areas of focus are set out in the 
Committee report on pages 120-124. 
The Remuneration Committee has 
determined that our Remuneration 
Policies and practices are designed to 
support M&G's strategy and promote the 
Group's long-term sustainable success. 

Remuneration for executives is aligned 
to M&G's purpose and values, and is 
clearly linked to the successful delivery 
of M&G's strategy. 

Details regarding remuneration policies 
and practices, together with the 
procedure for developing policy on 
executive, senior management, and 
workforce remuneration is in the 
Directors' Remuneration Report, 
which starts on page 120.

Priorities for 2024
– Continue to keep Executive Committee succession planning under review 

– Ensure that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board is 

appropriate to lead the Group

– Provide oversight of work to meet our diversity and inclusion goals and the 

targets that we have set to measure progress

Dear Shareholder
Key matters the Committee discussed 
during the year included Board and 
Committee composition, Executive 
Committee succession planning, diversity 
and inclusion goals, and oversight of the 
governance and Board composition of 
material subsidiaries. 

Committee purpose 
and responsibilities
In December 2023 the Board extended 
our delegated responsibilities to include 
overseeing the Group Governance 
Framework and oversight of subsidiaries 
governance policies, as well as 
developing, evaluating, and monitoring 
the Group’s Diversity and Inclusion 
strategy and initiatives across the Group.

The newly named Nomination and 
Governance Committee is responsible for 
monitoring the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience, as well as the 
diversity, of the Board. It is also 
responsible for making recommendations 
of new appointments to the Board and 
overseeing Board and senior 
management succession planning. 

Further details can be found in the 
Committee’s terms of reference, which 
are reviewed annually and available on 
our website.

Board composition, succession 
planning and performance
The Committee’s primary responsibilities 
are to ensure that Board composition is 
appropriate and to keep succession 
planning of both Executive and Non-
Executive roles under ongoing review. 

We refreshed our Skills Map for the Board 
during 2023, which enables us to 
objectively identify and track skills 
required and to plan for emergency and 
longer-term succession. Board members 
undertook a self-assessment exercise in 
November 2023 against the refreshed 
skills matrix, which included sector 
experience, strategy, customer, 
technology, data, and sustainability. 

The outputs from the self-assessment, 
which included that the current blend of 
skills, knowledge, and experience on the 
Board as a whole is appropriate in relation to 
current business priorities and prospective 
strategic initiatives, were discussed by the 
Committee in December 2023. 

Succession plans for the Non-Executive 
Directors, Executive Directors, and Group 
Executive Committee members were 
reviewed and discussed by the 
Committee in December 2023.

Executive Directors – skills 
mapping and succession
We review the skills of the Executive 
Directors and succession plans for these 
positions on an ongoing basis. This 
process helps to ensure that there are 
potential internal candidates for 
succession who are suitably qualified and 
experienced, and that we have a diverse 
talent pipeline.

109

Areas of focus in 2023
– Board skills mapping and 

succession planning.

– Executive committee succession 

planning.

– Governance, board composition 
and gender diversity of material 
subsidiaries.

Executive succession planning was a key 
focus for us during the year. The change 
in Group CEO during October 2022 and 
subsequent senior management changes 
during 2023 emphasised the importance 
of ensuring that M&G has the appropriate 
people in senior roles to build a strong 
and diverse senior management pipeline 
for the longer term. 

We received updates on the succession 
planning for the wider senior executive 
group twice during the year, with a talent 
and succession deep dive of the Asset 
Management business during 
December 2023, and deep dives of the 
Life and Wealth businesses and the 
Finance function in February 2024. 

During 2024, there will be a continued 
focus on the internal succession pipeline 
by enhancing the current talent 
programme to develop future leaders 
ready for advancement.

Appointment process
We have a duty to consider and 
recommend to the Board the 
appointment of any new M&G plc 
Board member. 

The appointment of a new Director begins 
with the identification of a vacancy or skills 
gap, together with consideration of the 
gender and ethnic diversity on the Board. 
We assess any skills required, including the 
evolving needs of the Board and then work 
with HR and the Company Secretary to 
produce a clear role specification to focus 
recruitment activities.

Using the role specification, an external 
search firm is selected on the basis of 
relevant experience for Non-Executive 
Director roles and internal and external 
searches are conducted for Executive roles. 
Long and short lists of candidates are 
considered, following which interviews are 
undertaken, at which Committee members 
(among others) test the candidates’ skills 
and fit with M&G's culture. 

These are essential criteria for the 
selection of Board members, since the 
Board aims to set the right tone from the 
top in how we go about our work and how 
our Directors represent and support 
M&G’s culture. 

Induction process
Structured and tailored induction 
programmes are prepared and, among 
other matters, cover meeting key 
members of the executive management 
team and the external and internal 
auditors; an overview of the financial and 
business plan; stakeholder engagement; 
organisation structure and all relevant 
policies, procedures and other 
governance material. 

Board independence 
and conflicts
We take into account the independence 
criteria set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as part of the selection 
process for our Non-Executive Directors. 
We assess the independence of each 
Non-Executive Director at least annually, 
to ensure that they can continue to 
properly fulfil their roles on the Board and 
provide independent challenge to the 
Executive Directors. 

In February 2024, we reviewed each Non-
Executive Director, taking into account 
their tenure, external roles and potential 
conflicts of interest. We determined that 
all Non-Executive Directors are free from 

any relationship or circumstances that 
could affect, or appear to affect, their 
independent judgement, and therefore all 
Non-Executives can be recommended for 
re-election at our 2024 AGM as 
independent Board members. 

In line with the Code, over half of our 
Board members, excluding the Chair, are 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 

We review potential conflicts for Non-
Executive Directors on their appointment, 
at least annually, and in advance of taking 
on any additional external appointment, 
supported by the Risk and 
Compliance team.

Time commitment
We oversee our Non-Executive Directors’ 
time commitments to ensure that each 
has sufficient time to dedicate to their role 
to be able to discharge effectively their 
responsibilities. At least once a year, we 
consider the number and nature of the 
Non-Executive Directors’ external 
commitments, and how this impacts the 
time required for their Board and 
Committee responsibilities.

We are satisfied that each Non-Executive 
Director has sufficient time to undertake 
their role at M&G. 

Board and Committee 
effectiveness
The process and results of the 2023 
Board and Committee effectiveness 
review are described on page 106. This 
year’s results and agreed areas of focus 
are described on page 107. 

Diversity and inclusion 
and gender balance
When considering Board composition and 
succession, we specifically review the 
Board's gender and ethnic diversity, and the 
gender and ethnic diversity targets 
contained in Listing Rule 9.8.6(9). The Board 
also considers gender diversity on the 
Boards of its material subsidiaries as well as 
progress against the Group's diversity 
commitments at half year and full year. 

The Board continues to meet the Listing 
Rule 9.8.6(9)(a)(iii) requirement for at least 
one of its members to be from an ethnic 
minority. Currently 50% of the senior Board 
positions (Chair, Group CEO, SID and Group 
CFO) are held by a woman and gender 
diversity on the Board is 37.5%. Whilst the 
percentage of women on the Board began 
the year at 44%, the departure of Fiona 
Clutterbuck after the AGM in May 2023

110

has meant that the Company did not meet 
the 40% target in Listing Rule 9.8.6(9)(a)(i) at 
31 December 2023. The size of our current 
Board means that individual membership 
changes can have a material impact on the 
gender ratio. However, the Board remains 
committed to achieving the gender targets 
for the Board contained in the Listing Rules 
as soon as reasonably practicable.

Governance of material 
subsidiaries 
We are responsible for overseeing the 
governance arrangements of our material 
subsidiaries MGG and PAC which sit in 
our Asset Management and Life 
businesses respectively. During 2023, we 
reviewed the composition of their Boards 
and changes to them, ensuring that they 
continue to comply with regulatory 
requirements and that succession plans 
are in place. 

The legal entity structure of the Wealth 
business is being reviewed in conjunction 
with strategy work and we will provide 
oversight of the board composition of the 
Wealth subsidiaries as part of this review.

During 2023, the Boards of our principal 
subsidiaries took part in a skills 
assessment to identify the blend of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Boards 
and to recognise potential areas where 
they might be enhanced. 

The analysis concluded that the current 
blend of skills, knowledge and experience 
on those Boards is appropriate in relation 
to our business priorities and prospective 
strategic initiatives.

Priorities for 2024
– Continued focus on the internal control environment and embedding 

the Group-wide integrated Control Framework

– Consideration and awareness of the impact of the changes to the UK 

Corporate Governance Code

– Oversight of sustainability reporting and assurance requirements 

in a continually evolving regulatory environment

On 3 April 2023, we welcomed Rob 
Lewis as our new Chief Auditor. Rob’s 
contribution has already been notable, 
particularly in relation to remodelling the 
internal audit strategy and setting out his 
vision for the audit team. 

We continued to spend time with PwC 
during its second year of audit, and with 
whom we worked closely on the 
adoption of IFRS 17. 

The Audit and Risk Committees continue 
to work closely together, and the cross-
membership principles that we follow 
ensure that members of both 
committees receive information in the 
most efficient way.

Finally, I would like to thank Fiona 
Clutterbuck, who stepped down from 
the Committee on 24 May 2023, and 
extend my thanks to the Committee 
members for their support and 
dedication over the year.

Clare Thompson
Committee Chair

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Audit 
Committee Report, which outlines the 
key themes we focused on during 
the year. 

Our 2023 agenda was dominated by 
financial reporting due to the adoption of 
the new insurance accounting standard, 
IFRS 17, and our finance transformation 
plan, which we continue to monitor 
alongside our business as usual 
activities. 

In September, we published our half-
year 2023 results for the first time on the 
basis of IFRS 17. 

We continue to oversee sustainability 
reporting and, in light of the changing 
regulation, revised our approach for 2023 
to include a number of enhancements.

We held a number of 'deep-dive' 
sessions during the year, including the 
financial close and reporting process 
changes due to the adoption of IFRS 17, 
and financial asset fair valuation 
methodologies and 
governance processes. 

The Committee has continued to focus 
on the overall control environment and 
this also encompassed the oversight 
controls over financial reporting 
processes performed by the 
third parties. 

Areas of focus in 2023
– Monitoring the Finance Change 

agenda, including oversight of the 
implementation of IFRS 17. 

– Reviewing and recommending to 
the Board the full-year and half-
year 2023 results, and approving 
the associated key accounting 
and actuarial assumptions and 
methodology.

– Reviewing and recommending to 
the Board the Solvency II Pillar III 
reporting, and approving the 
associated balance sheet 
valuation methods and 
assumptions.

– Reviewing and approving our 

Annual Report and Accounts, our 
2022/23 Sustainability Report and 
other sustainability reporting.

– Considering findings reported by 

the external auditor, reviewing the 
external audit strategy and plan.

– Considering and challenging the 
impact of economic uncertainty 
on key economic assumptions and 
valuations.

– Oversight of non-financial 

assurance, including 
sustainability.

– Monitoring the effectiveness of 

the Internal Audit function.

– Processes used to value complex 

and illiquid financial assets.

Financial Reporting 2023
The Audit Committee reviewed the full-
year 2023 consolidated and Company 
financial statements.

The review included:

Fair, balanced and understandable

In assessing whether the 2023 Annual 
Report and Accounts are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess M&G’s position, we gave 
regard to whether:

– Information in the Strategic Report, in 
particular the Business and Financial 
Review, represents a fair reflection of 
M&G's performance during the year.

– Significant issues identified in this 

report, including key areas of 
judgement and estimation, as well as 
any other significant issues disclosed 
within narrative reporting, are 
consistent with the financial 
statements.

– Alternative performance measures 

(APMs) have been given equal 
prominence to the statutory 
measures, there is a clear description 
of their calculation and an explanation 
of their use and relevance.

– Clarification and treatment of certain 

items within the APMs, particularly the 
allocation of items to adjusted 
operating profit before tax and 
operating capital generation, is in line 
with the defined methodology, and is 
appropriately disclosed.

– The identified key performance 
measures reflect those used by 
management to manage, monitor and 
assess the results of the business, 
linking to the strategy.

– Key messages are clear, consistent, 

and easily understood, without the use 
of excessive jargon.

Composition
The Board considers all Committee 
members are independent and that 
Clare Thompson has recent and relevant 
experience of working with financial 
reporting and accounting matters. 

Find out more about details of 
Committee members’ relevant skills and 
experience on pages 96 to 98.

2023 Meeting Schedule
In 2023, there were seven regular 
scheduled Audit Committee meetings 
and five short ad hoc meetings. In 
addition, we held one joint meeting with 
the Risk Committee, and two joint 
meetings with the Board to consider our 
full-year and half-year results. 

We incorporated training sessions on 
IFRS 17 within the regular meeting 
schedule.

In addition, we met individually with the 
Chief Auditor and the lead audit partners 
from our external auditors, PwC, without 
the presence of management. These 
private sessions are on a rolling 
programme, with internal and external 
auditors each holding at least two 
private sessions a year.

Annual evaluation of Audit 
Committee performance
The process and results of the 2023 
Board and Committee effectiveness 
review are described on page 106. This 
year’s results and agreed areas of focus 
are described on page 107. 

The Committee also 
receives: 
– Regular reports from The 

Prudential Assurance Company 
Limited (PAC) and M&G Group 
Limited (MGG) Audit Committees

– Updates on regulatory 

developments in financial and 
sustainability reporting

– Updates on approval of audit and 

non-audit work

Going concern and viability statements

In early 2024, we reviewed the going 
concern assessment undertaken by 
management for the purposes of the 
2023 consolidated financial statements. 

This included assessing M&G plc’s 
solvency, including its sensitivity to 
various economic stresses and its 
projections in a reasonable worst case 
scenario, being the pessimistic scenario 
(which reflects reduced demand from 
higher spreads and worsening economic 
conditions), liquidity projections, 
including the impact of applying specific 
liquidity stresses and the ability to 
access funding sources.

Based on the review, we concluded that 
the going concern assumption remains 
appropriate. 

In addition, we considered the 
associated assessment of longer-term 
viability to support the Viability 
Statement. This involved consideration 
of the strategic and financial planning 
process alongside an assessment of 
M&G plc’s key strategic priorities, 
business model and forecasting 
undertaken as part of the business 
planning process.

The Board challenged the assumptions 
underpinning the assessments, including 
the impact of various severe, but 
plausible stresses and scenarios on the 
ability to deliver the business plan, and 
concluded that the positions were both 
reasonable and supportable. Based on 
this determination, the Committee 
concluded that three years was the most 
appropriate period for longer-term 
viability in line with the business plan. 

IFRS 17
IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts is a new 
accounting standard, effective from 
1 January 2023, which has a significant 
impact on the financial reporting of our 
insurance contracts.

M&G plc has had an ongoing project to 
implement IFRS 17. The Committee have 
received regular updates on the project's 
progress, including achievements to 
date, key milestones during 2023 and 
upcoming priorities.

Critical estimates and areas of judgement and how they were addressed
We have assessed whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements. We have also considered all critical estimates and key judgements that are material to the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements. In this regard, we receive regular updates from management and review and challenge 
estimates and judgements accordingly. Special consideration was given to critical estimates and judgements arising on the 
adoption of IFRS 17: Insurance contracts, which were discussed at various meetings over the course of the year as part of the 
review of IFRS 17 methodology and implementation.

This section outlines the critical estimates and key judgements that have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements and how each of them have been considered and addressed by the Committee.

Critical estimate/
Key judgement

Valuation of 
insurance 
contracts and 
defined benefit 
pension liabilities

Valuation of 
complex and 
illiquid financial 
assets

How the Committee addressed the issue

We reviewed the key assumptions and judgements presented by management in the estimation and 
valuation of the Group’s insurance contracts and defined benefit pension liabilities. The key assumptions 
reviewed were:
– Policyholder mortality, maintenance expenses and valuation rate of interest (including selection of 

reference portfolio and allowance for credit risk) used in the estimation of insurance contract 
liabilities for annuities.

– Allowance for maintenance expenses, persistency, assumed future investment returns on the 

backing assets, policyholders' share of historic and future surpluses, and the illiquidity premium in 
setting the discount rate used in the estimation of insurance contract liabilities for with-profits 
policies.

– Mortality, inflation rates and discount rates used in the estimation of the Group's defined benefit 

pension liabilities.

In addition, we reviewed the following assumptions presented by management for determining the fair value 
of contracts for which the fair value approach was used on transition to IFRS 17:
– the target capital and cost of capital rate;
– for with-profits contracts, the assumed future investment returns on the backing assets, the 

assumptions used in determining the allowance for persistency and maintenance expenses, the level 
of compensation required to reflect the risk in relation to future shareholder transfers, and the 
discount rates used; and

– for annuity contracts, the assumed rates of policyholder mortality, maintenance expenses, and the 

discount rates used.

We considered the rationale provided by management for the assumptions used and reviewed any 
benchmarking provided.
The Committee also challenged the appropriateness of management’s credit assumptions given current 
market conditions.
We were satisfied that the assumptions adopted by management were appropriate. Further information on 
key assumptions can be found in Notes 24 and 32 of the consolidated financial statements in respect of the 
insurance contract liabilities and in Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements in respect of the defined 
benefit pension liabilities.

We received information on the carrying value of investments held on the consolidated statement of financial 
position, and particularly focused on those investments where the determination of their fair value required 
more subjective estimation (classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy). These assets include 
investment properties, lifetime mortgages, private credit (which includes securitised notes backed by 
residential ground rents) and investments in private equity vehicles. Specifically, in relation to the notes 
backed by residential ground rents, we considered the impact on assumptions of the UK Government 
consultation which may potentially restrict future income.
In addition, we considered the governance arrangements put in place by management to review the 
valuation of these assets (including those held by the defined benefit pension schemes) to ensure that it 
remains appropriate. While reviewing the valuation, we also considered the potential impact of the current 
macroeconomic environment and climate-related risk on relevant asset classes.

Given the market uncertainty during the year, we requested a deep dive of the valuation process. Following 
the deep dive, as well as the wider assessment of the remainder of the Group’s assets, we are satisfied that 
the basis of valuation for these assets was appropriate. Further information on key assumptions can be 
found in Note 31 of the consolidated financial statements.

Critical estimate/
Key judgement

Recoverable 
amount of 
goodwill

Specific 
accounting 
judgments applied 
as part of adoption 
of IFRS 17

How the Committee addressed the issue

We reviewed the results of annual impairment testing carried out in respect of goodwill associated with the 
Group’s cash-generating units. This involved reviewing the key inputs used in the assessment, including the 
discount rate and future cash flow projections used to determine value in use. Appropriate challenge was 
provided to management, particularly around growth rates, discount rates and terminal profit margins.
We considered the results of the work performed and agreed with management’s assessment that the 
responsAbility Investments AG cash-generating unit was impaired by £25m.
Further information on key assumptions can be found in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements.

Adoption of IFRS 17 required the application of judgement in respect of the following areas:
– The judgement with respect to whether contracts issued by M&G plc contain significant insurance 

risk, unless a specific exemption applies (eg equity release mortgages).

– Judgement in respect of certain investment contracts which provide an additional benefit in addition 
to guaranteed benefits to determine whether they meet the criteria to be considered as discretionary 
participation features.

– Judgement required at a contract level as to whether they meet the conditions for having direct 

participation features and consequently require the use of the Variable Fee Approach to measure the 
CSM.

– Judgement required to define underlying items for with-profits contracts that reflect the 

mutualisation between contracts and how to split underlying items between current and future 
policyholders.

– Judgement required to determine which surplus should be divided between current and future with-
profits policyholders as well as with the Group and which surplus is attributable solely to the Group. 

– Judgement required to assess whether the current amount of surplus attributed to with-profits 

policyholders should be determined retrospectively or prospectively.

– Judgement required in determining the relative weighting for the purposes of deriving coverage 

units where a contract provides both insurance and investment services.

– On transition, judgement was required to assess for which contracts it would be impracticable to apply 

the Fully Retrospective Approach (FRA).

As part of the review of IFRS 17 methodology, we reviewed and challenged the judgements applied by 
management as part of the adoption of IFRS 17. As part of the review, we considered alternative accounting 
treatments in light of the guidance provided in the standard. Following our review, we were satisfied that the 
judgements applied were appropriate. Further information on the accounting treatment can be found in 
Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements.

Other significant 
judgements

We reviewed and considered the other significant judgements as disclosed within Note 1.3 of the 
consolidated financial statements:
– Consideration over M&G plc’s interest in structured entities and whether control exists which would 

require their consolidation.

– The judgement exercised to determine the extent to which future taxable profits are expected to 

emerge and the corresponding period over which unused tax credits and unused tax losses will be 
utilised for recognition of deferred tax asset.

Following review of the basis of the above judgements we were satisfied that these were appropriate.

We also considered the following critical estimates and key judgements in respect of the Company financial statements. 

Critical estimate/
Key judgement

Recoverable 
amount of M&G 
Group Regulated 
Entity Holding 
Company Limited 
(M&G REH) in the 
financial 
statements

How the Committee addressed the issue

Management performed an impairment assessment at the year end in relation to the Company’s investment 
in M&G REH, which in turn is the holding company for M&G plc’s main regulated entities, including MGG and 
PAC. As a result, the recoverable amount of M&G REH has been determined by reference to the recoverable 
amount of these main operating subsidiaries. We considered management’s assessment of the recoverable 
amounts based on a discounted cash flow assessment, which was derived from management’s expectations 
of profits in respect of MGG and application of a discounted dividend model in respect of PAC. Where 
possible, management also considered alternative valuation techniques consistent with established 
valuation principles to determine the recoverable amount. Based on the review, we concluded that 
impairment of £933 million should be recognised. Further information is disclosed at Note A to the M&G plc

Audit Committee Report continued

Sustainability reporting
We have a responsibility to review, and 
challenge as appropriate, any 
sustainability or climate-related 
reporting in any material public 
documents, including but not limited to, 
climate-related financial disclosures 
required by the UK Listing Rules.

We received regular updates during 
2023 on our planned sustainability 
reporting, and have challenged, 
reviewed and approved 
these accordingly. 

In particular, the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); 
within the Annual Report and Accounts, 
the Sustainability Report, published in 
July 2023; and the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
reporting document for publication on 
our website.

We apply the same level of rigour to the 
review and challenge of these 
disclosures as we do to the review of 
external financial reporting. In relation to 
the mandatory TCFD reporting included 
in this Annual Report and Accounts, we 
have reviewed and approved the 
Environmental Metrics Basis of 
Reporting (Basis of Reporting) published 
on our website which sets out key 
considerations in respect of materiality, 
reporting boundary, restatement policy 
and the methodologies applied in 
determining carbon emissions metrics. 
In setting out the published Basis of 
Reporting, consistency with the 
requirements of the International 
Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) 
IFRS S1, as far as practicable, has been a 
key consideration discussed with 
the Committee. 

In relation to TCFD reporting, the 
Committee also considered the 
following key judgements in relation 
to climate metrics:

– Use of 2019 emissions data for 

sovereign bonds reporting in lieu of 
2020 (where this is the most recent 
data available) given the impact of 
lockdowns at the peak of the COVID 
pandemic on global GDP and 
sovereign activity for that year, 
therefore deemed not representative 
of usual activities.

– Scenarios used in climate modelling – 
our scenario analysis for public assets 
is based on Network for Greening the 
Financial Systems scenarios, and for 

real estate and infrastructure assets 
based on pathways produced by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC). We recognise the 
limitations with using these scenarios 
but judge them appropriate for 
consistent disclosure while thinking in 
this area develops.

– The data hierarchy for third-party 

emissions data, including a change in 
2023 to include Bloomberg as a data 
source for public equities and 
corporate debt emissions data, which 
has allowed for improvement in 
coverage for this asset class. Further 
details on data hierarchies used is 
available in the Basis of Reporting 
document on our website. 

– Application of the restatement policy 

and other re-presentations of prior year 
data where it was judged to be useful 
to investors. 

We recognise that there remains work to 
do on sustainability reporting as data 
improves and requirements change, and 
will continue to work with management 
as our reporting develops in this area, 
including increasing coverage across 
asset classes and ensuring that 
processes and controls around the 
reporting are robust and fit for purpose. 
During the year, the Committee 
approved the widening of the scope of 
limited assurance by PwC over non-
financial metrics to include selected 
financed emissions climate metrics. We 
will continue to review the scope of this 
work annually as reporting expectations 
and requirements develop, and the 
capabilities of assurance providers in 
this area mature.

The Committee has also reviewed 
responses to consultations during 2023 
in relation to the development of 
sustainability reporting as it pertains to 
our business including engagement with 
the ISSB and the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC). 

During 2023, the FRC carried out a 
thematic review of climate-related 
metrics and targets based on 2022 
reporting. The M&G plc 2022 Annual 
Report and Accounts was included in the 
sample and highlighted as an example of 
better practice in a number of areas. On 
the back of this review, in October 2023, 
M&G plc received a letter from the FRC 
setting out some opportunities for 
improvement in preparation of the 2023 
Annual Report and Accounts. 

115

The FRC confirmed it did not expect a 
response to the letter. The Committee 
have been advised how these areas have 
been considered within the preparation 
of the 2023 report.

Audit and Corporate 
Governance Reform
We have received regular updates 
during 2023 regarding the audit and 
corporate governance reforms initially 
proposed in a government consultation - 
Restoring Trust in Audit and Corporate 
Governance - in 2021. 

In May, the FRC launched a consultation 
seeking views on proposed changes to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
arising from the initial government 
consultation. Management prepared a 
response to the consultation with input 
from the impacted business areas. This 
was presented to us for review ahead of 
submission in early September 2023. 

An updated version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code was published in 
January 2024, with the main changes 
relating to internal controls. 

The Committee will continue to engage 
with management on any changes 
required to our processes and 
procedures in light of the updates to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and any 
further reforms.

Internal controls
The Committee has a responsibility, in 
conjunction with the Risk Committee, to 
review the adequacy and effectiveness 
of our Risk Management Framework and 
internal control systems prior to review 
by the Board.

This approach to risk culture is 
supported by the Operational Risk 
Policy, Framework, Standards and 
associated training, which articulate how 
the business expects colleagues to 
positively manage risk. All colleagues 
have risk management accountabilities 
as part of their core objectives.

We receive regular reports regarding the 
status of the control environment, 
including reviews of the effectiveness of 
the Risk Management Framework, the 
status and assessment of any 
outstanding control deficiencies and 
results of Key Control Assessments 
performed by the first Line of Defence 
and independent second Line of 
Defence testing of controls over 
Financial Close and Reporting

complies with the FRC’s guidance on risk 
management, internal controls and 
related financial and business reporting. 
Find out more about the annual 
assessment of risk management and 
internal controls on page 59.

Whistleblowing policy 
and framework
We are committed to a safe and inclusive 
workplace where all colleagues can 
speak out and report inappropriate 
behaviour in complete confidence, 
without fear of retaliation. 

The Whistleblowers’ Champion, who is 
also Chair of the Committee, provides 
governance and oversight of our Speak 
Out programme, which supports our 
Whistleblowing policy.

Reporting to the Committee on the 
effectiveness of the Whistleblowing 
policy occurs twice a year. Individual 
cases are not discussed with the 
Committee. Regular meetings are also 
held between management and the 
Whistleblowers’ Champion. 

We are satisfied that our whistleblowing 
policies and procedures remain robust 
and adequate.

Internal Audit
We are responsible for overseeing the 
work, effectiveness and independence 
of the internal audit function. The 
purpose of Internal Audit is to provide 
independent assurance to the Board and 
Executive Management on the adequacy 
of the design and effectiveness of M&G's 
systems of internal control, helping them 
to protect the Group's assets, reputation 
and sustainability. 

During 2023, we welcomed a new Chief 
Auditor, Rob Lewis, with the Committee 
overseeing the recruitment process and 
transitional arrangements. The Chair 
sets the objectives and reviews the 
performance of the Chief Auditor, who is 
directly accountable to the Committee, 
with unrestricted access to both the 
Chairs of the Committee and the Board, 
as well as Executive Management. 

We approved the Internal Audit Charter 
following its annual review, to assess its 
continued validity in light of internal audit 
professional standards and regulatory 
expectations. We also approved the 
2024 Internal Audit plan. 

This is a risk-based plan of coverage - 
developed in the context of M&G plc 
strategy and the Group-wide 
coordinated assurance plan - based on 
an assessment of inherent risk, control 
environment and consideration of 
external factors such as regulatory 
requirements, industry themes and 
emerging risks. The plan will be updated 
to reflect evolving assurance 
requirements and priorities as required.

We measured the effectiveness of 
Internal Audit using several key 
performance metrics, including appraisal 
of the ongoing Quality Assurance 
Improvement Programme. An 
independent assessment of the function 
is carried out every five years (2022 – 
rated Generally Conforms). We receive 
regular briefings from Internal Audit 
throughout the year and ask business 
owners to attend the Committee to 
explain actions being taken.

External Audit
Oversight and engagement 
of external auditor

PwC has been M&G's external auditor 
since 1 January 2022, following a 
competitive tender process in 2020. The 
audit is being led for the second year by 
audit partner Mark Pugh. We provide 
clear guidance to PwC on our 
expectations and hold meetings with 
PwC, without the presence of 
management, to allow the audit team to 
raise any concerns and remain 
independent and objective. We reviewed 
and approved the external audit plan 
before the start of the 2023 year-end 
process. 

M&G has complied with the Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 
for the year ended 31 December 2023.

The Committee have considered the 
Audit Committees and the External 
Audit: Minimum Standard published by 
the FRC in May 2023, and confirm 
compliance with this Standard. 

External auditor effectiveness

Each year, together with senior 
management, we assess the external 
auditor's performance, monitor their 
independence, objectivity, and the 
effectiveness of the audit process. 

116

We carried out our assessment in April 
2023 and considered feedback from key 
internal and external stakeholders on: 
quality of resource; overall plan and 
approach; execution of the audit; quality 
of communications received; and 
whether the external auditor had 
appropriately challenged management’s 
methodology and assumptions, key 
accounting policy judgements and 
exercised professional scepticism. 

Following the review of external audit 
performance and effectiveness, a 
shareholder resolution was 
recommended to reappoint PwC as 
external auditors at the Annual General 
Meeting in May 2023. A further review of 
effectiveness will be carried out in April 
2024, and on an annual basis thereafter.

We welcomed PwC's use of Audit 
Quality Indicators, which were 
monitored and reported on during the 
2023 year end reporting cycle.

Regulatory inspection of the audit

The FRC’s Quality Review team routinely 
monitors the quality of the audit work of 
certain UK audit firms through 
inspections of sample audits and related 
quality processes. PwC was reviewed on 
the audit of our financial reporting for the 
2022 financial year. The Chair of the 
Committee had discussions with the 
FRC as part of the process, and also 
discussed the outcome of the inspection 
with the Lead Audit Partner and the 
members of the Committee. 

The Committee was pleased with the 
outcome of the FRC's inspection which 
reported no areas for improvement of 
sufficient significance to include in their 
report, as well as four specific examples 
of good audit practice.

Auditor independence policy

Our Auditor Independence Policy was 
reviewed in December 2023 and will 
continue to be reviewed at least 
annually. The main purpose of this policy 
is to ensure that the external auditor is 
not engaged in any non-audit services 
that are not permitted, that we comply 
with all other relevant regulation and 
ethical guidance relating to relationships 
with the external auditor, and that we 
maintain a sufficient choice of 
appropriately qualified audit firms. 
Certain services need to be approved by 
the Committee before any engagement.

Fees paid to the auditor

Total fees paid to PwC during the year 
ended 31 December 2023 amounted to 
£22.3 million, of which £3.0 million 
related to non-audit services and 
£1.7 million related to overruns in 
completion of the 2022 audit. This 
compares to £16.7 million paid in 2022, 
of which £2.5 million related to non-
audit services.

The year-on-year increase in fees 
reflects the additional fees relating to 
IFRS 17 and inflation. A breakdown of 
fees paid to PwC is in Note 9 of the 
consolidated financial statements. In 
line with the Auditor Independence 
Policy, all non-audit services were 
approved by the Committee. We were 
satisfied that, considering the fees paid 
and services provided under the policy, 
the objectivity and independence of 
PwC was safeguarded.

Role and responsibilities 
of the Audit Committee
The Committee’s responsibilities 
include, but are not limited to:

– Financial reporting: monitoring 
the integrity of the consolidated 
financial statements, related 
announcements and other 
financial information provided to 
shareholders and other 
stakeholders.

– Framework of internal control and 

risk management systems: 
reviewing and monitoring the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the 
Risk Management Framework and 
internal control systems, in 
conjunction with the Risk 
Committee.

– Internal and external audit 
processes: assessing the 
effectiveness of the internal and 
external audit process.

– Whistleblowing procedures: 

overseeing the effectiveness of 
the whistleblowing programme. 

– Sustainability reporting oversight 

and the development of assurance 
in relation to this reporting.

In Focus

Reporting under IFRS 17 
IFRS 17 is the new accounting 
standard for insurance contracts, 
replacing IFRS 4, with an effective date 
of 1 January 2023. Our 2023 interim 
results were the first time we reported 
on an IFRS 17 basis, and the full year 
results included in this Annual Report 
and Accounts have been produced on 
an IFRS 17 basis.

IFRS 17 is a principles-based 
accounting standard which includes 
features that are not present in our 
financial reporting metrics. This leads 
to significant differences in the 
valuation of the liabilities, and hence 
shareholder equity, compared with 
IFRS 4. 

Monitoring implementation

The Committee received regular 
updates on progress towards the 
implementation of IFRS 17. In 2023, the 
focus was on finalising the 
methodology and judgements and 
ensuring that the business was 
prepared to deliver the requirements 
of the new standard. 

Methodology 

Over the past few years, in preparation 
for the implementation of IFRS 17, the 
Committee have discussed and 
approved a number of key 
methodology decisions. 

Moving into 2023, there were a few 
significant decisions outstanding, 
including fair value methodology, 
treatment of the deferred tax liability 
in the With-Profits Fund, 
policyholder share of the surplus 
assets in the With-Profits Fund and 
treatment of distributions of these 
surplus assets. These areas were 
reviewed and approved by the 
Committee in the first half of 2023. All 
decisions were also reviewed by PwC 
as they were finalised. 

External Disclosures 

In addition to its review of the 2023 
half-year and full-year results on an 
IFRS 17 basis, the Committee also 
reviewed and approved the IFRS 17 
disclosures in the 2022 Annual Report 
and Accounts.

Although IFRS 17 has an effective date 
of 1 January 2023, the requirement to 
restate comparative information 
meant that the date of transition 
to IFRS 17 for the Group was 
1 January 2022. As such, the 2022 
Annual Report included an overview of 
our approach to the implementation of 
IFRS 17 and a preliminary quantitative 
assessment of the impact of IFRS 17 
on the Group results. 

We also reviewed and approved the 
IFRS 17 market update which was 
published in July 2023 to help the 
market understand our latest position 
ahead of our half year results 
announcement in September. The 
update reflected the latest 
expectations and assessment of the 
impact of the IFRS 17 implementation, 
providing a restatement of M&G’s 
financial results for the year ended 
31 December 2022 and the six months 
ended 30 June 2022 on an unaudited 
IFRS 17 basis. 

Assurance 

PwC provided regular updates to the 
Committee on the status of the IFRS 17 
audit, highlighting any areas of 
concern as appropriate. PwC also 
carried out an audit of the transition 
balance sheet (as at 1 January 2022) 
and the restated 2022 financial 
statements. This allowed PwC to 
perform a review of the 2023 half-year 
accounts and the restated 
comparatives. All findings were 
reported to the Committee for 
consideration.

Insight and Analysis

Following the half year reporting 
period, the Committee reviewed a 
presentation summarising the 
approach taken by our peers when 
reporting on an IFRS 17 basis. This 
included analysis from internal and 
external sources, including an extract 
from a PwC cross-industry analysis, 
and helped the Committee to 
understand the impact of IFRS 17 on 
competitor’s results and see how 
other companies had presented their 
results on the new basis.

Find out more about the impact of 
IFRS 17 on our financial statements in 
Note 1.2.1 on pages 191-196.

Priorities for 2024
– Oversight of risks related to the execution of M&G’s business strategy 
including monitoring of the risks of the transformation programme

– Monitoring of M&G's operational resilience, including oversight of the risks 

relating to our third party and outsource providers

– Monitoring Consumer Duty outcomes and evolving risks such as sustainability 
and ESG, and artificial intelligence and how these are embedded in our Risk 
Management framework

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Risk 
Committee Report, which outlines our 
activities and work during the year.

The continued economic and 
geopolitical uncertainty in 2023 required 
our close attention. In particular, we 
reviewed a range of stress and scenario 
testing results through the Group ORSA, 
which provided insight on potential 
adverse impacts to the business and 
management actions available. The 
output of these tests feed into the 
Viability Statement on page 91.

The expansion of Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) introduces significant change to 
both the technology landscape and 
business capabilities. We held a deep- 
dive session to explore its potential risks 
(including evolving cyber security, 
access and privacy risks), as well as 
opportunities it presents.

Managing the risks relating to our use of 
third parties and outsource providers 
remains a priority, given our reliance on 
them to perform core services. 

We receive regular updates on our 
oversight of material third parties and 
have reviewed progress against tactical 
and strategic activities to enhance the 
framework. This will remain an area of 
focus in 2024.

The M&G transformation programme 
was launched at the beginning of 2023 
and we have taken an active role in 
overseeing both the execution and 
operating model impact risks associated 
with this change. 

This has aided our understanding of the 
impact on the overall risk profile, and we 
are now closely monitoring how these 
are managed over the remainder of the 
programme, with regular updates.

Following the identification that the 
framework to manage conflicts of 
interest required further embedding, we 
oversaw the completion of a plan to 
deliver this, including consideration of 
the key conflicts for M&G's three 
operating segments.

The compliance transformation 
programme was a regular item on our 
agenda in 2023 and we will continue to 
support the function as it completes the 
programme next year.

We continue to work closely with the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
Our cross-membership principles ensure 
we manage conflicts and all Non-
Executive Directors have the right 
information provided in the most 
efficient way. My role as Chair of the Risk 
Committee of PAC allows me a wider 
oversight of Group risk issues.

I would like to thank Peter Grewal, who 
served as Group Chief Risk and 
Compliance Officer since January 2021, 
and welcome Louise Gelling, who has 
taken over the role in the interim period 
while we recruit a successor.

Clive Adamson

Risk Management Framework 
and internal controls 
We approved changes to the Risk 
Management Framework and the risk 
policies as part of our annual review. We 
also recommended updates to M&G’s 
risk appetite and individual risk limits to 
the Board for approval.

Risk models and measures
We approved the overall methodology 
and key assumptions for the Solvency II 
valuation in conjunction with the Audit 
Committee, and reviewed the overall 
effectiveness of M&G’s Internal Model by 
reviewing the results of the annual 
programme of Solvency II Internal Model 
validation. We also approved the Internal 
Model validation plan for the 
forthcoming year. In conjunction with the 
Audit Committee, we received an update 
on financial systems resilience and the 
financial model valuations programme. 

Regulatory matters
We reviewed M&G’s ORSA and 
recommended its approval to the Board. 
In conjunction with the Audit Committee, 
we also reviewed regulatory and public 
Solvency II disclosures and 
recommended them to the Board for 
approval. In addition, we received 
updates on emerging regulations, 
regulatory risks and other regulatory 
matters arising during the year. 

Compliance and fraud
We reviewed and approved updates to a 
number of policies including those relating 
to regulatory compliance risk, privacy and 
data protection, conduct risk, market 
abuse and financial crime compliance.

Review of current and 
emerging risks
We are responsible for reviewing the 
Risk Management Framework, detailed 
on page 58, together with a list of M&G’s 
principal risks and how those risks are 
identified, managed and mitigated. 
We’re satisfied that our review, and 
subsequent reporting to the Board, 
enabled the Board to carry out a robust 
assessment of M&G’s emerging and 
principal risks.

Risk appetite, tolerance, 
profile and strategy
We reviewed regular reports from the 
CRCO, including updates on the risk 
profile, key risks and issues facing M&G, 
emerging risks, our capital and liquidity 
position against appetite and our control 
environment. We also received 
regular reports from our subsidiary 
Board Risk Committees.

Geopolitical and market events remained 
a key focus during 2023. Additionally, we 
monitored M&G’s response to the 
developments in artificial intelligence 
and the enhancement of our operational 
resilience capabilities. 

Sustainability and ESG risk was also an 
area of focus. During 2023, we reviewed 
M&G's sustainability and ESG risks. 
We also reviewed the required 
scenarios, including climate change 
scenarios, on a full balance sheet basis 
as part of the Own Risk and Solvency 
Assessment (ORSA), and recommended 
to the Board a range of economic 
scenarios for business planning 
purposes. 

We regularly reviewed and provided 
advice to the Board on how the 
assessment and analysis of the top 
financial and non-financial risks facing 
M&G were being managed. We were 
also provided with ‘deep-dive’ reviews 
and presentations from executives on 
key risks under their management, 
including third-party risk and 
outsourcing, data privacy, risk impact of 
the transformation programme, artificial 
intelligence and cyber security. We also 
received regular updates on business 
change activities and key programmes.

Priorities for 2024
– Reviewing the Executive Directors' packages to ensure structure and 

opportunity are appropriate

– Assessing the effectiveness of incentives in promoting long-term value 
creation through alignment with the refreshed purpose and strategy

– Assessing the effectiveness of client and sustainability metrics in delivering 

strategic objectives and outcomes

– Continuing focus on the fairness of workforce remuneration in a challenging 

economic environment

Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board and its 
Remuneration Committee, I am pleased 
to present the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report (DRR) for the year ended 
31 December 2023, covering our 
decisions in respect of remuneration 
outcomes for the 2023 financial year and 
implementation of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (DRP) in 2024.

I would firstly like to again thank 
shareholders for their engagement and 
support for the review and renewal of 
the DRP in 2023. We engaged with 21 of 
our largest shareholders representing 
c. 60% of share ownership and received 
a 96.46% vote in favour of the DRP, 
along with a 98.6% vote in favour of 
the 2022 DRR. 

We remain mindful of the need to keep 
certain aspects of the DRP and its 
implementation under review to maintain 
strong alignment with our refreshed 
strategy and purpose as they become 
further embedded within M&G. We’ve 
highlighted key updates in this report.

Performance delivered in 2023
In 2023, we have continued to deliver 
progress on our strategy, focused on 
simplification, profitable growth and 
financial strength. We've established a 
corporate infrastructure with three clear 
operating segments, Asset 
Management, Life and Wealth, which 
also work together: simplifying our 
business, improving the way we serve 
our clients, and creating more 
opportunities to grow M&G. Despite a 
backdrop of evolving market dynamics 
and geopolitical uncertainties, we've 
remained resilient and adaptive with 
financial and operating results that 
demonstrate the strength of our 
business model. 

In Asset Management the Wholesale 
business continues to build momentum 
with a second year of positive net inflows 
and fund performance over three and 
five years remaining strong. The 
Institutional business, as expected, 
remained impacted by the 2022 UK mini 
budget crisis resulting in overall net 
client outflows in the year.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued

In comparison to peers over three and 
five years, our performance remains 
strong or has strengthened with 64% of 
our Wholesale funds ranked in the upper 
performance quartiles over three years 
(2022: 67%), and 69% ranked in the 
upper performance quartiles over five 
years (2022: 60%). However, our 
Wholesale funds performance over one 
year has reduced relative to the previous 
year, with 51% of our Wholesale funds 
ranked in the upper performance 
quartiles over one year (2022: 68%).

The Life business has started its growth 
transformation by entering into two 
major bulk purchase annuity 
transactions in the year. The increase in 
yields during 2022 led to increased 
adjusted operating profit before tax and 
operating change in contractual service 
margin (our new additional alternative 
performance measure following the 
adoption of the new insurance 
accounting standard, IFRS 17) in Life.

Our Wealth segment results have 
benefitted from improved net client 
inflows into PruFund following strong 
underlying investment performance, and 
improved adjusted operating profit 
before tax and operating change in CSM 
in relation to the result from PruFund, 
again reflecting the increase in yields 
during 2022. 

Our capital position remains strong with 
our shareholder Solvency II ratio 
increasing to 203%, maintaining strong 
momentum from the previous year to 
outperform our three-year cumulative 
operating capital generation target for 
the 2021-23 LTIP award and remaining 
on track to achieve our £2.5 billion 
target by the end of 2024, linked to the 
2022 LTIP.

With share price growth in excess 
of 18% and the continuation of our 
dividend policy in 2023, shareholders 
realised a total return of 30% for the 
12-month period.

Clients remain at the core of our new 
purpose, which is to give everyone real 
confidence to put their money to work, 
and aligns with our refocused strategy. 
We are committed to serving our clients 
with excellence, prioritising their needs 
and expectations, elevating the quality of 
our service delivery, fostering stronger 
relationships and deeper trust. 

We are continuing to simplify and 
automate processes and enable our 
colleagues and business partners to 
work together more effectively so we 
can respond to clients’ needs and find 
the right solutions more quickly.

2023 Short-term 
Incentive Plan
The performance measures driving the 
outcome of the 2023 Short-Term 
Incentive (STI) scorecard are 
summarised below.

Financial performance in 2023

In 2023, we moved to a new basis of 
accounting for insurance contracts (IFRS 
17), which required the 2023 adjusted 
operating profit target under the 
previous accounting basis (IFRS 4) to be 
recalculated for the purpose of the STI 
scorecard. We discussed the different 
methodology for determining adjusted 
operating profit under IFRS 17 and 
whether a simple recalculation of the 
target was appropriate for remuneration 
purposes.It was concluded that under 
IFRS 17 the like-for-like methodology 
would lead to a measure that would not 
align remuneration to actual 
management delivery and value creation 
during the year. In order to achieve this 
alignment, it was decided to adopt a new 
STI profit measure for the 2023 
performance period taking account of 
operating change in contractual service 
margin, being a new Board-approved 
IFRS 17 alternative performance 
measure. 

Operating change in contractual service 
margin gives a view of economic value 
generated by including the impact of 
new business written and management 
actions taken in the period. Further 
details of the measure can be found on 
page 147. By adding the two metrics 
together, executive remuneration is 
better linked to strategic actions in the 
performance period in which they have 
been made.

AOP plus operating change in CSM of 
£1,152 million was above target in 2023. 
Above target AOP benefitted from 
higher than expected amortisation rates 
for the CSM in relation to with-profits 
business and also an increase in 
investment and interest income in the 
Corporate Centre. The operating change 
in CSM was also above target benefitting 
from higher than expected inflows into 
PruFund in the Wealth segment.

121

Operating Capital Generation is £996 
million and is above the maximum 
performance level, driven by higher 
underlying capital generation as a result 
of increased yields, together with higher 
other operating capital generation 
largely driven by model changes, offset 
by lower management actions.

Non-financial performance in 2023

Non-financial measures focus on our 
clients and colleagues, and ensuring we 
operate within an effective risk and 
controls environment. Non-financial 
measures ensure that the scorecards 
retain an appropriate balance between 
performance and how it is delivered, 
which is critical for M&G’s long-term 
success, sustainable shareholder value 
creation and aligning with the principles 
of the Consumer Duty. Although we did 
not achieve all of the stretching targets 
established at the beginning of the year, 
an above-target outcome was achieved 
for the non-financial section overall, and 
the Committee was pleased to observe 
stable or improving year-on-year trends 
across most client outcomes, colleague 
engagement and the control 
environment.

Our client metrics include:

– Our Life and Wealth net promoter 
score, which was 15 for 2023, a +1 
improvement on prior year and 
between the threshold and target of 
the performance range;

– With-Profits Fund investment 
performance, which again 
outperformed the benchmark 
demonstrating the benefit to 
policyholders of the strength and 
diversification of the Fund’s 
investment approach; and

– Asset Management investment 

performance, which is measured on a 
rolling quarterly average basis over 
one and three years. 70.7% of 
institutional funds outperformed their 
investment benchmark/objective to 
deliver a maximum outcome. 51% of 
wholesale funds outperformed their 
investment benchmark/objective, 
which was consistent with the 2022 
outcome and at the threshold of the 
performance range.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued

Employee engagement is the degree to 
which employees invest themselves to 
drive positive organisational outcomes. 
Colleague inclusion continues to be 
measured on a regular basis as part of 
our OneVoice surveys. We measure this 
in our OneVoice survey, asking 
colleagues how happy they are at work 
and if they would recommend M&G as a 
great place to work. Our response rate 
to the OneVoice survey generally 
remained stable at 77% at the end of 
2023 (2022: 79%) with our Sustainable 
engagement score also remaining 
relatively stable at 70.7 (2022:72). 

The scorecard target and performance is 
based on an average of the three 
surveys conducted in 2023. Taking into 
account the level of change across the 
Group Executive Committee during 
2023, the average outcome of 70.7, 
between threshold and target, was a 
pleasing outcome. 

Our annual assessment of risk 
management and internal control 
effectiveness identified that we made 
positive progress in 2023, while 
acknowledging that implementation 
work will continue into 2024 to reach 
target maturity. 

The positive trend of reducing the 
number of overdue high and very high 
assurance issues continued in 2023, with 
the outcome of 0.9% just below the 
maximum performance requirement. At 
63.6%, the proportion of self-identified 
high and very high issues was above 
target, and stable with the 2022 
performance level. 

As a result of this performance the 2023 
STI delivered an outcome of 79.9% of 
maximum opportunity for the Executive 
Directors (compared to an outcome of 
50.6% in 2022).

The primary measure was cumulative 
operating capital generation which was 
above target, with performance in 2023 
driven by higher yields and positive 
management actions.

25% of the scorecard was based on our 
total shareholder return relative to a peer 
group of FTSE 100 financial services 
companies (excluding investment trusts), 
with threshold performance set at the 
median of the peer group and maximum 
performance at the upper quartile. 

Performance was at the upper quartile of 
the peer group with a return of 46.1% for 
the three-year period, driven by a solid 
share price performance with a c. 12.5% 
increase over the period and the 
continuation of our dividend policy which 
continued to be at the high end of FTSE 
100 levels in 2023.

There has also been strong performance 
against the non-financial measures in the 
scorecard:

– For Risk and Conduct, the Committee 

considered a range of factors in 
determining the outcome of the 
measure. They observed that over the 
3-year period the business had 
generally operated within risk appetite 
and policy limits, with appropriate 
remediation promptly implemented in 
a limited number of instances where 
the business operated outside of this. 
In particular, policy compliance was 
maintained at a high level.

– It was observed that there had been 
incremental improvements in the 
control environment in each of the 
three years of the performance period 
and, while further improvement is 
needed in 2024, the positive progress 
over the performance period was 
acknowledged. Taking consideration 
of all of these factors, the Committee 
concluded that an outcome of 40% 
was appropriate.

– 2024 salary increases: The actual 

salary spend increase across the UK 
workforce in 2024 has been 4.6%, 
with higher increases towards more 
junior roles with an average increase 
of 5%, compared to 4% for more 
senior roles. During 2023 we remained 
mindful of the cost-of-living 
challenges, making a further one-off 
payment of £500 to all colleagues 
earning under £75,000 pa;

– We currently have 37% women in 

– 2023 STI outcomes: The average STI 

senior leadership, which has remained 
constant with 2022, and we remain 
committed to achieving our target of 
40% female representation in senior 
leadership by 2025. 

– Own emissions reduced by 43% 

from the 2019 baseline. The 
outperformance of the target has 
primarily been driven by positive 
management actions to reduce Scope 
1&2 emissions, particularly in relation 
to changes in our office portfolio, 
removal of natural gas from the 
Scottish offices following the 
relocation of our Stirling based 
colleagues to a new office in 2022, and 
proactive procurement of renewable 
electricity. In 2023, our Scope 3 
emissions increased due to upward 
trends in colleague travel. However, 
the 2023 level of business travel 
emissions was still 28% lower than the 
2019 baseline and ahead of the target.

Consideration of pay and 
conditions across the wider 
workforce
The Committee takes careful 
consideration of pay and conditions for 
the wider workforce with a focus on 
fairness of remuneration outcomes, 
particularly in the current challenging 
economic environment. From 2023 a 
remuneration-based question has been 
included in the all-colleague OneVoice 
survey to give the Committee additional 
insight. Workforce remuneration is also a 
key input when determining salary 
reviews and incentive outcomes for the 
Executive Directors. The key indicators 
considered by the Committee as part of 
its 2023 year-end decision making 
included:

outcome for wider workforce 
colleagues, which was 14% higher 
than it had been in 2022; and

– 2023 Total Remuneration outcome: 

The Chief Executive Total 
Remuneration Ratio, which was 28:1 
in 2023 at median (compared to 77:1 
in 2022).

The Committee noted that the decrease 
in the remuneration ratio was primarily a 
consequence of the new Group Chief 
Executive Officer not receiving an LTIP 
vesting in respect of the 2021-23 
performance period, having joined the 
Company in October 2022. It was also 
noted that the new Group Chief 
Executive Officer’s package was 13% 
lower than his predecessor, no salary 
increase had been awarded during 2023 
and on a like-for-like basis the STI award 
had increased in line with the formulaic 
outcome of the scorecard relative to the 
prior year. The Committee was therefore 
assured that the decisions taken in 
respect of remuneration outcomes were 
fair and reasonable when compared to 
the wider workforce experience over the 
period. The Committee noted that 
outputs such as the Group Chief 
Executive Officer pay ratio would 
continue to be subject to some volatility 
over a period where there have been 
changes to the Executive Directors and 
transformation activity impacts the 
demographics of our wider workforce.

In our approach to sustainability we 
continue to prioritise diversity and 
inclusion, along with climate change. We 
are proud to have been one of the first 
companies in our industry to publish an 
ethnicity in leadership target and 
voluntarily publish ethnicity pay gap 
data. 

We believe that transparency is key to 
driving real change, which is why we 
report our ethnicity pay gap in the same 
way that we report our gender pay gap 
data. See our gender pay gap report on 
our website for more detail.

We are committed to achieving year-on-
year improvement in the representation 
of gender and ethnicity in senior 
leadership roles, with ambitious targets 
to ensure fair representation of women 
and individuals who identify as Black, 
Asian or from a Minority Ethnic 
background throughout M&G. This is 
underpinned by our LTIP scorecard, with 
measures and targets aligned to 
achieving and maintaining our stretching 
public goals of 40% women and 20% 
ethnicity by the end of 2025. For more 
information on diversity and inclusion 
please refer to the colleagues section of 
this report from pages 50-53.

Other areas of focus in 2023
There has been further significant 
transformation activity and changes 
among the Group Executive Committee 
(GEC) over the course of the year, with 
the Committee overseeing remuneration 
decisions linked to transformation 
initiatives and for the hiring and exit of a 
number of below-Board executives 
during the year. We were pleased to be 
able to support the execution of 
initiatives and attract executives of the 
required calibre and experience for 
these key roles, within the parameters of 
our Group Remuneration Policy.

The Board oversaw a review across the 
Group to ensure that we meet our 
Consumer Duty responsibilities, which 
included an independent assessment of 
all incentive plan arrangements. The 
Committee received the report and 
conclusions and was pleased to note 
general alignment of the design of 
incentive plans and the approach to 
determining remuneration outcomes 
with the Consumer Duty principles. 
Areas of refinement were identified to 
strengthen alignment in some incentive 
plans and governance documentation.

Implementation in 2024
The Committee approved a salary 
increase of 4% for the Group Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer in 2024. This was the first 
increase to apply since they were hired 
during 2022.

In determining this increase the 
Committee considered external market 
benchmark data, performance/delivery 
since their hire dates and the experience 
of the wider workforce, for whom an 
overall spend of 4.6% applied.

During 2024 we will undertake a further 
review of the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration packages to ensure that 
the structure, alignment and opportunity 
are appropriate in the context of the 
scale of our strategic ambition and how 
effective we are in maintaining the 
momentum in its delivery. If changes are 
considered, we will consult with 
shareholders in advance of finalising any 
decisions.

Incentive plan measures 
for 2024
The scorecards went through a 
comprehensive review for the 2023 
performance period as part of the Policy 
review and consultation. We concluded 
that the structure and balance of 
financial and non-financial measures 
within the scorecards remained 
appropriate. Some changes have been 
applied to the underlying measures as 
we continue to monitor the effectiveness 
of alignment to our refreshed purpose 
and strategy.

Financial measures: Following the 
adoption of IFRS 17 we have retained the 
updated profit measure to add operating 
change in contractual service margin to 
adjusted operating profit before tax in 
the 2024 STI scorecard. We also 
identified that in order to more 
effectively align the Executive Directors 
to our strategic decision to re-enter the 
defined benefit pension de-risking 
market, the Committee decided to adopt 
an adapted operating capital generation 
measure for use in the STI and LTIP 
scorecards which excludes the capital 
strain on writing new business.

Non-financial measures: There is very 
little change to these measures, which 
provide effective alignment to our 
refreshed purpose and commitments to 
clients, our culture, our sustainability 
priorities (diversity and climate) and to 
operate within an effective risk and 
control environment. In defining the 
measures and targets for the 2024 
scorecards, we reviewed our 
methodology to ensure the measures 
were aligned to purpose and strategy, 
and would drive our new behaviours. 

We were also mindful of the progress 
made at the end of 2023 to ensure 
targets and performance ranges for 
sustainability measures were 
sufficiently stretching.

Additional context for the financial and 
non-financial measures can be found in 
the link to strategy and 2024 
implementation sections of this report 
on pages 130 and 144.

During 2024, we will be looking closely at 
our approach to measuring and tracking 
client outcomes with our three segment 
CEOs. We will also consider additional 
climate measures as we embed our 
strategy and interim targets for the asset 
manager and asset owner, as well as 
reviewing how we continue to 
incorporate diversity into the scorecards 
in light of our 2025 targets and the 
outcome of the FCA consultation on 
diversity and inclusion. We therefore 
expect further adaptations to the 
measures in 2025.

Conclusion
As we look forward to 2024, the 
Committee will be focused on: 

– Reviewing the Executive Directors' 
packages to ensure structure and 
opportunity are appropriate.

– Assessing the effectiveness of 

incentives in promoting long-term 
value creation through alignment with 
the refreshed purpose and strategy.

– Assessing the effectiveness of client 

and sustainability metrics in delivering 
strategic objectives and outcomes.

– Continuing focus on the fairness of 

workforce remuneration in a 
challenging economic environment.

Remuneration at a glance

This section provides an overview of the Directors' Remuneration Policy, the remuneration outcomes for 2023 and implementation 
decisions for 2024. Through our implementation and operation of the Policy we ensure alignment to the following principles:

Sustainable, long term 
success of the Group and 
robust risk framework

Clear alignment with the long-term interests of the Company through a significant proportion of 
executive packages being delivered in shares for three to five years and through the 
shareholding and two-year post-employment shareholding requirement policies.

Remuneration appropriately balanced between recognising short and long term performance.

Financial and non-financial incentive measures that are focused on indicators of sustainable 
performance that position the company strongly for continued success.

A robust and rigorous risk review of remuneration outcomes to ensure that these properly reflect 
overall company performance from a financial, key stakeholder, conduct and reputational 
perspective, and within an effective risk management framework and culture.

Clarity of our remuneration packages which are appropriately positioned relative to the scope 
and complexity of the roles and relevant market benchmarks, and designed to reflect and 
recognise performance.

Key focus on positive client outcomes and quality of client engagement.

Strong alignment with our ambitious diversity targets and objectives to maintain a positive and 
engaging culture that provides equality of opportunity for all current and prospective colleagues.

Promoting a positive culture in which the ‘how’ as well as the ‘what’ is recognised and valued, 
with a focus on colleagues and clients and demonstrable alignment between behaviours and 
remuneration outcomes.

High performing talent

Positive, safe and 
collaborative environment 
aligned to our purpose, values 
and culture

Predictability and alignment 
with stakeholders

Strong alignment for our executives with the experience of shareholders through the delivery of 
a significant proportion of remuneration in shares, with vesting and holding periods over 5 years 
and a robust shareholding requirement policy.

Incentive plan measures aligned to client outcomes and long term diversity and climate 
measures that reflect and recognise the company’s wider role and impact.

Simple and transparent

Remuneration plans and programmes that are simple to understand and provide clear linkage to 
performance set in line with business strategy.

Compliant and focused on 
best practice

Arrangements are fully compliant with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements and

Shareholding requirements
The Group Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must attain a shareholding requirement of 300% and 250% of base 
salary respectively within five years. Vested shares, after the sale of shares to fund tax liabilities, must be held until the requirement 
is met (unless there are exceptional circumstances). Unvested shares not subject to performance conditions count towards the 
requirement on a net-of-tax basis. In addition, shares subject to the shareholding requirement must be held in full for two years 
post-employment.

The shareholdings for Andrea Rossi and Kathryn McLeland are shown in the table below as at 31 December 2023. Having joined 
the Board in 2022 both are currently in compliance with the shareholding policy.

2023 Performance outcomes
The performance scorecard outcome for the 2023 STI was the same for both Executive Directors at 79.9%. Taking into account a 
range of factors, including personal performance and a risk and controls assessment, the Committee was satisfied that no 
adjustments be applied to the formulaic STI outcomes for the Executive Directors. Neither Andrea Rossi nor Kathryn McLeland had 
awards vesting under the 2021 LTIP, as both joined the company in 2022. Performance against the 2021 LTIP scorecard measures 
is however detailed in this report on page 135 with an overall vesting of 90.1%.

Rationale for measures and link to strategy
During the triennial review of the Policy in 2023, our incentive scorecards underwent a comprehensive review, and the 
Committee considered alternative models for delivering long-term incentives for simplification of our incentive structure 
and alignment with our purpose, strategy, culture and operational priorities. 

We concluded that our current approach of a Short-Term Incentive (STI) and performance-based LTIP created effective alignment 
and should be retained. 

We believe our incentive scorecards retain an appropriate balance between performance and how it is delivered, which is critical 
for M&G’s long-term success, and also sustainable shareholder value creation. Key aspects of non-financial performance include 
risk management effectiveness, client experience and outcomes, conduct, culture, diversity and climate, demonstrating alignment 
with all our stakeholders:

Customers

Colleagues

Communities
Shareholders

Customer outcome measures embedded in the STI scorecard

Colleague engagement is an established measure within the STI scorecard and Diversity in our LTIP scorecard

Climate and Diversity measures embedded in the LTIP scorecard
Alignment to the shareholder experience via:
– The relative TSR component within the LTIP scorecard
– Focus on capital generation which underpins our ability to pay a dividend
– Deferral into shares of a significant proportion of annual STI awards with vesting over three years
– Post-vesting holding and share ownership requirements for our senior executives

Performance measures
Our 2024 incentive scorecards have retained the same structure and measures, aligned to our refreshed purpose and strategy. We 
have refined the definition/methodology for some measures, as we continue to monitor the effectiveness of this alignment. All 
measures have transparent, quantifiable targets and performance ranges. 

In accordance with the Policy, the performance conditions may comprise a combination of financial and non-financial measures, 
with financial measures comprising at least 50% for STI and at least 75% (including TSR) for the LTIP.

The 2024 STI scorecard will have:

– 60% financial weighting with measures aligned to profit and capital generation; and

– 40% non-financial weighting with measures aligned to client outcomes, colleagues and risk and controls.

In 2023 the Company adopted IFRS 17 for accounting for its insurance contracts which required the 2023 Adjusted Operating 
Profit Target to be recalculated for the purpose of the STI scorecard since it had been based on the previous accounting 
standard .We discussed the different methodology under IFRS 17 and whether a simple recalculation of the target was appropriate 
for remuneration purposes. It was concluded that under IFRS 17 the like-for-like methodology would lead to a measure that would 
not effectively align remuneration to actual management delivery and value creation during the year. In order to achieve this 
alignment, it was decided to adopt a new STI profit measure for the 2023 performance period taking account of operating change 
in contractual service margin, being a new Board-approved IFRS 17 alternative performance measure.

In order to more effectively align the incentive plans to our strategic decision to re-enter the defined benefit pension de-risking 
market, the Committee decided to adopt an adapted Operating Capital Generation measure in the STI and LTIP scorecards from 
2024, which excludes new business strain (NBS). Without this amendment there is an unintended risk that the STI and LTIP would 
disincentivise the executive to pursue new business with the potential to deliver attractive long-term returns on capital, but which 
produces a short-term negative impact on capital generation at the point of execution.
The definitions of the financial measures are provided on page 147.

In addition, we have refined the methodology for the risk and control measures to increase coverage and reflect performance 
throughout the year, rather than as at a discrete point in time at the end of the year.

The 2024 LTIP scorecard will have:

– 75% financial weighting (including TSR), comprising Cumulative Operating Capital Generation excluding NBS (50%) and TSR 

ranking within a peer group (25%)

– 25% non-financial weighting with sustainability measures aligned to Diversity and Climate.

The capital measure has been refined to exclude new business strain, as explained above. We have retained the same three sustainability 
measures in 2024 (Gender and Ethnicity Diversity and Own Emissions reduction), for which we have published medium-term strategic 
objectives. The Committee paid careful consideration to performance delivered up to the end of 2023 and the challenges in maintaining 
and advancing performance over the next three years when determining the targets and performance ranges.

2024 Financial measures
The financial measures in our incentive scorecards are based on the Group's Alternative Performance Measures, which are aligned 
with M&G’s long-term performance, external financial targets and shareholder experience. In line with our commitment to review 
the relative weightings of the financial measures in the consultation on the 2023 Policy review, the measures are equally weighted 
at 30% in the 2024 STI scorecard (capital was previously 40% and profit 20%). 

Operating Capital Generation excluding new business strain (short and long-term incentive) 

Operating capital generation (defined on page 147) is an alternative performance measure which demonstrates the longer-term 
view of the movements in our capital surplus. Operating capital generation is aligned to our external targets and is reflective of 
performance that is within management’s control to deliver. The Committee decided to adopt an adjusted metric that excludes 
new business strain in order to ensure the measurement of current management’s performance is not impacted by the regulatory 
requirement to hold additional capital against new business written. New business strain is a component of underlying capital 
generation in the Life and Wealth segments.

Adjusted operating profit before tax plus operating change in contractual service margin (CSM) (short-term incentive) 

Adjusted operating profit before tax (defined on page 147) is the Group’s non-GAAP alternative performance measure used to 
demonstrate the longer-term performance of the Group as it is less affected by short-term market volatility and non-recurring 
items than IFRS profit before tax. The Committee decided to adopt a new STI profit measure by adding the operating change in 
contractual service margin, our new IFRS 17 related alternative performance measure for the Life and Wealth segment (defined on 
page 366) to adjusted operating profit before tax, to ensure that the incentive recognises growth and management actions in the 
period in which they were taken.

Relative total shareholder return (long-term incentive)

A long-term measure, which ensures direct alignment of remuneration outcomes to shareholder experience relative to a peer 
group. Our peer group comprises selected FTSE 350 peers based on comparable size, business scope and geography. This 
approach ensures close alignment to M&G‘s core business activities of Asset Management, Wealth and Life, and geographic 
coverage. The peer group is consistent with that applied to the 2023 LTIP scorecard other than reflecting the removal of Liontrust, 
which is not currently a constituent of the FTSE 350, and comprises:

– 3i Group – abrdn – Ashmore – Aviva – Hargreaves Lansdown – ICG – Jupiter – Just Group – Legal & General

– Man Group – Ninety One – Phoenix Group – Quilter – Rathbone – Schroders – St James’s Place

2024 Non-financial measures 
Across our short and long-term incentive plans, we have non-financial measures aligned with our purpose, strategy and culture. 
These measures ensure that there is an appropriate balance between our performance and how that performance has been 
delivered.

Client measures (short-term incentives)

Client measures are key to the successful execution of our strategy, and to understanding and delivering good client outcomes. 
We include the following measures:

– Life and Wealth clients: (a) a measure aligned to addressing and improving our client net promoter score; and (b) With-Profits 

Fund investment performance relative to benchmark.

– Investment management clients: (a) investment performance of wholesale funds; and (b) investment performance of institutional 

funds, relative to benchmarks and objectives. 

Colleague and Risk measures (short-term incentives)

– Colleague measure: aligned to the sustainable engagement index outcome from an average of the colleague OneVoice surveys, 

aligned with embedding our culture and supporting a safe, respectful and inclusive environment for colleagues.

– Risk and control environment measures: aligned with our commitment to operate within an embedded risk culture and strong 

risk governance framework.

Sustainability measures (long-term incentives)

Sustainability measures aligned to our strategy and external commitments for diversity and own-emissions reductions. We are 
monitoring and committed to introducing an interim net zero asset manager/asset owner measure in the future.

– Diversity (gender) – target aligned to our external commitment to achieve and maintain 40% gender representation by the end 

of 2025;

– Diversity (ethnicity) – target aligned to our external commitment to achieve and maintain 20% ethnicity representation by the 

end of 2025;

– Climate – an interim target aligned with progressing towards our external commitment to achieve a near-term carbon emissions 

reduction of 46% by 2030.

scorecard measures is available

Link to strategy and purpose
The metrics used for remuneration of adjusted operating profit before tax plus operating change in CSM and operating capital 
generation excluding NBS are primary indicators of M&G’s long-term performance and how we are delivering on our strategic 
priorities. Total shareholder return aligns with our performance in delivering value to shareholders through improvements in our 
financial performance and outlook, driven by the execution of our three strategic priorities and how we serve our clients. Non-
financial measures ensure there is appropriate balance with how we deliver performance and underpin our purpose to give 
everyone real confidence to put their money to work:

Details of these measures are set out on page 147.

Risk and Conduct
The Committee considered a range of factors in determining the outcome of the qualitative Risk and Conduct measure. 
They observed that over the 3-year period the business had generally operated within risk appetite and policy limits, with 
appropriate remediation promptly implemented in the limited number of instances where the business operated outside these. 
In particular, policy compliance was maintained at a high level. It was observed that there had been incremental improvements 
in the control environment in each of the three years of the performance period and that, while further improvement is expected 
in 2024, the positive progress was acknowledged. Taking consideration of all of these factors the Committee concluded that an 
outcome of 40% was appropriate.

Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) outcome 
For the 2021 LTIP M&G plc TSR was measured against a peer group constituted of FTSE 100 Financial Services companies 
excluding investment trusts. The starting point for TSR was based on a 30-calendar day average of M&G plc and peer group 
companies preceding the performance period. The end point was based on an average of the last 30-calendar days of the 
performance period. 

Consideration of risk 

The Committee received an independent review of the control environment and key risk and compliance matters from the Chief 
Risk and Compliance Officer, as well as input from the Risk Committee and the subsidiary Risk Committees for PAC and MGG. 
The Committee noted positive progress has been made across M&G plc during 2023 in building on the risk and control framework 
foundations previously put in place. They acknowledged that implementation work continues into 2024 to reach target maturity, 
including some enhancements to elements of the framework and embedding of group-wide Key Control Assessments across the 
business. The review framework considers the management of individual risks (for example conflicts of interest risk) and risk 
outcomes, such as customer outcomes, with specific output received in respect of notifiable event impacts; compliance with Group 
policy requirements; risk appetite assessment; and regulatory feedback. Taking consideration of all information from the report the 
Committee considered it appropriate to make no adjustments to the formulaic outcome of the 2023 STI, or any risk-related 
adjustments to the vesting of the 2021 LTIP.

Total shareholder return performance graph and Group Chief Executive Officer pay 
The performance graph shows the Total Shareholder Return of M&G plc compared to the index constituents of the FTSE 100, 
FTSE 100 financial services companies (excluding investment trusts), and a peer group of FTSE 350 sectoral firms aligned to the 
Group's core business activities (asset management, wealth management and/or life insurance) for the period beginning October 
2019 and ending in December 2023. M&G plc is a member of the FTSE 100 index, and in addition the FTSE 100 financial services 
sector (excluding investment trusts) is used to measure relative TSR performance in the 2021 and 2022 LTIP scorecards, and the 
bespoke FTSE 350 sectoral peer group for LTIP awards granted from 2023 onwards (which is more closely aligned to M&G's core 
business activities and geographic coverage).

price of £1.932 for the 2020 LTIP. Andrea Rossi does not have an LTIP award vesting in respect to 2023 (the final vesting outcome

All performance conditions have straight-line vesting between points and are measured over the three-year period 1 January 2023 
to 31 December 2025.

For all performance conditions other than TSR there is 0% vesting for performance at or below threshold, 50% at target and 100% 
at maximum with straight-line interpolation between these points.

The starting point for TSR is based on a 30-calendar day average of M&G plc and peer group companies preceding the 
performance period. The end point will be based on an average of the last 30-calendar days of the performance period. For this 
metric there is 0% vesting for performance below threshold, 25% for achieving the median (threshold performance) and 100% 
vesting for achieving upper quartile or above, with straight-line interpolation between these points. The peer group consists of a 
selection of FTSE 350 sectoral peers selected on objective criteria in terms of comparable size, business scope and geography and 
aligned to M&G's core business activities (asset management, wealth management and/or life insurance), and for 2023 comprised:

3i Group – abrdn – Ashmore – Aviva – Hargreaves Lansdown – ICG – Jupiter – Just Group – Legal & General - Liontrust

– Man Group – Ninety One – Phoenix Group – Quilter – Rathbone – Schroders – St James’s Place
