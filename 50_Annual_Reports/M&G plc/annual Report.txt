Building a stronger business

M&G's business continues to transform: with a clear purpose, client focus and 
our diversified business model we are well placed to deliver sustainable returns

Overview 
A year ago, we announced the group’s 
refreshed strategy. Since then, as his 
report shows, Andrea and his team have 
made good progress across all three 
pillars of our strategy – financial 
strength, simplification and growth. It is 
encouraging in this tough environment 
to have achieved higher net client flows 
and a robust financial performance.

Our purpose and strategy
During the year, we reviewed our 
purpose as part of a wider exercise to 
inspire and align ourselves on how best 
to implement the refreshed strategy. The 
conclusion of those detailed discussions 
was that our purpose is to give everyone 
real confidence to put their money 
to work. 

Although it is not easy to achieve, 
it guides our actions and shows how our 
integrated strategy as an asset owner, 
asset manager and wealth adviser 
aligns with our goals and our 
powerful capabilities.

As well as reviewing the purpose, we 
also asked ourselves what values and 
behaviours were needed to make the 
shifts that we wanted to see across the 
business. This work was led by Andrea 
and the senior leadership team, 
gathering input from the Board and 
engaging with colleagues across M&G. 

The process achieved unprecedented 
levels of engagement and feedback, 
which gives confidence that this 
articulation of our purpose, values and 
behaviours will embed deeply over time.

Our culture
Throughout 2023 the Board has 
continued to engage with our colleagues 
to better understand their experience of 
working at M&G, the role our culture 
plays and how we are striving to create 
an exceptional place to work: a positive 
culture where our colleagues enjoy each 
day, feel inspired to do their best for our 
clients, help grow the business and 
support the communities in which 
we operate.

Our people practices set a benchmark 
within our sector and in similar-sized 
organisations, and are recognised by the 
National Equality Standard, the UK’s 
highest benchmark for equality, diversity 
and inclusion.

We continue to make every effort to 
develop a fully inclusive environment for 
our colleagues, clients and communities. 
Over the past year, we have continued to 
develop and implement colleague-based 
initiatives across our five global 
workstreams, which cover disability, 
gender, ethnicity/nationality, life stages 
and LGBTQ+, and support our 
ambition of building a safe, inclusive 
and diverse culture.

We are committed to achieving greater 
gender parity across all of our global 
operations. We have been a signatory of 
the UK HM Treasury Women in Finance 
Charter for six years and are signatories 
of the Women in Finance Charter in 
Ireland and the diversity charters in 
France and Italy, showing expanded 
support for this ambition internationally.

We are proud to have been one of the 
first companies in our sector to publish 
an ethnicity in leadership target 
and voluntarily publish ethnicity pay 
gap data. 

Stakeholder engagement
As a responsible business we recognise 
the importance of proactive engagement 
across a range of different stakeholders 
and the value of partnerships with 
Governments, regulators, shareholders, 
trade associations and Non 
Governmental Organisations (NGOs). 

Throughout the course of the year we 
have held regular meetings with key 
external stakeholders on a range of key 
issues and engaged directly to ensure 
the best outcomes for our clients.

“
 We continue to make every 
effort to develop a fully inclusive 
environment for our clients, 
colleagues and communities.”

Shareholder returns
The Board recognises the importance of 
returns for our shareholders both 
through share price appreciation and 
capital returns. Generating strong and 
sustainable earnings is key and, while 
there is always more to be done, all who 
work in M&G should be proud of the 
robust financial performance that they 
have delivered. 

The Board’s dividend policy remains to 
pay stable or increasing dividends over 
time, with the recommendation of a total 
dividend for 2023 of 19.7 pence per 
share.

Directors
We are very well served by an excellent 
Board and I would like to thank them all 
for their support over the last year.

Conclusion
No Chairman’s statement would be 
complete without thanking those who 
contribute to our success. 

We aim to ensure that the composition 
of the Board represents a diverse mix of 
experiences and backgrounds to 
enhance discussion, deliberation 
and decision making. 

I continue to be impressed with the 
dedication and determination of the 
remarkable people at M&G and the 
high quality leadership of Andrea and 
his team. 

I remain focused on ensuring that we 
have the right skills and capabilities 
within the Board to support the 
transformation of M&G and I am 
personally committed to the diversity 
of our Board. 

I am hugely proud of how our colleagues 
have supported our clients throughout 
2023 and continued to make a positive 
contribution to the communities in which 
we operate. 

We have much still to do, but I am 
confident that the Group’s purpose, 
client focus and unique business model 
give a strong foundation for our people 
to deliver higher, more sustainable 
returns for our shareholders, as well as 
serving the interests of our clients and 
our broader stakeholders.

Group Chief Executive Officer’s statement

A clear sense of direction

2023: Strong financial performance, continued business 
momentum and good strategic progress

The underlying strength of our 
differentiated business model is driving 
good strategic progress. Combined with 
the hard work and commitment of our 
colleagues, we are delivering a strong 
operational and financial performance, 
as we transform the business, with 
better client outcomes.

Building the foundations 
for future success
In 2023, we embarked on a journey of 
ambitious growth aspirations, strategic 
realignments, and transformative 
initiatives. I am proud of the foundations 
we are laying for our future success. 
We are establishing a corporate 
infrastructure that brings us together: 
simplifying our business and improving 
the way we serve our clients, thereby 
creating more opportunities to 
grow M&G.

Underpinning this is our new purpose ‘to 
give everyone real confidence to put 
their money to work’ which reflects our 
long term ambition as a business. 
Central to this is our unwavering 
commitment to serving our clients with 
excellence. By prioritising their needs 
and expectations we will elevate the 
quality of our service delivery, foster 
stronger relationships and deeper trust, 
in turn delivering better customer 
outcomes, creating financial strength 
and achieving profitable growth.

Our balanced, diversified and synergistic 
business model enables this and through 
our new structure and refocused 
strategy we are driving forward Asset 
Management, reigniting our Life 
business, and refocusing Wealth, 
supported by a dedicated leadership 
team. I’m delighted to welcome to the 
Group Executive Committee Joseph 
Pinto as CEO Asset Management, Clive 
Bolton as CEO Life, and Caroline 
Connellan as CEO Wealth.

Leveraging our business 
model to deliver on 
our priorities 
Despite a backdrop of volatile financial 
markets and geopolitical uncertainties, 
we've remained resilient and adaptive. 
We have delivered good progress across 
each of our three core strategic pillars: 
financial strength, simplification 
and profitable growth, as we become 
a more efficient and more 
international organisation.

Financial strength

Over the past year we have become 
more profitable and more capital 
generative, as well as more resilient. 
We delivered an increased adjusted 
operating profit before tax of 
£797 million, helped by higher interest 
rates, up 28% year-on-year with our 
solvency ratio improving to 203%. 

Through effective capital management, 
our operating capital generation was up 
21% to £996 million. Given the strength 
of our operating capital generation, we 
are confident that we will achieve our 
£2.5 billion target by the end of 2024.

All of this means we are continuing to 
deliver attractive sustainable returns to 
our shareholders with a total dividend for 
2023 of 19.7 pence per share.

Simplification

We are a year into our transformation 
programme and have already taken 
significant steps to improve the 
efficiency of the business in the pursuit 
of better client service and outcomes. 
This has included starting to implement 
our new operating model, with 
accountable leaders for each of our 
three businesses, reducing our office 
space and enhancing the efficiency of 
our support functions.

We have a clear focus on transforming 
our cost base, creating capacity to 
investment to support priority areas, 
better client outcomes and 
growth opportunities.

We remain confident in achieving our 
target of a much improved operating 
model with costs reduced by £200 
million by 2025 compared to 2022, of 
which £73 million savings have already 
been achieved. 

“
We have delivered good 
progress across each of our 
three core strategic pillars.”

Group Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued

Client outcomes were strong across 
both the Institutional and Wholesale 
franchises, with roughly 50% of our 
wholesale funds ranked in the top 
quartile on both a three and five-year 
basis. We also continued to innovate, 
expanding the range of funds and 
investment vehicles that we offer such 
as new Asian and Global bond funds.

International Growth
Since 2020, our international AUMA 
have increased by 38% to £83 billion. In 
2023 alone, we had meaningful client 
inflows across key European and Asia 
Pacific markets. It is a testament to the 
quality of our capabilities.

Deep expertise
We have strong capabilities and 
expertise in a number of areas that are 
attractive to our clients. We are 
recognised as industry leaders in Public 
Fixed Income and currently have assets 
under management of £139 billion. We 
have a compelling range of funds across 
developed and emerging markets, 
government and corporate debt.

Growth

We have made strong progress across 
all of our businesses. 

Asset Management
Our Asset Manager has overcome 
significant market challenges and 
achieved positive net client flows of 
£800 million. It has delivered superior 
investment performance, grown 
internationally, and further diversified its 
client base and earnings mix. It is well 
positioned for the future, as it offers 
deep expertise in the asset classes 
attractive to our clients.

I am very pleased with the turnaround 
we delivered in our Wholesale business, 
underpinned by a strongly improved 
investment performance. Over the past 
two years, we achieved net client inflows 
of £2.0 billion, in contrast to the 
European market for active investment 
solutions which suffered net outflows of 
over £350 billion. 

Last year, our Institutional business 
faced meaningful headwinds in the UK 
market due to the ongoing de-risking of 
defined benefit pension funds. On the 
other hand, it thrived internationally, 
generating £5.5 billion of net client 
inflows over the last year alone and 
£16 billion over the past four years. 

Within Private Markets we are a 
European leader with £73 billion assets 
under management. We expect our 
Private Credit franchise to expand 
strongly with supportive market 
dynamics over the coming years, 
leveraging our strong track record both 
in terms of investment performance and 
innovation.

Life
Throughout 2023 our aim has been 
to reignite our Life business through 
a number of key initiatives. First, we 
successfully entered the bulk purchase 
annuity (BPA) market, completing two 
deals in 2023 and a third in March this 
year, bringing total sales to over 
£900 million. We hope to reach £1 billion 
to £1.5 billion in BPA sales per year, 
to fully offset the run-off of our annuity 
book and increase long-term 
capital generation. 

Secondly, we are working to leverage 
better the powerful combination of our 
With-Profits Fund and the shareholder 
balance sheet, to develop new 
propositions for the benefit of our 
clients, the With-Profits Fund and the 
wider Group. With a Solvency ratio of 
over 400% and surplus capital of more 
than £7 billion, the With-Profits Fund has 
the capacity and appetite to deploy 
capital over the long-term. Working 
together, we are highly effective in 
serving clients needs and have the 
opportunity to develop new 
compelling solutions for individual 
and corporate clients.

Making a difference

Supporting colleagues and communities
I am always keen to meet colleagues 
throughout the business. In late 2023, 
I visited our Kildean office in Scotland, 
listening to colleague views, including 
those from the Colleague Forum, our 
Client teams and Security Operations 
teams, and held a Townhall event.

The team, run largely on a volunteering 
basis, provides food, meals and key 
household items and were working 
around the clock to source 500 
Christmas gifts for children, as well as 
cooking dinners to deliver over the 
festive season. 

Equally important is understanding 
more about our different community 
engagement projects, and I was 
delighted to meet 'Start Up Stirling' - 
a charity we partner with to assist local 
people and families in need.

I also visited Stirling Albion, a football 
club we have sponsored for over 
20 years. I met trustees and volunteers, 
and heard more about their work in the 
local community to support sport and 
fitness. We will continue breaking 
down barriers to build communities.

Wealth
Our Wealth business has a strong brand 
and corporate heritage, an extensive 
reach through both tied-advice and third 
party distribution, and provides access 
for UK clients to a comprehensive range 
of multi-asset solutions, including our 
market leading PruFund.

Throughout 2023 we continued to see 
strong demand for our key propositions 
from our Wealth clients with PruFund 
Wealth sales increasing by 17%, 
reaching the highest level since 2019. 
We have seen great client feedback for 
PruFolio, our risk-rated range of multi-
asset solutions and our Model Portfolio 
Service, with the latter achieving a best 
in class Net Promoter Score.

We see significant opportunities to grow 
our Wealth business over the coming 
years with over 12 millioni people in the 
UK currently seeking assistance to 
achieve financial security. Clients want 
accessible advice, help in planning for 
life events, and a diversified multi-asset 
exposure that can reduce the volatility of 
their investments. Our Wealth franchise 
has what it needs to serve these clients 
and help them realise long-term value. 
By focusing on expanding our advice 
capabilities through our in-house Advice 
Training Academy and leveraging other 
multi-asset solutions to capitalise on 
growth opportunities, we expect to 
improve efficiency, client delivery, and 
financial outcomes in 2024 and beyond. 

Making a difference
As a responsible corporate citizen, asset 
owner and asset manager, we can effect 
positive real-world change. Through 
community investment and sustainable 
practices, we're committed to creating 
value not only for our stakeholders but 
also for society at large, helping to break 
down barriers that prevent people from 
living the life they want, offering support 
at a strategic and local level and focused 
on urban regeneration, economic 
empowerment and community building. 

“
Through community investment 
and sustainable practices, 
we’re committed to creating value 
not only for our stakeholders 
but also for society at large.”

Andrea Rossi
Group Chief Executive Officer

In addition to our new business CEOs, 
I was delighted to welcome Charlotte 
Heiss, General Counsel and Company 
Secretary and Rob Lewis, Chief Auditor 
to the Group Executive Committee. 
I’d like to again express thanks to 
Clare Bousfield, Alan Porter and 
Peter Grewal for their service to M&G 
and wish them all well for their 
future endeavours.

When I meet with colleagues, the sense 
of pride in the role that M&G plays and 
the determination to make a difference is 
clear. Thank you to everyone for their 
hard work and the part they have played 
in our success in 2023.

Outlook
As I look ahead to 2024 and beyond I am 
confident that we will continue to drive 
progress and deliver against the three 
pillars of our strategy - leading to 
sustainably better outcomes for clients 
and shareholders over time. 

While I remain mindful of the current 
external environment that we operate in, 
and both the challenges and 
opportunities this presents M&G, the 
strength and diversification of our 
business model stands us in good stead. 

Andrea Rossi
Group Chief Executive Officer

Growth capital and early-stage 
innovation remain the core focus for our 
purpose-led flexible private assets 
strategy, Catalyst, backed by a £5 billion 
mandate from the With-Profits Fund. It 
also invested €75 million in Biobest, a 
global leader in biological crop 
protection, and US$15 million into 
Harbinger Health, a US-based business 
that is innovating to detect the earliest 
stages of cancer.

Inspiring our colleagues
Our success is intrinsically tied to the 
dedication and expertise of our 
colleagues. By fostering a culture of 
innovation, collaboration and continuous 
learning, we are empowering our 
workforce to thrive and drive 
forward M&G. 

Our aim is to create an exceptional place 
to work at M&G: a positive culture where 
our colleagues enjoy each day. We are 
committed to ensuring our colleagues' 
working lives are engaging and fulfilling, 
in a safe, inclusive and diverse 
environment. We want them to feel 
inspired to do their best for our clients to 
help grow the business and support the 
communities in which we operate. Our 
refreshed strategy, new purpose and 
focus on delivering sustainable and 
profitable growth requires our people to 
continue to evolve and adapt at pace. 
We continue to invest in our people 
across all our markets and have 
restructured and strengthened our 
leadership and management teams to 
take us forward into our next exciting 
stage of growth.

Introducing our business CEOs

We have a new dedicated expert leadership team with ambitious plans 
to drive forward our Asset Management, Life and Wealth businesses

Asset Management

Joseph Pinto 
Asset Management CEO

We have ambitious plans for Asset 
Management, and I’m excited about 
the opportunities ahead of us.

As an active investment manager, we 
have deep expertise in the parts of the 
market that are attractive to our 
clients – in fixed income, private 
assets, sustainability and thematic 
equity funds. 

Our global network of investment and 
distribution teams enables us to be a 
local partner to our clients wherever 
they are in the world, delivering high-
value solutions to help them navigate 
the investment challenges they face.

Asset Management is the engine that 
powers our investment solutions and 
enables M&G to deliver value to a wide 
range of clients.

Life

Clive Bolton 
Life CEO

Wealth

Caroline Connellan
Wealth CEO

We have unique capabilities to deliver 
great outcomes for our individual 
and institutional clients and I'm excited 
by the opportunities to grow our 
Life business.

The strength of our balance sheet and 
With-Profits Fund means we have an 
unrivalled capability to meet the needs 
of our clients in a differentiated way, 
and our PruFund proposition in 
particular remains very popular.
We re-entered the bulk purchase 
annuity market during the year, and 
will be developing our range further 
during 2024. 

By building on the strong partnerships 
with Wealth and Asset Management, 
we’re in the best possible position to 
leverage our strengths and grow M&G.

I’m confident that Wealth is well 
positioned to capture the significant 
market opportunity, with a customer 
focused strategy to grow from our 
strong foundations and deliver 
increased value to the Group.

Looking forward, we will focus on 
championing advice and advisers - 
supporting individuals to meet their life 
goals and have a more financially 
secure future.

Our strategy includes growing our 
Advice offering, with over 450 advisers 
today, and broadening our national 
distribution footprint. We will leverage 
the benefits of our Group model to 
deliver market-leading offerings to 
customers, as well as flows to Life and 
Asset Management.

“
We want to reach more clients in more 
places, and we want them to be able to trust 
us with their savings and investments. 
This is behind our new purpose: give everyone 
real confidence to put their money to work.”

Asset Management

Life

Wealth

Our Asset Management business 
manages over £313.5 billion of assets 
on behalf of our Life and Wealth 
businesses and over 900 third-party 
institutional clients.

We are an international asset manager, 
focused on active management across 
public and private markets. The 
business is underpinned by deep and 
broad investment expertise across 
both fund management and extensive 
in-house research capabilities. 

Within public markets, we focus on 
value-add equity and multi-strategy 
investment and within Fixed Income, 
M&G is recognised as one of Europe’s 
leading investors. 

Our private markets business 
encompasses capabilities across 
Private and Structured Credit, Private 
Equity, Impact, Infrastructure and Real 
Estate. With assets of almost £75 
billion, M&G is one of the largest 
private market investors in Europe, and 
among the top 10 globally. 

Our Life business operates in the 
savings and pensions market, serving 
over four million clients, providing: 

– Corporate risk solutions, including 
Bulk Purchase Annuities and our 
workplace pension book. 

– Individual life and pensions solutions, 
including Retirement Account, our 
flexible individual pension product 
and onshore bonds which both offer 
PruFund as an investment option, 
and our legacy with-profits policies. 

– International life solutions, including 
our offshore bonds sold via our Irish 
business and Future + which 
provides access to PruFund-like 
solutions adapted for markets 
outside the UK. 

With the powerful combination of the 
shareholder balance sheet and the 
With-Profits Fund, our Life business 
has the opportunity to develop new 
and compelling solutions for individual 
and corporate clients. It is well placed 
to work together with our Asset 
Management business to respond to 
clients demand for smoothed 
investment returns and multi-asset 
investment solutions. 

Our Wealth business has over 
450 advisers and over 54,000 customers 
receiving ongoing advice, making us one 
of the top five advice businesses in 
the UK. 

We have a significant opportunity 
to support more people by providing 
advice to help them understand and 
plan for their futures: from planning 
for their children's education, to advice 
at retirement. We have a market-
leading national distribution footprint, 
and collaborate with external advisers 
to support the success of their 
businesses and help them deliver 
for their clients. 

Our teams in Advice and Distribution 
give access to our investment 
solutions, which we develop in 
partnership with Life and Asset 
Management, including our best-
selling PruFund, and our retail multi-
asset solutions such as Model Portfolio 
Service. We also provide technical 
support to advisers.

Asset Management

Widening access to market opportunities

Once a niche asset class, the private debt 
market is expected to hit US$2.8 trillion 
by 2028. Yet access to private corporate 
debt can be difficult, particularly for small 
or non-institutional investors, as it 
requires embedded relationships and 
specialist market participants to source 
and access opportunities.

Launched in October 2023, the strategy 
targets opportunities in private credit 
and is managed by M&G’s Private 
Credit team. It launched with a 
c.€600 million investment from the 
With-Profits Fund and targeted returns 
of Euribor +5%–6% are underpinned 
by floating rate income. 

The M&G Corporate Credit Opportunities 
European Long-Term Investment Fund 
aims to enable wider access to private 
debt instruments for investors seeking 
attractive returns, appropriate liquidity 
and the scope to respond flexibly to 
changing market conditions. 

M&G has a distinguished track record in 
private corporate lending. With the support 
of the With-Profits Fund, M&G was one of 
the first non-bank investors in Europe when 
we began investing in loans in 1999. Today 
we manage more than €9 billion in 
leveraged finance and direct private 
lending, including innovative structural 
solutions, for a wide range of clients.

Wealth

Advice that meets different client needs
As part of our purpose to give 
everyone real confidence to put their 
money to work, our advisers in Wealth 
help clients access a variety of financial 
products and services that match their 
needs. We are also doing more to 
ensure clients have access to advice 
that works for them. 

Our advisers recommended the M&G 
Wealth Passive range for all his 
investments, which suited his risk 
appetite and individual circumstances, 
gave him improved tracking, and used 
his ISA allowance. He is pleased with 
how his investments are now set up and 
he is now looking to the future with 
more clarity.

For example, a client approached M&G 
to review a bond he had held for 
10 years, as he was unhappy with its 
performance to date, charges and the 
lack of easy access to track it. He was in 
the ‘accumulation’ phase of his life and 
planning to start a family soon, but he 
had little to no long-term planning in 
place and needed assistance to help 
him plan for the future. 

We also work with clients who have 
specific requests, for example around 
investing in sustainability. We worked 
with a widowed client, age 75, who 
needed to simplify her investments. 
She has strong environmental beliefs 
and was looking for growth in her 
investments. We worked closely with 
our client to understand her needs and

consolidate her ISAs and pension onto 
our platform. She also invested in trusts 
for inheritance tax planning, and is 
delighted that her investments are now 
delivering towards a sustainable future, 
as well as helping her loved ones by 
thinking about the financial legacy she 
is looking to leave.

Meeting our Consumer 
Duty responsibilities
The Financial Conduct Authority’s new 
Consumer Duty rules set higher 
expectations for standards of care that 
firms across the financial services 
industry give to consumers in retail 
financial markets. We have established 
'Our M&G' outcomes to align with the 
Consumer Duty outcomes, ensuring we 
stay focused on delivering great client 
outcomes.

Delivering our M&G customer outcomes 
is central to our culture and activities. 
To support their delivery, we have 
established a new M&G Customer 
Committee, and our Life and Wealth 
businesses continue to run their own 
forums which provide oversight of the 
delivery of good customer outcomes.

Our enhanced monitoring and analysis 
of client outcomes includes reviewing 
investment performance, customer 
journeys and product value for money. 
We also survey clients about their 
expectations and experience, which 
allows us identify and act to fix client 
pain-points.

M&G outcome

Consumer Duty outcome

I trust M&G to help 
me achieve my 
financial goals so 
I can live the life 
I want

Price and value: Consumers pay a price for products and 
services that represent fair value (prices and quality). Poor 
value products and services are removed from markets, 
leading to fewer upheld complaints about poor value, 
unexpected fees or charges.

I have the 
right solution 
for my needs

Products and service: Consumers are sold and receive 
products and services that have been designed to meet their:
– needs
– characteristics
– objectives (fit for purpose)

I'm confident 
I can make an 
informed decision 
thanks to the help 
and support given 
to me

Consumer understanding: Customer service should enable 
consumers to realise the benefits of the products and 
services they buy and ensure they are supported when they 
want to pursue their financial objectives. Firms must monitor 
the quality of their support and act promptly where there’s 
evidence they are falling short.

I find it easy to 
deal with M&G 
and I feel valued 
in my relationship 
with them

Consumer support: support customers’ understanding 
through communications that:
– are tested, monitored and adapted to meet information 

needs and are likely to be understood

– equip timely, informed decisions 
– are tailored to intended recipients, having considered 

vulnerabilities, product complexity and the channel used

Life

Creating great client outcomes 
in corporate pensions
Our Life business manages several 
thousand corporate pension schemes, 
with more than 400,000 members and 
around £11.7 billion of funds under 
management. We look after these 
schemes on behalf of a number of 
different public and private sector 
organisations.

“For our clients, their pension scheme 
is a critical part of their compensation 
and benefit package for their 
employees so it’s really important that 
we work hand-in-hand with them to 
ensure that the pension scheme we 
provide is giving the service and 
outcome that’s expected and 
required,” explains Alastair Hogg, Head 
of Corporate Pensions at M&G.

Our clients are pension fund trustees, 
employers and benefit consultancies. 
We support our clients to meet their 
regulatory duties, providing a pension 
scheme that offers value for money to 
their clients. We make sure our clients 
are aware of any product and 
proposition changes, including the 
funds the schemes are investing in and 
support with technical administration 
queries or investment reporting.

Our long-term drivers

Changing client needs

Global sustainability challenges Savings and advice gap

The rise of digitisation is transforming 
client expectations, with demand for 
low-cost, seamless and real-time 
service from providers. Broader 
availability of data is also fuelling the 
need for better analytics and use of 
technology to develop solutions with 
better fit and customisation.

Massive investment is required in 
response to global challenges such as 
climate change and nature loss, and to 
ensure safe, sustainable energy 
sources, food and infrastructure.

Across most major markets, people are 
at risk of making insufficient financial 
preparations for their future, including in 
retirement. The options available to 
individuals are often complex and 
confusing, with poor access to advice to 
help them make the right decisions.

Opportunity

Opportunity

Opportunity

Although investment fees have been 
under pressure for many years and 
technology spend continues to rise, 
data-driven providers with digital and 
AI capabilities are well-placed to attract 
and retain clients through better service 
and more relevant products.

The financial sector is central to funding 
companies and initiatives that will 
accelerate the shift to a more 
sustainable economy, and will help 
companies to advance their own 
transition.

There is increasing appetite for access 
to assets that offer higher and 
diversified returns - both within and 
outside traditional asset classes.

By providing advice to individuals, 
providers can better understand their 
needs and design propositions that suit 
financial goals.

As part of our focus on simplifying our 
business, we aim to improve the digital 
experience we offer our clients, making 
it easier for them to deal with us. We are 
also using data to engage with our

personal needs.

We are continuing to develop our 
approach to sustainability, both in how 
we run our business and in the way we 
manage assets for our clients, while 
building our expertise in sustainable 
and impact investment.

M&G has a broad range of savings and

Europe’s leading investors in private 
assets. 

Through our Wealth business, we

increase the range of propositions 
available for their clients’ requirements.

Near-term considerations

Individuals and institutions are currently facing multiple pressures and uncertain conditions, with growing geopolitical tensions, 
higher interest rates, volatile markets and rising costs. While these factors are impacting short-term demand for savings and 
investments, with negative industry flows of €173.5 billion for European actively managed funds in 2023, they also create 
opportunities for providers that can create new propositions and deliver performance that meets changing client needs.

Building on our competitive advantage

to shape a strong, focused business with a clear purpose

can depend on us, while 
rewarding shareholders.

our
business
Becoming more nimble 
and efficient in how we work 
to best serve our clients.

Deliver

growth
Building on our strengths 
to better anticipate and 
address our clients’ needs.

We offer a broad and distinctive set of savings and investment propositions across Asset Management, Life and Wealth. 
The three pillars of our strategy are centred on our new purpose: to give everyone real confidence to put their money to work. 

The strength of our differentiated business model is helping us to deliver our strategy. By combining our deep understanding of 
client needs, international footprint, compelling products and services, investment capabilities and expertise, we are transforming 
M&G, delivering good operational and financial performance, and targeting superior client outcomes.

Our ability to generate long-term value is also dependent on how we address environmental and social issues through 
the investments we make on behalf of our clients, as well as our business operations.

Maintain our 
financial strength

Our financial strength is critical. 
It gives real confidence to our 
clients and shareholders that we 
are the right partner for them. 
We help our clients put their 
money to work and achieve their 
financial goals. For shareholders, 
we carefully allocate capital to 
invest in high-potential growth 
opportunities and reward them 
with attractive, dependable 
dividends.

Our priorities:

– Proactively manage our financial 

position

– Maintain a disciplined approach 

to capital allocation

– Grow and diversify revenue 

In 2024, we will continue the 
conservative management of our 
financial resources in line with our capital 
management framework. We plan to 
grow and diversify revenue by focusing 
on opportunities in Asset Management 
through new fund launches and 
expansion of international distribution, 
and in Life through further participation 
in the UK pensions de-risking market.

We have a well-capitalised balance 
sheet, supported by predictable and 
dependable capital generation from our 
Life business, and our diversified sources 
of earnings.

The Shareholder Solvency II ratio is 
our primary measure of balance 
sheet strength, and remains above our 
long-term target range at 203% as at 
31 December 2023.

We have also delivered a significant 
improvement in operating capital 
generation in 2023 and we have 
delivered 73% of our three-year target of 
£2.5 billion within the first two years.

Making a difference

Investing in clean energy solutions
In 2023, Infracapital successfully closed 
its largest ever co-investment process 
into Infracapital Greenfield Partners II 
investment Zenobē. 

Zenobē provides innovative battery 
solutions; capturing renewable energy, 
balancing its supply on the grid and 
transporting it to electric fleets across 
the country. 

Since Infracapital’s initial investment in 
2020, Zenobē has grown to establish 
itself as being at the forefront of two 
increasingly important industries.

Zenobē currently supports c.1,000 
electric vehicles worldwide and has 
worked with operators to deploy 
vehicles in over 75 depots. By 2026, 
Zenobē aims to support 4,000 electric 
buses, trucks and commercial vehicles 
on the road. 

The company also has 430MW of 
contracted grid-scale battery storage 
in the UK in operation or under 
construction, including its landmark 
100MW battery storage asset, at 
Capenhurst, Cheshire, which is critical 
for facilitating the growth of renewable 
energy on the national grid.

Simplify
our business

We are transforming the way in 
which we operate, so that we can 
better serve our clients and deliver 
our growth strategy more 
efficiently. We want to unlock 
M&G's potential by enabling our 
colleagues and business partners 
to work together more effectively, 
and improve the way we engage 
with clients. By doing this, we can 
find the right solutions for their 
needs more quickly.

Our priorities:

– Streamline our organisation

– Digitise and automate

– Modernise our technology estate 

Our transformation programme will 
deliver a more efficient and responsive 
organisation, a stronger control 
environment and £200 million in cost 
savings (gross of inflation). The rollout of 
our new target operating model is well 
advanced, we have strengthened our 
Executive team with dedicated 
leadership for each of our three business 
segments, and have delivered savings of 
£73 million by the end of 2023.

In 2023, we migrated nearly two million 
more life policies to our modern 
administration platform, enabling us to 
decommission old IT systems, improve 
service to clients and reduce costs. 

We will continue to simplify and 
automate processes, so we can better 
respond to client needs.

In Asset Management, we have improved 
our processes and adopted new 
workflow tools to enhance how we 
engage with clients, leading to quicker 
activation of new business and 
significantly faster responses to queries.

Our Life and Wealth businesses remain 
focused on delivering improvements in 
client service and experience so we are 
simpler and easier to engage with.

We have also continued to strengthen 
our Group Sustainability Governance 
model, improving collaboration, controls 
and decision-making. Our new Chief 
Sustainability Officer has a long track-
record of advancing sustainable 
practices and brings renewed focus to 
this core area of our business.

Our differentiated business model

Asset Management, Life and

advantage as we develop solutions 
and deliver outcomes for our 
clients and advisers, and helps us 
unlock the growth potential of a 
combined M&G.

Our priorities:

– Grow external flows in Asset 

Management

– Expand our Life solutions by 

leveraging the strength of the 
With-Profits Fund

– Develop our Wealth distribution 
footprint to provide more advice 
to more clients

Asset Management

During 2023, we have continued to 
build out our investment capabilities, 
onboarding the Asia fixed income 
team in Singapore and hiring a new 
Chief Investment Officer for Private 
Markets. We have simplified the 
business, by reorganising our Private 
Markets investment division into six 
centres of excellence, and 
strengthened our institutional sales 
structure to better engage with our 
clients based on their needs, across 
all asset classes.

Investment performance has seen 
steady improvement, with 64% of 
wholesale funds above median over 3 
years, compared to just 20% in 2020, 
resulting in much improved net flows 
from wholesale partners across a 
wide range of fund strategies.

We have expanded our distribution 
reach to accelerate the growth of our 
international earnings. We have built 
up our institutional client teams in 
Europe, hired new leadership in Asia 
and secured new authorisations to 
serve wholesale markets in 
Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea. 
We are also actively building new 
relationships in the Middle East.

In 2024, we will continue to expand our 
investment expertise and distribution, 
while streamlining and digitising our 
processes to better serve our clients and 
reduce costs:

– Individual: Working with our Wealth 
colleagues, we aim to develop new 
innovative products that reflect the 
evolving needs of our clients and 
changes in economic conditions.

With most of our policies on modern 
systems by mid-2024, we will be in a 
better position to serve our clients, 
connecting them with the services and 
advice we offer through our Wealth 
business, so our clients have confidence 
in how they choose to accumulate their 
savings and use them in retirement.

Wealth

In 2023, we have continued to build our 
foundations to accelerate our growth 
and deliver against our priorities.

– Continued to develop and grow the 

M&G Wealth Advice Academy – with 
166 Academy trainees as at the end of 
2023, compared to 53 in 2022

– Focused on improvements to our 
service to clients and advisers, 
including enhanced service over tax 
year end and a major update to our 
digital platform solution

– Delivered increased volumes of advice 
to UK customers through our Wealth 
offering, as well as by working with 
external advisers

During the year, we have seen an 
increase in PruFund sales, supported, in 
part, by making PruFund available via our 
digital platform for the first time. Service 
remains a key focus to remove barriers 
for advisers to deal with us and to access 
our full range of services and 
propositions for their clients.

As we move forward, the ambition of 
Wealth is to serve as many of those 
clients as possible, in line with our 
purpose to give everyone real confidence 
to put their money to work. 

– Broaden our offering in private assets, 
increasing origination outside the UK 
and widening access to the investment 
strategies deployed in our Life 
business

– Expand our public assets solutions, such 
as building up our global fixed income 
offering and launching thematic equity 
funds focused on innovation

– Provide clients with the opportunity to 
invest in solutions that aim to support 
positive real-world outcomes

– Build distribution and scale in Asian 

markets, focusing on Hong Kong, Japan, 
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan

Life

During 2023 we have repositioned the 
Life business for growth, we have 
continued to improve how we serve our 
clients, and have reduced business 
complexity.

– Corporate: We have re-entered the 

bulk purchase annuity market with two 
deals in 2023 totalling £0.6 billion and 
are building a solid pipeline of 
opportunities

– Individual: PruFund has added another 

year of dependable, resilient 
performance for policyholders 
resulting in a cumulative five year 
return of 30.4% in 2023 compared to 
16.1% for the ABI benchmark fundi
From 2024, we aim to use our scale and 
expertise to capture the material growth 
potential in the Life business, designing 
innovative propositions that draw on our 
financial strength and ability to take risk 
on behalf of our clients.

– Corporate: We will take a selective 
approach to Bulk Purchase Annuity 
transactions, focusing on cases where 
our capabilities in private assets can 
make a material difference to clients, 
and aim to roll out bespoke capital-
light de-risking solutions for certain 
pension schemes.

Capital generation is an integral financial 
metric that measures the change in surplus 
capital during the period, before dividends 
and capital movements.

Operating capital generation demonstrates 
the longer-term view of the movements in our 
surplus capital. It is less affected by short-
term volatility than total capital generation. 

The shareholder view of the Solvency II 
coverage ratio provides a more relevant 
reflection of our capital strength than the 
regulatory Solvency II coverage ratio.

Capital generation has increased from 2022, 
reflecting improved market movements and 
strong operating performance. 

Operating capital generation has increased as 
a result of a strong underlying result and 
benefits from management actions. 

A reduction in capital requirements from 
beneficial management actions has 
contributed to an increase in solvency ratio.

A message from our Chief Financial Officer

Our financial performance in 2023 demonstrates the strength 
of our business model in a challenging macroeconomic environment 

I’m delighted to present our 2023 results 
which continue to demonstrate the 
strengths of our business model and the 
progress we are driving as we focus on 
our three strategic pillars.

Wholesale Asset Management net client 
inflows of £1.5 billion (2022: £0.5 billion), 
continued the positive momentum in the 
business despite adverse market 
conditions.

Our Institutional business saw net client 
outflows of £0.7 billion (2022: £0.7 billion) 
driven by the continuing market volatility 
and redemptions following the 
September 2022 mini-budget in the UK. 
Despite these domestic headwinds, we 
continued to expand internationally, 
particularly in Europe.

Strong gross inflows of £7.0 billion led to 
net client inflows of £1.0 billion in our 
PruFund investment solution. In addition, 
our re-entry to the bulk purchase annuity 
market delivered £0.6 billion net inflows 
from two transactions announced in 
September in our Life business. 

Total AUMA increased to £343.5 billion 
(2022: £342.0 billion), predominantly as a 
result of positive market movements on 
asset valuations which are offset by the 
expected outflows from our annuities 
and traditional with-profits businesses 
and a weakening of foreign currency-
denominated assets.

Our 2023 IFRS result after tax shows a 
significant improvement on 2022; profit 
after tax attributable to equity holders for 
the year of £309 million (2022: 
£2,055 million loss). 

Yields did not increase as meaningfully 
this year as we saw in 2022, resulting in 
lower fair value losses on the surplus 
assets in the annuity portfolio and a small 
fair value gain on the interest rate 
hedging we have in place to protect 
our Solvency II capital position. 

Adjusted operating profit before tax was 
£797 million, up 28% on 2022 
(£625 million) driven by strong results, 
across both our with-profits business 
and annuities, primarily as a result of the 
increase in risk-free rates during 2022 
offset by Asset Management adjusted 
operating profit being modestly down on 
2022 and higher losses in our Platform 
and Advice business. The Corporate 
Centre benefitted from higher treasury 
income.

Operating Change in CSM, introduced 
on the adoption of IFRS 17 gives a wider 
representation of the drivers of 
performance by including the impact 
of new business and management 
actions, increased to £355 million 
(2022: £129 million).

Underlying capital generation improved 
by 20% to £752 million (2022: 
£628 million), which together with 
other operating results of £244 million 
(2022: £193 million) primarily caused by 
asset trading and optimisation in the 
With-Profits Fund, delivered a strong 
operating capital generation of 
£996 million (2022: £821 million). 
This means we are now at 73% of the 
£2.5 billion cumulative target by 2024, 
two years into the three year period. 

“
Our results 
underscore our 
continued focus 
on financial 
and operational 
discipline.”

Total capital generation of £358 million 
was offset by the payment of our 
dividends however, our shareholder 
Solvency II coverage ratio increased to 
203% (2022: 199%) as a result of the 
Solvency Capital Requirement also 
reducing due to benefits from 
management actions.

We have made a strong start to the 
targeted cost savings of £200 million by 
2025, and are taking action to reduce our 
core asset management cost/income 
ratio to below 70% by 2025 and to 
reduce our leverage ratio to below 30% 
by 2025. We are also still targeting Asset 
Management and Wealth adjusted 
operating profit before tax to be over 
50% of the Group total excluding 
Corporate Centre by the end of 2025. 

We paid an interim ordinary dividend of 
£152 million equal to 6.5 pence per share 
on 3 November 2023. A second interim 
dividend of £311 million equal to 
13.2 pence per share will be paid on 
9 May 2024, which means 19.7 pence 
per share of total dividends were paid 
to shareholders in relation to 2023.

As we look to 2024 we are confident 
about the momentum in our business 
and the resilience of our diversified 
model. In 2024 we are expecting some 
headwinds to the Group’s adjusted 
operating profit before tax due to market 
conditions in 2023 and the impact of 
strengthening persistency assumptions 
in 2023. This is due to the revised 
adjusted operating profit methodology 
following the adoption of IFRS 17 being 
applied for Life and Wealth. The revised 
methodology reflects the opening value 
of the CSM, its amortisation rate and the 
expected real world return based on 
risk-free rates and expected market risk 
premiums at the start of the year.

I am pleased with these results in the 
face of continuing economic and 
geopolitical challenges and also the 
successful publication of both our 
interim and full-year results under IFRS 
17, concluding what was significant 
activity and change for our business 
and the insurance industry as a whole.

Adjusted operating profit before tax
The following table shows adjusted operating profit before tax split by segment. Results for the comparative period have been 
marked as restated to reflect the retrospective application of IFRS 17, ‘Insurance Contracts’ and IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ 
from 1 January 2023, as outlined in Note 1.2.1. Additionally, our operating segments have been revised in the year to reflect the 
change in management structure; our previous segment Retail and Savings has been replaced with two new operating segments, 
Life and Wealth, while our Asset Management segment remains unchanged.

Adjusted operating profit before tax increased to £797 million in the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: £625 million) driven 
by an increase in adjusted operating profit from Life and a reduction in the losses from the Corporate Centre. 

In Asset Management, revenues and costs were impacted by responsAbility, our Swiss-based team who specialise in impact 
investing that we acquired in May 2022. Revenues earned were £995 million (2022: £995 million) and operating costs were 
£791 million (2022: £763 million) of which £42 million (2022: £23 million) and £38 million (2022: £22 million), respectively, relate to 
responsAbility. Removing the impact of responsAbility, revenue earned was down by 2%, in line with average AUMA, and costs 
increased by 1.6%, which is below inflation and demonstrates our continued focus on cost discipline. These movements in revenue 
and costs lead to a fall in adjusted operating profit before tax to £242 million (2022: £264 million). 

The improvement in yields during 2022 has driven the increase in Life adjusted operating profit by £126m to £586m (2022: £460m). 
The opening CSM value for the traditional with-profits business at the start of 2023 was higher than 2022 leading to a larger 
amount being released to profit in 2023. The expected return on surplus assets in the annuity portfolio also increased. The higher 
CSM release and return on annuity surplus assets have been partially offset by a decrease in the impact of asset trading in the 
annuity portfolio. 

Wealth adjusted operating profit before tax has increased by £22 million to £180 million (2022: £158 million), following an 
improvement in the adjusted operating profit from the PruFund UK business which has been partially offset by an increase in the 
loss from Platform and Advice business due to inflationary pressures on costs. Adjusted operating profit from the PruFund UK 
business has benefited from the improvement in yields during 2022, similar to Life traditional with-profits business. 

The Corporate Centre has benefited from an increased investment return from our treasury function, of £57 million 
(2022: £13 million) as a result of higher interest rates.

IFRS result after tax
The IFRS result after tax attributable to equity holders is a profit of £309 million compared to a £2,055 million loss for the year 
ended 31 December 2022. The favourable movement reflects a reduction in losses from short-term fluctuations in investment 
returns to £171 million loss in the period (2022: £2,858 million loss). 

Market conditions have led to lower losses from short-term fluctuations in investment returns in the current period with the impact 
of rising rates for the year ended 31 December 2023 not being as significant as the year to 31 December 2022. The overall losses 
primarily comprise of a £4 million gain (2022: £989 million loss) on interest rate swaps purchased to protect PAC's Solvency II 
capital position against falls in interest rates and £159 million loss (2022: £1,301 million loss) from the difference in actual and 
expected long-term investment return on surplus assets backing the annuity portfolio, both of which have significantly improved 
due to the smaller increase in yields in 2023 compared to 2022. There were also losses of £123 million (2022: £104 million gain) on 
the hedging instruments held to protect the Solvency II capital position from falling equity markets, which moved to a loss as a 
result of increases in equity markets. 

In the year ended 31 December 2023, restructuring costs and other of £141 million mainly relate to costs to transform our 
operations of £73 million, £30 million of investment spend in building out capability in our Asset Management business and 
£19 million for the continuing development of the M&G Wealth platform business. This compares to £147 million of restructuring 
costs for the year ended 31 December 2022.

The equity holders tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2023 was £112 million (2022: tax benefit of £585 million) 
representing an effective tax rate of 26.6% (2022: 17.8%). Excluding non-recurring items, the equity holders' effective tax rate was 
28.7% (2022: 28.7%). The equity holders' effective tax rate of 26.6% (2022: 22.2%) was higher than the UK statutory rate of 23.5% 
(2022: 19.0%) primarily due to the adverse impact of deductions not allowable for tax purposes.

Operating change in Contractual Service Margin (CSM)
Operating change in CSM is a new alternative performance measure introduced on the adoption of IFRS 17 and supplements the 
adjusted operating profit metric for the Life and Wealth segments. It represents the change in CSM during the period resulting 
from new business, interest accretion, experience changes and release of CSM to adjusted operating profit but excludes the 
impact of short-term fluctuations in investment return and accounting mismatches arising on the adoption of IFRS 17.

Operating change in CSM increased to £355 million in the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: £129 million), driven by higher 
expected real-world return on the CSM from with-profits business. 

In Life, operating change in CSM increased to £125 million (2022: £75 million) primarily due to an increased contribution from 
traditional with-profits business of £67 million from £23 million in 2022. Shareholder annuities operating change in CSM of £36m 
(2022: £35 million) remained stable year on year with an increased contribution from new business of £42 million (2022: £6 million) 
due to the two bulk purchase annuity transactions in September 2023, offset by a reduction in the impact of assumption changes 
and variances to £60 million (2022: £94 million) mainly due to a lower benefit from longevity assumption changes.

Wealth operating change in CSM relates to PruFund UK business and increased by £176 million to £230 million (2022: £54 million). 
The expected real-world return on the CSM for PruFund business of £330 million (2022: £186 million) more than offset the CSM 
released to adjusted operating profit of £231 million (2022: £154 million). In addition, there was a higher contribution from new 
business of £94 million (2022: £18 million) to the operating change in CSM, due to increased gross client inflows to PruFund 
during 2023 combined with the increase in yields over 2022.

Total capital generation was £358 million for the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: negative £397 million), reflecting higher 
operating capital generation and an improved result from market movements, partially offset by the impact of the eligible own 
funds restriction. There are limits, prescribed by the regulator, on the amount of different types of own funds that can be used to 
demonstrate solvency. As at 31 December 2023, the sum of capital classed as Tier 2 and Tier 3 exceeds 50% of the regulatory 
Group Solvency Capital Requirement by £216 million. While this capital remains available to the Group, as it is above this regulatory 
threshold own funds must be restricted by this amount to determine eligible own funds. 

Underlying capital generation increased to £752 million (2022: £628 million). The increase is driven mainly by the higher expected 
return on the annuity surplus assets and the present value of shareholder transfers in respect of with-profits business following the 
rise in interest rates over 2022.

The increase in other operating capital generation in the year ended 31 December 2023 to £244 million (2022: £193 million) mainly 
reflects benefits from asset trading and optimisation, in particular a £225 million capital benefit from an update to the strategic 
asset allocation for the With-Profits Fund. There was a further benefit from updates made to the capital model to capture the 
economic impacts of COVID-19 and the invasion of Ukraine and also to reflect increased interest rate and inflation volatility. These 
benefits were partly offset by the impact of reducing the level of equity hedging in place in the With-Profits Fund. 

Market movements over 2023 have resulted in a negative impact of £507 million (2022: negative £1,225 million). Although equity 
markets have improved, returns on the With-Profits Fund were lower than expected, and credit has already been taken for the 
expected return in underlying capital generation. The negative market movements are driven by a loss of £321 million (2022: 
positive £454 million) arising from a fall in the present value of shareholder transfers less equity hedges, and a loss on the value of 
surplus assets in the annuity portfolio of £93 million (2022: £1,602 million loss). Other market impacts include a gain on interest rate 
swaps, designed to protect the Solvency II capital position in a falling interest rate environment, of £4 million (2022: £989 million 
loss). Contributing to the negative impact, the movement in Solvency Capital Requirements attributable to market movements is an 
increase of £90 million compared to a reduction of £1,034 million in 2022. The large fall in Solvency Capital Requirement over 2022 
was driven by the increase in interest rates, which materially decreased longevity risk capital; following the reduction in interest 
rates over 2023, this benefit has not been repeated.

Market movements include a negative impact of £264 million in respect of the UK Government's consultation on ground rents. This 
impact reflects a ratings downgrade to all impacted notes from AA- to A+ and an increase in the illiquidity premium used in the 
valuation of these assets to allow for the additional uncertainty in the cashflows arising from legislative risk partially offset by a 
reduction in technical provisions, together with an increase in the SCR to reflect the possible outcomes set out in the consultation. 
We have been engaging with the UK Government on this consultation and are fully supportive of the government’s objective to 
strengthen leaseholder protection. Together with our peers, we have proposed a solution to achieve such a goal while preserving 
residential ground rents as an investable asset class for pension funds and the wider investment community. We remain hopeful of 
a solution that works for all parties.

The impact of restructuring costs and other movements of £49 million (2022: £(166) million) includes the impact on the capital 
position of restructuring costs. These costs are offset by a c.£177 million benefit from the impact of the Solvency II reforms, 
comprising a reduction in the Solvency II risk margin and the removal of a restriction that applied in relation to transition from 
Solvency I to Solvency II.

Capital position
The Group's shareholder Solvency II coverage ratio increased to 203% (2022: 199%). However, Solvency II surplus decreased to 
£4.5 billion as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £4.6 billion), driven by a reduction in eligible own funds. Although capital generation, net 
of the eligible own funds restriction, was positive £358 million, this was offset by the payment of £462 million in dividends to 
shareholders. The solvency ratio increased as the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) also reduced, driven by benefits from 
management actions including asset trading and optimisation. 

Our With-Profits Fund continues to have a strong Solvency II coverage ratio of 403%, increased from the 362% reported at 
31 December 2022. Surplus increased as a result of strong underlying capital generation from in-force business and positive 
impacts from market movements and management actions, as well as the Solvency II reforms to the risk margin and transitional 
measures on technical provisions. This was partially offset by the impact of the distribution of c.£1 billion of excess surplus to 
policyholders.

The regulatory Solvency II coverage ratio of the Group as at 31 December 2023 was 167% (2022: 164%). This view of solvency 
combines the shareholder position and the With-Profits Fund, but excludes all surplus within the With-Profits Fund.

Capital Management Framework
The primary focus of our capital management framework is to maintain financial strength and reward shareholders with 
attractive returns. This is achieved through actively managing M&G’s solvency position and the quality of capital held.

When deploying additional capital, we prioritise investments that can generate long-term sustainable earnings growth. Any 
investment is always measured against the financial attractiveness of capital returns, as well as our Risk Appetite Framework.

In previous periods we disclosed cash and liquid assets for the Parent Company only. These periods have been restated to include the Group's other 
holding companies (M&G Group Regulated Entity Holding Company Limited and M&G Corporate Holdings Limited) as we believe it provides a more 
meaningful and representative disclosure.

Closing cash and liquid assets at 31 December 2023 included a £940 million (2022: £950 million) inter-company loan asset with Prudential Capital plc, 
which acts as the Group's treasury function.

Movements in cash and liquid assets held by the holding companies for the year ended 31 December 2023 represent the dividends 
and payments that will arise in the normal course of business. Total cash and liquid assets have decreased slightly over 2023 with 
dividend payments to equity holders of £462 million (2022: £465 million) and interest paid on structural borrowings of £189 million 
(2022: £190 million) mostly offset by cash remittances from our subsidiaries. During 2023, £66 million was injected into subsidiaries 
including £60 million funding to Wealth business subsidiaries. In 2022, £221 million was used to fund acquisitions and inject capital, 
including the acquisition of Sandringham and M&G Wealth Investments LLP and our partnership with Moneyfarm.

£14.1 billion (2022: £12.7 billion) of total Asset Management AUMA relates to assets under advice. 

Wholesale Asset Management had net client inflows for the second year running, of £1.5 billion (2022: £0.5 billion) continuing the 
positive momentum in this business, despite the adverse market conditions.

Over three and five years our performance remains strong or has strengthened with 64% of our Wholesale funds ranked in the 
upper performance quartiles over three years (2022: 67%), and 69% ranked in the upper performance quartiles over five years 
(2022: 60%). However, our Wholesale funds performance over one year has reduced relative to the previous year, with 51% of our 
Wholesale funds ranked in the upper performance quartiles over one year (2022: 68%).

Much of the growth within Wholesale Asset Management has come from the UK, where we have attracted net client inflows of 
£1.5 billion, reflecting the continuing execution of our strategy, which is focused on deepening our relationships with key wealth 
managers and intermediaries, in addition to a strong equity performance. Continuing economic uncertainty, market volatility and 
International channel assets not performing as strongly meant the growth in the UK was offset by net client inflows in other parts of 
our Wholesale business. 

Wholesale assets under management and administration (AUMA) increased by £1.1 billion to £55.0 billion driven by the net client 
inflows. This was partly offset by negative market and other movements of £0.4 billion in 2023, in particular due to the weakening 
of foreign currency-denominated AUMA, notably South African Rand, during 2023.

Net client outflows of £0.7 billion (2022: £0.7 billion) in our Institutional Asset Management business reflects the continuing impact 
of the significant market volatility in the UK in 2022, with redemptions triggered following September 2022’s mini-budget leading to 
net client outflows of £3.5 billion during 2023. This was partially offset by £0.8 billion related to a large mandate win in Switzerland 
(Swiss Investment Fund for Emerging Markets), with the remainder primarily due to net client inflows within our Real Estate 
business. 

Our expertise in private assets, which offers private fixed income, alternatives, real estate and infrastructure equity offerings, is a 
key component of our Institutional investment capability, and represents a resilient, high-margin source of revenues. Our private 
assets under management reduced by 4% to £73.4 billion of AUMA as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £76.6 billion) owing to negative 
market and other movements.

£309 million of the fee-based revenue is in respect of assets managed on behalf of Life and Wealth (2022: £306 million).

Asset Management adjusted operating profit before tax decreased 8% to £242 million in the year ended 31 December 2023 
(2022: £264 million) with improved investment return partly offsetting increased expenses.

Revenue earned by Institutional Asset Management was £588 million (2022: £598 million) and includes £42 million 
(2022: £23 million) from responsAbility, our Swiss-based team specialising in impact investing which was acquired in May 2022. 
The reduction in revenue is primarily due to lower fees earned on public fixed income as a result of the impact of lower AUMA from 
market volatility, and the continuing impact from the mini-budget crisis in 2022. In Wholesale Asset Management, revenue 
increased marginally to £407 million (2022: £397 million) as a consequence of increased AUMA. In addition, income earned from 
performance fees and carried interest included in fee-based revenue was £30 million (2022: £56 million), reducing after the higher 
revenue related to fund performance in 2022 which was not expected to repeat.

The Asset Management average fee margin of 33bps for 2023 was up from 32bps for 2022. Average fee margins in the larger 
Institutional Asset Management business increased to 30bps (2022: 29bps), while Wholesale Asset Management fee margins 
reduced to 37bps (2022: 38bps).

Asset Management operating expenses have increased by £28 million to £791 million (2022: £763 million) with costs of £38 million 
(2022: £22 million) from responsAbility. Removing the impact of responsAbility, costs increased by only 1.6%, significantly below 
inflation, demonstrating our continued focus on cost discipline. Market pressures meant that, excluding performance fees, the 
cost/income ratio for the Asset Management business increased to 79% (2022: 77%). 

Investment return, which includes gains on seed investments, interest income on cash balances and hedges on management 
incentive schemes, improved by £29 million compared to 2022, reflecting an improvement in market conditions.

Underlying capital generation for the year ended 31 December 2023 remained stable at £246 million (2022: £246 million). 
The impact of higher costs and lower performance fee income has been offset by a reduction in the capital required to be held in 
respect of market risks, driven in part by the increased level of hedging in place.

Other operating capital generation has increased, driven primarily by the impact of an improvement in the process used to assess 
operational risk scenarios in respect of trade instruction and trade execution errors , which has resulted in a material reduction in 
the associated capital requirement. The improved investment income for 2023 relative to 2022 has also contributed to the 
increase. In 2022, other operating capital generation was negatively impacted by an increased allocation of operational risk capital 
requirements, offset elsewhere within the Group.

The Life business experienced total net client outflows of £5.7 billion (2022: £5.7 billion), as the majority of the business runs off. 
However, two bulk purchase annuity transactions in September 2023 contributed £0.6 billion (2022: £nil) gross client inflows 
following our strategic decision to re-enter the bulk purchase annuity market by taking a selective approach where our capabilities 
can make a material difference to clients and to increase our long-term capital generation. There were also net client inflows of 
£0.1 billion (2022: £0.2 billion) into PruFund by clients in Europe.

Life AUMA decreased to £100.9 billion (2022: £103.0 billion) driven by the net client outflows, partly offset by positive market and 
other movements of £3.6 billion (2022: £18.2 billion negative), reflecting movements in interest rates.

Adjusted operating profit before tax from our Life business increased to £586 million (2022: £460 million) driven by increases in 
both the with-profits business and shareholder annuities business that reflect the impact of the increase in yields in 2022.

Europe includes the results of business written by Prudential International Assurance plc. Adjusted operating profit before tax reduced to a 
£3 million loss (2022: £19 million profit) caused by an increase in the provision under an agreement to reimburse the With-Profits Fund for 
its contribution to the costs for growing the business written in Poland, driven by an increase in expected expenses and decrease in 
expected future sales. In 2022, there was a benefit from extending the term of this agreement.

The contractual service margin (CSM) for with-profits business is based on the expected value of future shareholder transfers. As a 
result of the rise in risk-free rates over 2022, the CSM at the start of 2023 is higher than at the start of 2022, and there has been 
an increase in the amount of the CSM released to adjusted operating profit to £238 million compared to £186 million for the year 
ended 31 December 2022. This represents 14.0% pa of the opening CSM attributable to the shareholder (2022: 13.2% pa). 

The expected return on the shareholders' share of excess assets in traditional with-profits has increased by £16 million to 
£35 million. As the expected rate is set at the start of the reporting period, the rise in risk-free rates over 2022 resulted in an 
increased expected rate of return from 2.4% pa for 2022, to 6.0% pa for 2023.

The shareholder annuities result has increased by £92 million to £331 million. The recurring sources of earnings from the annuity 
book are primarily the returns on surplus assets in excess of IFRS 17 insurance liabilities based on long-term expected investment 
returns and the release of the CSM. The expected return on excess assets, which is set at the start of the reporting period, has 
increased by £92 million to £205 million as a result of the rise in risk-free rates during 2022.

The release of the CSM to adjusted operating profit for shareholder annuities was £96 million compared to £89 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2022, benefiting from a higher opening CSM balance. The amount of CSM released represents 7.2% pa of the 
31 December 2023 CSM before amortisation (2022: 6.9% pa).

Asset trading and portfolio management actions reduced £39 million to £2 million due to a reduction in asset trading profits on the 
matching adjustment portfolio. The 2022 profit was primarily one-off trading profits not repeated in 2023. Other provisions and 
reserves in 2022 included a loss from a change in assumptions in relation to lifetime mortgages, not repeated in 2023.

The credit quality of fixed income assets in the annuity portfolio remained strong over 2023. 98% of the debt securities held by the 
shareholder annuity portfolio are investment grade and only 19% are BBB. In addition 80% of the shareholder annuity portfolio is 
held in debt securities either categorised as Risk Free or Secured (including cash). Rating migrations resulted in very low level of 
downgrade experience (defined as movements in BBB notching and, otherwise, letter downgrades), with c.4% of bonds in the 
portfolio being impacted.

The expected real-world return on the CSM more than offset the release of the CSM to adjusted operating profit, resulting in a net 
contribution to operating change in CSM of £71 million (2022: £71 million). The total expected rate of return on the CSM is 
determined at the start of the year and increased to 8.5% for 2023 compared to 4.8% for 2022 due to the increase in risk free rates 
over 2022. 

Assumption changes and variances of £4 million loss (2022: £48 million loss) are driven by a reduction in future investment 
management expenses for traditional with-profits business offset by the impact of changes to the strategic asset allocation for the 
With-Profits Fund and higher actual claims than expected. The driver of the 2022 loss was higher claims compared to those 
expected causing future expected shareholder transfers to be lower leading to a reduction in the CSM.

Interest accreted on the CSM at 2.3% pa in 2023 (2022: 1.9% pa) and increased by £6 million to £30 million. The interest rate is 
based on the forward curve 'locked in' at IFRS 17 transition date (1 January 2022) and as limited new business is written the interest 
applied will increase over time, moving along the upward-sloping December 2021 yield curve. 

The increase in the contribution from new business to the operating change in CSM was driven by the two bulk purchase annuity 
transactions in September 2023. 

Assumption changes and variances have fallen to £60 million (2022: £94 million). There was a large benefit in 2022 from longevity 
assumptions changes, which arose from lower expected future improvements in mortality rates, offset by an increase in short-term 
expense assumptions for project costs. In 2023, the impact of longevity assumption changes and experience variances is much 
smaller.

Traditional with-profits business generated underlying capital of £182 million in the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: 
£192 million) due to an increase in the value of shareholder transfers driven by higher yields over 2022 offset by losses on equity 
hedges. 

There also continued to be significant capital generation from the shareholder annuity and other life business, contributing 
£350 million (2022: £251 million). The underlying capital generation for annuity business has increased because the rise in yields 
over 2022 results in an increase in the expected return on surplus assets in the annuity portfolio. The bulk purchase annuity 
transactions entered into over 2023 generated a capital strain of £26 million at the date of the transaction. 

Other operating capital generation increased to £147 million (2022: £67 million), largely reflecting model updates and management 
actions including the beneficial impact of an update to the strategic asset allocation of the With-Profits Fund offset by the impact of 
reducing the level of equity hedging. Asset trading in the annuity portfolio contributed £52 million in 2023, offset by the impact of 
an update to the matching adjustment strategy. The benefit from model improvements reflects updates made to the capital model 
to fully capture the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as the increased 
volatility in inflation and interest rates. In 2022, other operating capital generation included a significant £213 million benefit from 
longevity assumption changes, which has not been repeated in 2023. 

Management actions and other has increased by £145 million to £62 million which includes the impact of non-market experience.

The losses from the Platform and Advice business increased to £32 million (2022: £24 million) driven by an increase in costs owing 
to inflation and a one-off intangible asset write-off in the first half of 2023 of £7 million. In Other Wealth, revised pricing in non-with-
profit products has led to lower revenues.

CSM has increased due to the same reasons outlined in Life, resulting in an additional £77 million released to profit compared to 
the year ended 31 December 2022. This represents 11.6% pa of the opening CSM attributable to the shareholder (2022: 10.6% pa). 
The amortisation rate for PruFund business is lower than the rate for the traditional with-profits business in Life as that business is 
more mature and is running off faster. 

The expected return on the shareholders' share of excess assets in Wealth has increased by £13 million to £34 million. The higher 
expected rate of return of 6.0% in 2023 compared to 2.4% in 2022 increased the expected return on excess assets to £42 million 
(2022: £21 million). This is partly offset by £9 million loss as a result of an arrangement entered into between the With-Profits Fund 
and the shareholder fund in the year. The nature of this transaction is a monetisation of future shareholder transfers, whereby a 
portion of these transfers will be refunded to the With-Profits-Fund in exchange for an immediate cash sum. The loss recorded 
reflects the real-world unwinding of the swap liability created. 

In Other, the year to 31 December 2023 included a £28 million loss as a result of the above arrangement; primarily a one-off due to 
the valuation difference between the real world valuation of the swap liability created relative to the IFRS 17 measurement basis. 
There is a further £15 million loss due to an increase in expected expense overrun on writing new PruFund UK business during the 
year partially offset by a reduction in risk adjustment.

The expected real-world return on the CSM for Prufund UK business more than offset the release of the CSM to adjusted operating 
profit, resulting in a net contribution to operating change in CSM of £99 million (2022: £32 million). The expected real-world rate of 
return on the CSM increased to 8.5% for 2023 compared to 4.8% for 2022 due to higher risk free rates at the start of the year. The 
opening CSM for PruFund UK business also increased due to the higher risk free rates and net client inflows. The combination of 
the higher opening CSM and expected real-world rate of return lead to the expected real-world return on CSM increasing to 
£330 million (2022: £186 million).

PruFund UK new business also contributed £94 million (2022: £18 million) to the increase in CSM over the period, the rise relative 
to 2022 is due to the material increase in yields over 2022 and the higher net client inflows.

Assumption changes and variances of £37 million (2022: £3 million) are driven by a reduction in future investment management 
expenses on PruFund UK business and an improvement in persistency.

Underlying capital generation from Wealth increased in the year ended 31 December 2023 to £163 million (2022: £155 million). 

The contribution from in-force PruFund UK business increased to £229 million (2022: £216 million) as a result of the increase in 
expected return given the rise in yields over 2022, partially offset by a reduction in the value of equity hedges. 

New business strain from the PruFund UK business has reduced to £22 million (2022: £36 million); the increase in risk-free rates 
increased the value of future expected shareholder transfers reducing the cost of writing new business. Included in 2022 was the 
release of a £15 million provision for new business expense overruns. 

Platform and Advice and Other Wealth business contributed negative capital generation, driven mainly by operating losses in 
respect of Platform and Advice business and some unit-linked business. In 2022, smaller losses in respect of Other Wealth 
business were offset by a reduction in SCR, resulting in nil net impact. 

Other operating capital generation of £82 million reflects a c.£180 million benefit from the update to the strategic asset allocation 
of the With-Profits Fund, partly offset by the reduction of the level of hedging in place in the With-Profits Fund. Non-market 
experience variances contributed a loss of £40 million compared to a gain of £61 million as at 31 December 2022.

Our approach to sustainability

Sustainability and M&G

Using our broad capabilities to drive positive real-world change 
and support the move to a more sustainable world 

Enabling real-world change
As an asset owner and asset manager, 
with strong capabilities in public and 
private markets, we’re well positioned to 
support positive environmental and 
social change.

We seek to create long-term value for 
our stakeholders by addressing the 
interconnected risks and opportunities 
presented by sustainability, both 
through the investments we manage on 
behalf of our clients and throughout our 
business operations.

During 2023, we continued to prioritise 
climate change and diversity and 
inclusion, as well as developing our 
governance structure and approach to 
sustainability, to make sure we are 
focusing and developing in the right 
areas, for our clients, people and 
communities. This includes financing 
and enabling the deployment of 
solutions and early-stage innovation 
through long-term patient capital from 
our asset owner. 

We have continued to make investments 
in private assets that contribute to a 
more sustainable economy, for example 
through our £5 billion Catalyst strategy 
and our emerging markets impact 
manager, responsAbility. In terms of 
public assets, our clients continue to 
benefit from targeted strategies offering 
exposure to sustainability themes and 
positive impact via our Planet+ range 
of funds. 

Our product offering continues to evolve, 
with the proportion of our funds 
compliant with SFDR Article 8 or 9 in our 
SICAV range increasing from 54% at the 
end of 2022 to 79% at the end of 2023.

Climate change

As a business, we are committed to 
reaching net zero emissions by 2050 
at the latest and have set interim 
decarbonisation targets for in-scope 
investments as well as for our 
business operations. 

Last year, our asset manager submitted 
a target update to the Net Zero Asset 
Managers Initiative (NZAMi), including 
a 2030 decarbonisation goal for real 
estate, aligning its commitments with 
our asset owner.

Financing climate solutions is a key 
aspect of our approach and an area 
where we see an opportunity for growth. 
Our asset manager continues to develop 
climate strategies and solutions – 
ranging from climate-related 
investments for our clients, to products 
that support the low-carbon transition. 

To improve our investment decisions 
and stewardship efforts we have 
adopted an enhanced asset manager net 
zero investment framework and 
introduced a separate, but 
complementary, climate solutions 
investment framework, to provide a 
clearer and more holistic assessment of 
transition opportunities. 

These frameworks have fed into product 
developments, including our newly 
launched Sustainable Alpha 
Opportunities Fund, which uses the net 
zero investment framework as part of its 
monitoring criteria. 

responsAbility, our emerging markets 
impact manager, achieved recognition 
during COP28 for the launch of a new 
climate-focused strategy, the Asia 
Climate Fund.

As an active investor, engagement and 
investment strategy form a critical part 
of M&G’s levers to decarbonise our 
investment portfolio. In 2023 we 
progressed the implementation of our 
asset manager’s Thermal Coal 
Investment Policy, with a focus on 
issuers in OECD/EU countries, and have 
laid the foundations for engagement 
with companies in non-OECD countries 
in 2024.

We continued to participate in a range of 
collaborative initiatives, including 
Climate Action 100+, and joined the 
newly launched Net Zero Engagement 
Initiative, as well as Nature Action 100. 
We have also supported efforts to 
improve climate and nature-related 
industry guidelines through initiatives 
such as the PRA and FCA convened 
Climate Financial Risk Forum. 

Find out more in our Climate-
related disclosures on pages 
69-90

Diversity and inclusion

As a business, we are committed to 
diversity and inclusion both within 
our workforce and across our 
investment portfolios. 

In 2023, our asset manager continued to 
engage companies on its minimum 
diversity expectations. Of the 200 
companies identified as not meeting its 
criteria in September 2022, more than 
half have made progress and over a third 
now meet these expectations.

Internally, we have targeted 40% female 
representation and 20% from Black, 
Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds 
by 2025. We actively evaluate the 
diversity policies of investment 
managers that manage assets on our 
behalf, and look at how they challenge 
investee companies to improve and 
maintain diversity.

Inclusion on pages 51-53

Risks

Sustainability presents a mosaic of risks 
and significant uncertainty, particularly 
given the complexity and scale of global 
challenges. Climate change and nature 
loss are twin drivers of a range of risks 
that can cascade and compound, 
impacting people, companies and 
economies. Mismanagement of social 
issues, such as human rights 
infringements and poor D&I practices, 
can influence our social license to 
operate and cause reputational and 
financial damage.

There are different transmission 
channels for sustainability risks for M&G, 
through the investments we manage, 
and also via our ability to attract and 
retain staff and clients – impacting our 
strategic pillars. Sustainability risks can 
also manifest in our operations and 
damage our credibility, for example if we 
are perceived to greenwash. 

We follow a three lines of defence model, 
with specific polices implemented by our 
asset manager, asset owner and second-
line risk teams (see page 47).

Opportunities

Behind the many risks posed by 
sustainability challenges, there are also 
major long-term opportunities, aligned 
with our purpose and strategy. The 
climate transition alone will require 
significant investment in solutions, to 
transform the global energy system and 
build resilience to future impacts. 

Changing client expectations and 
preferences is another strategic 
opportunity, given our strong public and 
private asset capabilities, and ability to 
cater for a wide range of needs. 
Regulatory developments such as the 
UK Sustainable Disclosure Requirements 
(SDR) should drive greater transparency 
and trust around sustainable investing, 
helping clients select strategies that are 
aligned with their priorities. 

To practice sustainability authentically 
we also need to address our direct 
impacts, through our operational 
decarbonisation and environmental 
management, as well as create a diverse 
and inclusive culture where all M&G 
employees can perform at their best.

Evolving our approach

Developing our assessment of sustainability risks and opportunities, 
to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders

In 2023, our focus has been to 
strengthen our overall sustainability 
resource and governance, which is key 
to drive further progress across 
the business.

Our first Chief Sustainability Officer, 
Kathy Ryan, joined in November and has 
a long track record in advancing 
sustainable practices across the financial 
industry through her work at the Great 
West Life Group, leading on responsible 
investment for Irish Life Investment 
Managers, and previously at 
Aviva Investors. 

Kathy brings a fresh perspective to M&G, 
and will be responsible for developing 
and implementing our Group 
sustainability strategy, including our 
strengthened governance framework.

We have also improved our committee 
oversight structures, including work to 
embed our Executive Sustainability 
Committee, and hired new expertise into 
the business, including a new Head of 
Sustainability in our asset 
management business.

We’re working to better embed 
sustainability across our business 
portfolio, continually reviewing and 
evolving our actions, including our 10-
point approach, to ensure we are 
focusing our efforts on the most material 
issues and meeting our clients' changing 
needs and preferences.

To ensure we develop in the right areas, 
we have conducted a Group-wide 
assessment of sustainability themes, 
based on discussions with a range of 
internal stakeholders. From this, we 
created a shortlist of areas mapped 
against both their potential effect on 
M&G and our impact on the issue. Areas 
of high strategic significance included 
climate change, diversity and inclusion, 
and financial resilience and inclusion. 
Our assessment also identified themes 
likely to become more significant to 
M&G, including natural capital 
(‘biodiversity’) and digital innovation.

Work is already underway across the 
business to improve how we integrate 
and manage themes, including 
measuring our nature-related 
investment exposures and using artificial 
intelligence to improve our ability to 
assess the sustainability credentials of 
investee companies. Recognising the 
interdependencies between climate and 
natural capital, we have also started 
work to enhance our measurement and 
stewardship in this area.

We acknowledge that this is a dynamic 
process and that we need to reassess 
risks and opportunities on an ongoing 
basis, with input from both internal and 
external stakeholders. Expectations 
continue to evolve, against a backdrop of 
regulatory change and updated 
recommendations from the scientific 
community. As long-term stewards of 
our clients' assets we need to 
incorporate both regulatory and 
scientific developments into our 
business planning.

Kathy Ryan
Chief Sustainability Officer

This is a pivotal time for global 
sustainability. The interconnected 
challenges of climate change and 
nature loss demand unprecedented 
and far-reaching changes across all 
aspects of society and the economy.

It’s a privilege to work in an industry 
that has a major role to play in 
improving sustainable outcomes. 
M&G is committed to play its part by 
using our broad capabilities to drive 
positive change, including 
financing solutions that can 
deliver real-world impact. 

Aligning our business and 
investments to thrive in a more 
sustainable, low-carbon economy is 
both a challenge and opportunity. 
We are harnessing our strengths 
and continue to place emphasis on 
collaboration, both internally and 
externally. This coming year will be 
crucial as we renew our strategic 
approach to sustainability to focus 
on real-world outcomes.

Our approach to sustainability continued

Natural capital
Natural capital refers to the world’s 
stock of renewable and non-renewable 
natural assets, such as soil, air and 
water, and all living things, from which a 
wide range of ecosystem services, such 
as pollination, air purification and 
provision of raw materials, can be 
derived. Biodiversity, including every 
living thing on Earth, is one part of 
natural capital, and a key determinant of 
the resilience of ecosystem services – 
a decline in the state of nature can 
reduce the resilience of ecosystems, 
and their capacity for providing 
ecosystem services. 

Our societies, economies and financial 
systems fundamentally depend on 
natural capital, and the basic health and 
resilience of biodiversity. Research 
suggests that approximately $44 trillion 
of economic value generation 
'moderately' or 'highly' depends on 
natural capital and its ecosystem 
services. However, scientific findings 
suggest that natural capital is 
deteriorating globally, and faster than at 
any time in human history. 

Nature loss through biodiversity loss 
impacts the entire planetary system and 
is subject to the interdependencies of 
its multiple drivers (ie climate change,

land use change, natural resource 
exploitation, pollution and invasive 
species). The Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC) has 
underlined that effective action on 
climate depends upon the preservation 
of biodiversity and natural regulatory 
systems, and needs to include 
consideration of associated 
social implications. 

If left unmanaged, the wide-ranging 
physical impacts of natural capital loss 
and climate change, combined with the 
socio-economic impacts of these 
issues, could have disruptive 
consequences on asset valuations, the 
stability of financial markets and the 
global economy overall.

At M&G, we are focusing on developing 
our knowledge on impacts, 
dependencies, risks and opportunities 
around natural capital in an investment 
context. We have started to conduct 
due diligence on emerging data 
providers, to develop our framework for 
engagement, and have rolled out initial 
investment team training, building on 
our existing approach to climate 
change. Last year, our private asset 
Catalyst strategy invested in a company 
that is providing solutions to reduce the 
environmentally harmful use of 
chemical pesticides as outlined in the 
case study below.

As members of the Taskforce for 
Nature-related Financial Disclosures 
(TNFD) Forum, we continue to engage 
with the materials provided by the 
Taskforce, including the final TNFD 
Framework released in 
September 2023. Upon its launch, we 
have joined the investor engagement 
initiative Nature Action 100, extending 
our collaborative climate-related 
stewardship efforts to include nature 
considerations. We are also leading the 
nature work stream of the Climate 
Financial Risk Forum’s Financial 
Resilience working group.

Financial markets require clear and 
long-term economic incentives and 
regulatory signals from policy-makers in 
order to effectively shift capital away 
from nature-negative investments 
towards those in nature-positive 
activities. We are looking to participate 
in the evolving dialogue on the 
challenges for investors to effectively 
take action on nature loss. As a financial 
services company, our main nature-
related impacts, dependencies, risks 
and opportunities reside in the 
investments we manage and 
administer. However, we recognise the 
importance of identifying, measuring 
and reducing our impacts and 
dependencies on nature through our 
own operations too.

Making a difference

Supporting sustainable crop management
Traditional chemical pesticides are 
associated with negative impacts, 
including environmental damage, 
pest resistance and health issues. 
In readiness for the inevitable market 
shift, chemical companies are funding 
natural pesticide and bio-fertiliser 
programmes. The US$70 billion global 
pest-control market is growing at a rate 
of 3% per annum, of which biological 
control products make up US$10 billion - 
US$12 billion.

high-value crops through biological 
crop protection and pollination. Biobest 
creates tailored biological stimulants 
and pest control solutions which 
support strict environmental and 
regulatory requirements. 

The capital injected by Catalyst helped 
fund Biobest’s acquisition of Biotrop - 
a Brazilian biological solutions specialist 
in open field crop nutrition and 
protection. The acquisition will position 
Biobest as a major player in South 
America, expanding its range 
of biological solutions and 
complementing its existing portfolio.

M&G’s purpose-led flexible private 
assets strategy, Catalyst, has made a 
€75 million investment in Biobest, a 
global leader in this field, whose mission 
is to promote sustainable production of

Sustainability governance

We are embedding our sustainability governance model to improve 
collaboration and decision-making, to deliver sustainable shareholder value

Regular Risk and Compliance reporting 
is provided to the Risk Committee 
through the Chief Risk and Compliance 
Officer’s report. During the year the 
Chief Risk and Compliance Officer 
presented a number of topics that 
consider sustainability and ESG risks 
including the top and emerging risks 
facing our business, risk appetite and 
Own Risk and Solvency Assessment 
(ORSA) stresses and scenarios. 

Find out more in the Committee 
Reports on pages 109-119

The diagram below presents the Group 
governance structure as it relates to 
sustainability. All terms of reference for 
our Board-level governance committees 
are available on our website.

The newly renamed Nomination and 
Governance Committee is responsible 
for the composition of, recruitment to 
and succession planning for the Board 
and its committees, taking into account 
the future viability of our business. This 
includes reviewing the Board's gender 
and ethnic diversity, and related targets. 

The Board also reviewed the progress 
against the Group’s diversity 
commitments at half year and full year.

The Audit Committee receives regular 
updates on sustainability reporting and 
developments in this area. During the 
year the Audit Committee have reviewed 
and challenged market disclosures and 
the methodology applied in relation to 
the production of our climate metrics. 

Board oversight
M&G's Board has responsibility for 
oversight of the long-term sustainability 
and success of the business, and is 
responsible for creating and delivering 
sustainable shareholder value. This 
includes setting the Group’s 
sustainability strategy. The Board 
delegates specific duties to sub-
committees as follows:

– Reporting in the Annual Report and 
Accounts and any other material 
public documents in respect of climate 
change and sustainability matters (for 
compliance with relevant regulations, 
legislation and standards) is included 
in the Audit Committee’s terms of 
reference.

– Assessment of sustainability and ESG 

risk within the Group Risk Management 
Framework, including climate-related 
stress and scenario testing, the reporting 
of climate-related risk disclosures and 
provision of advice to the Board in 
setting M&G’s sustainability strategy, is

Risk management
Sustainability and ESG has been 
identified as a principal risk to our 
business. Find out more about this in the 
Risk Management section on page 61. 

Across M&G and its subsidiaries, we 
have integrated sustainability risk 
through our ESG Risk Management 
Framework across the three lines of 
defence (business, risk and compliance 
and internal audit). Overall responsibility 
for assessing sustainability and ESG risk 
is designated to the Risk Committee.

Consideration of ESG and sustainability 
risk is being built into our decision-
making, with sustainability themes and 
risk factors being incorporated into our 
general investment and risk 
management processes.

Find out more on Risk 
Management on pages 58-59

Policy
Our Group Governance Framework 
defines our approach to governance and 
internal controls, and includes policies 
covering sustainability-related topics. 
Each policy is owned and sponsored by 
a member of the Group Executive 
Committee.

The ESC, chaired by the CSO, meets on 
a monthly basis to support the oversight 
of sustainability-related risks and 
opportunities across the Group, 
undertaking quarterly regulatory horizon 
scanning.

The ESC makes recommendations to the 
Group Executive Committee and/or 
Board as needed, supporting the 
execution of the sustainability strategy 
and working alongside other committees 
such as the Management Disclosure 
Committee (MDC), where required.

Sustainability disclosures and reporting 
considered material to the Group are 
presented to the MDC, which has 
responsibility for the review and 
challenge of all material group-level 
external reporting and disclosure, before 
submission to the Audit Committee and/
or Board for approval. The MDC is 
chaired by the CFO.

During the year we have taken a 
number of other actions to advance our 
Group-wide sustainability governance. 
These include: 

– Promoting and driving a collaborative 
sustainability approach across the

Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for setting senior

Executive Directors' reward structure is 
linked to core performance management 
scorecards, which include sustainability-
related metrics. 

For our executive LTIP arrangements 
(the M&G Performance Share Plan) for 
2023-2025, the overall weighting for 
sustainability-related targets has 
increased from 15% to 25%, evenly 
divided between: our organisation's 
operational emissions reductions, and 
our gender and ethnicity diversity 
targets. This allocation has been 
retained for the LTIP arrangements set 
for the 2024-2026 target period. 

We review annually our objectives and 
remuneration structures, including any 
sustainability-related targets.

Management’s role
Our Chief Financial Officer (CFO) has 
responsibility at an executive level for 
sustainability, including climate. Our new 
Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), who 
joined us in November 2023, supports 
the CFO by leading on sustainability 
strategy, policy, commitments, and 
governance model.

The CFO presents a report to each 
Board meeting which gives a regular 
opportunity to escalate any material 
climate or other sustainability issues and 
policy decisions. In addition, in 2023 the 
CFO took separate sustainability update 
papers to the Board covering a range of 
topics including governance, risk, control 
environment, resource and the outcome 
of an assessment of material 
sustainability themes relevant to our 
business conducted during the year.

The Executive Sustainability Committee 
(ESC) is a sub-committee of the Group 
Executive Committee with cross 
functional membership including the 
CEOs of the Asset Management, Life 
and Wealth segments.

How the Board fulfils its duties

Understanding the needs of our stakeholders is essential to help us 
fulfil our purpose and drive value creation over the longer term 

The following pages provide more detail on how the Board has fulfilled its duties as set out in Section 172(i) (a) to (f) 
of the Companies Act 2006 (Section 172) and how it has engaged with and taken account of our stakeholders’ interests over 2023. 
We have also described how the Board considers our key stakeholders and their views. 

How the Board fulfils its Section 172 duties
Section 172 requires a company director to act in the way he or she considers, in good faith, would most likely promote the 
success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. The following aspects demonstrate how the Board 
establishes a structure to help it fulfil the Section 172 duties. 

Establishing our purpose, strategy, culture and values

The Board sets M&G's purpose, values, and strategy, and monitors our culture to ensure that these are aligned and this sets 
the tone for how we want to do business. Our culture and values inform our purpose, and are an essential underpin for our 
decision-making on strategy and what we want to achieve. Find out more on page 94. 

Board skills and stewardship

The establishment of a strong Board is essential for successful stewardship at M&G. We seek to recruit and retain Directors 
with diverse skills and expertise to govern decision-making. We develop our Directors through a comprehensive induction 
process and engagement with management, training, and workshops. This process helps our Directors to enhance their skills, 
so they can contribute to stronger decision-making and are better placed to help shape proposals and provide constructive 
challenge. Find out more on page 103. 

Board information

The Board has guidelines and training for colleagues to ensure that material prepared for Directors is of a high standard and 
considers aspects relevant for Section 172, including long-term impact and how key stakeholder interests have been 
considered. We encourage Directors to provide feedback to paper preparers to guide this process. 

Board discussion and decision-making

As part of its discussions, the Board provides rigorous evaluation, assessment of risk and challenge to ensure decisions 
promote our long-term sustainable success and balance the needs and interests of our stakeholders. Key themes and issues 
relating to our stakeholders are considered when the Board has discussions, and they influence the Board’s decision-making.

Key decision #1

Asset Management, Life and Wealth
In 2023, the Board approved restructuring our business into three distinct but complementary operating segments and 
appointed new CEOs to each segment, and it also reviewed and approved the strategy for each business.

This new segmental approach will help to deliver our strategic priorities: better serve our clients and develop our product 
offering; to grow external flows into Asset Management; to deploy an integrated pensions and savings distribution channel in 
the UK; and to build a defined benefit pension solution business.

Stakeholders considered

Clients, colleagues, investors and regulators.

Decision-making process

Management recommended the proposal to restructure M&G into three businesses for several reasons, including: deepening 
our understanding of client needs; increasing trust in M&G; enhancing convenience for our clients, by making it easy for them 
to engage with us; delivering targeted growth; and simplifying and strengthening our operating model. 

The Board agreed that separating the Retail and Savings business would help management focus more on the Life and Wealth 
strategies, which would support the goals of financial strength, simplification and growth. 

The Board noted the emphasis on good client outcomes was both good for the business and aligned with Consumer Duty. 

The Board approved the proposal because it would help achieve profitable growth for shareholders, better meet and respond 
to our clients’ needs, and be beneficial for colleagues in terms of collaboration, empowerment, accountability and removing 
obstacles to execution.

Key decision #2

New purpose
The Board approved our new purpose, together with new behaviours and strategic drivers aligned to our strategy and 
business plan.

This approach links the why (our purpose), what (our drivers) and the how (our behaviours), providing the basis for M&G to 
achieve our growth, simplification and financial strength targets.

Stakeholders considered

Clients, colleagues, investors and regulators.

Decision-making process

Management first engaged with clients and colleagues, and considered the views and interests of regulators and the external 
environment.

In November 2023, a workshop was held with the Board to discuss the proposed purpose, drivers and behaviours, and to 
consider stakeholder interest, ahead of the Board approving them in December.

The Board considered and discussed the matters relating to culture, values and behaviours, including the culture needed to 
drive execution and simplification, the importance of tone from the top, and investing in our people to ensure greater depth 
and stronger internal succession.

The Board also took into account the interests of clients, shareholders and regulators and how the purpose, values and 
behaviours were aligned to the Group's strategy.

As part of the programme of activity, the Executive Directors and Group Executive Committee members held in-person 
meetings with clients and colleagues to discuss direct feedback on the proposition, which was factored into the development 
of our new purpose, drivers and behaviours.

Key decision #3

Bulk purchase annuities
The Board approved the strategy for defined benefit pension solutions and approved two bulk purchase annuity (BPA) 
transactions for a combined premium of £617 million. 

Re-entering the BPA market is a key component of our strategy and represents our first transactions since we closed the 
annuity book to new business in 2016. This move into Life opens a third channel to support growth at M&G, alongside Asset 
Management and Wealth, creating value for our shareholders and clients.

Stakeholders considered

Clients, colleagues, investors and regulators.

Decision-making process

The Board considers re-entering the BPAs market as an opportunity to access a growing market to offset the natural run-off of 
our in-force Shareholder Annuities book, expand and extend the capital generation capacity of the Group, and drive inflows 
into our Asset Management operations.

The Board considered the individual BPA transactions from a capital allocation perspective and concluded that they would 
promote M&G's success for the benefit of its investors, and would be beneficial to the Group’s stakeholders in terms of our 
strategic priorities: to deliver profitable growth, simplify the business and maintain financial strength.

The Board also considered the interests of colleagues, including in relation to operational readiness, and emphasised the 
importance of the detailed implementation plan including colleague requirements and ways to increase their skills and 
capabilities. 

The Board took into consideration the needs and interests of clients, and concluded that re-entering this market would be 
beneficial to clients by offering new and unique solutions to pensions market.

Key decision #4

Simplify our business
The Board approved our transformation plan, which aims to improve client outcomes, simplify our operating model and 
improve accountability and employee engagement. 

We want to simplify our business and empower employees, remove barriers to execution and make M&G a better place to 
work. We aim to deliver £200 million of cost savings gross of inflation by the end of 2025, support our growth ambitions and 
deliver value for our shareholders, colleagues, and clients.

Simplification and efficiency activities include digitising and automating processes to reduce operational risk and unlock 
benefits of scale.

Stakeholders considered

Clients, colleagues, investors and regulators.

Decision-making process

The Board noted the focus on improving client outcomes, strengthening the risk and control environment and simplifying the 
business model to create capacity to invest. 

The Board also considered the interests of colleagues and questioned management on the benefits to colleagues. It was 
satisfied that colleagues would benefit from clearer ownership and accountability, lifting barriers to execution, and reducing 
the complexity of processes. In balancing the needs of stakeholders, the Board accepted that there would be redundancies 
and ensured that the terms of the voluntary redundancy programme for colleagues were appropriate and fair, and included full 
redeployment support.

The Board took into consideration the needs and interests of clients, and concluded that this programme would accelerate 
product innovation, reduce time-to-market and contain costs, while also improving client outcomes.

How we engage

Colleagues

M&G has over 6,000 permanent colleagues in 38 offices 
globally. Our colleagues are core to everything we do and 
fundamental to the success of the Group. The Board believes 
that ongoing engagement and two-way dialogue with 
colleagues is vital to ensuring that their interests and 
concerns are understood, and that we take appropriate 
action. An engaged workforce is the foundation to delivering 
for our other stakeholder groups. 

Engagement with our colleagues includes formal and informal 
meetings, a series of sessions between Non-Executive 
Directors and colleagues, colleague surveys, Townhall 
meetings, and other interactions as part of Board site visits.

Find out more about our colleagues 
on pages 50-53

How we engage

During 2023, there were a number of formal sessions between Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) and colleagues from across 
the Group. The NEDs attended sessions with colleagues across different locations and seniority levels, and included 
colleagues from different business areas, graduates and colleague ambassadors. The purpose of these regular sessions is to 
give our Board members the opportunity to engage directly with colleagues, gain insights into M&G's culture and understand 
colleague views and interests.

The Board visited the Milan office in September 2023 and held a variety of colleague events including a Townhall with 
colleagues, hosted by the Chair and Group CEO, and breakout groups with NEDs and colleagues on topics including diversity 
and inclusion, and client-centricity. The Townhall was attended by all Board members and colleagues from the Milan office. 

Listening to colleague feedback is vital. Our ‘OneVoice’ surveys capture feedback and track engagement across M&G. Each 
business area has its own action plan and engagement initiatives, and progress is tracked by the Group Executive Committee 
and discussed by the Board.

Key themes, issues and matters

– Positive feedback on culture and workforce/people policies

– Balance of controlling costs and investing for growth

– Removing barriers to execution including technology 

– Empowerment and desire for increased autonomy

– Hybrid working and return to office in the context of 

– Importance of learning and development, career 

collaboration

progression, and pastoral care, including for graduates

– Collaboration and prioritisation

Actions and progress

The key themes and issues are taken into account when having discussions as a Board and they influence the Board’s 
decision-making. Feedback on themes from Board conversations with colleagues were documented and shared for discussion 
with the NEDs, the Chief People Officer and, where appropriate, senior management.

The Board discussed the key themes from its direct engagement with colleagues and emphasised to management the 
importance of growing internal talent, strengthening succession plans, and further improving the employee proposition.

The Board discussed the key themes and issues from the colleague surveys and questioned management on their proposed 
actions in response. Senior leadership had increased the frequency of attending the office in-person to enhance collaboration. 
Management had provided greater clarity on strategy, committed to simplification and to making further improvements to IT 
experience.

The Board discussed and approved the actions being taken to improve accountability, which included the approach to 
performance and reward to ensure it improved objective setting for senior leaders and strengthened alignment with the new 
purpose. The events for senior leaders held in 2023 were designed to enhance collaboration, accountability and understanding 
of the strategic direction, as well as removing barriers to execution.

M&G can best serve them, continuous improvement of client/adviser outcomes, and client priorities in the Group’s Business Plan. 

The Board also received direct feedback from clients as part of the programme of work on our new purpose.

The Group CEO regularly meets clients to understand their views, discuss ways to further enhance our relationships and 
product offerings, and provides their feedback to the Board.

Client engagement meetings are held to enable management to understand what matters to our clients and to build strategic 
relationships with them.

Management also engages regularly with our clients on a day-to-day basis, in meetings, at roundtable events and conferences.

Regulators

Maintaining an open and cooperative relationship and dialogue with regulators and policymakers is critically important. 
The Group has a number of regulated entities, which are supervised at the legal entity level. We engage with regulators at 
both a Group and subsidiary level. 

How we engage

The Chair, Group CEO and other Board and Executive Committee members meet regularly with the supervisory and other 
teams at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Representatives from both the FCA 
and PRA attended a Board meeting to discuss regulatory priorities.

Key themes and regulatory priorities

– Governance and control environment

– Consumer Duty

– Impacts arising from the economic environment, in the 

– Strategy

context of credit risk and liquidity risk

– Climate risks 

– Operational resilience

– Outsourcing arrangements

Actions and progress

The Board believes that open and regular dialogue promotes transparency between the Group and its regulators and ensures 
that M&G is in a position to reflect the views of our regulators when setting strategy. The outcomes of our engagement with 
our regulators influence the Group’s priorities and focus for the year.

One of the Board’s main priorities is ensuring that the governance, leadership and culture at M&G facilitates good decision-
making, problem solving, and the delivery of good client outcomes.

During the year, the Board’s activities have included consideration of sustainability matters, the Group’s readiness and 
compliance with the Consumer Duty, together with a range of matters and decisions relating to strategy and execution. 

During the year, the Risk Committee’s activities have included reviewing a range of climate scenarios as part of the ORSA 
process, reviewed and challenged matters relating to risk management, internal controls, operational resilience and 
outsourcing.

During the year, the Nomination and Governance Committee’s activities have included leadership and succession planning 
and appointments to the Group Executive Committee.

As well as the key stakeholder groups above, the Board is committed to engaging with other stakeholders to ensure that we 
maintain positive relationships and take account of their views and interests. These include communities, charity partnerships and 
suppliers.

Communities

Our operating model for Corporate Responsibility is to build inclusive and resilient communities through urban regeneration, 
economic empowerment and community building. We want to use our community investment to help break down the barriers that 
prevent people from living the life they want. Our framework for community engagement provides support at a strategic and local 
level.

Charity partners

We work closely with our charity partners to develop strong, sustainable projects that meet local needs. We nurture spaces and 
places that help people and nature to thrive, giving people skills and opportunities to be financially secure, and building and 
strengthening relationships within and between communities.

Business partners

Our suppliers are critical to our business and the long-term success of the Group. We are committed to the principles of the 
Prompt Payment Code, and aim to treat suppliers fairly and consistently. The Chief Risk and Compliance Officer’s (CRCO) report to 
the Risk Committee provides a regular assessment of key risks, including any issues regarding third-party suppliers and 
outsourcers. The Board oversees the performance of business partners and suppliers through reporting from management and 
the Risk function. Day-to-day oversight is conducted by the operational teams and substantive issues are escalated to the Board 
through regular management reporting. Our annual Modern Slavery Transparency Statement will be approved by the Board and 
published later in 2024. Given the nature of our business and our use of third parties, this is focused on our efforts to find, fix and 
prevent modern slavery in our supply chain.

Scientific evidence shows that climate change is one of the biggest threats 
to our planet, and that carbon emissions are contributing to climate 
change. Our objective is to ensure that our operations and the assets we 
manage are aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, using the levers 
we have to support the necessary transition to net zero. These levers 
include investment strategy, stewardship, advocacy and our own 
operations.

 Our ambition is to build inclusive and resilient communities through urban 
regeneration, economic empowerment, and community building. Social 
mobility is our core focus and we want to use community investment to 
help break down the barriers that prevent people from living the life they 
want. As a responsible long-term investor, our sustainability ambition 
supports a socially just transition; our dedicated capabilities in emerging 
markets investing further complements this position through capital 
deployment in areas such as financial inclusion. 

As an organisation, we do not tolerate any form of slavery, servitude and 
forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking. We hold our suppliers to 
the same ethical standards to which we hold ourselves and require them to 
remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our influence 
also extends to the companies and assets in which we invest - grounded in 
our investment principles, engagement with investee companies helps to 
ensure they are considering and appropriately managing modern slavery 
risks.

Addressing financial crime is integral to protecting and stimulating 
economic growth as well as for instilling confidence in consumers within 
the financial services sector. We are committed to preventing, detecting 
and where necessary, reporting instances of such criminal conduct to the 
appropriate authorities and regulators. We strive to ensure highest 
possible levels of financial crime awareness among our employees and 
parties acting on our behalf - this is supported by mandatory training and 
reporting requirements.

Human rights

Human rights concerns all of us and is 
core to our business interests and we 
believe in supporting human rights by 
acting responsibly in everything we do 
including in key areas such as modern 
slavery, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, 
diversity and inclusion, health and safety, 
the environment and our 
carbon footprint. 

We are committed to working with all 
our suppliers and stakeholders to help 
end slavery, human trafficking, child 
labour and any other abuse of 
human rights. We review and approve 
annually our M&G Supply Chain Modern 
Slavery Business Standard. This 
supports the management of modern 
slavery risk and how we approach third-
party supplier relationships. Through 
annual attestation against the standard, 
we assess our approach and ensure we 
meet the minimum standards stipulated 
by the UK Home Office, while ensuring 
we are compliant in our license to 
operate in line with the Modern Slavery 
Act 2015 (the Act). 

We regularly review how non-financial 
risks are embedded within our third-
party supplier lifecycle to ensure 
continuous improvement and alignment 
to regulatory policy and best practice, 
including modern slavery-related supply 
chain risks.

Our commercial procurement teams 
across our UK businesses have 
embedded a co-ordinated response to 
the requirements of the Act, focused on 
our external supply chain, as follows:

– Commercial procurement highlights 

within all tender activity our 
expectations around modern slavery. 
We undertake this process regardless 
of a supplier's statutory position 
(suppliers under the £36 million 
threshold stipulated by the Act are not 
exempted from our requirements) 
and it is included in the due 
diligence process. 

– Our Code of Conduct and Supplier 

Code of Conduct is regularly 
maintained. All our suppliers must sign 
up to the Code as part of our due 
diligence process. These Codes 
outline the standards to which we 
expect our suppliers to adhere, 
including human rights and modern 
slavery-related issues.

– Both commercial procurement and 

Third-Party Risk determine the nature 
of services provided by suppliers and 
identify associated risks, including 
any potential risk exposure to 
modern slavery. 

Where suppliers do not appear to 
have appropriate standards in place, 
we will work in close collaboration to 
improve standards. This ongoing 
monitoring, especially focused on the 
onboarding of new material suppliers 
to M&G, builds on previous reviews of 
our supplier base when we reviewed 
the common procurement category 
themes and measure our potential 
exposure to modern slavery risk. 

– As part of our ongoing sustainability 

initiatives we have carried out in-depth 
reviews on our high-risk suppliers with 
UK-originated spend to understand 
the potential inherent risk to our 
business. Where needed, we have 
taken the necessary steps to identify 
opportunities to improve standards. 
We will continue to work with 
suppliers to align their approach to 
ours on an ongoing basis.

– Our comprehensive e-learning module 

on modern slavery helps our 
employees understand the link 
between our business and human 
rights and raise awareness around 
modern slavery, its scale and 
complexity. This training was 
refreshed in 2023 to reflect changes at 
M&G and trends in the topic of 
modern slavery. 

– The e-learning module is targeted at 
specific employees across core areas 
of our business. Our Board and Senior 
Executives have undertaken refresher 
training to demonstrate our 
commitment to combatting modern 
slavery and human trafficking.

– In 2023, we refreshed and updated 
M&G contracts for modern slavery 
provisions. In addition, purchase order 
terms and conditions, applied to all 
spend, include the appropriate 
modern slavery conditions and 
requirements.

We recognise our responsibility to 
comply with all relevant legislation 
included within the Act. Our annual 
Modern Slavery Transparency 
Statement (to be published later in 2024) 
confirms how we comply with all 
relevant legislation; the steps we’ve 
taken to assess and mitigate against the 

48

risk of modern slavery and human rights 
violations within our business and supply 
chains; and how we’ve managed and will 
continue to proactively monitor 
those risks.

In relation to our investment activity, 
areas at material risk of human rights 
violations form part of our investment 
analysis. If we were to become aware of 
violations or where we believe there are 
insufficient protections around such 
issues, we would undertake 
engagement with investee companies, 
enabling us to have constructive 
dialogue with those exposed to human 
rights abuses such as modern slavery 
risks, both in their direct operations and 
within supply chains. In cases where we 
believe this would not be effective to 
reach a more sustainable outcome we 
may escalate, including to divestment. 
Funds managed by our asset manager 
are also able to apply an exclusion to 
companies breaching global norms 
principles (eg UN Global Compact 
principles) which includes issues such as 
modern slavery and human rights, 
through the application of our Global 
Norms Exclusions List, overseen by the 
Global Norms Committee. Our asset 
owner funds, where they have control of 
the mandate design, apply a global 
norms exclusion.

During 2024, we will continue to focus 
on embedding modern slavery risk 
management as part of our continuous 
improvement activities. This will include 
reviews of our supplier onboarding, risk 
assessment and due diligence 
processes and controls, as well 
as Group-wide, third-party 
oversight governance.

We will also embed our new Supply

Anti-bribery and anti-corruption

We are committed to the highest levels 
of integrity in the way we conduct 
business and have a no tolerance 
approach to bribery and corruption given 
its adverse impact on society and 
undermining of economic development. 

We require all our employees across the 
globe, including firms that conduct 
activity on our behalf, to adhere to our 
Financial Crime Policy and relevant 
standards requirements, which include 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption controls, 
and to carry out their duties with 
openness and transparency. 

Periodic mandatory training and 
reporting requirements ensure that 
employees (and associated persons) are 
aware of their obligations under the UK 
Bribery Act 2010, including additional 
training requirements for certain front-
line colleagues. 

Risk management and control failures 
could lead to criminal prosecution, fines 
or reprimands and/or cause significant 
damage to M&G’s reputation.

As an investor, we comply with 
applicable financial sanctions regimes – 
any company sanctioned by these 
regimes is excluded from our investment 
universe. Furthermore, governance is a 
fundamental part of investment analysis 
performed by our asset manager, which 
includes consideration of bribery and 
corruption risks and associated controls, 
so that these can be considered in 
investment decisions and/or to prioritise 
engagement for improvement. If we 
believe that a company which is not 
subject to financial sanctions has 
significant risk associated with bribery 
and corruption, this is considered as part 
of our investment decision-making, and 
may be escalated where appropriate. 

From an asset owner perspective, where 
we have investment decision-making 
authority, such instances will prompt 
engagement with the appointed asset 
manager, which may lead to exclusion 
from our portfolio if unsuccessful.

Adherence to policies
We have a no tolerance approach to 
bribery, which is articulated in M&G’s 
Risk Appetite, Financial Crime Policy and 
related standards.

The resulting framework ensures M&G 
complies with its obligations under 
applicable law, with adequate controls to 
ensure all Associated Persons (including 
employees) are acting with integrity.

Looking after our colleagues 

We are committed to ensuring our colleagues' working lives are engaging 
and fulfilling, in a safe, inclusive and diverse environment

Inspiring people 
to do their best
In achieving our new purpose and driving 
growth, we have a responsibility to do 
what’s in the best interests of our 
colleagues. We are creating an 
exceptional place to work: a positive 
culture where our colleagues enjoy each 
day, feel inspired to do their best for our 
clients, help grow the business, and 
support the communities in which we 
operate. 

Our people practices set a benchmark 
within our industry and in similar-sized 
organisations, and are recognised by the 
National Equality Standard, the UK’s 
highest benchmark for equality, diversity 
and inclusion. 

Over the past year, we have continued to 
develop and implement colleague-based 
initiatives across our five global 
workstreams, which cover disability, 
gender, ethnicity/nationality, life stages 
and LGBTQ+, and support our ambition 
of building a safe, inclusive and diverse 
culture.

“

Achieving 
re-accreditation of the 
National Equality 
Standard reflects our 
incredible journey over 
the past three years, 
and the collective team 
effort that has gone 
into defining our 
working environment 
and culture.”
Mark McLane
Head of Diversity, 
Inclusion and Well-being

To monitor how we are progressing on 
delivering change and ensuring 
accountability, as well as meeting 
increasing market and regulatory demand 
for transparency, we are expanding how 
we collect, analyse and report data.

In 2023, we moved to regular employee 
engagement surveys across the year. By 
gathering more data and analysing 
trends using our surveys, we are getting 
a deeper insight into how well our 
policies and initiatives are working in real 
time. This helps us to act more quickly on 
feedback, as well as improve our 
colleagues' experience. Our new metrics 
include the overall percentage of 
colleagues who identify as LGBTQ+, 
disabled and our social mobility data. 

We measure employee engagement 
through our OneVoice surveys to track 
how happy people are at work and 
whether they would recommend M&G as 
a great place to work. Results are split by 
demographic group and results analysis 
takes into consideration risk and 
emerging challenges. The aggregate 
Sustainable Engagement score for 2023 
was 70.7 (2022: 72.0). Our culture focus 
groups deep dive into themes arising 
from engagement survey results and we 
determine key areas for improvement.

with our colleagues see page 43

colleague-related risk see page 66

Leading policies that meet 
colleague needs
We are continually adapting our people 
approach to support our colleagues’ 
evolving needs and ensure their positive 
well-being at work. Our market-leading, 
progressive people policies meet every 
life stage, including our Inspiring 
Families Policy with neo-natal leave, 
fostering and kinship entitlements. We 
have a Menopause Policy with extended 
healthcare benefits around fertility and 
reproductive health, and we also offer 
Time Off When You Need It and 
Transitioning at Work policies.

Our behaviours
Our values of care and integrity 
underpin our behaviours, which guide 
how all our colleagues should act and 
interact with each other, clients and 
all stakeholders. Our new behaviours 
are aligned with our culture and 
values, and help us to deliver our new 
purpose and strategy:

Tell it like it is: Respectfully speaking 
up to create better ways forward - 
both direct and empathetic

Own it now: Putting your name on 
things with confidence to drive 
progress and results quickly

Move it forward together: Forming 
cross-functional teams to seize the 
right opportunities and solve real 
problems

Progress takes many forms
We are committed to becoming more 
diverse and inclusive. By benchmarking 
ourselves against others in the 
marketplace, across all aspects of our 
diversity and inclusion strategy, it holds 
us to a higher level of accountability than 
just reaching the M&G strategy targets. 
It provides additional data we use to 
evolve and improve our approach to 
diversity, inclusion and well-being.

Our Code of Conduct ensures we conduct 
ourselves ethically, putting our values and 
behaviours into action every day, and in 
accordance with our policies and 
procedures, global laws and regulations. 

Our Whistleblowing Policy details 
whistleblower protections in place across 
M&G, so that anyone who speaks out 
feels safe and confident in doing so. It is 
supported by our Speak Out programme, 
which includes different confidential 
reporting channels, managed by the 
Speak Out team, which reports directly to 
the Chief People Officer.

All reports are taken seriously, with 
qualifying reports independently and 
confidentially investigated. All 
investigations are governed by our 
Speak Out programme.

Our colleagues continued

In addition to our extensive range of 
policies that support our colleagues, we 
are mindful of the cost-of-living 
pressures faced by many during a 
challenging external economic 
environment, resulting in a further one-
off financial support payment to our 
lower-earning colleagues in May 2023. 

Ensuring colleague mental 
health and well-being
Our good practice initiatives and 
campaigns give colleagues access to 
well-being resources, including mental 
health support, 24/7, such as our well-
being and inclusion app; our well-being 
on-demand channel; and Nudge (our 
financial well-being platform).

In 2023, over 2,700 colleagues 
registered to attend our well-being 
workshops and resources.

Our dedicated Colleague Support 
Adviser provides colleagues with a 
confidential, bespoke service to help 
resolve personal concerns, as well as 
group coaching.

We are conscious of absence as a result 
of mental health, and monitor absence, 
including mental health, through monthly 
reporting as part of our overall People 
Risk assessment. We have a specific 
question on stress levels at work in our 
OneVoice surveys, and share results 
with the Group Executive Committee 
and the Board.

Developing all colleagues: 
Winning Mindsets
A new purpose, refreshed strategy and 
greater focus on delivering sustainable 
and profitable growth requires our 
people to continue to evolve and adapt 
at pace. In 2023, we launched a new 
colleague-wide learning experience 
called Winning Mindsets. It offers a 
variety of experiences to inspire our 
colleagues, including immersive 
experiences supported by bite-sized 
workshops, equipping colleagues to put 
learnings into practice across four areas: 
thinking client, decision-making, keeping 
it simple, and embracing change.

Developing exceptional 
people managers: People 
Manager Academy
We have comprehensive targeted 
training and guidance for our people 
managers. Building upon our five People 
Manager Expectations, we ran five 
cohorts of our People Manager Academy 
in 2023, with 450 people managers 
taking part. 

The total alumni of our People Manager 
Academy is now 1,466. The People 
Manager Academy includes practical 
workshops, digital simulations for safe 
practice, personal diagnostics and peer 
coaching, including diversity and 
inclusion content. People managers are 
also supported via critical moment 
checklists and toolkits.

Diversity and inclusion 
throughout M&G
We have a five-year Diversity and 
Inclusion (D&I) plan and governance 
model, with pre-defined roles for the 
Executive Committee and Board, 
alongside our D&I team, diversity forums, 
diversity networks and enterprise 
workstreams. 

Our D&I targets keep us focused on 
building a positive workplace and we 
have initiatives throughout the talent 
management lifecycle, from sourcing 
candidates to recruitment, career 
progression and succession. We are 
aiming to improve gender balance 
across our organisation and appointed 
several women to key senior roles over 
2023, including Caroline Connellan as 
Wealth CEO and Kathy Ryan as our first 
Chief Sustainability Officer. 

To find out more about how we are

Our colleague-led diversity networks 
provide support and networking 
opportunities and are aligned with our 
five global workstreams: 

– Elevate, our gender network

– Enable, our accessibility and 

neurodiversity network

– Embrace, our ethnicity, nationality and 

faith network

– Pride, our LGBTQ+ network

– Mind Matters, our mental health and 

well-being network.

Throughout 2023, we have run events 
such as 'Understanding Fibromyalgia' 
and 'Suicide Awareness'. Enable also 
runs regular coffee mornings for 
colleagues with caring responsibilities. 

We ensure that everyone at M&G has 
the opportunity to fulfil their potential 
and realise their aspirations. We have 1% 
of employees who self-declare as 
LGBTQ+, (with 69% non-disclosed), and 
1.66% of employees in the UK who 
consider themselves disabled.

Measuring D&I at M&G 
Diversity in senior leadership: We 
are aiming to achieve 40% women 
and 20% ethnic diversity in senior 
leadership by 2025. In 2023, women 
in senior leadership was 37% (2022: 
37%) and ethnicity in senior 
leadership was 7.4% (2022 restated: 
6.7%). See page 53 for more details.

Colleague inclusion index: This 
continues to be measured on a 
regular basis as part of the 
OneVoice Survey, with an average 
score of 66.7 across three surveys in 
2023. It is based on two questions - 
'Leaders at M&G value different 
perspectives' and 'I feel free to 
speak my mind without fear of 
negative consequences'. Taking into 
account the level of change at the 
senior leadership during the year, 
our score is slightly lower than last 
year (2022: 69.0), but continues to 
reflect that care and integrity remain 
core values at M&G.

In 2023, we were re-accredited as a 
Disability Confident leader, the highest 
level recognised under the Department 
for Work and Pensions Disability 
Confident Scheme. 

The Scheme supports employers to 
make the most of the talents disabled 
people bring to the workplace.

Partnerships to support 
industry diversity
We recognise that the financial services 
industry has traditionally not been as 
diverse as other industries and so we are 
actively supporting cross-sector initiatives 
to develop diverse talent. We sponsor the 
Financial Services Skills Commission, and 
chaired the workstream that developed 
and published the Inclusion Measurement 
Guide, a framework that encourages the 
financial sector to consistently measure 
inclusion. 

Our external partnerships also drive 
social mobility in our industry, for 
example through our work with Talent 
Foundry and Urban Synergy on early 
intervention and pre-apprenticeships.

These projects also improve diversity in 
our own talent pipeline and build our 
community outreach. 

Our gender and 
ethnicity pay gap
Our mean gender pay gap across the 
business for 2023 continues to improve to 
28.5% (2022: 29.2%) and our average bonus 
gap has improved to 66.6% from 67.5%.

We are proud to have been one of the first 
companies in our sector to publish an 
ethnicity target in leadership and we 
voluntarily publish ethnicity pay gap data. 
In 2023, our Group mean ethnicity pay gap 
improved to 3.2% (2022: 5.5%).

¢ Men ¢ Women

Under the Companies Act 2006 (the Companies Act), we are required to report on the gender diversity of our employees, our ‘senior managers’ and our Board. 
The gender diversity of our employees and our Board is shown above. ‘Senior managers’ is defined by the Companies Act, as anyone who has responsibility for 
planning, directing or controlling the activities of the Company, or a strategically significant part of the Company, and must include the number of persons of 
each sex who were the directors of the undertakings included in the consolidation. Where such persons hold multiple directorships across the Group they are 
only counted once. For this purpose, ‘senior managers’ includes our GEC members (excluding those on the Board), our GEC direct reports and our ‘Other 
senior management’ from the chart above. On this basis, we have 474 senior managers (314 men, 160 women).

¢ White ¢ Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic ¢ Undisclosed

Our ethnic diversity reporting includes a separate category of 'undisclosed' for the first time. To support our evolution to more 
granular reporting, we have taken a number of measures over the past two years to improve our data accuracy and enhance our 
definition of diversity, reporting capabilities and competitiveness in attracting a diverse talent pool. 

However, our HR data system is configured to record ethnicity data in the UK and Ireland only. The total 'undisclosed' figure of 43% 
therefore includes a large proportion of overseas colleagues where ethnicity data has not been captured. For colleagues based in 
the UK and Ireland, the undisclosed figure is 18%.

We remain committed to achieving our target of 20% ethnic diversity in senior leadership by 2025. Our ethnicity percentage for 
GEC and GEC direct reports has increased slightly to 7.4% at the end of 2023 from 6.7% at the end of 2022 (restated to exclude 
undisclosed). This is an increase of over 5% from our 2019 baseline of 2% (excluding undisclosed). We have several initiatives in 
place to enhance the overall diversity of our talent pipeline, including participation in #10000 Black Interns programme, using the 
Black Women in Asset Management (BWAM) job board, hosting professional networking events with BWAM members, 
introducing the Aspire Career Exploration programme encouraging colleagues who identify as Black, Asian and minority ethnic to 
explore client-facing roles, and enhancing internal mobility of diverse talent.

Board diversity
The FCA Listing Rule 9.8.6(9) sets out a number of requirements for Board diversity based on the following targets:

– At least 40% of M&G’s Board are women (including those self-identifying as a woman)

– At least one of the senior board positions (Chair, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Senior Independent Director (SID) or Chief 

Financial Officer (CFO)) is a woman (including those self-identifying as a woman)

– At least one member of the Board is from a non-white ethnic minority background (as referenced in categories recommended by 

the Office for National Statistics (ONS))

The Board continues to meet the requirement for at least one of its members to be from an ethnic minority. Currently, 50% of the 
senior Board positions (Chair, CEO, SID and CFO) are held by a woman and gender diversity on the Board is 37.5%. However, 
whilst the percentage of women on the Board began the year at 44%, the departure of Fiona Clutterbuck after the AGM in May 
2023 has meant that the Company did not meet the 40% target at 31 December 2023. See page 110 for further details.

All data in graphs and tables are as at 31 December 2023. Data relating to the gender and ethnic diversity of the Board was collected by way of a questionnaire. 
This questionnaire asked Board members individually to disclose their gender identity and ethnic background, on a voluntary self-reporting basis, by selecting 
options aligned with those in the left-hand columns of the table above (and therefore included the option not to specify an answer). M&G employees (including 
executive management) are encouraged to confirm their gender and ethnicity at the onboarding stage, on a voluntary self-reporting basis, by selecting options 
(which include the option not to specify an answer). Data relating to the gender and ethnic diversity of executive management was sourced from this existing 
data, which is held within M&G’s secure HR system.

We aim to provide the essential needs for communities to thrive, to equip people with the tools they need to be financially secure 
and to provide opportunities for people to prepare for the future. Our operating model for Corporate Responsibility (CR) guides and 
supports each office and market to manage charitable activities, within a consistent, business-wide approach. Our CR strategy and 
performance is reviewed bi-annually by the Group Executive Committee.

Habitat for Humanity GB

The Tree Council 

The Talent Foundry

Skills for Life is a series of interactive, 
employability workshops delivered in 
schools across the UK, at M&G offices, 
and via an online CV review service. 
These workshops support students 
from under-resourced backgrounds in 
understanding how best to promote 
themselves when they are applying for 
jobs, university or apprenticeships; 
provide crucial guidance; and empower 
talented young people by helping them 
develop skills to take their future into 
their own hands and become 
independent, active citizens. 

In 2023, 5,533 young people took part 
in Skills for Life programmes, and M&G 
colleagues volunteered over 540 hours 
of support.

“

Having external visitors deliver 
workshops that help students 
recognise the importance of skills 
and attributes that they need 
to become career ready is a major 
plus for our students. By nurturing 
their soft skills through the 
workshop activities, they have grown 
in confidence, work better with 
their team and have improved 
their communication skills through 
presentations, mock interviews etc.”

Teacher
Pioneer Academy, Slough

Our partnership with Habitat for 
Humanity GB focuses on using empty 
buildings across Europe to address the 
social housing crisis by turning unused 
spaces into homes for vulnerable 
groups. We used data to understand 
the scale of the opportunity presented 
by empty buildings; repurposed 
properties to showcase the viability of 
the approach and developed a coalition 
of experts to design a toolkit to share 
this knowledge more widely. 

Our efforts in the UK are being shared 
across All Party Parliamentary Groups 
on housing and homelessness, and our 
efforts in Poland have changed 
legislation to encourage adoption of 
vacant residential units. To date, we 
have renovated 16 empty spaces into 
homes in England (London) and Poland 
(Warsaw and Silesian Region) and 
construction is currently underway in 
new locations including Scotland, 
Ireland and Germany.

“

Working with Habitat for Humanity gave 
us the opportunity to think very deeply 
about the accommodation needs of 
young people leaving care. It has 
enabled us to reconsider our options 
with private providers and to have the 
skills and confidence to partner with 
organisations like Habitat and M&G 
to do things differently and to do 
things better.”

Our partnership with The Tree Council 
supports schools in urban areas with 
high levels of deprivation and nature-
poor grounds. We aim to give young 
people the skills and knowledge to help 
tackle the climate and ecological crises. 

Between 2019 and 2023, we have 
enabled 250,128 students and teachers 
in 769 UK schools to take part in The 
Tree Council’s ‘Young Tree Champions’ 
programme. Alongside pupil workshops 
and teacher training, we have planted 
more than 32,000 trees in schools 
across the UK.

250,128 

students in 769 schools have taken part 
in The Tree Council’s ‘Young Tree Champions’ 
programmes since 2020.

Shinfield St Mary’s Primary School in 
Reading has been a Young Tree 
Champion since 2021. It has established 
one of the largest Miyawaki Forests in a 
school in the UK, with 2,000 trees 
planted this year. The school has also 
successfully embedded the project into 
its curriculum and is establishing a 
school tree nursery to supply local 
schools with saplings. 

“

The school’s ecology work is ambitious 
and exceptional. Sessions are carefully 
planned to develop pupils’ 
understanding of the natural world. 
Pupils know how they are 
explicitly applying and making links 
with their learning in many 
subjects, including mathematics, 
science and geography. 
Pupils are unequivocal in their 
views about why this environmental 
work matters. They see it as crucial for 
their and others’ future.”

The international Empowering Families 
programme helps young people and their

full potential by accessing 
entrepreneurship and leadership skills, 
enabling struggling families to support 
their children’s health and educational 
attainment. We have supported young 
people through digital mentorships with 
M&G colleagues, distance learning 
activities, and apprenticeships – helping 
them to take the next steps in their 
employability journey. Since partnership 
launch almost four years ago, M&G and 
SOS Children’s Villages have been 
reaching 121,000 young people and 
parents every year in India, Italy, Germany, 
Poland, France and Spain. 

We have also supported young people

Making a difference

Helping families
Meenakshi, aged 9, and her family 
were referred to SOS Children’s 
Villages in India after enduring poor 
living conditions and struggling to 
provide regular healthy and nutritious 
meals. Meenakshi’s weight was 
worryingly low, so the family were 
allocated nutritional food kits for four 
months. They were also shown how to 
easily source nutritious food items 
themselves and the benefits of a 
balanced diet. Meenakshi’s weight 
has since been restored and she is 
enjoying school again. The support 
provided by the Family Strengthening 
Programme in recent years has been 
instrumental to Meenakshi receiving a 
good education. 

In addition, through SOS Children’s 
Villages India’s self-help groups, 
Meenakshi’s mother has learnt about 
financial independency and improved 
her written and communication skills. 
She is now a step closer to securing a 
stable source of income for her family.

The 10X Challenge enterprise 
programme and digital platform helps 
young people develop entrepreneurial 
and financial capability skills, 
particularly investment and longer-term 
saving, and empowers teachers to be 
confident about teaching financial

The Age UK Building Resilience 
programme aims to equip vulnerable, 
older people with the tools, skills and 
opportunities needed to build resilience 
at difficult stages of their lives. The 
holistic support offered includes in-
depth information and advice, support 
and referrals to appropriate services 
through Age UK’s Advice Line. 

Now in its fourth year, M&G’s support 
has enabled Age UK to help 6,446 older 
people and respond to 30,629 enquiries 
to Age UK’s Advice Line.

Making a difference

Building resilience
Terry is 80 years old and lives alone 
since his wife’s death last year. The 
impact was profound and Terry 
grappled with feeling ‘useless’, 
struggling to learn cooking, cleaning 
and managing the household finances. 
He found it difficult to pay the bills and 
feared putting on the heating, despite 
experiencing breathing difficulties 
worsened by the cold. Terry felt very 
alone and would often go five days 
without speaking to a soul.

Terry turned to the Age UK Advice 
Line for help, and with its support he 
was awarded Attendance Allowance. 
“It saves me worrying about where the 
money is going to come from next,” 
says Terry. “I’m so grateful for Age 
UK’s help.”

The Age UK Advice Line also referred 
Terry to the Age UK Telephone 
Friendship Service. Regular calls with 
his telephone friend Jade have 
brought light and hope back during 
lonely times. “Loneliness is hard to 
explain,” he says. “Some nights I get 
quite depressed. I’ve always worked 
with people - I’m a people person - 
so it’s lovely to be able to speak to 
somebody. I look forward to our call 
all week.”

M&G in the Community
Every year we run a series of 
roadshows and take M&G in the 
Community on the road to meet with 
our colleagues. We showcase how 
our flagship 'Breaking barriers, 
building futures' programme is 
making a difference in our 
communities; and share and learn 
from our colleagues’ experiences, 
enabling them to connect with our 
charity partners and network. We 
complement this with an annual 
virtual show to ensure all colleagues 
can access and engage with our 
community programmes. More than 
2,000 colleagues joined to find out 
more about M&G’s community 
support in 2023.

Colleague engagement
In 2023, 1,517 M&G colleagues dedicated 
12,012 hours to supporting charities with 
activities from skills-based volunteering 
such as mentoring, to tree planting, 
beach cleaning and refurbishment of 
housing for vulnerable groups. Working 
together with community champions 
across our offices, we direct funding and 
volunteering through our local 
community grants, giving our colleagues 
ownership and the ability to choose 
where to focus their support.

M&G in the Community Fund
Our M&G in the Community Fund is an 
annual grant programme that supports 
local charities and projects with small 
donations. The Fund Committee 
includes 39 colleagues across M&G 
locations and, since its launch in 
September 2019, the Fund has awarded 
348 charitable grants globally.

Disaster and 
emergency response 
We feel it is our responsibility to respond 
to emergencies and make a meaningful 
contribution in the most appropriate and 
prompt way, and we work with national 
and international charity partners to 
direct a targeted, humanitarian response.

Supporting communities 
in times of crisis

Morocco and Libya response
In response to the earthquake in 
Morocco and the flooding in Libya, we 
made emergency corporate donations to 
support the relief efforts of the British 
Red Cross, our established long-term 
charity partner. M&G’s support helped to 
provide basic relief items, including 
blankets, sleeping bags, heaters, tents 
and beds, and emergency food supplies.

Israel and Palestine
As the crisis unfolded in Israel and 
Palestine, we worked with the British 
Red Cross to deliver humanitarian aid to 
those affected by the conflict. We made 
an emergency corporate donation 
towards medical supplies, supported by 
volunteers from Magen David Adom (the 
national Red Cross Society of the State 
of Israel) and the Palestine Red Crescent 
Society.

Charitable donations
We calculate our community investment 
spend using the Business for Societal 
Impact standard (B4SI), which includes 
cash donations to registered charitable 
organisations, as well as a cash 
equivalent for in-kind contributions.

Our total community investment spend 
in 2023 was £4.7 million, of which 
£3.2 million was cash. The balance 
included in-kind donations prepared in 
accordance with B4SI guidelines. 
Furthermore, £220,438 was donated by 
our employees through our payroll

Protecting our business

Our careful approach to risk management allows us to make effective business 
decisions today, while understanding the challenges that face us tomorrow 

One of the key objectives of the Risk 
and Compliance function is to help the 
business make informed decisions.

The environment of economic and 
geopolitical uncertainty in 2023 
continued to highlight the importance 
of risk management to enable 
effective decision-making. We have 
supported the business through this 
uncertainty and in managing new or 
emerging risks, including new 
technology adoption. 

2023 also saw the business model 
evolving into three distinct yet 
complementary businesses across 
Asset Management, Life and Wealth, 
which are overseen by the Risk and 
Compliance function to deliver 
diversified exposure for growth within 
our risk appetite. 

In 2023, we have made good progress 
in simplifying and embedding our risk 
and control frameworks, enhancing 
our risk culture and driving a mature 
three lines of defence model. We will 
continue to work with the business in 
2024 to support key decision-making 
and the successful execution of our 
business strategy. 

Louise Gelling
Interim Chief Risk and Compliance Officer

Risk management framework
As part of our business, we take on risk 
on behalf of our clients and shareholders. 
We selectively take risks if they are 
adequately rewarded, and can be 
appropriately quantified and managed. In 
this way, we safeguard our ability to meet 
client commitments, comply with 
regulations and protect our reputation.

Our comprehensive approach to risk 
includes identifying, measuring, 
managing, monitoring and reporting 
current and emerging risks - the Risk 
Management Cycle - supported by our 
risk culture and strong risk governance.

Our Risk Management Framework is 
designed to manage risk within agreed 
appetite levels, aligned to delivering our 
strategy and creating long-term value for 
clients and shareholders.

Risk culture
The Board is responsible for instilling an 
appropriate risk culture. Working 
together with senior management, the 
Board oversees and promotes risk 
management by emphasising and 
embedding the importance of balancing 
risk with profitability and growth in 
decision-making.

It also oversees internal control 
processes and ensures compliance with 
regulatory requirements.

Our approach to risk culture is centred 
around our Group-wide ‘I Am Managing 
Risk’ programme, which requires 
colleagues to take personal 
responsibility for identifying, assessing, 
managing and reporting risk. Our 
colleagues are expected to work 
together to do the right thing for our 
clients, wider stakeholders and our 
business. All colleagues have risk 
management accountabilities as part of 
their core objectives.

Governance
The Risk Committee is responsible for 
assisting the Board in overseeing risk. 

The Audit Committee assists the Board 
in meeting its responsibilities for the 
integrity of our financial reporting, 
including the effectiveness of our Risk 
Management Framework and internal 
control systems. 

The Remuneration Committee ensures 
that our compensation structures place 
appropriate weight on colleagues 
adopting our behaviours and risk culture 
to align with our long-term success.

Risk management continued

Our Risk Management Framework and 
internal control systems support our 
Risk, Remuneration and Audit 
Committees and are based on the ‘three 
lines of defence’ model. 

First line business and support functions 
identify and manage risks and are 
overseen by the second line Risk and 
Compliance function. The second line is 
structurally independent of the first line, 
and provides oversight, advice and 
challenge. The third line Internal Audit 
function is empowered by the Audit 
Committee to audit the design and 
operating effectiveness of our system of 
internal controls, including governance, 
risk management and control processes. 

Risk appetite and limits
Risk appetite is the level and type of risk 
we are willing to accept in pursuing our 
business objectives. Our risk appetite 
statements and limits specify our risk 
appetite and tolerance to take on risk. 
The statements and thresholds are 
aligned to our business model and 
strategy and cover significant financial 
and non-financial risks. We have 
established aggregate risk appetite 
statements and limits for capital, liquidity 
and dividend volatility. Our capital risk 
appetite is supported by a solvency 
intervention ladder, which sets out 
management actions to consider or 
implement at different levels of 
regulatory solvency. 

We assess our ability to stay within our 
risk appetite during the annual business 
planning process, and monitor and 
manage our actual position regularly 
throughout the year.

We also set the individual appetite 
statements and limits so we operate in 
line with aggregate approved risk 
appetite statements, even when the 
individual limits are fully used.

Risk and Compliance 
oversight
Our Risk and Compliance function 
performs second line oversight to 
support growing product offerings in a 
changing business environment. In 
managing the risks arising from our re-
entry to the Bulk Purchase Annuity 
(BPA) market, our Risk and 
Compliance function performed 
reviews of strategic and deal-specific 
activities with a focus on delivery 
against business plans and alignment 
with regulatory requirements and 
agreed appetite for risk exposures. 

Colleagues from across the first and 
second line were included in cross-
functional committees and working 

groups to enhance our risk 
identification, monitoring and 
decision-making capability. 

We advised on specific financial and 
non-financial risks, including the 
pricing framework, proposition design, 
model risk, operational risk, 
reputational risk, and delivery and 
execution risks. 

Final business recommendations to 
the Prudential Assurance Company 
Limited Board on the two specific BPA 
deals made in 2023 were supported by 
an independent Risk and Compliance 
opinion, which included consideration 
of the risks being taken under a variety 
of scenarios and the position against 
risk appetite.

Prescribed indicators inform us whether 
a risk may move out of appetite and, 
together with limit utilisation, this is a 
core element of our risk reporting to our 
Board and Executive Risk Committees 
with appropriate management actions.

Risk and capital management
Our Group Own Risk and Solvency 
Assessment (ORSA) is built around risk 
management, strategy and business 
planning and capital management. It 
covers our processes and procedures to 
identify, measure, manage, monitor and 
report short-term and long-term risks 
and assess the adequacy of our solvency 
position. The Group ORSA process is 
supported by subsidiary ORSA 
processes for our Solvency II entities 
and Internal Capital Adequacy and Risk 
Assessment (ICARA) processes for our 
investment firm entities.

“
We design and then oversee 
a controlled approach to risk 
management, with clear 
ownership, in line with our 
risk appetite.”

Louise Gelling
Interim Chief Risk and Compliance Officer

Risk management and internal 
control effectiveness
The Risk and Audit Committees have 
considered the outcome of the annual 
assessment of risk management and 
internal control effectiveness for 2023. 
The assessment is performed for each 
business area by the first line, with an 
independent second line opinion. It is 
driven by Risk and Control Self 
Assessments (RCSAs) conducted over 
the year, along with consideration of 
issues; notifiable events; compliance 
with policy requirements; risk appetite 
assessment; and regulatory feedback.

The business area assessments are 
aggregated to provide a material 
subsidiary and an overall M&G plc 
group-wide assessment. Internal Audit 
also provide an independent assessment 
of the overall control environment.

The assessment identified that positive 
progress has been made across M&G plc 
during 2023 in building on the risk and 
control framework foundations previously 
put in place, but also acknowledges that 
implementation work continues into 2024 
to reach target maturity. Management 
attention is therefore still required to fully 
embed the framework, including some 
targeted enhancements to elements of the 
framework and embedding of group-wide 
Key Control Assessments across 
the business. 

The Risk and Audit Committees at M&G 
plc Group and subsidiary level 
collectively monitor the timeliness with 
which outstanding actions and 
embedding plans are completed.

Principal risk

Management and mitigation

Outlook

Changing client preferences, 
together with economic and 
political conditions, could 
adversely impact our 
performance against our 
strategy.

Economic factors may impact 
product demand and our ability to 
generate an appropriate return. 
Increased geopolitical risks and 
conflicts, and policy uncertainty, 
may impact our products, 
investments and operating model.

Our reliance on PruFund for our 
inflows and our intermediated 
channel for sales in our Wealth 
business segment heighten our 
exposure to changing economic 
conditions and client preferences.

Our annual strategic planning is 
overseen by Risk and Compliance 
function and the Board. The 
process of strategy approval 
considers the potential impact of 
the wider business environment 
and economy. Throughout the 
year, we monitor and report on 
progress in delivering our 
Business Plan.

During 2023, we have realigned 
our leadership structure to our 
three businesses: Asset 
Management, Life and Wealth. 
This mitigates risk by aligning 
accountability with our business 
model and strategy which are 
overseen by our Risk and 
Compliance function. We are 
making good progress to 
transform M&G to continue 
delivering diversified risk 
exposures.

Our risk exposure to business 
environment and market forces is 
expected to increase as we build 
scale in selected markets, while 
managing risks arising from 
uncertain economic outlook, 
geopolitical conflicts, legislative 
changes and negative economic 
trends. The evolving asset 
management market places 
competitive pressure on fees, 
requiring continued focus on 
delivering good customer 
outcomes and assessing target 
markets.

Within the UK market, legislative 
risks include potential changes in 
legislation resulting from the UK 
Government's consultation on: 
"Modern leasehold: restricting 
residential ground rent for 
existing leases", which could 
adversely impact our senior and 
junior notes backed by residential 
ground rents.

2 Sustainability and ESG

Principal risk

Management and mitigation

Outlook

The importance of ESG factors to 
the organisation is expected to 
increase as the physical impacts 
of climate change continue to 
accelerate, nature risks become 
more prominent and new risks 
emerge.

Regular review of the ESG Risk 
Management Framework will be 
required to identify any 
enhancements necessary to allow 
the business to manage these 
risks appropriately.

A failure to address and embed 
sustainability considerations 
within our strategy, products, 
operating model, and 
communication approach could 
adversely impact on our financial 
performance, reputation and 
future growth. 

We consider and act upon a 
broad range of issues including 
those concerning greenwashing, 
climate impact, diversity and 
inclusion, and corporate 
governance.

We consider ESG Risk in terms of 
sustainability, or by how our 
business impacts on the planet 
and society, the impact of ESG 
factors on our organisation, and 
our ability to meet a range of key 
stakeholder expectations on 
sustainability and ESG issues.

We have an ESG Risk 
Management Framework in place 
to provide a structured approach 
for our identification, assessment 
and management of ESG risks, 
based on the three lines of 
defence model. The framework is 
supported by the ESG Risk Policy, 
which sets out key business 
requirements.

We consider ESG risks in our key 
strategic decisions, regular risk 
reporting and Board risk 
assessment papers.

We integrate climate change risk 
into our scenario analysis 
process, with both top down and 
bottom up considerations, over a 
range of time horizons.

Principal risk

Management and mitigation

Outlook

A failure to deliver against fund 
mandate or client investment 
objectives (including sustained 
underperformance of funds), to 
maintain risk profiles that are 
consistent with our clients’ 
expectations, or to ensure that 
fund liquidity profiles are 
appropriate may all lead to poor 
client outcomes and result in 
fund outflows.

If these risks materialise for our 
funds or a range of funds, it may 
impact our profitability, reputation 
and growth plans.

Our fund managers are 
accountable for the performance 
of the funds they manage, and 
management of the risks within 
the funds.

Independent Investment Risk and 
Performance teams oversee fund 
performance, fund liquidity and 
investment risks, reporting to the 
Chief Risk and Compliance 
Officer.

Such activities feed into 
established oversight and 
escalation forums to identify, 
measure and oversee investment 
performance, investment risk and 
fund liquidity risks.

Our investment risk exposure is 
expected to increase as markets 
have priced in a soft economic 
landing alongside central banks 
cutting interesting rates, this is 
coinciding with significant 
elections globally.

Economic uncertainty increases 
investment risk which is driven by 
market targets with investment 
performance measured against 
benchmarks and peers.

Any unforeseen economic 
downturns or surprise election 
outcomes would result in 
repricing of markets.

4 Credit

Principal risk

Management and mitigation

Outlook

Our credit risk is impacted by our 
re-entry to the BPA market and 
ongoing economic uncertainty 
that may trigger volatile markets. 
Negative market developments, 
or industry events impacting 
invested sectors could negatively 
impact our invested credit 
positions.

We are exposed to the risk that a 
party to a financial instrument, 
banking transaction or 
reinsurance contract causes a 
financial loss to us by failing to 
discharge an obligation.

Our primary exposure to solvency 
is from the change in the value of 
invested assets arising from 
credit spread widening, or credit 
rating downgrades.

We also have exposure to credit 
risk through while for trading, 
banking or reinsurance activities 
which this relates to the risk that 
the counterparty fails to meet 
their obligations.

Our Credit Risk Policy sets 
standards for assessing, 
measuring and managing credit 
risk, monitored by a dedicated, 
independent team.

We set and regularly review limits 
for individual counterparties and 
by issuers, sectors and aggregate 
credit quality, and monitor 
exposures against these limits.

Our policy is to undertake 
transactions with counterparties 
and invest in instruments of high 
quality. Where appropriate, we 
seek to collateralise transactions 
to mitigate credit risk including 
derivatives, secured lending, 
reverse repurchase agreements 
and reinsurance transactions. We 
also manage and control 
reinsurance treaties to enable 
effective risk transfer.

5 Market

Principal risk

Management and mitigation

Outlook

Our market risk exposure is 
expected to increase over the 
Business Plan period driven by 
expected volumes of PruFund 
new business and our BPA 
market re-entry partially offset by 
run-off of the existing insurance 
business. 

Market risk remains uncertain, 
with upcoming US and UK 
elections, rising geopolitical risk 
and negative market sentiments. 
There are expectations that 
inflation will stabilise. Our 
solvency buffers offer significant 
protection against market risks.

Our profitability and solvency 
are sensitive to market 
fluctuations in the level or 
volatility of equities, properties, 
alternative investments, interest 
rates, currencies and inflation.

Significant market fluctuations 
could have material adverse 
effects on our revenues and 
returns.

Market risk appetite is set and 
monitored to limit our exposure to 
key market risks, and we have 
prescribed limits on the seed 
capital provided for new funds.

Where appropriate, and subject 
to risk limits and procedures, we 
use derivatives for risk reduction, 
to hedge equities, interest rates 
and currency risks, for example.

Material falls in interest rates may 
increase the amount we need to 
set aside to meet our future 
obligations.

We review regularly our hedging 
and investment strategies, 
including asset-liability matching, 
informed by stress testing.

We have procedures to respond 
to significant market events and 
disruptions, bringing together 
colleagues across M&G to 
provide an enhanced monitoring 
and decision-making capability.

Exchange rate movements could 
impact fee and investment 
income denominated in foreign 
currencies.

Material increases in inflation may 
increase our cost base and the 
amount we need to set aside to 
meet future obligations, 
negatively impacting profitability. 

6 Corporate liquidity

Principal risk

Management and mitigation

Outlook

We are exposed to the risk that 
we have insufficient cash 
resources to meet our 
obligations, such as claims, 
creditors, and planned 
dividends, as they fall due. 

This includes ensuring each part 
of our business and M&G plc has 
sufficient resources to cover 
outgoing cash flows, under a 
range of severe but plausible 
scenarios.

Risk appetite is set such that we 
maintain adequate liquid 
resources and our liquidity 
position is regularly monitored 
and stress tested. We have 
detailed liquidity contingency 
funding plans in place to manage 
a liquidity crisis.

Liquidity, cash and collateral is 
managed for the Group by 
Prudential Capital, which holds 
liquid, high grade assets and has 
access to external funding.

Our corporate liquidity risk 
exposure is expected to remain 
stable. M&G plc's liquidity position 
is managed against risk appetite 
and is driven by subsidiary 
dividend payments and 
intercompany settlement. 
Liquidity is therefore dependent 
on the successful delivery of our 
Business Plan.

7 Insurance

Principal risk

Management and mitigation

Outlook

We are exposed to the risk of 
loss or of adverse change in the 
financial situation of our 
business, or that of our clients, 
resulting from changes in the 
level, trend, or volatility of 
mortality; longevity; morbidity; 
persistency; expense and margin 
pricing experience.

Unexpected changes in the life 
expectancy (longevity) of our 
clients could have a material 
adverse impact on our future 
liabilities, which would affect our 
profitability and solvency. This 
risk mainly arises from our large 
annuity book.

We conduct annual reviews of 
longevity and other assumptions 
such as persistency and 
expenses, which are supported 
by detailed assessments of actual 
mortality experience and have a 
team of specialists undertaking 
longevity research.

We perform regular stress and 
scenario testing to understand 
the size of insurance risk 
exposures.

We have undertaken longevity 
risk transfer transactions, where 
attractive financial terms are 
available from suitable market 
participants.

Our insurance risk exposure is 
expected to increase at a 
managed level due to the re-entry 
into the BPA market as part of our 
growth strategy. This exposure 
will be managed within our 
existing control environment. Our 
insurance risks are subject to 
appropriate controls in pricing 
and reserving processes. BPA 
transactions require appropriate 
consideration of longevity risk 
and are subject to risk oversight.

8 Operational

Principal risk

Management and mitigation

Outlook

A material failure or operational 
disruption in the processes and 
controls supporting our 
activities, including that of our 
third-party suppliers or our 
technology, could result in poor 
client outcomes, reputational 
damage, increased costs and 
regulatory censure.

Our dependence on technology 
means the unavailability of key 
hardware or software, inadequate 
information security 
arrangements and ineffective use 
of digital solutions could impact 
our ability to operate effectively.

Additionally, serious failings in the 
delivery, or persistent under 
performance by our third-party 
suppliers, could impact our client 
service delivery.

Our operational risk exposure is 
expected to remain neutral 
throughout 2024, supported by 
continued progress of our 
transformation programme, data 
management, and 
implementation of an enhanced 
third-party management 
framework. 

We continue to improve our 
operational resilience of 
important business services 
under ‘severe, but plausible’ 
scenarios, targeting the March 
2025 regulatory requirement on 
operational resilience issued 
jointly by the PRA, Bank of 
England and FCA. Efforts to 
enhance the control environment, 
and our deployment 
consideration of new technology, 
including artificial intelligence, are 
ongoing.

Our Risk Management 
Framework defines our approach 
to managing operational risks and 
associated controls, including IT, 
data and outsourcing 
arrangements.

We have a Data Policy that sets 
out the principles and 
requirements on the use of data 
across the organisation, which 
has become more important with 
the developments in artificial 
intelligence.

We apply business continuity and 
crisis management requirements 
using a risk-based approach to 
identify and manage Important 
Business Services and Critical 
Shared Services. Strategies are 
then designed, implemented, and 
tested to manage the risk of 
intolerable harm under ‘Severe, 
but plausible’ scenarios.

We have an Information 
Technology Risk Policy in place to 
manage technology risks. We are 
enhancing the existing third-party 
risk management framework for 
our global operations, including in 
the selection, on-boarding, 
management and termination of 
third parties.

Outlook

We expect the nature of our 
change risk to remain stable over 
2024 as we look to deliver on our 
strategic priorities including our 
transformation programme 
announced in 2023. We expect 
our change risk profile to 
decrease and return to a more 
normal level once we achieve 
those ambitions.

Failure to deliver on our 
significant change programmes 
within cost and capacity 
constraints may impact our 
business model and ability to 
deliver against our Business Plan 
and strategy.

Our Group Executive Committee 
advises the Group CEO on 
prioritisation decisions. The 
objective is to prioritise the 
activities which help to achieve 
our Business Plan and comply 
with new regulations. 

Change Delivery is overseen by 
the Change Delivery Board which 
is chaired by a Group Executive 
Committee Member. This 
committee monitors and reports 
on a suite of metrics measuring 
the delivery progress, costs and 
benefits of our transformation 
programmes.

In addition there is a project 
Standard in place which all 
functions must follow and attest 
compliance with. This includes 
reporting and escalation of risks 
to management and the Board.

Outlook

We expect the nature of our 
people risk to remain stable in 
2024, following successful 
delivery of the voluntary 
redundancy programme in 2023 
and with key people metrics 
remaining stable. The impacts on 
colleagues of our transformation 
programme and our changes to 
hybrid working are being 
monitored and managed.

The success of our operations is 
highly dependent on our ability 
to attract, retain and develop 
highly qualified people with the 
right mix of skills and 
behaviours, to support our 
positive culture and growth.

As we continue to implement our 
strategy, our people risk is 
heightened in areas including our 
pay practices, workloads and 
morale, the conduct of colleagues 
or groups of colleagues, and 
industrial relations.

Our HR framework is designed to 
align colleague objectives and 
remuneration to our business 
strategy and culture. It includes 
policies and standards for 
diversity and inclusion, employee 
relations, remuneration, talent, 
resourcing, performance and 
learning.

Our management and Board 
receive regular reporting on key 
issues and developments, 
including succession planning, 
industrial relations, pay, culture 
and diversity. 

We conduct colleague surveys to 
better understand their views and 
use the survey findings to 
improve their experience.

Outlook

We are exposed to the risk from 
potential failure to meet 
regulatory requirements or to 
adequately consider regulatory 
expectations, standards or 
principles. 

We operate in a highly regulated 
environment, interact with 
regulators globally, and are 
subject to a number of regulatory 
initiatives. There are wide-ranging 
consequences of regulatory non-
compliance, including client 
detriment, reputational damage, 
fines and restrictions on 
operations or products.

Accountability for compliance 
with regulatory and legal 
requirements sits with our senior 
management. Our Risk and 
Compliance function supports our 
businesses by providing guidance 
to, and oversight of, the business 
in relation to regulatory 
compliance matters, and carries 
out assurance activities to assess 
the adequacy of systems and 
controls designed to comply with 
regulations and legislation.

We monitor regulatory 
developments and consultations 
and engage with government 
policy teams, industry bodies and 
regulators.

Aligned to our strategy, 
international expansion can 
create additional regulatory 
complexity as our business 
processes and colleagues must 
adapt to meet the expectations of 
the relevant regulators globally. 
In addition, there continues to be 
a high quantum of regulatory 
change across the financial 
services industry with ESG, 
consumer protection and 
operational resilience being the 
key themes globally. Within the 
UK, Consumer Duty, including the 
addition of ‘closed book’ 
products, will continue to be a key 
focus. 

12 Reputational

Principal risk

Management and mitigation

Outlook

Our Reputational Risk 
Management framework and 
dedicated Reputational Risk team 
monitor and report on 
reputational risks, using a suite of 
metrics to monitor stakeholder 
groups.

We have embedded Reputational 
Risk Champions throughout our 
business. They perform an active 
role in identifying and monitoring 
key reputational risks and drivers. 

Key to managing evolving 
stakeholder expectations will be 
to continue to address the 
material aspects of sustainability 
and ESG risk, as well as other 
reputational risks. Such risks may 
include strategic commitments, 
continuity of servicing, and 
evolving regulatory expectations.

Our reputation is the sum of our 
stakeholders’ perceptions, 
which are shaped by the nature 
of their expectations and our 
ability to meet them. There is a 
risk that through our activities, 
behaviours or communications, 
we fail to meet stakeholder 
expectations and adversely 
impact trust and reputation in 
M&G or our brands. 

Failure to effectively manage 
reputational risk could result in 
poor stakeholder outcomes and 
impact our revenues and cost 
base, our ability to attract and 
retain the best staff and potential 
regulatory intervention or action.

Management and mitigation

Outlook

There is a risk that through the 
acts or omissions of individuals 
within M&G, we deliver poor 
outcomes for clients, colleagues, 
or other stakeholders, or that we 
affect market integrity.

Conduct continues to be a key 
theme from our regulators, with 
firm failures often cited as part of 
enforcement actions notably from 
the FCA. We have taken positive 
steps to design and implement 
processes to oversee, measure 
and report on conduct risk during 
2023 and these will be embedded 
during 2024. 

Observing the proper standards 
of conduct in all its forms is 
essential at M&G. Due to the 
broad nature of conduct risk, 
management is pervasive and 
reflected in policy and processes 
including but not limited to: our 
Code of Conduct and our Conflict 
of Interest, Market Abuse and 
Investment Communications 
Recording policies.

Our Asset Management business 
has a Conduct Management 
Framework to provide a 
consistent process for conduct 
management and our Life and 
Wealth businesses have a mature 
suite of customer outcome 
management information in place 
in support of Consumer Duty.

Emerging risks
Emerging risks are potentially significant newly developing or evolving risks, generally characterised by a high degree of 
uncertainty - making them difficult to quantify. 

An annual assessment process identifies our emerging risks, and assesses those that will be subject to management and 
monitoring. The assessment collates input from subject matter experts across our first and second lines of defence, as well as 
external perspectives.

We review the development of emerging risks during the year to update our assessment. We also review our preparedness 
should a risk emerge, incorporating any material developments since the annual assessment.

Examples of emerging risks reviewed by the Executive Risk Committee and the Risk Committee during the year include:

– Artificial intelligence;

– Geopolitical conflicts; and

– Macroeconomic trends and outlook, including the interest rate environment and stagflation.

Climate-related disclosures

Our climate disclosures (including TCFD)

We are committed to taking action on climate change and operating 
our business more sustainably, as we progress on our net zero journey

Our climate-related disclosures set out 
in this section of the report are 
consistent with the four pillars and 
11 recommended disclosures of the 
Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on 
Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), and take into account both the 
all-sector guidance and the 
supplementary guidance for asset 
owners and asset managers. 

Disclosure of our Scope 3 emission 
metrics are presented where availability 
of source data allows. In particular, we 
continue to gather data for our supply 
chain emissions, and improve coverage 
and quality of data for our financed 
emissions. For our supply chain we aim 
to formally report on emissions related to 
purchased goods and services in the 
near future.

For emissions relating to our investment 
portfolio (financed emissions), we have 
increased coverage in the year, and 
expect further improvements as 
availability of data improves, and 
industry guidance extends to a 
broader range of asset classes such as 
asset-backed securities and derivatives.

As climate is a consideration across a 
number of areas of the business, the 
table below provides details of where 
relevant disclosures can be found for 
each of the TCFD recommendations.

Our approach to climate change

By strengthening our frameworks and tools to align M&G and our clients’ 
investments with the climate transition, we are preparing ourselves 
for a low-carbon world

Strategy
As a large investor in both public and 
private assets, our strategy is focused on 
positive real-world change, using the 
levers we have to support the climate 
transition and help our clients manage 
the risks and opportunities brought by 
climate change. This means taking action 
to align our investments so that they 
contribute to and thrive in a low-carbon 
world.

From an investment perspective, we can 
influence decarbonisation through three 
key channels: 

– Investment strategies: Making 

changes to our investment portfolios

– Stewardship: Engaging issuers to 

implement ambitious transition plans

– Advocacy: Engaging with industry and 

policy makers

Alongside portfolio decarbonisation, we 
can play an important role in helping to 
finance and enable climate solutions, to 
accelerate the transition. At M&G, we 
consider this a structural growth 
opportunity we are well placed to 
support, both in developed and 
emerging markets.

Our stewardship approach is based on 
our belief that divestment does not have 
a direct impact on real-world emissions 
reductions. Our priority as an active, 
long-term investor is to encourage 
change through engagement and voting.

Net zero transition

At the same time, governments need to 
create the right conditions for 
accelerated climate action. Here we can 
also play a role through advocacy and 
collective effort, to promote greater 
economy-wide ambition. We do this 
through collaboration with peers and by 
supporting ambitious public climate 
policy and appropriate regulation.

Further details on our engagement and 
implementation strategy for 
investments, as both an asset owner and 
asset manager, are on pages 78-81.

While our operational climate impact is 
smaller than our financed emissions, our 
own direct actions also matter – just as 
the companies we invest in, we need to 
decarbonise our operations, including 
our value-chain emissions, and consider 
environmental impacts and 
dependencies which we are tackling as 
an integral part of our journey to net 
zero. We aim to drive down direct and 
indirect emissions on a Paris-aligned 
timeline. Further details on our 
operational impact and activity to 
support our net zero journey are on 
pages 75-77. 

We recognise that holistic action on 
climate requires us to consider nature-
related issues, to address the systemic 
risks associated with the 
interconnected issues of climate 
change and nature loss (see page 37).

Taking action in 2023
– Submitted a target update to the Net 

Zero Asset Managers Initiative 
(NZAMi), including a 2030 
decarbonisation goal for real estate.

– Adopted an improved asset manager 
net zero investment framework to 
support investment decisions and 
stewardship efforts.

– Introduced a new climate solutions 
investment framework to better 
categorise and measure exposure to 
climate solutions.

– Used the net zero investment 

framework in the development of the 
newly launched Sustainable Alpha 
Opportunities Fund.

– Continued to implement our asset 

manager Thermal Coal Policy, focusing 
on issuers in OECD/EU countries, and 
prepared for further review of non-
OECD/EU companies in 2024.

– Progressed engagement with the top 

40 emitters in our asset owner 
portfolios, in line with our Net-Zero 
Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) 
commitment, to encourage net zero 
alignment.

– Joined the newly formed Institutional 
Investors Group on Climate Change 
(IIGCC) Net Zero Engagement 
Initiative and Nature Action 100.

– Participated in climate and nature-

related best-practice work through 
the Climate Financial Risk Forum.

least 67% of our operational supply 
chain emissions by 2030*.

Issuers representing 70% of financed 
emissions (Scope 1 and 2, public equity 
and corporate debt) either assessed to 
have credible transition plans, or 
engaged to help ensure those 
companies are Paris aligned.

Engage with 40 largest emitters and 
reduce sectoral emissions by 2030*: 
Utilities (60%); Oil, Gas and Coal (50%); 
Materials and steel (40%); Transport, 
road (50%); Transport, aviation (25%); 
and Transport, shipping (25%).

*      Target against 2019 baseline.
†      The interim decarbonisation targets for public assets and real estate cover Scope 1 and 2 financed emissions.

Targets
We have committed to reach net zero 
emissions by 2050 at the latest, across 
our investments and operations. We 
recognise that Paris-aligned action is 
path-dependent, and have set interim 
decarbonisation targets for in-scope 
investments as well as our operations. 
Our operational emissions form part of 
the non-financial remuneration metrics 
used for our Executive Directors. 

We are conscious of the difference 
between 'paper' emissions reductions 
and decarbonisation in the real world, 
and hence the need for clear attribution. 
We also realise the importance of a just 
transition, where the costs and benefits 
are shared fairly between generations, 
communities and regions.

Priorities for 2024
– Implement our evolved net zero 

investment framework, including our 
new climate solutions investment 
framework.

– Progress our climate and nature-
related stewardship activities, 
individually and collaboratively.

– Continue engagement with existing 
and prospective clients, to increase 
assets in scope of our interim targets.

– Engage with our supply chain to 

encourage ambitious transition plans 
and reduce our indirect operational 
emissions.

– Enhance our climate strategy across 

asset classes.

Governance
Governance over climate risks and 
opportunities follows our overall 
sustainability governance model. 
Further details of how the Board and 
sub committees discharge their 
responsibilities in relation to 
sustainability (including climate) are 
set out in the sustainability 
governance section of the 
strategic report.

Key developments in the year include 
the appointment of a Chief Sustainability 
Officer and new Head of Sustainability 
for the asset manager.

Find out more on sustainability 
governance on pages 38-39

Business planning
The Board is responsible for approving 
the Business Plan annually. Where we 
have a reasonable estimate of the 
income or expenditure related to our 
climate actions, and these are expected 
to materialise over the plan period (three 
years), we capture it in our business 
planning process. For example, change 
programme spend and anticipated 
growth in sustainability-focused fund 
propositions are captured in the plan.

Reporting 
We value the importance of clear and 
decision-useful climate disclosures, to 
enable all stakeholders to assess our 
strategy and progress. In 2023, we have 
expanded our climate-related 
disclosures to cover in-scope entities 
and products as required by the FCA. 
We have also widened our independent 
limited assurance to cover selected 
financed emissions metrics for the first 
time, including data on public assets and 
sovereign debt.

The Audit Committee is responsible for 
oversight and development of assurance 
around sustainability reporting, including 
climate disclosures.

Climate risks and opportunities

Climate risk
The identification, assessment and 
management of climate-related risks, 
along with other ESG-related risks, is 
integrated into our ESG Risk 
Management Framework. Climate 
change falls under sustainability and 
ESG, a principal risk for M&G, and is 
therefore a key area of oversight for our 
Risk and Compliance teams. 

Consideration of sustainability risk is 
built into our decision-making, with 
sustainability themes and risk factors 
being incorporated into our general 
investment and risk management 
processes.

Climate risk identification
As part of our Own Risk and Solvency 
Assessment (ORSA) we have used our 
in-house climate modelling expertise to 
explore the potential financial impacts of 
physical and transition risks on our 
balance sheet through four different 
climate scenarios (Orderly Net Zero 
2050, Disorderly Divergent Net Zero, 
Disorderly Delayed Transition and Hot 
House World Nationally Determined 
Contributions). The scenarios use the 
Network for Greening the Financial 
System (NGFS) phase 3 scenarios as a 
basis, with additional inputs taken from 
the 2015 Burke et al. study on the effects 
of temperature on economic production, 
the Emergency Events Database, and 
the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index 
to support the modelling of physical risk.

The results of our 2023 modelling 
indicates that a Hot House scenario 
continues to have the most significant 
impact on our balance sheet, while 
disorderly scenarios are more adverse 
than an orderly transition. The likelihood 
of an orderly transition appears to be 
falling, due to the gap between global 
action and Paris-aligned pathways. 

As a result we have strengthened our 
focus on disorderly outcomes. In 2023, 
we explored the impacts of an additional 
disorderly scenario, Divergent Net Zero, 
which assumes that the transition 
diverges across countries and sectors. 
The modelling undertaken this year is a 
progression of the work carried out for 
the 2022 ORSA.

In addition to this overall balance sheet 
modelling, we also continue to 
undertake more granular, asset-by-asset 
modelling to support integration across 
our investment teams. The climate 
model we use for public assets – Aladdin 
Climate – was updated in 2023 to better 
reflect the latest scientific 
developments, as well as new data sets, 
including issuer net zero target 
information (eg Science Based Targets 
initiative and CDP data). 

Find out more on this scenario 
analysis on pages 85-88

Scenario analysis acts as a useful tool for 
interrogating and understanding how 
climate-related developments could 
impact the assets we manage and 
administer. We will continue to develop 
our in-house climate scenario capability, 
both quantitatively and qualitatively, 
recognising modelling limitations and the 
importance of continual evaluation of 
assumptions.

Navigating uncertainty
We recognise that climate change 
presents a range of complex and 
interconnected transition and physical 
risks that are hard to capture in long-
term quantitative scenario modelling. 
This includes non-linear change and 
second-order impacts (see examples in 
the diagram below), which could affect 
the issuers and assets we invest in as 
well as whole economies. 

As an example, physical risk model 
outputs could change materially should 
so-called tipping points be incorporated. 
Tipping points represent potentially 
irreversible changes to the climate 
system that could accelerate the pace 
and impacts of acute and chronic 
physical climate events. These effects 
are practically challenging to include in 
model parameters, meaning physical risk 
impacts may be underestimated in 
models that do not include them.

In view of these limitations, and 
acknowledging growing awareness of 
the need for more qualitative 
approaches, we are exploring short-term 
scenarios that can accommodate more 
complexity, higher uncertainty, and that 
are more representative of the real 
world. To date this has been through 
industry forums such as the Institute and 
Faculty of Actuaries and the Climate 
Financial Risk Forum. 

Climate risk as a business
We are exposed to transition and 
physical risks in our operations and 
through our supply chain, both of which 
could have an impact on our business 
continuity, costs and assets. Our 
Workplace Solutions team monitor and 
manage our operational emissions 
footprint, including engagement with our 
suppliers. More details on this can be 
found on page 75.

We are also aware of reputational 
climate risk to our business, such as not 
meeting our targets or overstating our 
work. In 2023, we have carried out 
structured activity to assess the 
effectiveness of greenwashing risk 
mitigation controls and strengthen these 
where appropriate. This has included the 
rollout of mandatory greenwashing 
training across the business.

Transition and physical impacts
We take a holistic view of climate risks across a range of timeframes (short term: <3 years (consistent with our business planning 
cycle); medium term: 3-10 years; long term: 10+ years).

Both transition and physical risks have the potential to impact the value of the assets we manage on our clients’ behalf (find out 
more about our investment scenario analysis on pages 85-88), which directly influences our revenue and the value of assets held 
on our balance sheet. The main categories of these risks are illustrated in the table below and are applicable across our different 
legal entities and business areas.

We understand that climate-related risks can overlap and interact, creating compound and cascading impacts, and that the precise 
timing and sequence is hard to predict. Given this uncertainty, the transition and physical risks outlined below have potential to 
arise over a range of timeframes. We believe that both transition and physical risks may start to materialise over the short term, 
with the likelihood and potential impact of the risks rising, and continuing to increase over time.

Monitoring and management
De-risking involves pulling our levers – investment strategy, stewardship, advocacy and operational change – to ensure that the 
portfolios we manage, and our operations, are aligned with the transition, and resilient to physical impacts. Our first-line risk 
management approach is embedded in our thermal coal policies and asset manager net zero investment framework, which in turn 
inform our climate stewardship, including escalation actions and any potential divestment where we do not see sufficient progress. 

We are willing to accept some time-bound transition risk exposure, as long as we can build confidence that investees are on 
sufficiently ambitious decarbonisation trajectories. Some physical hazards are more prominent for asset classes such as real estate 
and infrastructure, and involve location-specific assessments of existing and new assets (see our private asset scenario analysis on 
page 88).

Our asset manager investment teams have access to a range of proprietary tools to help them identify, assess and monitor climate 
risks for different types of assets, drawing on our ESG database. These include our ESG scorecard, which incorporates climate-
related analysis, and the portfolio analytics tool (PAT), which helps our investment teams monitor climate data and track progress 
against relevant benchmarks. 

Operationally, we are managing both direct and indirect transition risks, for example through our renewable energy procurement 
and active engagement with our supply chain. Effective management of these risks is important to ensure that we maintain and 
strengthen our competitive position.

Climate opportunities
The climate transition presents major 
long-term investment opportunities 
across asset classes and markets, both 
from a mitigation and adaptation 
perspective. 

Many drivers are now converging to 
accelerate the shift away from fossil 
fuels, including technological progress, 
falling costs of renewable energy and 
storage, and government policy. 

We cannot predict the exact pace of 
change, but climate action is a structural 
opportunity aligned with our purpose 
and strategy.

Whether clients are looking for climate-
focused strategies, including energy 
transition opportunities, or increased 
exposure to sustainability and impact-
oriented funds, we offer a wide range of 
capabilities. 

We are also driving action in our 
operations, by reducing our direct and 
indirect impacts, and educating our 
employees.

Climate strategies and solutions 

As a large investor in both public and 
private assets we are strongly placed to 
finance and enable climate solutions, 
both in developed and emerging 
markets. We can back early-stage 
innovation through our impact and 
private equity offering, and have 
significant capabilities in infrastructure 
and real estate.

Through responsAbility, our emerging 
markets impact manager, we also 
support the deployment of solutions in 
the developing world, including use of 
blended finance, which is when public 
sources of finance are combined with 
private capital to de-risk and mobilise 
greater investment in emerging and 
frontier markets.

In terms of public assets, as part of our 
Planet+ range of funds, we offer 
targeted strategies that provide our 
clients with exposure to solutions 
providers and Paris-aligned benchmarks. 
Our wider product offering is also 
evolving: the share of strategies in our 
SICAV fund range compliant with SFDR 
Articles 8 (where a financial product 
promotes environmental or social 
characteristics) and 9 (where a financial 
product has sustainable investment as 
its objective) has risen to 79% at the end 
of 2023, up from 54% at the end of 2022.

Our asset manager is improving the 
frameworks it uses to assess transition 
and net zero alignment, including the 
classification of climate solutions and 
critical ‘transition enablers’. This is 
feeding into strategy development – for 
example, our newly launched 
Sustainable Alpha Opportunities fund 
(SAOF) uses our evolved net zero 
investment framework categories as 
part of its monitoring criteria. 

As an asset owner, propositional 
development and climate solutions 
exposure is important too. Since we 
launched PruFund Planet in 2021, clients 
have been given the opportunity to 
access solutions which have positive 
environmental and societal objectives, as 
well as the same smoothing mechanism 
and risk profile as PruFund. 

The PruFund Planet proposition is a 
family of five funds differentiated by risk 
level, with an investment strategy and 
manager selection that prioritises 
sustainability and positive impact. 

Over the year, our asset owner has 
seeded and made allocations to 
investment strategies managed by 
responsAbility, taking advantage of new 
expertise and capabilities within the 
Group. We believe these allocations are 
both diversifying to the current life fund 
investment strategy and represent 
positive sustainability outcomes.

M&G’s Catalyst investment strategy, 
backed by our With-Profits Fund, invests 
in assets that contribute to a sustainable 
economy. This is achieved by investing in 
companies that act to avoid harm, 
benefit stakeholders and contribute to 
solutions.

Across our business, we continue to 
identify attractive climate-related 
investments in many markets, and we 
expect the opportunity set of climate 
solutions to continue to expand as the 
transition builds momentum.

Making a difference

Climate impact in emerging markets
In 2023, our emerging markets impact 
manager, responsAbility, launched a 
new climate-focused strategy, the Asia 
Climate Fund (ACF). It also achieved 
the final closing of the Climate Smart 
Agriculture & Food Systems Fund 
(CSAFSF), which launched in 2021. 
Both use blended finance structures, 
where public and private sector capital 
is combined to drive impact.

on the Asian region and targets 
decarbonisation in the commercial 
and industrial sectors, by promoting 
mitigation technologies, including 
distributed energy generation and 
storage, electric mobility, and energy 
efficiency. 

The CSAFSF’s objective is to mobilise 
private capital for the implementation 
of climate-smart initiatives relating to 
global food systems, targeting small 
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
in parts of Asia, Latin America 
and Africa.

The ACF received a prestigious award 
during COP28, linked to the USAID 
Climate Finance for Development 
Accelerator. The strategy is focused

Climate change and our operations

Operational targets
We have set an emissions target for our 
corporate operations aligned with a 
Paris-aligned 1.5°C pathway, using 2019 
as our baseline. Our near-term 
operational carbon reduction targets are: 

– Reducing Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) 

carbon emissions (tCO2e) from our 
buildings by 46% by 2030 from a 
2019 baseline

– Reduce business travel carbon 

emissions (tCO2e) by 46% by 2030 
from a 2019 baseline

– Engage with suppliers to encourage 
them to set carbon reduction targets 
aligned with climate science, with an 
aim to cover a minimum of 67% of our 
Scope 3 supply-chain emissions by 
2030 (excluding investments)

We have also committed to purchasing 
100% renewable electricity across our 
operational estate by the end of 2025.

Building environmental 
management
By the end of 2023, we operated an 
environmental management system 
(EMS) certified to the internationally 
recognised ISO 14001 standard for five 
out of our six UK offices. This includes 
our new Stirling office, which was 
brought into scope during the year.
We continue to roll out and develop 
guidance and processes to support 
efficient operation of our offices. This 
includes the integration of applicable 
environmental considerations within our 
office selection process, and guidance 
on opportunities to include green 
clauses in our leases. 

To support continual improvement in 
office operations, we issue an annual 
sustainability assessment to offices to 
identify opportunities for improvement 
and lessons learned. 

In 2023, we also maintained our zero-
waste-to-landfill commitment for our UK 
offices where we have operational 
control of the property, and promote this 
as best practice for all other office 
locations. In line with this commitment, 
we have donated over 1,300 items of 
furniture to five charities in 2023, which 
arose from changes at our offices in both 
London and Reading. 

Making a difference

Cutting our buildings' footprint
Throughout 2023 we have implemented 
a number of changes across our 
operational estate to reduce our carbon 
footprint internationally. One example of 
this is our main office in Poland, where 
we have implemented a programme of 
energy-efficient lighting upgrades. 

In our larger UK offices we are also 
rolling out smart building technology. 
This provides real-time buildings data 
to improve operational performance 
by reacting to changes in demand 
based on occupancy. 

Supply chain engagement
The goods and services we procure are 
a significant source of our corporate 
Scope 3 emissions. In 2019, our suppliers 
accounted for around 90% of our 
baseline emissions (c.182,000 tCO2e) 
and we are aiming to report formally on 
these emissions in the near future.

To address this source of emissions we 
have an engagement target of 67% of 
our supply chain emissions (against a 
2019 baseline) to be covered by targets 
aligned with climate science and the 
Paris agreement by 2030. This target 
excludes emissions from our 
investment portfolios.

In 2023, we built on the success of our 
2022 supplier engagement campaign, 
contacting more than 330 of our 
suppliers to gather more information on 
their emissions and target ambitions. 

Through a targeted email campaign, a live 
supplier webinar and one-to-one follow 
ups, we have gained a greater 
understanding of our suppliers' 
sustainability ambitions and carbon 
emissions performance. By assessing 
suppliers' actual data, we were able to 
more accurately determine emissions for 
the campaign supply base, compared to 
relying on a spend-based 
emissions methodology. 

75

For year-end 2022, 58% of our supply 
chain emissions are reported to be 
covered by science-based targets, an 
increase over data assessed for 2021 
(20% covered by science-based targets).

Renewable energy
As part of our ongoing global corporate 
RE100 commitment to reduce Scope 2 
emissions, we source renewable 
electricity across our operational estate. 
In the UK, we purchase high-quality 
REGO-backed (Renewable Energy 
Guarantees of Origin) renewable energy 
across our UK estate, where we have 
ownership of utilities contracts. 

Across our remaining offices, we obtain 
energy from certified renewable energy 
contracts, on-site renewables, and 
purchase of renewable energy attribute 
certificates (EACs), where direct 
renewable energy is not available.

In 2023 98.4% of our electricity use was 
provided by renewable energy (0.6% on-
site generation, 88.7% via procurement 
and 9.1% via EACs).

Enforcement actions 
No fines or regulatory actions have 
occurred during the year for 
environmental incidents.

Buildings Scope 1 and 2 
reduction from baseline

Progress against targets
For our corporate operations carbon 
reduction targets we measure progress 
against our Scope 1 and 2 building 
emissions, and across our business 
travel emissions. We use 2019 as the 
baseline as it was the year the Group 
demerged from Prudential plc. 

Following the acquisition of 
responsAbility in May 2022, its seven 
offices met the criteria of our 
‘operational control’ approach during the 
year, and hence are now included in our 
disclosures for 2023. In accordance with 
our Environmental Metrics Basis of 
Reporting, we have also restated our 
2019 baseline for this change, resulting 
in a 7% increase in market-based 
emissions, and a 6% rise in location-
based emissions. 

While the inclusion of this additional 
source of emissions increases the 
absolute carbon reduction required to 
meet our near-term target of a 46% 
reduction by 2030, we remain on track to 
achieve this target.

At the end of 2023:

– Scope 1 and 2 market-based 

emissions from our buildings have 
reduced by 87% from baseline.

– Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions relating to 
travel, including business travel by air, 
rail and car, transport fuels and other 
emissions have decreased by 31% 
from our baseline as we have 
continued to utilise virtual 
collaboration and more sustainable 
modes of travel where possible. 
However we acknowledge that these 
emissions have increased from 2022, 
largely due to business travel 
restrictions being lifted.

– 58% of supply chain emissions, which 
we have not previously reported on, 
are covered by suppliers with either 
validated or committed science-based 
targets (SBTs).

Performance in the year
When measuring our year on year 
performance we have compared 2023 
with the restated results for 2022 as 
detailed in our GHG Emissions 
Statement on page 77. 

In 2023, our total Scope 1 and 2 market-
based GHG emissions were 703 tCO2eA, 
which is a 55% reduction from 2022 
(restated: 1,565 tCO2e). This decrease is 
largely attributed to a 60% reduction in 
Scope 1 emissions due to the move to 
our new office in Stirling in 2022, 
removing natural gas from our 
operations in Scotland.

In 2023, we also reduced our total 
energy consumption by 39% compared 
to 2022 (restated). Savings have been 
achieved through actions such as 
continued rationalisation of occupied 
space and improvement works eg 
daylight harvesting, and increasing the 
set temperature points in our IT 
equipment rooms, reducing the energy 
demand from cooling. 

Emissions from waste generated 
increased from 20 tCO2e in 2022 
(restated) to 53 tCO2e in 2023, from
280 tonnesA of waste. The changes in 
reported waste emissions are attributed 
to colleagues returning to offices and an 
increase in offices reporting waste to 16 
(2022: 12), covering 69% of our total 
floorspace. In 2023 our UK operational 
recycling rate was 67% which is 
consistent with 2022 (67%).

Similarly, due to colleagues returning 
to offices, emissions from water 
consumption increased in 2023 to 
7 tCO2e from 4 tCO2e in 2022 (restated). 
This equated to 37,592m3A of water used 
in 2023, covering data from 30 offices, 
73% of our total floorspace. We continue 
to work with our offices internationally to 
improve the data availability. 

Due to an increase in colleague journeys, 
reported emissions from land and air 
travel have increased to 7,139 tCO2e in 
2023 from 2,916 tCO2e in 2022 
(restated). Of this increase, 731 tCO2e 
related to the addition of responsAbility.

58%

 Supply chain emissions from suppliers 
with validated or committed SBTs

We continue our transition to a fully 
electric fleet across our UK operations 
by restricting the selection of company 
cars to electric or ultra-low emissions 
vehicles. The proportion of electric 
vehicles rose from 13% of 148 vehicles in 
2022 to 19% of 115 vehicles in 2023. 
In the UK, cars available through our 
colleague salary-sacrifice scheme 
are also limited to ultra-low 
emissions vehicles.

Approach to carbon credits
We prioritise absolute emissions 
reduction, recognising that the use of 
carbon credits to offset residual 
emissions should be the last resort. 
In line with current industry guidance, 
we do not anticipate using carbon 
credits to offset over 10% of our 
residual emissions to reach net zero. 

This year we have purchased carbon 
credits in a nature-based project. 
The project has been assessed 
against our offsetting principles, 
which align to the Oxford Principles 
for Net Zero Aligned Carbon 
Offsetting. We continue to assess the 
voluntary carbon market and 
emerging guidance when purchasing 
carbon credits.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions Statement
We have compiled our global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the Companies (Directors’ Report) 
and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018. 

GHG emissions are broken down into three scopes; we have included full reporting for Scope 1 & 2, and selected Scope 3 
reporting as best practice. Scope 1 emissions are our direct emissions from the combustion of fuel, fugitive emissions and 
company-owned vehicles. Scope 2 emissions cover our indirect emissions from the purchase of electricity (including use of 
company electrical vehicles), heating and cooling. We have reported our Scope 2 emissions using both the location and 
market-based methods in line with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Our Scope 3 footprint currently includes business 
travel (category 6) booked through our travel providers, car travel in colleague-owned cars (category 6), water consumption 
(category 1) and waste generation (category 5) from occupied properties (where data is available). Due to an increase in 
floorspace sub-let in our London office, for the first time this year we have also included emissions from leased property 
(category 13), where data is available. The financed emissions (category 15) from our investment portfolios are reported 
separately on pages 82-84.

Please refer to our Environmental Metrics Basis of Reporting 2023 (Basis of Reporting) for further detail on our methodology. 
Data is presented gross of any carbon credits. Selected metrics reported for 2023 (as indicated by A) have been subject to

Our GHG emissions are prepared in line with The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard. Further details on our calculation methodology, including emission factors used can 
be found in our Basis of Reporting which is available on our website. 

Waste: Our 2022 reported Scope 1 & 2, and selected Scope 3 emissions have reduced by 8% to 
4,505 tCO2e (previously 4,880 tCO2e) attributed to the removal of the materials use emissions factor 
originally applied to our Scope 3 waste emissions. The removal of the materials use emissions factor has 
also reduced our 2019 baseline emissions for waste from 370 tCO2e to 19 tCO2e.
responsAbility: The 2019 baseline has been updated to include responsAbility (rA) – further details on 
rA can be found on page 76. Total Scope 1 & 2, and selected Scope 3 baseline emissions increased by 
980 tCO2e from the addition, largely reflecting business travel emissions.
Company car energy data: We have also restated our 2019 baseline figure for total energy consumption 
to 29,490 MWh (previously 26,205 MWh) to reflect the inclusion of data for company cars which was 
previously unavailable. No update to emissions was required.

Investments – implementation strategy

Climate transition alignment
Top-down analysis helps monitor and 
manage exposures and portfolio 
decarbonisation, but to address climate-
related risks and opportunities properly, 
each issuer and asset needs to be 
assessed on an individual basis. And, 
importantly, the ability to influence real-
world change is different between public 
and private markets.

Our evolving frameworks and tools allow 
us to build a clearer picture of issuers' 
climate profiles, including the 
identification of critical 'transition 
enablers' who are helping the world 
mitigate and adapt. They also support 
our stewardship efforts, by highlighting 
areas of misalignment and therefore 
priorities for engagement.

Net zero investment actions
We believe supporting an orderly 
transition to net zero will reduce risk at 
the system level and for the issuers and 
assets we invest in on behalf of our 
clients. It will also present opportunities 
that we are well positioned to access as 
an active manager across public and 
private markets. We have committed to 
support the goal of net zero GHG 
emissions by 2050, in line with global 
efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C, by 
working with our clients. 

Our approach to aligning investments 
with climate goals is built upon three key 
actions, through which we can support 
decarbonisation and real-world 
transformation. 

– Growing our allocations to companies 
and assets critical to the transition that 
are already aligned, to help them 
prosper and displace higher emitting 
activities. We aim to do this by 
providing our investment teams with 
high-quality research on companies 
and assets core to the transition and 
developing products that support the 
net zero transition. 

– Aligning issuers and assets with a net 

zero pathway through active 
ownership to reduce emissions in the 
real economy. We aim to do this by 
engaging with issuers and assets 
directly to set net zero targets and 
plans but also by engaging with 
policymakers and industry bodies to 
create the conditions for success. 

– Reallocating away from risky high GHG 
emitting issuers or assets that aren’t 
able or willing to transition. Our first 
priority will be to grow our 
investments in solutions providers and 
to engage. If our engagement is 
unsuccessful and companies have 
significant exposures to climate risks, 
as a last resort we can reallocate the 
capital to lower emissions assets or 
solutions providers.

Coal policy implementation
Our approach to thermal coal provides 
a foundation for dealing with other 
high-carbon investments. Coal is a 
priority because of its global emissions 
impact and the risk of stranded assets as 
the transition gathers pace. 

Our asset owner has developed a 
thermal coal approach, aligned with the 
Group thermal coal position, which 
covers public assets. Since 2021, this has 
resulted in coal-related exclusions 
across our shareholder annuity and with-
profits businesses.

Our position, as set out in March 2021, is 
that thermal coal needs to be phased out 
by 2030 in OECD and EU countries, and 
by 2040 in the rest of the world – 
a forward-looking approach to enable 
positive real-world change in line with 
the Paris Agreement.

The asset manager Thermal Coal 
Investment Policy, which came into 
effect in April 2022, applies to all listed 
equities and public fixed income 
investments actively managed on behalf 
of M&G Investment's clients (excluding 
those managed by M&G Investments 
Southern Africa), unless a client has 
requested to opt out. At the end of 2023, 
the policy covered 32% of our asset 
manager's AUMA.

Over 2023, we have focused on 
implementing the OECD/EU list of 
exceptions and exclusions. This has 
resulted in further divestments where 
we have deemed issuers unwilling or 
unable to align with our phase-out 
timeline. We have also been identifying 
and assessing non-OECD/EU issuers in 
line with the timeframes of the policy.

More details on in-scope assets and 
policy thresholds can be found in the 
Thermal Coal Investment Policy on our 
website. Our Wealth advice business is 
not covered by these policies.

Asset Manager
Our asset manager Net Zero Investment 
Framework has evolved over 2023, in 
line with guidance from the Institutional 
Investors Group on Climate Change 
(IIGCC), to better track and manage two 
key pillars of our investment transition 
approach: decarbonising the assets we 
manage and increasing investments in 
climate solutions. Our new net zero 
investment framework provides a clearer 
differentiation of issuers' net zero 
commitments and maturity, helping our 
engagement efforts, and giving us a 
more accurate view of the transition 
alignment of the portfolios we manage. 
Issuers will be placed in one of six 
categories, which include 'net zero 
aligned', 'net zero aligning' and 
'not aligned'.

Our asset manager has also introduced a 
separate and complementary climate 
solutions investment framework, aligned 
with existing and emerging taxonomies. 
The framework will provide consistency 
in measurement and allow us to better 
categorise and monitor issuers' 
exposure to the structural growth 
themes of climate mitigation 
and adaptation. 

Together these frameworks will provide 
a more holistic and decision-useful 
transition 'dashboard' for our investment 
teams. We are applying these 
frameworks to public equities and debt 
in the first instance, with private credit 
also covered by the net zero investment 
framework, with plans to extend them to 
asset classes such as sovereign bonds 
and other unlisted assets. 

The net zero investment framework has 
already played a part in investment 
strategy development, notably our newly 
launched Sustainable Alpha 
Opportunities Fund. This diversified 
fixed income strategy will allocate to 'net 
zero aligned' or 'aligning' assets, 
including companies with net zero 
targets, and expects this allocation to 
increase over time.

Asset manager interim emissions targets
As a member of NZAMi, our asset manager business made an initial commitment in 2021 to halve the carbon footprint of in scope 
investments managed on behalf of our asset owner business by 2030. Real estate assets were added in 2023, with a commitment 
to reduce the carbon footprint by 36% by 2030. The total commitment represented 30.4% (£92 billion) of asset manager AUMA as 
at 31 December 2022 (the reference point for our last update). We plan to provide a progress update in 2024.

Private assets and real estate

Our private assets business invests 
across a range of private markets, 
including leveraged finance, unlisted real 
estate equity, unlisted infrastructure 
equity, real estate finance, private asset-
backed securities and books of 
consumer loans and mortgages. 

Over 2023, our real estate equity 
business continued desk-based 
decarbonisation modelling for direct real 
estate investments, using the Carbon 
Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) as our 
primary tool. Over half of our real estate 
funds have either completed or are in the 
final stages of detailed studies to 
understand their own net-zero carbon 
pathway. Implementation of the UK and 
Europe Sustainable Development and 
Refurbishment Framework has also 
progressed, enhancing our standards on 
operational and embodied carbon in new 
developments and refurbishments. We 
have continued to deploy solutions to 
collect occupier energy data across our 
largest portfolios, and completed further 
asset-level net zero carbon audits, 
enabling integration of decarbonisation 
costs within asset plans. 

Climate impact continues to be a 
strategic priority for Infracapital, our 
private infrastructure arm. The focus on 
climate change and the need to 
accelerate the transition to a low-carbon 
economy has created a number of 
investment opportunities for 
Infracapital’s strategies, from thermal 
battery solutions and electric vehicle 
charging infrastructure, to the 
decarbonisation of the logistics sector. 
Additionally, Infracapital works actively 
across its broader portfolio to 
understand climate risks and 
opportunities, and establish 
decarbonisation initiatives. 

In 2023, Infracapital demonstrated its 
commitment to decarbonisation through 
securing sustainability-linked financing for 
Infracapital Partners IV, its latest 
investment strategy. This fund will help 
bridge the investment gap, by investing in 
essential infrastructure across Europe, 
benefiting from transitions in sustainability, 
energy, digitalisation and transport.

Our emerging markets private impact 
manager, responsAbility, continues to 
develop innovative climate-focused 
investment strategies, with its newly 
launched Asia Climate Fund winning an 
award at COP28. It is also integrating a 
proprietary carbon emissions monitoring 
and reporting tool called CO2rA, building 
on the successful implementation of a 
similar in-house tool related to the Global 
Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF), 
a public-private strategy that 
responsAbility manages.

Asset owner
In 2021, M&G joined NZAOA, a group of 86 
global institutional investors committed to 
transitioning their investment portfolios to 
help limit global heating to 1.5°C. In line with 
the NZAOA’s Target Setting Protocol, we 
have set interim decarbonisation targets 
for public equity and corporate debt, direct 
real estate and carbon-intensive sectors, 
and plan to provide a progress update in 
2024. We are also evolving our approach to 
climate strategy and decarbonisation in line 
with changing best practice, and may, as a 
result, review the actions we take to align 
with the climate transition.

Asset manager selection

From a sustainability perspective, we 
consider the purpose of manager 
selection to be to identify an investment 
manager that has the people, processes 
and expertise in place to meet the 
requirements specified in the investment 

79

mandate. To achieve this, we ensure our 
selection process includes a 
comprehensive assessment against 
sustainability-specific criteria, to enable 
an appropriate review of the managers’ 
alignment with our purpose, values and 
priorities, including climate change.

We perform investment due diligence to 
assess managers’ ability to deliver the 
expected investment performance or 
outcome for a fund over the long term. This 
is informed by our bespoke Request for 
Proposal (RfP) process, which includes 
detailed ESG investment-led questions. In 
turn, this is supported by the RfP ESG due 
diligence questionnaire, which aims to 
assess managers’ stance on key 
sustainability issues. This questionnaire 
includes a specific section on climate 
change, aiming to assess the robustness 
and alignment of the manager’s net zero 
ambitions against our own. 

Once an investment manager has been 
selected and onboarded, the Manager 
Oversight team conducts ongoing due 
diligence reviews. This includes regular 
meetings and site visits. Sustainability is 
a standing agenda item at quarterly 
meetings. Ahead of these meetings, 
managers are expected to complete an 
ESG due diligence questionnaire, which 
aims to assess any changes to the 
managers’ sustainability activities or 
priorities. 

In 2023, our asset owner worked on the 
identification of specific companies and 
sectors where we expect managers to 
explain their investment rationales and 
engagement efforts. This has been done 
by screening our portfolios for 
companies of interest (currently those 
that are exposed to modern slavery risk 
as well as those that have high carbon 
emissions) and asking our managers to 
carry out engagement.

Investments – engagement strategy

Asset manager
Stewardship is one of the key levers we 
have to drive real-world climate action. 
By requesting that those representing 
the highest Financed Carbon Emissions 
(FCE) in M&G Investment's listed equity 
and fixed income portfolios adopt 
credible targets and transition plans, we 
can support the acceleration of 
decarbonisation and reduce our 
investment-related emissions. 

In 2023, we undertook a review of the 
first three years of M&G Investments' 
Hot 100 Engagement Programme, which 
covers the 100 companies that account 
for a majority of our asset manager's 
financed emissions in listed equity and 
corporate fixed income (excluding M&G 
Investments Southern Africa – MGSA).

By the end of the year, we had either 
engaged with, or assessed, 70 of the Hot 
100 companies identified in January 
2023 – representing 85% of the financed 
carbon emissions of the asset manager's 
holdings in this target group. 

We also have a public asset engagement 
programme specifically targeting investee 
companies with exposure to thermal coal, 
to determine if they are compliant with our 
Asset Manager Thermal Coal Investment 
Policy. Over 2023, we engaged with 
10 coal-related investees.

Of the 10 engagements undertaken in 
2023, four were successful, resulting in 
those companies being compliant with 
the coal policy and eligible for 
investment. Five of the engagements 
were unsuccessful, resulting in those 
investees being added to the coal 
exclusions list and divested. 
The remaining engagement was 
inconclusive, but we divested for 
other reasons. 

For our private investments, 
engagement is important too. We are 
focused on encouraging improved 
climate-related disclosures, to help us 
track decarbonisation efforts and better 
understand risk exposure. 

Collaborative engagement

We have been an active member of 
Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) since 
2017. CA100+ is an investor-led initiative 
to ensure the world's largest corporate 
greenhouse gas emitters take necessary 
action on climate change. 

We represent over 700 members of 
CA100+ as co-leads on three specific 
engagements, targeting investee 
companies in the mining (Rio Tinto), 
chemical (BASF) and cement (Holcim) 
sectors. We also sit on the CA100+ 
Corporate Programme Advisory Group 
and Net Zero Stewardship Working 
Group, and are active members of 
six additional company-specific 
working groups. 

In 2023, we joined a broader initiative, 
the IIGCC Net Zero Engagement 
Initiative, to ratchet up engagement with 
some of the highest emitters we own 
that do not feature on the CA100+ list. 
Here we are co-leads on four companies 
in the forestry (UPM), cement (Buzzi) 
and chemical (Linde and Yara) sectors. 

We also became members of Nature 
Action 100 (NA100), which is modelled on 
CA100+, but targets companies with high 
exposure to biodiversity and nature loss. 

We are co-leads on five NA100 
companies; three complementing our 
climate work (Rio Tinto, UPM and BASF), 
and the other two in the pharmaceutical 
sector (AstraZeneca and Novo Nordisk). 
We have also been working with the 
Investor Forum and ShareAction on a 
variety of collective engagements.

Asset owner 
As an asset owner, we rely on the asset 
managers we appoint to exercise direct 
climate engagement in line with our 
policies and objectives. 

During 2023 we have been developing our 
engagement strategy and monitoring, 
focused on the 40 largest carbon emitters 
in our portfolios. We have also looked at 
high-emitting companies in sectors where 
we have set targets, some of which fall 
outside of the top 40 list. 

External managers

Although engagements are executed by 
our asset managers, we hold them 
accountable for the interactions they 
have with investee companies, and 
engage with them to deliver our desired 
results. Having a robust approach and 
process in place to engage with asset 
managers is key to ensure the best 
outcomes for our policyholders and 
clients.

Overall, we expect engagement 
processes and actions to be aligned with 
the PAC ESG Investment Policy, 
Shareholder Engagement Policy and 
Voting Standard, as well as the agreed-
upon mandate. Should we feel that there 
is persistent misalignment, we will 
escalate our engagement.

The Treasury & Investment Office team 
follow a structured approach to 
engagement, defined by the following 
actions:

– Annual letter of priorities: we share an 
Annual Letter of ESG Priorities with all 
our asset managers, outlining our key 
areas of focus, which will form the 
basis of requests and dialogue 
throughout that year.

– Engagement and voting analysis: all 
asset managers will be requested to 
submit regular sustainability 
engagement and voting templates to 
provide an update on their stewardship 
activities. This will be reviewed and 
assessed on an ongoing basis. 

– Ad hoc engagement: where specific 

engagement activities require further 
due diligence/escalation, or where 
specific changes have occurred within 
the managers’ sustainability activities 
or priorities that are a cause for 
concern, the ESG & Regulatory team 
will aim to organise ad hoc 
engagement meetings with the asset 
managers. 

In the case of climate change, as detailed 
within our Asset Owner ESG Investment 
Policy, we rely on our investment 
managers to engage with investee 
companies to change behaviour, 
improve disclosure, reduce emissions, 
and, where in line with our investment 
mandates, to allocate capital towards 
low-emission sectors of the economy, 
including climate solutions. Our asset 
managers provide periodic reporting of 
their engagements, covering objectives 
and progress. We monitor these 
engagements in select cases, with a 
view to informing strategies and 
positions. We may work with our 
investment managers to tilt our 
portfolios away from investee companies 
that are not on sufficiently ambitious 
reduction paths.

We view the exclusion of any company 
on the basis of their carbon emissions as 
an action of last resort that should only 
be taken if we are certain that 
engagement will not lead to meaningful 
strategic and operational change. 

Public policy 
and industry engagement
We recognise that the climate transition 
will not reach the necessary pace and 
scale without the right public policy 
frameworks, and remain committed to 
advocacy and industry collaboration, to 
create a more supportive environment 
for ambitious climate action.

Public policy advocacy 

M&G continues to engage constructively 
with UK and EU policymakers on a wide 
range of sustainability public policy 
topics. We do this individually and 
through a variety of membership bodies. 
Over 2023, our climate advocacy 
involved contributing to the UK 
Government’s updated Green Finance 
strategy, the work of the Transition Plan 
Taskforce to set out a best-in-class 
template for corporate disclosure on the 
transition, the FCA’s Sustainability 
Disclosure Regime and the European 
Commission’s proposals to review SFDR. 
M&G also co-chaired the FCA-convened 
Working Group to develop a Code of 
Conduct for ESG data and ratings 
providers.

We have called for a comprehensive 
policy framework that sets out a reliable 
pathway for investors and market 
participants. Such a framework would 
contain, among other things: ambitious, 

81

and mandatory decision-useful 
disclosure requirements from both 
public and private companies, creating 
long-term clarity for investors’ decision-
making; proper incentivisation of climate 
solutions (ensuring critical technologies 
reach scale and competitive 
commercialisation quicker); support for 
credible transition activities; meaningful 
prudential regulation reform and broader 
policy action to capture nature and 
biodiversity loss. 

In 2023, we have also responded to 
reporting-related consultations from the 
Department for Business and Trade, 
Financial Reporting Council and the 
International Sustainability Standards 
Board (ISSB).

We recognise that closing the climate 
financing gap requires direct 
deployment of capital towards solutions, 
and have worked with UK policymakers 
on ways to increase institutional 
investors’ allocation to private assets. 
M&G was a co-founding member of the 
government’s Mansion House Compact, 
putting patient capital to work to the 
benefit of both innovative businesses 
and individual savers.

Industry advocacy 

As part of our ongoing active 
memberships of the Investment 
Association, Principles for Responsible 
Investment, the Investor Forum, IIGCC 
and Association of British Insurers, 
among others, we continue to 
participate in a range of discussions, 
including ones focused on climate.

M&G plc is part of a coalition of 
governments, businesses and 
organisations in the Powering Past Coal 
Alliance (PPCA). We have engaged on the 
PPCA's Declaration, which reflects the 
latest scientific consensus and confirms 
that coal power must be phased out by 
2030 and 2040 in OECD and non-OECD 
economies, respectively. During 2023, we 
have also provided detailed feedback as 
part of the PPCA’s Finance Principles 
refresh, to reflect the evolving science as 
well as the financial service sector’s 
ambition on coal phase-out.

M&G is also leading the nature work 
stream of the Climate Financial Risk 
Forum’s Financial Resilience working 
group, providing industry guidance on 
how to incorporate nature into financial 
services risk management.

Investments - Climate metrics

Across our investment portfolios we produce a range of metrics to identify and assess climate-related risks and opportunities. This 
includes absolute emissions metrics as well as intensity-based indicators that enable comparison across different issuers and 
portfolios. In addition to backward-looking data, which indicate the current emissions profile of an asset or portfolio, we also use 
forward-looking metrics to assess transition alignment and potential impacts on asset values over time. For climate metrics relating 
to our corporate operations see our GHG Emissions Statement on page 77. 

The key metrics used across our internal and external reporting are financed carbon emissions (FCE), carbon footprint, and 
weighted average carbon intensity (WACI). For example, we assess FCE change at portfolio level to monitor our overall portfolio 
emissions exposure, while we monitor carbon footprint (a measure of economic emissions intensity) to assess progress against our 
asset manager and asset owner interim targets. WACI is used to understand our portfolio exposure to carbon-intensive issuers. 
We currently rely on Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions to inform investment decisions. While we monitor Scope 3 emissions as a proxy 
for risk exposure to inform targeted actions, such as engaging companies on transition plans, disclosure of this emissions category 
remains poor, which makes it less reliable for decision-making. 

Our emissions metrics have been calculated based on the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) principles. This 
year we have included a data quality score – covering public assets (equities and corporate debt) and sovereign debt emissions – 
for the first time. The score is based on PCAF methodology and ranges from one to five, where one represents the highest data 
quality and five is the lowest. Details on definitions of metrics reported and limitations of data used can be found on pages 89-90, 
with more information provided in our Environmental Metrics Basis of Reporting available on our website.

In our analysis, ‘coverage’ refers to the proportion of in-scope AUMA for which we have sufficient environmental, financial, or other 
data required in the calculation of a given metric. Asset classes such as cash, derivatives and asset-backed securities (ABS) are not 
included, reflecting a lack of either climate accounting standards or mature data sources for these types of assets. Externally 
managed mandates in which the asset owner is invested are also not included. Metrics reported in this section are calculated for 
M&G plc, subject to asset classes included and coverage within these groups.

Our Environmental Metrics Basis of Reporting 2023, available on our website, sets out our policy on restatements. We have 
restated public asset and sovereign debt metrics for the year ended 31 December 2022, primarily as a result of developing our 
calculation methodologies. Further details on the restatements and the impact on the previously presented metrics are set out in 
the relevant section below. All figures presented reflect the annual emissions calculated with reference to in-scope AUMA of each 
asset class as at 31 December for each year.

Selected metrics reported for 2023 (as indicated by A) have been subject to external independent limited assurance by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). PwC's independent limited assurance report is available on our website.

Reclassification of bonds from corporate debt to sovereign debt resulted in a change of in-scope AUMA for this asset class.

Analysis of 2023 compared with restated 2022 metrics

For 2023, despite an increase in coverage we have seen a reduction in FCE and carbon footprint due to the reduction of holdings in 
a high-emission intensity issuer in our M&G Investments Southern Africa (MGSA) portfolio and shifts in market value (which do not 
reflect real-world decarbonisation), both offset by an underlying increase in real-world emissions of investee companies that 
remain in the portfolio. The fall in Scope 3 FCE was driven largely by a reduction of holdings in a small number of high-emission 
intensity issuers in our MGSA portfolio. 

Similar to 2022, the portfolios managed by our MGSA business make up a significant proportion of our FCE at 3,073 ktCO2e 
(2022 restated: 5,365 ktCO2e ) for Scope 1 & 2 and 10,310 ktCO2e (2022 restated: 15,901 ktCO2e) for Scope 3.

Restatement of 2022 metrics previously presented

To increase coverage in 2023, we have expanded the sources of third-party emissions data for public equity and corporate debt to 
include Bloomberg as an additional provider. Further details of our data hierarchy are set out in our Environmental Metrics Basis of 
Reporting, available on our website. As a result of this change, we have restated the 2022 metrics previously presented to include the 
additional source. The increase in coverage has resulted in a rise in reported absolute emissions for public assets in the restated figures. 

The increase in absolute emissions for the restated 2022 figures is larger than the relative increase in coverage, reflecting a 
number of high-emission intensity issuers being captured within the additional coverage. This can also be seen through the 
restated carbon footprint of the portfolio.

Over the year, we have also made a refinement to our methodology for the green bonds emissions data, to base this on the 
estimated emissions of the project funded by the bond rather than the emissions of the issuer, where the data is available. Green 
bonds account for 2.6% of the in-scope portfolio and therefore this revision has had minimal impact on the restated metrics.

Sovereign debt
In the table below, we have included financed domestic production and consumption emissions, and their respective weighted 
average intensities. The presentation has been updated this year to show metrics both as including and excluding Land Use, Land

Reclassification of bonds from corporate debt to sovereign debt resulted in a change of in-scope AUMA for this asset class. 

2023 and 2022 (restated) exclude exported emissions whereas 2022 (previously presented) includes exported emissions. See below for further details.

iii  The data quality score for Scope 2 and 3 metrics are based on economic-activity based emissions from the OECD. 

Analysis of 2023 compared with restated 2022 metrics

In 2023, sovereign emissions increased in line with the increase of in-scope AUMA. The increase in in-scope AUMA is largely driven 
by larger allocations to gilts and treasuries, through new bond funds being brought into scope of our reporting, and also partly from 
market movements – with bond values having a strong end to 2023.

Similar to public equities and corporate debt, our M&G Southern Africa portfolios make up a significant proportion of our sovereign 
FCE at 2,199 ktCO2e (2022 restated: 2,410 ktCO2e) for production emissions and 1,656 ktCO2e (2022 restated: 1,826 ktCO2e) for 
consumption emissions (both including LULUCF).

Restatement of 2022 metrics previously presented

We have reviewed our methodology for sovereign debt emissions against PCAF's Financed Emissions Standard, and as a result have 
restated the 2022 sovereign debt emissions for the following methodology changes:

i The calculation of sovereign production emissions relies on the determination of an attribution factor, using data on the 

sovereign’s gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for the purchasing power parity (PPP) rates in international $. Previously this 
was converted using the World Bank’s PPP conversion factor for the UK and used along with the investment holding in GBP to 
determine the attribution factor. We have updated our methodology to determine the attribution factor using PPP-adjusted GDP 
(international $) and the sovereign bond market value (USD). The change in production emissions following restatement is 
primarily as a result of this change. Financed sovereign production emissions have also been recalculated using an additional 
data source where available for the assets in-scope, as outlined in our Basis of Reporting.

ii In addition to the changes above, financed sovereign consumption emissions are now reported excluding exported emissions. 
Previously no adjustment was made for exported emissions, which is the main driver for the change in restated consumption 
emissions. There has also been a change in the OECD data used for imported emissions which are included in the 
overall calculation.

Our real estate assets recorded a decrease in absolute emissions over the year (13% for Scope 1 & 2), primarily due to reduced in-
scope AUMA as some assets were sold in the year combined with lower market values. Scope 3 emissions have increased due a 
higher energy consumption across the assets occupied and run by tenants as activity has continued to pick up post COVID. Real 
estate emissions have been restated in the year to reflect that some emissions for certain assets were included twice in 2022. 

Infracapital emissions data is based on numbers reported directly from the underlying investee companies, which have not been 
externally verified. The decrease in Scope 1 & 2 emissions is partially due to improved data as well as ongoing emissions reduction 
initiatives across the portfolio, such as the purchase of certified renewable electricity at the asset level, resulting in a drop in Scope 
2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions have increased as investee company reporting becomes more mature, with additional data across 
the supply chain and other Scope 3 categories being added, a trend which we expect to continue as the completeness of investee 
company reporting on this emissions category improves.

Metrics not based on emissions
In addition to emissions-related data, we track metrics that indicate public asset exposure to climate transition risks and 
opportunities, including fossil fuel and EU Taxonomy-aligned exposures.

The fossil fuel exposure data is also relevant from an engagement and voting perspective, as it captures many of the target 
companies in our climate stewardship programme. The fossil fuel exposure metric covering revenue from fossil fuel generation is 
particularly relevant given our approach to thermal coal.

Fossil fuel and EU Taxonomy-aligned/Green bond exposure
The table below covers fossil fuel and green exposures of our public equities and corporate debt portfolios, presenting the 
absolute exposure to each category based on holdings as at 31 December 2023, as well as the proportion of in-scope assets this 
represents.

Metrics in the table above are based on the same £179 billion of in-scope assets used for the public equities and corporate debt 
metrics presented on page 82. Exposure to fossil fuels has decreased in absolute and relative terms across both metrics presented 
in the table. On top of changes initiated by our investee companies, market movements and portfolio changes, our fossil fuel 
exposure can also change due to increased data coverage from our data providers. Green Exposure has increased from last year, 
partly due to bond markets performing well over 2023.

Scenario analysis

Methodology and limitations
Scenario analysis is a type of forward- 
looking assessment used to assess the 
resilience of our equities, corporate and 
sovereign debt, real estate and 
infrastructure portfolios to different 
future climate scenarios. We use climate 
models that have sufficient coverage 
across key funds and our largest issuers. 
Asset classes such as cash, derivatives 
and asset-backed securities are not 
included.

In our analysis, the scope of assets 
included for public and private asset 
portfolios are the same as those in our 
backward-looking metrics unless 
otherwise stated.

We rely on data modelling partners to 
provide us with portfolio, sector, and 
asset-level output data, including:

– future GHG emissions

– emissions intensity

– physical climate damages

– energy flows and demand

– technological capabilities 

This data is provided at an issuer, sector, 
and portfolio level. The data points are 
aggregated to calculate climate-
adjusted valuation metrics and 
temperature-alignment metrics.

The scenario model we use for public 
assets – Aladdin Climate – has been 
updated in 2023, across all three 
modules ('transition', 'physical' and 
'temperature alignment'), to better 
reflect the latest science and incorporate 
new datasets.

As with any model, the results are heavily 
influenced by the assumptions made, 
which significantly influence the outputs.

Scenario global emission trajectories
Million tons of CO₂e/year

We recognise that the climate models 
are based on stylised scenarios, and 
attempt to capture the possible future 
interplay between physical climate 
impacts, policy and regulation, and 
consumer behaviour at a global scale. 

The scenarios are not predictive, but 
rather help us explore a range of 
potential outcomes. This analysis acts as 
a useful tool for interrogating and 
understanding how climate-related 
developments could impact the assets 
we manage and administer.

Another key observation is that the data 
underpinning climate-scenario modelling 
is reported by companies at a lag relative 
to financial data. We have used up-to-
date information where available. 
However, for a subset of our analysis, 
the GHG emissions used in the scenario 
modelling represents data from prior 
years. 

Public assets
For public listed equities, corporate debt 
securities and sovereign debt, we assess 
the financial impact of climate change 
based on three Network for Greening 
the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios:

– An orderly scenario, predicting a 

temperature rise below 2°C by 2100 as 
a result of immediate climate action. 

– A disorderly scenario, in which climate 
action is delayed until 2030, and the 
temperature rise is kept below 2°C. 

– A hot house scenario, which predicts 
an average temperature change of 
over 3°C by 2100, assuming only 
current policies are implemented. 

The underlying NGFS scenarios used to 
produce the climate-adjusted values do 
not include all relevant factors that may 
impact outcomes, for example so-called 
climate tipping points and nature-related 
impacts, which could significantly impact 
the results presented.

The outputs should not be treated as 
forecasts but as an iterative process and 
exploration of possible futures. They are 
best viewed in conjunction with other 
data and qualitative information. These 
scenarios are subject to a number of 
limitations, as described on pages 89 -90.

Private assets
For the real estate and infrastructure 
asset modelling, our output is limited to 
Representative Concentration Pathway 
(RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 only, as produced by 
the IPCC. These broadly align to the 
public asset orderly and hot house 
scenarios. The output of this model is 
limited to the identification of risk level, 
and reinstatement value at risk. 

This is partly due to the fact that the 
model assesses only direct climate risk 
and partly due to the nature of the 
investments.

Find out more on the methodology and 
limitations of the scenario analysis 
performed on our investment portfolios 
on pages 89-90.

Forward-looking metrics 
The key forward-looking metrics that we 
report across public assets are:

– Implied temperature rise: this metric 
allows a user to quickly gauge if a 
portfolio and issuer’s GHG emissions’ 
trajectory is aligned with the Paris 
Agreement through sub-industry and 
regional benchmark comparisons. 

– Climate-adjusted value: this metric is 
equivalent to value at risk (VaR), but is 
calculated on a bottom-up basis, by 
assessing the impact of different 
climate scenarios on a company’s 
financial position. The adjusted value 
is calculated separately for physical 
and transition risks as part of the 
scenario model that we use across our 
public portfolios (Aladdin Climate).

– Binary science-based targets: this 

data shows the proportion of issuers 
who have committed to setting 
science-based targets, or had their 
targets validated by the Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

For private investments, we report 
physical climate risk impacts across fixed 
assets, such as our real estate and 
infrastructure. Here we primarily monitor 
the relative risk score against a range of 
climate-related natural disasters, such as 
storms, flooding and wildfires.

Portfolio alignment 
Portfolio alignment indicators help us assess which portfolio companies have committed to, or are in the process of, aligning to the 
Paris Agreement temperature goals. While companies are not net zero today, this reflects target setting and plans for emissions 
reductions and is therefore a gauge of the transition alignment of our investment strategies going into the future. The binary net 
zero alignment data below is based on public commitments from companies to set science-based targets and have these validated 
by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). SBTi is a widely used framework for independently validated science-based targets. 
The metrics presented exclude companies that may have established climate targets, but have not committed to, or had targets 
validated by the SBTi. 

Science-based targets (public assets)
The table below shows the proportion of our asset manager AUMA that have either committed to or set SBTi targets, together 
representing £61.7 billion, or a total of 1,325 issuers. The number of issuers with SBTi commitments has dropped partly due to SBTi 
tightening its criteria in 2023 and removing companies that have not submitted their targets for validation within 24 months.

While the average across our modelled

the broader economy and therefore not 
surprising at this stage in the climate 
transition. We would expect the figure 
to improve as we work to meet our 2030 
targets for in-scope assets and continue 
to carry out climate engagements with 
investees as part of our stewardship.

Implied temperature rise 
As part of our modelling, we have 
calculated the implied temperature rise 
(ITR) for each individual issuer where 
data is available (covering 88% of in-
scope public equities and corporate debt 
as at 31 December 2023). ITRs are a fairly 
intuitive way to assess transition 
alignment at a point in time, by 
estimating an issuer’s relative share of 
the remaining global carbon budget 
consistent with the Paris Agreement. In 
simple terms, it shows what the global 
temperature rise would be if the whole 
economy followed the same emissions 
pathway as the portfolio analysed. This 
allows us to assess the transition profile 
of the companies we invest in and their 
progress toward driving down 
greenhouse gas emissions, while also 
measuring the effect of any changes we 
make to our portfolios during the year. 

Due to their simplicity, ITRs are 
inherently limited and we recognise the 
following:

– There is no commonly accepted 

approach to temperature alignment 
calculations, which makes 
comparisons across different model 
outputs problematic.

– The methodology we have used 

allocates a carbon budget to each 
company, and compares that 
company’s progress and expected 
future emissions against that budget. 

– The calculation is sensitive to sector 

and geographical emission 
assumptions.

– It is based on carbon intensity 

(emissions per unit of revenue for each 
investee), and on projections of future 
GHG emissions which are subject to 
significant uncertainties.

– The portfolio ITR is calculated as the 

weighted average of individual 
company ITRs.

– ITR by its nature is a point in time 

metric and therefore does not account 
for changes to our portfolios in the 
future.

We do not use ITR in isolation, due to the 
limitations mentioned, but believe it 
provides useful indications of alignment 
when viewed in conjunction with other 
information. 

The chart shows our relative ITR 
exposure, based on portfolio weightings 
to a range of temperature levels. It 
shows that issuers remain aligned to a 
broad range of temperature outcomes. 
While the proportion aligned to below 
1.5°C has increased to 38% (2022: 28%), 
44% of modelled assets still exceed 2°C 
based on the underlying issuers’ 
transition pathways.

The weighted average warming potential 
across modelled issuers (public equities 
and corporate debt) is 2.5°C, which 
represents a reduction from our average 
temperature alignment in 2022 (2.6°C).

Public assets (scenario 
modelling results) 
As part of our forward-looking analysis 
we model our public asset portfolios 
(public equities, corporate debt, and 
sovereign debt) against three scenarios 
to help us quantify the relative financial 
impacts of climate change across 
different outcomes. This assessment is 
based on a bottom-up approach, and 
provides estimates of the financial 
impact on all issuers modelled, as well as 
the impact on asset valuations. 

From an asset value perspective, we can 
take the following findings from our 
scenario modelling in 2023:

– Overall, the results continue to 

indicate that the negative impacts on 
asset values will be felt more broadly 
across all sectors in the hot house 
scenario, driven by the increasing 
physical risk and second-order 
macroeconomic impacts towards the 
end of the scenario horizon. 

– Looking at the sectoral breakdown of 

public listed equities and public 
corporate debt, it is clear that the 
orderly and disorderly scenario 

impacts are most pronounced in the 
energy, industrials and materials sectors 
(where significant change is required to 
decarbonise and align with the 
transition). By contrast, under the hot 
house scenario (looking at physical 
impacts only) asset valuations are 
impacted fairly evenly across all sectors.

As noted on page 86, we recognise that 
the outputs from this analysis are subject 
to limitations, and the results should be 
interpreted with these in mind. 

Further details on limitations of the 
modelling can be found on page 89-90.

Private asset results
We continue to use the global insurance broker and risk adviser Marsh to assess our real estate and infrastructure exposure to 
physical climate risk. Marsh uses XDI which quantifies the cost of extreme weather and climate change impacts to physical assets, 
taking into account asset-specific information – how different types of assets in a specific location will perform in different physical 
conditions. The scenarios used in this model are based on Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5, as produced 
by the IPCC. These broadly align to the orderly and hot house scenarios. Importantly, the modelling does not consider second-
order and transition impacts which could affect asset values. Further details on limitations can be found on page 89-90.

Real estate

For our directly owned real estate equity portfolio, the physical climate risk has remained similar to last year’s levels, identifying 
only a relatively small proportion of assets that are at high risk from future climate conditions. Under each scenario, assets were 
rated low, medium or high risk (high risk meaning at least 1% of an asset’s value being at risk of damage per year). 
The key conclusions of our real estate analysis are that: 

– under an orderly scenario (RCP 2.6) between 5.9% and 8.8% of assets will be rated high risk by 2050 and 2100 respectively; and 

– under a hot house scenario (RCP 8.5) these percentages increase to 6.5% and 11.3%.

For real estate assets, the physical risk is driven by exposure to hydro-meteorological hazards such as floods (eg as a result of their 
proximity to the coast). While future change to climatic conditions will exacerbate financial impacts, exposure to acute physical 
risks can be mitigated through measures such as insurance or localised flood defences. 

The output of this model is limited to the identification of risk level and reinstatement value at risk partly due to the fact that the 
model assesses only direct climate risk and partly due to the nature of the investments.

Infracapital

Model results were analysed for asset locations that were identified as medium or high risk. The results suggest that from the 
assets modelled, only a relatively small proportion of assets are at high risk from future climatic conditions. 

As with the real estate model, assets were rated low, medium or high risk under each scenario. The key conclusions from our 
Infracapital assessment are that: 

– under an orderly scenario (RCP 2.6) between 8.3% and 10.3% of assets will be rated high risk by 2050 and 2100 respectively; and 

– under a hot house scenario (RCP 8.5) these percentages increase to 8.6% and 11.6%.

Supplementary climate metric 
and modelling information

Metric definitions
Financed Carbon Emissions (FCE) 
represent the absolute greenhouse gas 
emissions associated with a portfolio of 
investments where there is available 
reported data or estimates. Financed 
emissions are influenced by change in 
financial factors such as market 
movements and portfolio values, which 
are separate to real world emissions.

Carbon footprint refers to FCE 
normalised by the market value of a 
portfolio (GHG emissions per million 
pounds of investment). This indicator is 
particularly useful for comparative 
purposes, but similar to FCE is sensitive 
to financial factors that do not relate to 
decarbonisation. Carbon footprint is 
used to monitor progress against our net 
zero interim targets.

Weighted Average Carbon Intensity 
(WACI) provides a single metric 
summing the individual emissions 
intensities of issuers in a portfolio based 
on their weightings, indicating our 
portfolio exposure to carbon-intensive 
issuers.

For both carbon footprint and WACI the 
current portfolio value is based on 
market value and is limited to assets for 
which all data necessary for the 
calculation of financed carbon emissions 
is available. For private assets, the 
emissions-related metrics reported are 
FCE and carbon footprint only.

We use data sourced from third-party 
data providers (eg MSCI and Bloomberg) 
to calculate the above emissions metrics. 
While we perform high-level checks on 
the data received, we are reliant upon 
the accuracy of source data received 
from these third-party vendors.

Details on the calculation methodology, 
data sources and limitations of each 
metric produced is available in our 
Environmental Metrics Basis of 
Reporting 2023 available on our website.

In addition to backward-looking metrics 
that are focused on emissions, we 
monitor a range of indicators that 
provide information on whether an asset, 
or portfolio, is exposed to higher climate-
related transition risks or opportunities. 

These include:

– Exposure to fossil fuels: these metrics 

show the value of our exposure to 
issuers with revenues derived from 
the whole value chain of oil, gas and 

coal, with a separate metric for issuers 
that generate revenue from fossil fuel-
based power generation. These 
metrics indicate transition risk, given 
the necessity of phasing out fossil 
fuels to meet the Paris Agreement. 

– EU Taxonomy alignment and Green 

bonds: this is the value of our 
exposure to issuers that are 
generating revenues from green 
activities, as defined by the EU 
Taxonomy (including climate 
mitigation and adaptation) or debt 
classified as Green bonds (CBI aligned 
or CBI certified green bond).

– Climate commitment of issuers: We 
monitor net zero alignment across 
‘committed’ and ‘targets validated’ 
SBTi categories and green exposure. 
These metrics, calculated for public 
listed equities and corporate debt 
portfolios, are helpful in monitoring our 
overall position at portfolio level.

High level methodology 
We have licensed two different climate 
models from third-party providers to 
undertake scenario analysis at the asset/
issuer level: Aladdin Climate for financial 
assets (the ‘equities and bonds model’ 
covering public listed equities, corporate 
and sovereign public debt); and Marsh 
for assessing the private portfolio’s real 
estate and infrastructure exposure to 
physical climate risk. Physical climate 
risk of the private portfolio is modelled 
by Marsh using XDI which quantifies the 
cost of extreme weather and climate 
change impacts to physical assets, 
taking into account asset-specific 
information – how different types of 
assets in a specific location will perform 
in different physical conditions.

Both models are leveraging the 
extensive expertise and experience from 
third-party providers with strong 
capabilities in climate scenario 
modelling, and were selected following 
extensive proof-of-concept exercises. 
However, climate change scenario 
modelling is an inherently complex area 
and so the results presented on pages 
85-88 are influenced by assumptions, 
judgements and limitations. 

These include the nature of scenario 
modelling itself, data limitations and 
specific model limitations from our 
modelling counterparties. The results 
should be interpreted with this in mind.

The models provides outputs based on 
the following scenarios: 

– An orderly scenario, which is aligned 
with Representative Concentration 
Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and predicts a 
temperature rise below 2°C by the end 
of the century, aligned with the Paris 
Agreement. Important context for this 
scenario is that the world currently 
remains significantly off target in 
restricting the temperature rise to 
below 2°C, yet the industry often 
refers to this as a ‘best case’ and it 
provides a valuable reference point 
against other scenarios. 

– A disorderly scenario, which is 

aligned with RCP 2.6 and predicts a 
temperature rise lower than 2°C by the 
end of century. However, climate 
action to achieve this is not taken until 
2030, which delays transition impacts 
and makes them more drastic. This 
scenario is limited in that it assumes 
coordinated policy action at a global 
level by 2030. This scenario is useful 
to explore transition risk dynamics, 
and is only applicable to the equities 
and bonds model. 

– A hot house scenario, which is aligned 
with RCP 8.5 and predicts an average 
temperature change above 3°C by the 
end of the century, assuming no global 
response to climate change beyond 
what has already been committed to. 
There are concerns about the 
credibility of this scenario. However, it 
is widely used in industry to represent 
a ‘worst-case’ outcome and provides a 
valuable comparison with the RCP 2.6 
scenario as an unlikely high-risk 
future. 

Key assumptions: transition risk

As countries around the world increase 
energy demand and transition to greener 
energy sources, a key assumption is the 
energy requirements and mix in each 
region under each of the three scenarios. 
Projections include both energy 
reduction and change in the energy mix, 
and show the high-level requirement of a 
complete phase-out of coal in the 
transition assumptions, as well as 
significant reductions in gas, replaced 
primarily by renewables such as wind, 
solar and hydro energy. 

These impacts – notably emissions 
trajectories, energy demand and supply 
mix, carbon prices and electrification 
assumptions – drive major model results.

Key assumptions: physical risk

For the equities and bonds model, 
macro-level assumptions about how 
physical risks will impact GDP pathways 
are applied across all sectors, essentially 
allowing for implicit estimation of 
second-order impacts (eg supply chain 
impact). By contrast, for the real estate 
and infrastructure model, physical risk 
data from Marsh, using XDI, calculate 
direct impacts at specific location, 
meaning that outputs of the model 
represent the projected impact due to 
direct physical damage to each asset, 
and do not take into account second-
order financial impacts (eg business 
interruption).

Data limitations 
of scenario analysis
There are a number of limitations 
impacting our scenario analysis, 
reflecting the current industry-wide 
challenges of climate modelling. 

The scenarios adopted are largely 
sourced from IPCC and do not account 
for non-linear change and the possible 
crossing of climate system tipping 
points. As a result, there are financial 
impacts, including at a regional level, that 
are not fully captured, leading to a 
potential underestimation of risk. 

An important aspect is the input data, 
since for most assets modelled we have 
used company-specific data sourced 
from third parties such as Aladdin, Evora 
or Bloomberg. Many publicly-listed 
companies are measuring and reporting 
their emissions, which is a required data 
point for the calculation of climate-
related metrics. However, among smaller 
and privately owned companies, this 
data is not commonly reported. 

Another area of data limitation relates to 
lack of high-quality, comprehensive and 
reliable data upon which the model 
assumptions are based. Models are 
developed using proxies where data 
gaps are present, to ensure we obtain 
the widest coverage possible. 

Another aspect of data limitations 
relates to the lack of historical data 
points to calibrate and validate the 
model outputs. In particular, the lack of 
historical data on the relationship 
between climate risks and financial 
outcomes makes it difficult to interpret 
modelled outcomes far into the scenario 
horizon with confidence. 

Despite these limitations, scenario 
analysis provides us with useful 
information that can inform investment 
decision-making. 

Limitations of the public 
assets climate change model
At the counterparty and portfolio level, 
the model assumes no change to the 
composition of investment portfolios. 
While such assumptions are necessary 
for model feasibility, they do impact on 
the reliability of the results. One of the 
other limitations of the equities and debt 
model is the timeline. The scenario 
analysis provides outputs up to 30 years 
in the future, and while this helps to 
provide an estimate of the adjustment in 
valuation by 2050, there are aspects of 
the scenario interplay beyond 2050 that 
are not explored. Importantly, the 
current version of the equities and bonds 
model provides separate assessments of 
physical and transition risks, which 
reduces our ability to assess the 
interdependencies across those climate 
risk transmission mechanisms.

This transition module in particular only 
takes into account Scope 1 & 2 GHG 
emissions. There are some industries, 
such as automotive, that are known to 
be significant climate contributors owing 
to high Scope 3 emissions, yet these 
impacts are not explicitly explored. 
Measurement and reporting of Scope 3 
emissions is expected to improve and 
will be incorporated into the analysis in 
future as scenario analysis matures.

When assessing physical risk, the 
geographic distribution of a company’s 
financial activity and dependencies is 
crucial. In the absence of such 
information, the model follows a top-
down approach in determining climate 
shocks at sectoral level through 
macroeconomic pathways. 

As a result of these limitations, the model 
results need to be interpreted taking the 
following caveats into consideration:

– Being a static asset portfolio, we have 

not modelled likely investment or 
asset allocation actions to mitigate 
against climate-related impacts. For 
example, in a disorderly scenario we 
would likely have to carry out 
significant reallocation across both 
asset classes and geographies to align 
with rapidly changing policies.

– We recognise the transmission 

pathway interdependencies across 
physical and transition risks, so the 
model results need to be interpreted 
taking this limitation into 
consideration. 

Limitations of the private 
assets climate change model
The real estate and infrastructure model 
uses climate peril data to model the 
direct impact of physical climate impacts 
globally. In some geographies there is 
limited data, and the model uses a range 
of underlying source data at various 
resolutions to provide the necessary 
coverage for the projected perils. Similar 
to the equities and debt securities 
climate change model, the outputs 
provided by the real estate and 
infrastructure modelling assumes a 
number of key factors remain constant, 
in particular the current level of regional 
physical defence actions is assumed to 
remain unchanged. Although national 
defences may be upgraded in the future 
this is not considered within the physical 
climate risk projections.

Importantly, the scenario analysis for 
private assets only assesses direct 
physical risk and does not capture other 
potential climate-related impacts for 
those assets. It is important to bear this 
in mind when interpreting the results 
and also consider possible second-order 
impacts of physical risk (eg business 
disruption) as well as the impacts from 
transition modelling (eg asset valuation 
change due to a deterioration in 
economic conditions).

Viability statement

In accordance with Section 31 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board 
has undertaken a comprehensive and 
robust assessment of the prospects and 
viability of the Group.

Process for assessing 
long-term prospects
The Group’s long-term prospects are 
primarily assessed through the strategic 
and financial planning process. 

Due to the long dated nature of our 
products, the Board considers the 
sustainability and resilience of the 
strategy and business model, as detailed 
on pages 15-17 and page 8, over a longer 
time horizon. This includes the 
consideration of longer term themes such 
as technology, digitalisation, growing 
need of savings products and climate 
change which are pertinent to the Group.

The Board have also considered the 
output of the financial planning process 
reflected in the Business Plan which 
covers the period to December 2026. The 
Business Plan was approved by the Board 
in December 2023, following a robust 
review and challenge process.

The Business Plan contains detailed 
financial forecasts, including the related 
risks and mitigating actions over the 
planning period. The forecasts have been 
prepared based on the business model 
that management is deploying to deliver 
our key strategic priorities, as explained 
on page 15-17. The Business Plan covers 
all the key measures that underpin our 
Financial Management Framework, which 
includes metrics on capital, liquidity, debt 
and earnings.

The Business Plan considers the 
implications of current and emerging risks 
and the resulting uncertainties that these 
present to the achievement of the 
Business Plan, including the principal risks 
and uncertainties to which the Group is 
exposed, as discussed on pages 60-68. 
We assess these risks and uncertainties 
through stress and scenario testing as 
discussed below.

Progress against the Business Plan will be 
monitored regularly by the Board.

The Board also considered and reviewed 
the results of the annual Own Risk and 
Solvency Assessment (ORSA), which is an 
integral part of our risk management 
process. The process helped the Board to 
assess the resilience of the Group’s 
solvency position to various risk and 
stress scenarios. The Board confirms that 
it has carried out a robust assessment of 
the company’s emerging and principal 
risks.

Period for assessing viability
The Board considers that the three-year 
period to December 2026 is appropriate 
for assessing viability. This aligns with the 
business planning horizon and so, reflects 
the period over which key strategic 
initiatives will be delivered, principal risks 
will be managed and results will be 
monitored. 

Assessment of viability
The Board assessed the financial and 
operational impact of the Group’s principal 
risks on the ability to deliver the Business 
Plan. The Board reviews the principal risks 
to ensure that they reflect current market 
conditions and any changes to the Group 
risk profile.

As part of the strategic and financial 
planning process, we considered the 
resilience of our financial position to 
various combined risk scenarios. 

The combined scenarios are developed by 
the Risk and Resilience team, with input 
from the Investment Office and Finance. 
The process is overseen by the Group Risk 
Committee.

The Business Plan was subjected to the 
following combined risk scenarios based 
on plausible pathways for the global 
economy in the context of the current high 
inflation environment and geopolitical 
uncertainty, and the resultant impact on 
investment performance and consumer 
behaviour:

– Optimistic – Inflation peaks and falls 
steadily, led by headline components 
and an improvement in supply 
dynamics. Central Banks are able to 
ease policy rates at a faster pace than 
current pricing as inflation dynamics 
improve. 

– Pessimistic – Growth dynamics 

deteriorate further and developed 
economies enter recession. Inflation 
begins to fall as activity falters and a 
negative output gap opens up. Rates 
reprice to factor in a reversal of rate 
hikes as slowdown in activity 
accelerates. 

– Stagflation – Inflation remains high and 

broad based, despite recessionary 
conditions, constraining room for 
manoeuvre by Central Banks and 
forcing them to remain restrictive in 
policy setting. Elevated nature of 
inflation leads to demand destruction in 
the real economy and a pickup in credit 
delinquencies and default leading to a 
recession.

The stated scenarios were translated into 
impacts on various macroeconomic 
indicators to determine how delivery of 
the Business Plan is affected. 

In addition, as part of its ORSA, the Group 
undertook reverse stress testing to 
determine scenarios that would result in 
the shareholder solvency coverage ratio 
falling below 100%. This included a 
scenario where both market and longevity 
risks were stressed.

The derived scenarios indicated that the 
Group had the ability to withstand severe 
events while still meeting its capital 
requirements and maintaining sufficient 
headroom to maintain viability over the 
projection period.

Climate risk is considered by the Board as 
part of its strategic oversight. It features in 
the assumptions and modelling done for 
our Business Plan and is also assessed as 
part of our ORSA.

We continue to refine our climate-related 
scenario testing approach and to assess 
appropriate management actions that 
could mitigate the impacts of climate-
related risks.

For the purpose of the ORSA, the following 
scenarios were assessed:

– Net zero 2050 (orderly transition) – 

Global warming limited to 1.5ºC by the 
end of the century through stringent 
climate policies and innovation, reaching 
global net zero CO2 emissions around 
2050. 

– Delayed Transition (disorderly 

transition) – Annual emissions do not 
decrease until 2030. Strong policies are 
needed to limit warming to below 2ºC by 
the end of the century. CO2 removal is 
limited.

– Divergent (disorderly transition) - Global 
warming limited to 1.4ºC with net zero 
CO2 emissions by around 2050. A failure 
to coordinate policy stringency across 
sectors leads to higher transition costs. 

– Current Policies (Hot-house world) - 

Only currently implemented policies are 
preserved, leading to high physical risks. 
Warming exceeds 2.6ºC by the end of 
the century. 

The results of the stress and scenario 
testing demonstrated that due to the 
robust risk management process in place 
and the broad range of mitigating actions 
available, such as access to immediate 
liquidity funding and the ability to reduce 
dividends, the Group is able to withstand 
the impact in each case with regards to 
meeting all liabilities as they fall due.

Statement of viability
Based on the results of the procedures 
outlined above, the Board has a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three-
year period ending 31 December 2026.

Basis of preparation

The Strategic Report presented in our Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023 has been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR) issued by the FCA. In accordance with 
Section 414C of the Companies Act 2006, DTR 4.1.8 and DTR 4.1.9, the Group is required to provide a fair, balanced and understandable 
review of the business, including key performance indicators to the extent necessary, and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group.

The risk management section of the Strategic Report describes the principal risks and uncertainties on pages 60-68. 

In preparing this Strategic Report we have considered the Guidance on the Strategic Report as issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in June 2022. 

In addition the Board has also considered the guidelines with respect to alternative performance measures (APMs) as issued by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in October 2015 and the guidance on APMs included in the thematic review published 
by the Financial Reporting Council titled IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ Interim Disclosures in the First Year of Application 
in November 2023.

Our Board believes that the APMs identified within the Strategic Report are useful for management and investors in assessing the 
performance of the business during the year, in conjunction with the relevant IFRS results included within the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.

Chair’s introduction to governance

Governance that supports our business

The Board is responsible for our long-term sustainable success, 
generating stakeholder value and contributing to wider society

The purpose of those sessions is for 
Board members to have the opportunity 
to directly engage with, and listen to, 
colleagues from different cross sections 
of the business and to ensure we are 
reflecting feedback into planning and 
decision-making.

Stakeholders
The Board takes active steps to 
understand the interests, needs and 
concerns of other key stakeholders. 
Ongoing engagement and active 
listening are vital to ensuring that 
stakeholder views are properly 
understood and appropriately 
represented. In particular, the Board 
regularly discusses and advocates for a 
client-focused mindset and 
consideration of clients in everything we 
do. The Board strategy offsite included a 
client panel discussion, covering client 
expectations and how M&G can best 
serve them. 

Ensuring that management is spending 
time to understand our clients has been 
a Board priority this year. As part of 
developing the new purpose, 
management held meetings with clients 
to discuss M&G's products, service and 
wider proposition. 

Board evaluation review
The Board reflects on its performance 
and effectiveness annually. This year, our 
evaluation was facilitated externally by 
Boardroom Review Limited. The 
evaluation process was comprehensive 
and rigorous. It involved initial briefing 
meetings with a range of key 
stakeholders, followed by in-depth 
structured one-to-one interviews with 
members of the Board and a workshop 
during October 2023. 

Key themes emerging from the sessions 
and review were used to develop an 
action plan, which was reviewed 
and endorsed by the Board in 
December 2023. The Board will continue 
to track the actions through 2024 and 
progress will be reviewed regularly at 
Board meetings through the year.

More information about the Board 
evaluation and action plan is 
on pages 106-107.

Board composition and 
succession planning
Board composition and succession 
planning was a key area of focus for the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
during 2023, helping us ensure we have 
the appropriate balance of the desired 
skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge. 

The Board also played a key role in the 
changes at executive management level. 
As Chair, I consider each Director’s 
individual contribution to the Board, 
together with feedback and insights 
from the 2023 Board effectiveness 
review, to confirm that all Directors 
are discharging their roles effectively. 
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee keeps the skills required 
by the Board under review as part of 
succession planning.

Fiona Clutterbuck stepped down from 
the Board and her role as Senior 
Independent Director (SID) at the 2023 
AGM. I would like to thank her for her 
significant contribution to the Board and 
her years of service to M&G. I am 
grateful to Clare Thompson, Chair of the 
Audit Committee, who has acted as 
interim Senior Independent Director 
since then.

I have set out the key areas of 
governance on which the Board has 
focused over 2023. We have complied 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
throughout the financial year. The table 
on the next page sets out examples of 
how the Board has done this for each 
Principle and signposts to where you can 
find more information.

Governance and strategy
The Board is responsible for M&G's long-
term sustainable success, generating 
value for shareholders and contributing 
to wider society.

A critical element of the Board’s activity 
in early 2023 was approval of our 
refocused strategy, which builds on our 
financial strengths, drives simplification 
and efficiencies that benefit our clients, 
and delivers growth. The Board 
continues to oversee the delivery of 
the strategy.

Culture
Having the right culture at M&G is a vital 
underpin to our strategy and the Board 
is committed to ensuring that our 
colleagues are engaged in creating 
the right work environment and 
a positive culture. 

During 2023, the Board approved the 
new purpose, together with values and 
behaviours aligned to our strategy and 
business plan. I believe that our 
approach will set M&G up to achieve our 
strategic goals, delivering for our 
customers. Key to our success is 
maintaining our strong culture. The 
Board strongly believes in the value of 
culture and demonstrating the right tone 
from the top in everything that we do. 

The Board monitors this in a number of 
ways and receives regular updates on 
people and culture, as well as insights 
from regular colleague surveys. We also 
draw on regular formal and informal 
sessions with colleagues to gain deeper 
insights into our culture.

Diversity
The Board is fully committed to 
leveraging the benefits of diversity of 
thought and life experience in our 
discussions. We have committed to 
achieving the gender and ethnic 
diversity targets contained in Listing Rule 
9.8.6(9). I am pleased that 50% of our 
senior Board positions (Chair, Group 
CEO, SID, and CFO) are held by a woman 
and we have met the target to have at 
least one director from an ethnic 
minority background. Whilst the 
percentage of women on the Board began 
the year at 44%, the departure of Fiona 
Clutterbuck after the AGM in May 2023 has 
meant that the Company did not meet the 
40% gender diversity target. As at 31 
December 2023 gender diversity on the 
Board was 37.5% However, the Board 
remains committed to achieving the 
gender targets for the Board contained in 
the Listing Rules as soon as 
reasonably practicable.

AGM
The Board would like to thank our 
shareholders who participated in our 
AGM in 2023. The Board continues to 
view the AGM as a key point in our 
governance calendar. It is an opportunity 
to listen to views from our shareholders 
and for shareholders to meet and ask 
questions of our Board members, 
including Committee Chairs. We look 
forward to welcoming you again in 2024.

Finally, I would like to thank our 
colleagues for all of their hard work 
during 2023 and the commitment 
they have shown to deliver for 
our stakeholders.

Corporate Governance Report

Board leadership and company purpose

Board responsibilities 

The M&G Board is collectively 
responsible for our long-term, 
sustainable success, the delivery of 
sustainable value to our stakeholders, 
and contributing to wider society. 

The responsibilities of the Board include: 

– providing leadership, setting the 
strategy and maintaining high 
standards of governance

– leading the development of our 
culture, values and behaviours

– providing oversight of the execution of 
our strategy and holding management 
to account for financial and business 
performance

– ensuring the necessary resources are 
in place for the Group to be able to 
meet its objectives and measure 
performance against these

– being responsible for ensuring there is 
a framework of prudent and effective 
controls, which enable risk to be 
assessed and managed

– ensuring that its responsibilities to 
shareholders and stakeholders are 
met, including through effective 
engagement and dialogue with key 
stakeholders, particularly 
shareholders, customers, colleagues 
and the regulators.

Culture, values 
and behaviours 
The Board understands the importance 
of culture and setting the tone of the 
organisation from the top and 
embedding it throughout M&G. During 
the year, the Board approved a new 
purpose statement, together with a set 
of behaviours. Our purpose is aligned 
with our culture and strategy, and 
positions us to achieve our strategic 
priorities: profitable growth, 
simplification, and financial 
strength targets. 

The Board has approved the approach to 
culture measurement, which includes 
consideration of a culture insights report 
at least twice a year, and a culture 
dashboard as a primary method for 
monitoring culture. 

Additionally, the Board assesses culture 
when reviewing and discussing the 
outputs and themes from regular 
colleague surveys. The culture 
dashboard includes colleague and 
culture insights on a range of matters 
including: safe; respectful; inclusive; 
client-centric, accountable; and one 
team. 

In 2023, the Board considered and 
endorsed the actions proposed by 
management to further improve culture, 
which included: 

– additional actions to embed 

constructive challenge and sharing 
a broader range of perspectives 
across M&G 

– a top-down focus on addressing 
complexity and obstacles to drive 
improvements in accountability and 
remove barriers to execution

– events to drive conversations across 
M&G, creating behavioural change 
and driving commitment to our 
new purpose.

Stakeholder engagement
The Board seeks to understand the 
interests, needs and concerns of 
shareholders and other key stakeholders 
(including customers, colleagues, and 
regulators) to enable M&G to pursue 
long-term sustainable success. 

For more information on how we engage 
with our stakeholders as well as how the 
Board has discharged its duties under 
Section 172 of the Companies Act, see 
pages 40-45 of the Strategic Report.

Shareholder engagement

We believe that regular, ongoing 
engagement with key stakeholders and, 
in particular, our shareholders is central 
to good corporate governance. Our 
Investor Relations (IR) team, reporting to 
our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible 
for managing shareholder engagement 
and ensuring it is effective and 
comprehensive. 

Throughout 2023, management 
regularly met and engaged with 
shareholders as part of results 
roadshows, at investor conferences and 
at sell-side analyst events. 

We held a mix of in-person and virtual 
meetings to maximise investor 
engagement, encourage the 
participation of overseas investors and 
manage time efficiently. Across 2023, we 
held over 170 engagements with 
institutional equity and debt investors, 
primarily from the UK. We achieved 
broad coverage of our existing register, 
meeting with over 50.3% of our active 
shareholder base.

The Chair, Senior Independent Director 
and Chairs of each Board Committee are 
always available to engage with major 
investors, typically to discuss corporate 
governance matters. 

In 2023, the Chair engaged with 
shareholders on matters including 
sustainability, remuneration and Board 
composition, as well as performance 
against the Company’s strategy. The 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
consulted with major shareholders and 
proxy voting agencies to understand 
their views on the proposed approach 
for our Remuneration Policy and key 
executive remuneration decisions. 
Further details and the outcome of this 
engagement are included within the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report from 
page 120.

Board leadership and company purpose continued

Engagement during 2023 included 
seven sessions between Non-Executive 
Directors and colleagues, together with 
various sessions with colleagues as part 
of the Board’s site visit to Milan in 
October 2023. The engagement 
sessions in Milan between the Board and 
colleagues included: a corporate 
responsibility roadshow; discussion 
groups between Non-Executive 
Directors and colleagues; a session on 
diversity and inclusion; and a Townhall 
with colleagues hosted by the Chair and 
Group CEO. 

Feedback on themes from direct 
engagement sessions between the 
Board and colleagues are documented 
and shared with the Non-Executive 
Directors and the Chief People Officer, to 
ensure appropriate follow-up and action 
as applicable. Management regularly 
reports to the Board on a range of 
people matters, topics and themes, 
which the Board takes into account 
when making decisions.

Further information on colleague 
engagement is in the stakeholder 
engagement section on page 43. 

The Board receives a report on investor 
relations matters at least quarterly, 
including feedback from investors, 
market expectations of financial 
performance and updates on share 
register composition. Our Corporate 
Brokers also provide the Board with 
advice on market sentiment, input on 
market communications and share 
register analysis.

In addition to information on strategic, 
financial, and operational performance, 
the Group engages with shareholders 
and relevant shareholder advisory 
agencies on sustainability matters. The 
Group produces regular sustainability 
reporting detailing our approach. This 
can be found on our website.

Our AGM provides the opportunity for all 
shareholders to meet and to put 
questions to the Board. We were 
delighted to host a hybrid AGM in 2023. 
We encourage shareholders to use 
virtual meeting technology to ask 
questions ‘live’ and to pre-register 
questions in advance. The virtual 
meeting technology enables 
shareholders to vote on AGM resolutions 
‘live’ in the meeting.

The investors section of the Group’s 
website is our primary source of 
regularly updated information about the 
Group. All financial reports and 
statements, regulatory news service 
announcements and disclosures, 
presentations and other relevant 
documents are available on the website, 
together with a summary of financial 
analysts’ forecasts of performance. 
Recognising that joining our full year and 
half year results conference calls is not 
always possible, we ensure that 
recordings of these presentations are 
accessible to all shareholders via our 
website. We provide additional 
dedicated services to our retail 
shareholders via the Group Secretariat 
team and our registrar, Equiniti.

As part of the Group CEO induction, 
Andrea Rossi met with a number of our 
major shareholders between November 
2022 and January 2023. The 10 investors 
he met with jointly accounted for 34% of 
the register as of December 2022. This 
corresponds to c.42% of the 
‘addressable’ register, ie removing 
passive holdings and shares held by the 
employee trust. 

Investors' areas of focus were capital 
management, strategy, and growth.

Workforce engagement

The Board believes that having a diverse 
team of colleagues makes us more 
dynamic, fosters innovation and boosts 
performance. The Board continues to 
support senior leadership goals for 
ethnic and gender diversity. The Board 
regularly tracks progress against these 
through diversity and inclusion (D&I) 
reporting. Information on D&I can be 
found in Colleagues section on pages 
51-53. 

To comply with the provision of the Code 
relating to workforce engagement, the 
Board has determined it would have 
collective responsibility for employee 
engagement. The Board believes that 
Non-Executive Directors' regular 
meetings with colleagues across 
different geographies and seniority, 
supplemented by colleague surveys and 
culture insight reporting, are effective. 
These methods facilitate meaningful, 
two-way dialogue between the Board 
and colleagues to gain insights into 
culture, and to understand colleague 
views and interests. It also inputs into 
the Board’s decision-making process 
by ensuring meaningful engagement 
on how feedback is considered and 
acted upon.

The Nomination and Governance 
Committee provides oversight of the 
governance arrangements for the 
material subsidiaries.

Executive governance 
There is an executive governance 
framework, which includes details of 
how the members of the Group 
Executive Committee discharge their 
duties and regulatory responsibilities, 
make decisions in adherence with the 
Delegated Authority framework, and 
how the management committees in 
their business or function support 
their decision-making and 
governance processes.

term sustainability and success of the 
business and affairs of M&G, and is 
responsible to shareholders for creating 
and delivering sustainable shareholder 
value.

Board

and objectives

– the approval of specific matters. 

The matters that require Board approval 
are contained in a Schedule of Matters 
Reserved for the Board.

Chair, Group CEO and Non-
Executive Directors
In discharging its responsibilities, the 
Board is supported by management and 
ensures a clear division of 
responsibilities between the Chair, the 
Group Chief Executive Officer, the 
Senior Independent Director, and the 
Non-Executive Directors. 

Day-to-day management of M&G is 
delegated to the Group Chief Executive 
Officer. There is a document that sets 
out the division of responsibilities 
between the roles of the Chair and Chief 
Executive Officer in accordance with the 
principles and provisions of the Code, 
and the responsibilities of the Senior 
Independent Director. 

The role of the Non-Executive Directors 
includes providing constructive 
challenge, strategic guidance, offering 
specialist advice, and holding 
management to account.

During the year, the Chair of the Board 
engaged with Directors between Board 
meetings to discuss business and 
strategic issues. The Chair and the Non-
Executive Directors met regularly during 
the year without the Executive Directors 
being present. 

The Board spent significant time getting 
to know the new members of the 
executive management team. 
Comprehensive Board and Committee 
papers, comprising an agenda and 
formal reports and briefing papers are 
sent to Directors in advance of each 
meeting. 

Board Committees
The Board delegates specific 
responsibilities to Board Committees, 
which operate within clearly defined 
terms of reference approved by the 
Board. In compliance with the Code, 
the Board has established an Audit 
Committee, a Nomination and 
Governance Committee and a 
Remuneration Committee. We have also 
established a separate Risk Committee. 

The Terms of Reference for each Board 
Committee are reviewed and approved 
annually by the Board and are available 
to view on our website. 

The Committee Chairs are responsible 
for reporting to the Board on the 
Committees’ activities and do so 
following each Committee meeting.

Chairs’ Forum
The Chairs’ Forum is composed of the 
Chairs of M&G Group Limited (MGG), 
The Prudential Assurance Company 
Limited (PAC) and the Group Chair, with 
the Group CEO being invited to meetings 
as needed. This provides an opportunity 
to engage on common themes, matters 
of escalation, and other topics of 
interest. During the year, this included: 
strategic matters; Board effectiveness 
and succession planning; customer 
outcomes; people and culture; 
regulatory matters; sustainability; and 
financial performance and business plan. 

Subsidiaries
Independent Non-Executive Directors 
are appointed to the Boards of MGG and 
PAC relating to the Asset Management 
and Life businesses respectively. 

MGG and PAC both have a Board of 
Directors led by an independent Chair, 
and Audit and Risk Committees, 
comprised entirely of independent Non-
Executive Directors. During the year, the 
Board of the Company and the Boards of 
the material subsidiaries had a full day 
meeting discussing strategic topics 
and priorities.

Board composition 
and diversity 
The Board has eight Directors: a Non-
Executive Chair, a Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, four Non-
Executive Directors, and two Executive 
Directors (Group Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer). 

The Board considers all its Non-
Executive Directors to be independent 
and that it has complied with the 
requirements of the Code in relation to 
the balance of executive and 
independent Non-Executive Directors on 
the Board, and the composition of the 
Company’s Board Committees. 

Three of the Directors are women, one of 
the Directors is from a minority ethnic 
background; and two senior positions 
are held by women (Senior Independent 
Director and Group Chief 
Financial Officer).

The Nomination and Governance 
Committee regularly reviews the Board’s 
composition to ensure there is a diverse 
mix of skills, knowledge, and experience. 
During the year, this Committee also 
reviewed the board composition, tenure, 
mix of skills, and diversity on a number of 
principal subsidiary boards.

You can find further details on diversity 
and inclusion, including statistical data 
on gender and ethnic diversity, in our 
Colleagues section which starts 
on page 50.

Time commitment
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee at least annually considers 
the time commitment required of the 
Non-Executive Directors to ensure that 
they have sufficient time to meet their 
board responsibilities, together with 
reviewing their external appointments, 
potential or actual conflicts of interest, 
and assessing their independence.

Board independence
The Board has evaluated the 
independence of all the Non-Executive 
Directors.

In assessing each Director, the Board 
considers whether there are 
relationships or circumstances which are 
likely to affect or could appear to affect a 
Director’s judgement. 

At each Board meeting, we give regular 
updates on market and industry 
activities, and legal and regulatory 
changes relevant to M&G. The Board 
holds an annual Strategy Offsite. 

The Board has concluded that each of 
the Non-Executive Directors are 
independent in character and 
judgement. The Chair was independent 
on appointment. In line with the Code, at 
least half the Board, excluding the Chair, 
are independent Non-Executive 
Directors. All Directors are subject to 
annual re-election at the 
Company’s AGM.

Succession planning
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee is responsible for succession 
planning and for making 
recommendations to the Board 
regarding Board composition. During the 
year, this Committee reviewed and 
discussed Board composition and 
succession planning, and executive 
succession planning. You can find 
further details on succession planning in 
the Nomination and Governance 
Committee report which starts 
on page 109.

Directors are appointed by the Board 
and then put forward for election or re-
election by shareholders at the AGM. 

All Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed for initial terms of three years 
and the appointment may be terminated 
by either party upon six months’ written 
notice or by shareholder vote at 
the AGM. 

The Non-Executive Directors do not 
have any entitlement to compensation if 
their office is terminated. Find out more 
about the remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors on page 158.

Directors’ inductions, training, 
and development 
All new Board members have a 
structured induction programme on 
appointment, which includes an overview 
of our business areas and functions. 

During 2023, the Board received training 
and/or undertook deep dives on the 
following areas: Balance Sheet, Capital 
and Liquidity; Cyber Resilience; Bulk 
Purchase Annuities and Capital; and 
Artificial Intelligence. 

The Audit Committee undertook training 
sessions and/or deep dives on IFRS 17, 
Financial Controls Framework, and 
Asset Valuations, and the Risk 
Committee held sessions on: Third-Party 
Supplier and Outsourcing risks; Data 
Privacy risks; Cyber Security risks; and 
Conflicts of Interest. 

All Board members are invited to 
participate in all sessions, regardless of 
Committee membership. Where 
appropriate, we extend invitations to 
relevant training sessions to Non-
Executive Directors on our subsidiary 
boards.

Information to the Board
Board members receive formal papers in 
advance of each Board or Committee 
meeting, which provides them with the 
opportunity to review and challenge, and 
facilitates more informed decisions on 
the issues under consideration. The 
Chair and Company Secretary oversee 
an ongoing programme to ensure Board 
and Committee papers are of high 
quality and meet internal standards and 
requirements. In addition to formal 
Board meetings, the Chair maintains 
regular contact throughout the year with 
the Group Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer, and members of the 
Group Executive Committee to discuss 
specific issues. The Company Secretary 
acts as an adviser to the Board on 
matters concerning governance and 
ensures compliance with Board 
procedures. All Directors had access to 
the Company Secretary’s advice during 
2023. Directors may also take 
independent professional advice at 
M&G’s expense, if required.

2023 Effectiveness Review

Background

In 2023, the Board commissioned an externally facilitated Board effectiveness review in accordance with the Code and best 
practice. The Board’s last externally facilitated review was performed in 2020. The review was conducted between July 2023 and 
October 2023 and was led by the Chair with support from the General Counsel and Company Secretary. 

Appointment

Following a selection process led by the Chair, with support from the General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Board 
appointed Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review, an experienced external board evaluation specialist to facilitate the review. Neither 
Dr Long nor Boardroom Review has any other connection with the M&G plc Group. The engagement with Boardroom Review 
includes a follow-up review to be conducted in 2024.

Process

The methodology for the review included a review of information by Dr Long and built on the insights and findings from the 2022 
Board evaluation and assessed progress against the actions that the Board committed to take as a result. The review involved in-
depth, structured one-to-one interviews by Dr Long with each Board member, ending with a workshop session for the Board in 
October 2023. The interviews anchored around the following key themes:

Themes
Use of time and information

Topics
– Executive / Non-Executive Director preparation and priorities

– Agenda design and schedule use of time (formal & informal)

– Quality of information

Meetings

– Context setting and framing of issues

– Case study on coverage of specific Board topics, with a particular focus on 

the Board’s visit to the Milan office in September

– Balance of executive presentation vs Board debate

– Clarity of conclusions and actions

Culture and dynamics

– Quality of debate and blend of voices

– Contribution of critical executives and attendees

– Contribution to knowledge and understanding – opportunities and challenges

– Board support

Summary of 2023 review findings
The key findings and proposed actions were presented to the Board in December 2023, which prompted an open and constructive 
debate on the insights and findings, and actions were agreed. 

There had been strong progress since the previous evaluation, with an open Board culture that is low ego and respectful, allowing 
a good blend of voices and perspectives to be represented, and with a good level of openness and transparency with the senior 
executive team. The Board welcomed the progress that has been made in strengthening relationships with stakeholders, building 
the Group CEO's relationship with regulators and the positive momentum that has been achieved. Board members have also 
valued the informal discussions outside meetings and the opportunities to spend time with local teams and customers.

Key themes emerging from the Board discussion were used to develop a number of agreed action points which are summarised on 
the next page.

tenure. 

During 2023, the Boards of our principal subsidiaries also took part in an 
assessment to identify their blend of skills, knowledge and experience, to 
recognise potential areas where they might be enhanced and reflect those in 
succession plans, where appropriate. 
During 2023, the Board received monthly reports from the executive team to 
supplement formal Board reporting. In addition, the Executive Directors hold 
an informal monthly call to discuss the report with the Non-Executive 
Directors.

Board members are invited to feedback any comments on papers at the end 
of every meeting.

Progress here was assessed as a key part of the 2023 Board effectiveness 
review. 

Progress has been made by the Group Chief Executive Officer in establishing 
effective relationships with both the FCA and PRA.

Corporate Governance Report

Audit, risk and internal controls

The Board is responsible for ensuring 
the Group’s risk management 
framework and internal control system is 
maintained and remains effective. 

Our internal control systems ensure the 
quality and integrity of our internal and 
external financial and sustainability  
reporting, as well as operational, legal 
and regulatory compliance. It prescribes 
the extent of the principal risks we are 
willing to take as part of our strategy. 
The internal control systems are 
designed to facilitate management of the 
Group and its businesses within the 
Board’s risk appetite, rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve our 
objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatements. 

M&G currently operates the ’three lines 
of defence’ model to govern its approach 
to risk management. In the three lines of 
defence model, the first line is 
responsible for the ownership and day-
to-day management of risks and is 
overseen by the second line Risk and 
Compliance function. The second line is 
structurally independent of the first line, 
and provides oversight, advice and 
challenge. The third line Internal Audit 
function is empowered by the Audit 
Committee to audit the design and 
operating effectiveness of our system of 
internal controls, including governance, 
risk management and control processes.

The Board remains committed to 
instilling an appropriate risk culture and 
operating within a strong internal control 
system, with a view to continuously 
maturing, embedding, and enhancing 
risk management throughout the Group. 
The Board delegates some of its 
responsibilities to the Audit Committee 
and Risk Committee. 

The Board is responsible for setting the 
Group’s risk appetite and tolerance, 
following recommendation from the Risk 
Committee. Detail on our Risk 
Management Framework, risk appetite 
and limits, principal risks and 
uncertainties, and emerging risks are 
in the Risk Management section on 
pages 58-68.

The Audit Committee regularly works 
alongside the Risk Committee to monitor 
the adequacy and effectiveness of our 
internal control systems and risk 
management systems. The Audit 
Committee reports regularly to the 
Board on its activities. Details on the 
Audit Committee's activities in 2023 are 
on pages 111-117.

The Risk Committee assists the Board in 
fulfilling its responsibilities by advising 
on risk strategy and overseeing the 
development, implementation, and 
maintenance of the Group’s Risk 
Management Framework (RMF) and the 
Group Risk Appetite statements. The 
Risk Committee reports regularly to the 
Board on its activities. Further details on 
the activities of the Risk Committee can 
be found on pages 118-119. 

The Remuneration Committee ensures 
that our compensation structures place 
appropriate weighting on colleagues 
adopting our behaviours and risk culture 
to deliver the Group’s strategy and 
achieve the objectives to deliver long-
term, sustainable success for the Group. 
Further details on the activities of the 
Remuneration Committee can be found 
on pages 120-124.

Remuneration
The Board has established a 
Remuneration Committee comprised of 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Details of its responsibilities, activities, 
and areas of focus are set out in the 
Committee report on pages 120-124. 
The Remuneration Committee has 
determined that our Remuneration 
Policies and practices are designed to 
support M&G's strategy and promote the 
Group's long-term sustainable success. 

Remuneration for executives is aligned 
to M&G's purpose and values, and is 
clearly linked to the successful delivery 
of M&G's strategy. 

Details regarding remuneration policies 
and practices, together with the 
procedure for developing policy on 
executive, senior management, and 
workforce remuneration is in the 
Directors' Remuneration Report, 
which starts on page 120.

Priorities for 2024
– Continue to keep Executive Committee succession planning under review 

– Ensure that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board is 

appropriate to lead the Group

– Provide oversight of work to meet our diversity and inclusion goals and the 

targets that we have set to measure progress

Dear Shareholder
Key matters the Committee discussed 
during the year included Board and 
Committee composition, Executive 
Committee succession planning, diversity 
and inclusion goals, and oversight of the 
governance and Board composition of 
material subsidiaries. 

Committee purpose 
and responsibilities
In December 2023 the Board extended 
our delegated responsibilities to include 
overseeing the Group Governance 
Framework and oversight of subsidiaries 
governance policies, as well as 
developing, evaluating, and monitoring 
the Group’s Diversity and Inclusion 
strategy and initiatives across the Group.

The newly named Nomination and 
Governance Committee is responsible for 
monitoring the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience, as well as the 
diversity, of the Board. It is also 
responsible for making recommendations 
of new appointments to the Board and 
overseeing Board and senior 
management succession planning. 

Further details can be found in the 
Committee’s terms of reference, which 
are reviewed annually and available on 
our website.

Board composition, succession 
planning and performance
The Committee’s primary responsibilities 
are to ensure that Board composition is 
appropriate and to keep succession 
planning of both Executive and Non-
Executive roles under ongoing review. 

We refreshed our Skills Map for the Board 
during 2023, which enables us to 
objectively identify and track skills 
required and to plan for emergency and 
longer-term succession. Board members 
undertook a self-assessment exercise in 
November 2023 against the refreshed 
skills matrix, which included sector 
experience, strategy, customer, 
technology, data, and sustainability. 

The outputs from the self-assessment, 
which included that the current blend of 
skills, knowledge, and experience on the 
Board as a whole is appropriate in relation to 
current business priorities and prospective 
strategic initiatives, were discussed by the 
Committee in December 2023. 

Succession plans for the Non-Executive 
Directors, Executive Directors, and Group 
Executive Committee members were 
reviewed and discussed by the 
Committee in December 2023.

Executive Directors – skills 
mapping and succession
We review the skills of the Executive 
Directors and succession plans for these 
positions on an ongoing basis. This 
process helps to ensure that there are 
potential internal candidates for 
succession who are suitably qualified and 
experienced, and that we have a diverse 
talent pipeline.

109

Areas of focus in 2023
– Board skills mapping and 

succession planning.

– Executive committee succession 

planning.

– Governance, board composition 
and gender diversity of material 
subsidiaries.

Executive succession planning was a key 
focus for us during the year. The change 
in Group CEO during October 2022 and 
subsequent senior management changes 
during 2023 emphasised the importance 
of ensuring that M&G has the appropriate 
people in senior roles to build a strong 
and diverse senior management pipeline 
for the longer term. 

We received updates on the succession 
planning for the wider senior executive 
group twice during the year, with a talent 
and succession deep dive of the Asset 
Management business during 
December 2023, and deep dives of the 
Life and Wealth businesses and the 
Finance function in February 2024. 

During 2024, there will be a continued 
focus on the internal succession pipeline 
by enhancing the current talent 
programme to develop future leaders 
ready for advancement.

Appointment process
We have a duty to consider and 
recommend to the Board the 
appointment of any new M&G plc 
Board member. 

The appointment of a new Director begins 
with the identification of a vacancy or skills 
gap, together with consideration of the 
gender and ethnic diversity on the Board. 
We assess any skills required, including the 
evolving needs of the Board and then work 
with HR and the Company Secretary to 
produce a clear role specification to focus 
recruitment activities.

Using the role specification, an external 
search firm is selected on the basis of 
relevant experience for Non-Executive 
Director roles and internal and external 
searches are conducted for Executive roles. 
Long and short lists of candidates are 
considered, following which interviews are 
undertaken, at which Committee members 
(among others) test the candidates’ skills 
and fit with M&G's culture. 

These are essential criteria for the 
selection of Board members, since the 
Board aims to set the right tone from the 
top in how we go about our work and how 
our Directors represent and support 
M&G’s culture. 

Induction process
Structured and tailored induction 
programmes are prepared and, among 
other matters, cover meeting key 
members of the executive management 
team and the external and internal 
auditors; an overview of the financial and 
business plan; stakeholder engagement; 
organisation structure and all relevant 
policies, procedures and other 
governance material. 

Board independence 
and conflicts
We take into account the independence 
criteria set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as part of the selection 
process for our Non-Executive Directors. 
We assess the independence of each 
Non-Executive Director at least annually, 
to ensure that they can continue to 
properly fulfil their roles on the Board and 
provide independent challenge to the 
Executive Directors. 

In February 2024, we reviewed each Non-
Executive Director, taking into account 
their tenure, external roles and potential 
conflicts of interest. We determined that 
all Non-Executive Directors are free from 

any relationship or circumstances that 
could affect, or appear to affect, their 
independent judgement, and therefore all 
Non-Executives can be recommended for 
re-election at our 2024 AGM as 
independent Board members. 

In line with the Code, over half of our 
Board members, excluding the Chair, are 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 

We review potential conflicts for Non-
Executive Directors on their appointment, 
at least annually, and in advance of taking 
on any additional external appointment, 
supported by the Risk and 
Compliance team.

Time commitment
We oversee our Non-Executive Directors’ 
time commitments to ensure that each 
has sufficient time to dedicate to their role 
to be able to discharge effectively their 
responsibilities. At least once a year, we 
consider the number and nature of the 
Non-Executive Directors’ external 
commitments, and how this impacts the 
time required for their Board and 
Committee responsibilities.

We are satisfied that each Non-Executive 
Director has sufficient time to undertake 
their role at M&G. 

Board and Committee 
effectiveness
The process and results of the 2023 
Board and Committee effectiveness 
review are described on page 106. This 
year’s results and agreed areas of focus 
are described on page 107. 

Diversity and inclusion 
and gender balance
When considering Board composition and 
succession, we specifically review the 
Board's gender and ethnic diversity, and the 
gender and ethnic diversity targets 
contained in Listing Rule 9.8.6(9). The Board 
also considers gender diversity on the 
Boards of its material subsidiaries as well as 
progress against the Group's diversity 
commitments at half year and full year. 

The Board continues to meet the Listing 
Rule 9.8.6(9)(a)(iii) requirement for at least 
one of its members to be from an ethnic 
minority. Currently 50% of the senior Board 
positions (Chair, Group CEO, SID and Group 
CFO) are held by a woman and gender 
diversity on the Board is 37.5%. Whilst the 
percentage of women on the Board began 
the year at 44%, the departure of Fiona 
Clutterbuck after the AGM in May 2023

110

has meant that the Company did not meet 
the 40% target in Listing Rule 9.8.6(9)(a)(i) at 
31 December 2023. The size of our current 
Board means that individual membership 
changes can have a material impact on the 
gender ratio. However, the Board remains 
committed to achieving the gender targets 
for the Board contained in the Listing Rules 
as soon as reasonably practicable.

Governance of material 
subsidiaries 
We are responsible for overseeing the 
governance arrangements of our material 
subsidiaries MGG and PAC which sit in 
our Asset Management and Life 
businesses respectively. During 2023, we 
reviewed the composition of their Boards 
and changes to them, ensuring that they 
continue to comply with regulatory 
requirements and that succession plans 
are in place. 

The legal entity structure of the Wealth 
business is being reviewed in conjunction 
with strategy work and we will provide 
oversight of the board composition of the 
Wealth subsidiaries as part of this review.

During 2023, the Boards of our principal 
subsidiaries took part in a skills 
assessment to identify the blend of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Boards 
and to recognise potential areas where 
they might be enhanced. 

The analysis concluded that the current 
blend of skills, knowledge and experience 
on those Boards is appropriate in relation 
to our business priorities and prospective 
strategic initiatives.

We continued to spend time with PwC 
during its second year of audit, and with 
whom we worked closely on the 
adoption of IFRS 17. 

The Audit and Risk Committees continue 
to work closely together, and the cross-
membership principles that we follow 
ensure that members of both 
committees receive information in the 
most efficient way.

Finally, I would like to thank Fiona 
Clutterbuck, who stepped down from 
the Committee on 24 May 2023, and 
extend my thanks to the Committee 
members for their support and 
dedication over the year.

Clare Thompson
Committee Chair

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Audit 
Committee Report, which outlines the 
key themes we focused on during 
the year. 

Our 2023 agenda was dominated by 
financial reporting due to the adoption of 
the new insurance accounting standard, 
IFRS 17, and our finance transformation 
plan, which we continue to monitor 
alongside our business as usual 
activities. 

In September, we published our half-
year 2023 results for the first time on the 
basis of IFRS 17. 

We continue to oversee sustainability 
reporting and, in light of the changing 
regulation, revised our approach for 2023 
to include a number of enhancements.

We held a number of 'deep-dive' 
sessions during the year, including the 
financial close and reporting process 
changes due to the adoption of IFRS 17, 
and financial asset fair valuation 
methodologies and 
governance processes. 

The Committee has continued to focus 
on the overall control environment and 
this also encompassed the oversight 
controls over financial reporting 
processes performed by the 
third parties. 

Areas of focus in 2023
– Monitoring the Finance Change 

agenda, including oversight of the 
implementation of IFRS 17. 

– Reviewing and recommending to 
the Board the full-year and half-
year 2023 results, and approving 
the associated key accounting 
and actuarial assumptions and 
methodology.

– Reviewing and recommending to 
the Board the Solvency II Pillar III 
reporting, and approving the 
associated balance sheet 
valuation methods and 
assumptions.

– Reviewing and approving our 

Annual Report and Accounts, our 
2022/23 Sustainability Report and 
other sustainability reporting.

– Considering findings reported by 

the external auditor, reviewing the 
external audit strategy and plan.

– Considering and challenging the 
impact of economic uncertainty 
on key economic assumptions and 
valuations.

– Oversight of non-financial 

assurance, including 
sustainability.

– Monitoring the effectiveness of 

the Internal Audit function.

– Processes used to value complex 

and illiquid financial assets.

Financial Reporting 2023
The Audit Committee reviewed the full-
year 2023 consolidated and Company 
financial statements.

The review included:

Fair, balanced and understandable

In assessing whether the 2023 Annual 
Report and Accounts are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess M&G’s position, we gave 
regard to whether:

– Information in the Strategic Report, in 
particular the Business and Financial 
Review, represents a fair reflection of 
M&G's performance during the year.

– Significant issues identified in this 

report, including key areas of 
judgement and estimation, as well as 
any other significant issues disclosed 
within narrative reporting, are 
consistent with the financial 
statements.

– Alternative performance measures 

(APMs) have been given equal 
prominence to the statutory 
measures, there is a clear description 
of their calculation and an explanation 
of their use and relevance.

– Clarification and treatment of certain 

items within the APMs, particularly the 
allocation of items to adjusted 
operating profit before tax and 
operating capital generation, is in line 
with the defined methodology, and is 
appropriately disclosed.

– The identified key performance 
measures reflect those used by 
management to manage, monitor and 
assess the results of the business, 
linking to the strategy.

– Key messages are clear, consistent, 

and easily understood, without the use 
of excessive jargon.

Composition
The Board considers all Committee 
members are independent and that 
Clare Thompson has recent and relevant 
experience of working with financial 
reporting and accounting matters. 

Find out more about details of 
Committee members’ relevant skills and 
experience on pages 96 to 98.

2023 Meeting Schedule
In 2023, there were seven regular 
scheduled Audit Committee meetings 
and five short ad hoc meetings. In 
addition, we held one joint meeting with 
the Risk Committee, and two joint 
meetings with the Board to consider our 
full-year and half-year results. 

We incorporated training sessions on 
IFRS 17 within the regular meeting 
schedule.

In addition, we met individually with the 
Chief Auditor and the lead audit partners 
from our external auditors, PwC, without 
the presence of management. These 
private sessions are on a rolling 
programme, with internal and external 
auditors each holding at least two 
private sessions a year.

Annual evaluation of Audit 
Committee performance
The process and results of the 2023 
Board and Committee effectiveness 
review are described on page 106. This 
year’s results and agreed areas of focus 
are described on page 107. 

The Committee also 
receives: 
– Regular reports from The 

Prudential Assurance Company 
Limited (PAC) and M&G Group 
Limited (MGG) Audit Committees

– Updates on regulatory 

developments in financial and 
sustainability reporting

– Updates on approval of audit and 

non-audit work

Going concern and viability statements

In early 2024, we reviewed the going 
concern assessment undertaken by 
management for the purposes of the 
2023 consolidated financial statements. 

This included assessing M&G plc’s 
solvency, including its sensitivity to 
various economic stresses and its 
projections in a reasonable worst case 
scenario, being the pessimistic scenario 
(which reflects reduced demand from 
higher spreads and worsening economic 
conditions), liquidity projections, 
including the impact of applying specific 
liquidity stresses and the ability to 
access funding sources.

Based on the review, we concluded that 
the going concern assumption remains 
appropriate. 

In addition, we considered the 
associated assessment of longer-term 
viability to support the Viability 
Statement. This involved consideration 
of the strategic and financial planning 
process alongside an assessment of 
M&G plc’s key strategic priorities, 
business model and forecasting 
undertaken as part of the business 
planning process.

The Board challenged the assumptions 
underpinning the assessments, including 
the impact of various severe, but 
plausible stresses and scenarios on the 
ability to deliver the business plan, and 
concluded that the positions were both 
reasonable and supportable. Based on 
this determination, the Committee 
concluded that three years was the most 
appropriate period for longer-term 
viability in line with the business plan. 

IFRS 17
IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts is a new 
accounting standard, effective from 
1 January 2023, which has a significant 
impact on the financial reporting of our 
insurance contracts.

M&G plc has had an ongoing project to 
implement IFRS 17. The Committee have 
received regular updates on the project's 
progress, including achievements to 
date, key milestones during 2023 and 
upcoming priorities.

Critical estimates and areas of judgement and how they were addressed
We have assessed whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements. We have also considered all critical estimates and key judgements that are material to the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements. In this regard, we receive regular updates from management and review and challenge 
estimates and judgements accordingly. Special consideration was given to critical estimates and judgements arising on the 
adoption of IFRS 17: Insurance contracts, which were discussed at various meetings over the course of the year as part of the 
review of IFRS 17 methodology and implementation.

This section outlines the critical estimates and key judgements that have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements and how each of them have been considered and addressed by the Committee.

Critical estimate/
Key judgement

Valuation of 
insurance 
contracts and 
defined benefit 
pension liabilities

Valuation of 
complex and 
illiquid financial 
assets

How the Committee addressed the issue

We reviewed the key assumptions and judgements presented by management in the estimation and 
valuation of the Group’s insurance contracts and defined benefit pension liabilities. The key assumptions 
reviewed were:
– Policyholder mortality, maintenance expenses and valuation rate of interest (including selection of 

reference portfolio and allowance for credit risk) used in the estimation of insurance contract 
liabilities for annuities.

– Allowance for maintenance expenses, persistency, assumed future investment returns on the 

backing assets, policyholders' share of historic and future surpluses, and the illiquidity premium in 
setting the discount rate used in the estimation of insurance contract liabilities for with-profits 
policies.

– Mortality, inflation rates and discount rates used in the estimation of the Group's defined benefit 

pension liabilities.

In addition, we reviewed the following assumptions presented by management for determining the fair value 
of contracts for which the fair value approach was used on transition to IFRS 17:
– the target capital and cost of capital rate;
– for with-profits contracts, the assumed future investment returns on the backing assets, the 

assumptions used in determining the allowance for persistency and maintenance expenses, the level 
of compensation required to reflect the risk in relation to future shareholder transfers, and the 
discount rates used; and

– for annuity contracts, the assumed rates of policyholder mortality, maintenance expenses, and the 

discount rates used.

We considered the rationale provided by management for the assumptions used and reviewed any 
benchmarking provided.
The Committee also challenged the appropriateness of management’s credit assumptions given current 
market conditions.
We were satisfied that the assumptions adopted by management were appropriate. Further information on 
key assumptions can be found in Notes 24 and 32 of the consolidated financial statements in respect of the 
insurance contract liabilities and in Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements in respect of the defined 
benefit pension liabilities.

We received information on the carrying value of investments held on the consolidated statement of financial 
position, and particularly focused on those investments where the determination of their fair value required 
more subjective estimation (classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy). These assets include 
investment properties, lifetime mortgages, private credit (which includes securitised notes backed by 
residential ground rents) and investments in private equity vehicles. Specifically, in relation to the notes 
backed by residential ground rents, we considered the impact on assumptions of the UK Government 
consultation which may potentially restrict future income.
In addition, we considered the governance arrangements put in place by management to review the 
valuation of these assets (including those held by the defined benefit pension schemes) to ensure that it 
remains appropriate. While reviewing the valuation, we also considered the potential impact of the current 
macroeconomic environment and climate-related risk on relevant asset classes.

Given the market uncertainty during the year, we requested a deep dive of the valuation process. Following 
the deep dive, as well as the wider assessment of the remainder of the Group’s assets, we are satisfied that 
the basis of valuation for these assets was appropriate. Further information on key assumptions can be 
found in Note 31 of the consolidated financial statements.

Critical estimate/
Key judgement

Recoverable 
amount of 
goodwill

Specific 
accounting 
judgments applied 
as part of adoption 
of IFRS 17

How the Committee addressed the issue

We reviewed the results of annual impairment testing carried out in respect of goodwill associated with the 
Group’s cash-generating units. This involved reviewing the key inputs used in the assessment, including the 
discount rate and future cash flow projections used to determine value in use. Appropriate challenge was 
provided to management, particularly around growth rates, discount rates and terminal profit margins.
We considered the results of the work performed and agreed with management’s assessment that the 
responsAbility Investments AG cash-generating unit was impaired by £25m.
Further information on key assumptions can be found in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements.

Adoption of IFRS 17 required the application of judgement in respect of the following areas:
– The judgement with respect to whether contracts issued by M&G plc contain significant insurance 

risk, unless a specific exemption applies (eg equity release mortgages).

– Judgement in respect of certain investment contracts which provide an additional benefit in addition 
to guaranteed benefits to determine whether they meet the criteria to be considered as discretionary 
participation features.

– Judgement required at a contract level as to whether they meet the conditions for having direct 

participation features and consequently require the use of the Variable Fee Approach to measure the 
CSM.

– Judgement required to define underlying items for with-profits contracts that reflect the 

mutualisation between contracts and how to split underlying items between current and future 
policyholders.

– Judgement required to determine which surplus should be divided between current and future with-
profits policyholders as well as with the Group and which surplus is attributable solely to the Group. 

– Judgement required to assess whether the current amount of surplus attributed to with-profits 

policyholders should be determined retrospectively or prospectively.

– Judgement required in determining the relative weighting for the purposes of deriving coverage 

units where a contract provides both insurance and investment services.

– On transition, judgement was required to assess for which contracts it would be impracticable to apply 

the Fully Retrospective Approach (FRA).

As part of the review of IFRS 17 methodology, we reviewed and challenged the judgements applied by 
management as part of the adoption of IFRS 17. As part of the review, we considered alternative accounting 
treatments in light of the guidance provided in the standard. Following our review, we were satisfied that the 
judgements applied were appropriate. Further information on the accounting treatment can be found in 
Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements.

Other significant 
judgements

We reviewed and considered the other significant judgements as disclosed within Note 1.3 of the 
consolidated financial statements:
– Consideration over M&G plc’s interest in structured entities and whether control exists which would 

require their consolidation.

– The judgement exercised to determine the extent to which future taxable profits are expected to 

emerge and the corresponding period over which unused tax credits and unused tax losses will be 
utilised for recognition of deferred tax asset.

Following review of the basis of the above judgements we were satisfied that these were appropriate.

We also considered the following critical estimates and key judgements in respect of the Company financial statements. 

Critical estimate/
Key judgement

Recoverable 
amount of M&G 
Group Regulated 
Entity Holding 
Company Limited 
(M&G REH) in the 
financial 
statements

How the Committee addressed the issue

Management performed an impairment assessment at the year end in relation to the Company’s investment 
in M&G REH, which in turn is the holding company for M&G plc’s main regulated entities, including MGG and 
PAC. As a result, the recoverable amount of M&G REH has been determined by reference to the recoverable 
amount of these main operating subsidiaries. We considered management’s assessment of the recoverable 
amounts based on a discounted cash flow assessment, which was derived from management’s expectations 
of profits in respect of MGG and application of a discounted dividend model in respect of PAC. Where 
possible, management also considered alternative valuation techniques consistent with established 
valuation principles to determine the recoverable amount. Based on the review, we concluded that 
impairment of £933 million should be recognised. Further information is disclosed at Note A to the M&G plc 
Company financial statements.

Sustainability reporting
We have a responsibility to review, and 
challenge as appropriate, any 
sustainability or climate-related 
reporting in any material public 
documents, including but not limited to, 
climate-related financial disclosures 
required by the UK Listing Rules.

We received regular updates during 
2023 on our planned sustainability 
reporting, and have challenged, 
reviewed and approved 
these accordingly. 

In particular, the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); 
within the Annual Report and Accounts, 
the Sustainability Report, published in 
July 2023; and the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
reporting document for publication on 
our website.

We apply the same level of rigour to the 
review and challenge of these 
disclosures as we do to the review of 
external financial reporting. In relation to 
the mandatory TCFD reporting included 
in this Annual Report and Accounts, we 
have reviewed and approved the 
Environmental Metrics Basis of 
Reporting (Basis of Reporting) published 
on our website which sets out key 
considerations in respect of materiality, 
reporting boundary, restatement policy 
and the methodologies applied in 
determining carbon emissions metrics. 
In setting out the published Basis of 
Reporting, consistency with the 
requirements of the International 
Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) 
IFRS S1, as far as practicable, has been a 
key consideration discussed with 
the Committee. 

In relation to TCFD reporting, the 
Committee also considered the 
following key judgements in relation 
to climate metrics:

– Use of 2019 emissions data for 

sovereign bonds reporting in lieu of 
2020 (where this is the most recent 
data available) given the impact of 
lockdowns at the peak of the COVID 
pandemic on global GDP and 
sovereign activity for that year, 
therefore deemed not representative 
of usual activities.

– Scenarios used in climate modelling – 
our scenario analysis for public assets 
is based on Network for Greening the 
Financial Systems scenarios, and for 

real estate and infrastructure assets 
based on pathways produced by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC). We recognise the 
limitations with using these scenarios 
but judge them appropriate for 
consistent disclosure while thinking in 
this area develops.

– The data hierarchy for third-party 

emissions data, including a change in 
2023 to include Bloomberg as a data 
source for public equities and 
corporate debt emissions data, which 
has allowed for improvement in 
coverage for this asset class. Further 
details on data hierarchies used is 
available in the Basis of Reporting 
document on our website. 

– Application of the restatement policy 

and other re-presentations of prior year 
data where it was judged to be useful 
to investors. 

We recognise that there remains work to 
do on sustainability reporting as data 
improves and requirements change, and 
will continue to work with management 
as our reporting develops in this area, 
including increasing coverage across 
asset classes and ensuring that 
processes and controls around the 
reporting are robust and fit for purpose. 
During the year, the Committee 
approved the widening of the scope of 
limited assurance by PwC over non-
financial metrics to include selected 
financed emissions climate metrics. We 
will continue to review the scope of this 
work annually as reporting expectations 
and requirements develop, and the 
capabilities of assurance providers in 
this area mature.

The Committee has also reviewed 
responses to consultations during 2023 
in relation to the development of 
sustainability reporting as it pertains to 
our business including engagement with 
the ISSB and the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC). 

During 2023, the FRC carried out a 
thematic review of climate-related 
metrics and targets based on 2022 
reporting. The M&G plc 2022 Annual 
Report and Accounts was included in the 
sample and highlighted as an example of 
better practice in a number of areas. On 
the back of this review, in October 2023, 
M&G plc received a letter from the FRC 
setting out some opportunities for 
improvement in preparation of the 2023 
Annual Report and Accounts. 

115

The FRC confirmed it did not expect a 
response to the letter. The Committee 
have been advised how these areas have 
been considered within the preparation 
of the 2023 report.

Audit and Corporate 
Governance Reform
We have received regular updates 
during 2023 regarding the audit and 
corporate governance reforms initially 
proposed in a government consultation - 
Restoring Trust in Audit and Corporate 
Governance - in 2021. 

In May, the FRC launched a consultation 
seeking views on proposed changes to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
arising from the initial government 
consultation. Management prepared a 
response to the consultation with input 
from the impacted business areas. This 
was presented to us for review ahead of 
submission in early September 2023. 

An updated version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code was published in 
January 2024, with the main changes 
relating to internal controls. 

The Committee will continue to engage 
with management on any changes 
required to our processes and 
procedures in light of the updates to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and any 
further reforms.

Internal controls
The Committee has a responsibility, in 
conjunction with the Risk Committee, to 
review the adequacy and effectiveness 
of our Risk Management Framework and 
internal control systems prior to review 
by the Board.

This approach to risk culture is 
supported by the Operational Risk 
Policy, Framework, Standards and 
associated training, which articulate how 
the business expects colleagues to 
positively manage risk. All colleagues 
have risk management accountabilities 
as part of their core objectives.

We receive regular reports regarding the 
status of the control environment, 
including reviews of the effectiveness of 
the Risk Management Framework, the 
status and assessment of any 
outstanding control deficiencies and 
results of Key Control Assessments 
performed by the first Line of Defence 
and independent second Line of 
Defence testing of controls over

Whistleblowing policy 
and framework
We are committed to a safe and inclusive 
workplace where all colleagues can 
speak out and report inappropriate 
behaviour in complete confidence, 
without fear of retaliation. 

The Whistleblowers’ Champion, who is 
also Chair of the Committee, provides 
governance and oversight of our Speak 
Out programme, which supports our 
Whistleblowing policy.

Reporting to the Committee on the 
effectiveness of the Whistleblowing 
policy occurs twice a year. Individual 
cases are not discussed with the 
Committee. Regular meetings are also 
held between management and the 
Whistleblowers’ Champion. 

We are satisfied that our whistleblowing 
policies and procedures remain robust 
and adequate.

Internal Audit
We are responsible for overseeing the 
work, effectiveness and independence 
of the internal audit function. The 
purpose of Internal Audit is to provide 
independent assurance to the Board and 
Executive Management on the adequacy 
of the design and effectiveness of M&G's 
systems of internal control, helping them 
to protect the Group's assets, reputation 
and sustainability. 

During 2023, we welcomed a new Chief 
Auditor, Rob Lewis, with the Committee 
overseeing the recruitment process and 
transitional arrangements. The Chair 
sets the objectives and reviews the 
performance of the Chief Auditor, who is 
directly accountable to the Committee, 
with unrestricted access to both the 
Chairs of the Committee and the Board, 
as well as Executive Management. 

We approved the Internal Audit Charter 
following its annual review, to assess its 
continued validity in light of internal audit 
professional standards and regulatory 
expectations. We also approved the 
2024 Internal Audit plan. 

This is a risk-based plan of coverage - 
developed in the context of M&G plc 
strategy and the Group-wide 
coordinated assurance plan - based on 
an assessment of inherent risk, control 
environment and consideration of 
external factors such as regulatory 
requirements, industry themes and 
emerging risks. The plan will be updated 
to reflect evolving assurance 
requirements and priorities as required.

We measured the effectiveness of 
Internal Audit using several key 
performance metrics, including appraisal 
of the ongoing Quality Assurance 
Improvement Programme. An 
independent assessment of the function 
is carried out every five years (2022 – 
rated Generally Conforms). We receive 
regular briefings from Internal Audit 
throughout the year and ask business 
owners to attend the Committee to 
explain actions being taken.

External Audit
Oversight and engagement 
of external auditor

PwC has been M&G's external auditor 
since 1 January 2022, following a 
competitive tender process in 2020. The 
audit is being led for the second year by 
audit partner Mark Pugh. We provide 
clear guidance to PwC on our 
expectations and hold meetings with 
PwC, without the presence of 
management, to allow the audit team to 
raise any concerns and remain 
independent and objective. We reviewed 
and approved the external audit plan 
before the start of the 2023 year-end 
process. 

M&G has complied with the Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 
for the year ended 31 December 2023.

The Committee have considered the 
Audit Committees and the External 
Audit: Minimum Standard published by 
the FRC in May 2023, and confirm 
compliance with this Standard. 

External auditor effectiveness

Each year, together with senior 
management, we assess the external 
auditor's performance, monitor their 
independence, objectivity, and the 
effectiveness of the audit process. 

116

We carried out our assessment in April 
2023 and considered feedback from key 
internal and external stakeholders on: 
quality of resource; overall plan and 
approach; execution of the audit; quality 
of communications received; and 
whether the external auditor had 
appropriately challenged management’s 
methodology and assumptions, key 
accounting policy judgements and 
exercised professional scepticism. 

Following the review of external audit 
performance and effectiveness, a 
shareholder resolution was 
recommended to reappoint PwC as 
external auditors at the Annual General 
Meeting in May 2023. A further review of 
effectiveness will be carried out in April 
2024, and on an annual basis thereafter.

We welcomed PwC's use of Audit 
Quality Indicators, which were 
monitored and reported on during the 
2023 year end reporting cycle.

Regulatory inspection of the audit

The FRC’s Quality Review team routinely 
monitors the quality of the audit work of 
certain UK audit firms through 
inspections of sample audits and related 
quality processes. PwC was reviewed on 
the audit of our financial reporting for the 
2022 financial year. The Chair of the 
Committee had discussions with the 
FRC as part of the process, and also 
discussed the outcome of the inspection 
with the Lead Audit Partner and the 
members of the Committee. 

The Committee was pleased with the 
outcome of the FRC's inspection which 
reported no areas for improvement of 
sufficient significance to include in their 
report, as well as four specific examples 
of good audit practice.

Auditor independence policy

Our Auditor Independence Policy was 
reviewed in December 2023 and will 
continue to be reviewed at least 
annually. The main purpose of this policy 
is to ensure that the external auditor is 
not engaged in any non-audit services 
that are not permitted, that we comply 
with all other relevant regulation and 
ethical guidance relating to relationships 
with the external auditor, and that we 
maintain a sufficient choice of 
appropriately qualified audit firms. 
Certain services need to be approved by 
the Committee before any engagement.

Fees paid to the auditor

Total fees paid to PwC during the year 
ended 31 December 2023 amounted to 
£22.3 million, of which £3.0 million 
related to non-audit services and 
£1.7 million related to overruns in 
completion of the 2022 audit. This 
compares to £16.7 million paid in 2022, 
of which £2.5 million related to non-
audit services.

The year-on-year increase in fees 
reflects the additional fees relating to 
IFRS 17 and inflation. A breakdown of 
fees paid to PwC is in Note 9 of the 
consolidated financial statements. In 
line with the Auditor Independence 
Policy, all non-audit services were 
approved by the Committee. We were 
satisfied that, considering the fees paid 
and services provided under the policy, 
the objectivity and independence of 
PwC was safeguarded.

Role and responsibilities 
of the Audit Committee
The Committee’s responsibilities 
include, but are not limited to:

– Financial reporting: monitoring 
the integrity of the consolidated 
financial statements, related 
announcements and other 
financial information provided to 
shareholders and other 
stakeholders.

– Framework of internal control and 

risk management systems: 
reviewing and monitoring the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the 
Risk Management Framework and 
internal control systems, in 
conjunction with the Risk 
Committee.

– Internal and external audit 
processes: assessing the 
effectiveness of the internal and 
external audit process.

– Whistleblowing procedures: 

overseeing the effectiveness of 
the whistleblowing programme. 

– Sustainability reporting oversight 

and the development of assurance 
in relation to this reporting.

In Focus

Reporting under IFRS 17 
IFRS 17 is the new accounting 
standard for insurance contracts, 
replacing IFRS 4, with an effective date 
of 1 January 2023. Our 2023 interim 
results were the first time we reported 
on an IFRS 17 basis, and the full year 
results included in this Annual Report 
and Accounts have been produced on 
an IFRS 17 basis.

IFRS 17 is a principles-based 
accounting standard which includes 
features that are not present in our 
financial reporting metrics. This leads 
to significant differences in the 
valuation of the liabilities, and hence 
shareholder equity, compared with 
IFRS 4. 

Monitoring implementation

The Committee received regular 
updates on progress towards the 
implementation of IFRS 17. In 2023, the 
focus was on finalising the 
methodology and judgements and 
ensuring that the business was 
prepared to deliver the requirements 
of the new standard. 

Methodology 

Over the past few years, in preparation 
for the implementation of IFRS 17, the 
Committee have discussed and 
approved a number of key 
methodology decisions. 

Moving into 2023, there were a few 
significant decisions outstanding, 
including fair value methodology, 
treatment of the deferred tax liability 
in the With-Profits Fund, 
policyholder share of the surplus 
assets in the With-Profits Fund and 
treatment of distributions of these 
surplus assets. These areas were 
reviewed and approved by the 
Committee in the first half of 2023. All 
decisions were also reviewed by PwC 
as they were finalised. 

External Disclosures 

In addition to its review of the 2023 
half-year and full-year results on an 
IFRS 17 basis, the Committee also 
reviewed and approved the IFRS 17 
disclosures in the 2022 Annual Report 
and Accounts.

Although IFRS 17 has an effective date 
of 1 January 2023, the requirement to 
restate comparative information 
meant that the date of transition 
to IFRS 17 for the Group was 
1 January 2022. As such, the 2022 
Annual Report included an overview of 
our approach to the implementation of 
IFRS 17 and a preliminary quantitative 
assessment of the impact of IFRS 17 
on the Group results. 

We also reviewed and approved the 
IFRS 17 market update which was 
published in July 2023 to help the 
market understand our latest position 
ahead of our half year results 
announcement in September. The 
update reflected the latest 
expectations and assessment of the 
impact of the IFRS 17 implementation, 
providing a restatement of M&G’s 
financial results for the year ended 
31 December 2022 and the six months 
ended 30 June 2022 on an unaudited 
IFRS 17 basis. 

Assurance 

PwC provided regular updates to the 
Committee on the status of the IFRS 17 
audit, highlighting any areas of 
concern as appropriate. PwC also 
carried out an audit of the transition 
balance sheet (as at 1 January 2022) 
and the restated 2022 financial 
statements. This allowed PwC to 
perform a review of the 2023 half-year 
accounts and the restated 
comparatives. All findings were 
reported to the Committee for 
consideration.

Insight and Analysis

Following the half year reporting 
period, the Committee reviewed a 
presentation summarising the 
approach taken by our peers when 
reporting on an IFRS 17 basis. This 
included analysis from internal and 
external sources, including an extract 
from a PwC cross-industry analysis, 
and helped the Committee to 
understand the impact of IFRS 17 on 
competitor’s results and see how 
other companies had presented their 
results on the new basis.

IFRS 17 on our financial statements in

Priorities for 2024
– Oversight of risks related to the execution of M&G’s business strategy 
including monitoring of the risks of the transformation programme

– Monitoring of M&G's operational resilience, including oversight of the risks 

relating to our third party and outsource providers

– Monitoring Consumer Duty outcomes and evolving risks such as sustainability 
and ESG, and artificial intelligence and how these are embedded in our Risk 
Management framework

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Risk 
Committee Report, which outlines our 
activities and work during the year.

The continued economic and 
geopolitical uncertainty in 2023 required 
our close attention. In particular, we 
reviewed a range of stress and scenario 
testing results through the Group ORSA, 
which provided insight on potential 
adverse impacts to the business and 
management actions available. The 
output of these tests feed into the 
Viability Statement on page 91.

The expansion of Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) introduces significant change to 
both the technology landscape and 
business capabilities. We held a deep- 
dive session to explore its potential risks 
(including evolving cyber security, 
access and privacy risks), as well as 
opportunities it presents.

Managing the risks relating to our use of 
third parties and outsource providers 
remains a priority, given our reliance on 
them to perform core services. 

We receive regular updates on our 
oversight of material third parties and 
have reviewed progress against tactical 
and strategic activities to enhance the 
framework. This will remain an area of 
focus in 2024.

The M&G transformation programme 
was launched at the beginning of 2023 
and we have taken an active role in 
overseeing both the execution and 
operating model impact risks associated 
with this change. 

This has aided our understanding of the 
impact on the overall risk profile, and we 
are now closely monitoring how these 
are managed over the remainder of the 
programme, with regular updates.

Following the identification that the 
framework to manage conflicts of 
interest required further embedding, we 
oversaw the completion of a plan to 
deliver this, including consideration of 
the key conflicts for M&G's three 
operating segments.

The compliance transformation 
programme was a regular item on our 
agenda in 2023 and we will continue to 
support the function as it completes the 
programme next year.

We continue to work closely with the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
Our cross-membership principles ensure 
we manage conflicts and all Non-
Executive Directors have the right 
information provided in the most 
efficient way. My role as Chair of the Risk 
Committee of PAC allows me a wider 
oversight of Group risk issues.

I would like to thank Peter Grewal, who 
served as Group Chief Risk and 
Compliance Officer since January 2021, 
and welcome Louise Gelling, who has 
taken over the role in the interim period 
while we recruit a successor.

Risk Management Framework 
and internal controls 
We approved changes to the Risk 
Management Framework and the risk 
policies as part of our annual review. We 
also recommended updates to M&G’s 
risk appetite and individual risk limits to 
the Board for approval.

Risk models and measures
We approved the overall methodology 
and key assumptions for the Solvency II 
valuation in conjunction with the Audit 
Committee, and reviewed the overall 
effectiveness of M&G’s Internal Model by 
reviewing the results of the annual 
programme of Solvency II Internal Model 
validation. We also approved the Internal 
Model validation plan for the 
forthcoming year. In conjunction with the 
Audit Committee, we received an update 
on financial systems resilience and the 
financial model valuations programme. 

Regulatory matters
We reviewed M&G’s ORSA and 
recommended its approval to the Board. 
In conjunction with the Audit Committee, 
we also reviewed regulatory and public 
Solvency II disclosures and 
recommended them to the Board for 
approval. In addition, we received 
updates on emerging regulations, 
regulatory risks and other regulatory 
matters arising during the year. 

Compliance and fraud
We reviewed and approved updates to a 
number of policies including those relating 
to regulatory compliance risk, privacy and 
data protection, conduct risk, market 
abuse and financial crime compliance.

Review of current and 
emerging risks
We are responsible for reviewing the 
Risk Management Framework, detailed 
on page 58, together with a list of M&G’s 
principal risks and how those risks are 
identified, managed and mitigated. 
We’re satisfied that our review, and 
subsequent reporting to the Board, 
enabled the Board to carry out a robust 
assessment of M&G’s emerging and 
principal risks.

Risk appetite, tolerance, 
profile and strategy
We reviewed regular reports from the 
CRCO, including updates on the risk 
profile, key risks and issues facing M&G, 
emerging risks, our capital and liquidity 
position against appetite and our control 
environment. We also received 
regular reports from our subsidiary 
Board Risk Committees.

Geopolitical and market events remained 
a key focus during 2023. Additionally, we 
monitored M&G’s response to the 
developments in artificial intelligence 
and the enhancement of our operational 
resilience capabilities. 

Sustainability and ESG risk was also an 
area of focus. During 2023, we reviewed 
M&G's sustainability and ESG risks. 
We also reviewed the required 
scenarios, including climate change 
scenarios, on a full balance sheet basis 
as part of the Own Risk and Solvency 
Assessment (ORSA), and recommended 
to the Board a range of economic 
scenarios for business planning 
purposes. 

We regularly reviewed and provided 
advice to the Board on how the 
assessment and analysis of the top 
financial and non-financial risks facing 
M&G were being managed. We were 
also provided with ‘deep-dive’ reviews 
and presentations from executives on 
key risks under their management, 
including third-party risk and 
outsourcing, data privacy, risk impact of 
the transformation programme, artificial 
intelligence and cyber security. We also 
received regular updates on business 
change activities and key programmes.

Priorities for 2024
– Reviewing the Executive Directors' packages to ensure structure and 

opportunity are appropriate

– Assessing the effectiveness of incentives in promoting long-term value 
creation through alignment with the refreshed purpose and strategy

– Assessing the effectiveness of client and sustainability metrics in delivering 

strategic objectives and outcomes

– Continuing focus on the fairness of workforce remuneration in a challenging 

economic environment

Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board and its 
Remuneration Committee, I am pleased 
to present the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report (DRR) for the year ended 
31 December 2023, covering our 
decisions in respect of remuneration 
outcomes for the 2023 financial year and 
implementation of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (DRP) in 2024.

I would firstly like to again thank 
shareholders for their engagement and 
support for the review and renewal of 
the DRP in 2023. We engaged with 21 of 
our largest shareholders representing 
c. 60% of share ownership and received 
a 96.46% vote in favour of the DRP, 
along with a 98.6% vote in favour of 
the 2022 DRR. 

We remain mindful of the need to keep 
certain aspects of the DRP and its 
implementation under review to maintain 
strong alignment with our refreshed 
strategy and purpose as they become 
further embedded within M&G. We’ve 
highlighted key updates in this report.

Performance delivered in 2023
In 2023, we have continued to deliver 
progress on our strategy, focused on 
simplification, profitable growth and 
financial strength. We've established a 
corporate infrastructure with three clear 
operating segments, Asset 
Management, Life and Wealth, which 
also work together: simplifying our 
business, improving the way we serve 
our clients, and creating more 
opportunities to grow M&G. Despite a 
backdrop of evolving market dynamics 
and geopolitical uncertainties, we've 
remained resilient and adaptive with 
financial and operating results that 
demonstrate the strength of our 
business model. 

In Asset Management the Wholesale 
business continues to build momentum 
with a second year of positive net inflows 
and fund performance over three and 
five years remaining strong. The 
Institutional business, as expected, 
remained impacted by the 2022 UK mini 
budget crisis resulting in overall net 
client outflows in the year.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued

In comparison to peers over three and 
five years, our performance remains 
strong or has strengthened with 64% of 
our Wholesale funds ranked in the upper 
performance quartiles over three years 
(2022: 67%), and 69% ranked in the 
upper performance quartiles over five 
years (2022: 60%). However, our 
Wholesale funds performance over one 
year has reduced relative to the previous 
year, with 51% of our Wholesale funds 
ranked in the upper performance 
quartiles over one year (2022: 68%).

The Life business has started its growth 
transformation by entering into two 
major bulk purchase annuity 
transactions in the year. The increase in 
yields during 2022 led to increased 
adjusted operating profit before tax and 
operating change in contractual service 
margin (our new additional alternative 
performance measure following the 
adoption of the new insurance 
accounting standard, IFRS 17) in Life.

Our Wealth segment results have 
benefitted from improved net client 
inflows into PruFund following strong 
underlying investment performance, and 
improved adjusted operating profit 
before tax and operating change in CSM 
in relation to the result from PruFund, 
again reflecting the increase in yields 
during 2022. 

Our capital position remains strong with 
our shareholder Solvency II ratio 
increasing to 203%, maintaining strong 
momentum from the previous year to 
outperform our three-year cumulative 
operating capital generation target for 
the 2021-23 LTIP award and remaining 
on track to achieve our £2.5 billion 
target by the end of 2024, linked to the 
2022 LTIP.

With share price growth in excess 
of 18% and the continuation of our 
dividend policy in 2023, shareholders 
realised a total return of 30% for the 
12-month period.

Clients remain at the core of our new 
purpose, which is to give everyone real 
confidence to put their money to work, 
and aligns with our refocused strategy. 
We are committed to serving our clients 
with excellence, prioritising their needs 
and expectations, elevating the quality of 
our service delivery, fostering stronger 
relationships and deeper trust. 

We are continuing to simplify and 
automate processes and enable our 
colleagues and business partners to 
work together more effectively so we 
can respond to clients’ needs and find 
the right solutions more quickly.

2023 Short-term 
Incentive Plan
The performance measures driving the 
outcome of the 2023 Short-Term 
Incentive (STI) scorecard are 
summarised below.

Financial performance in 2023

In 2023, we moved to a new basis of 
accounting for insurance contracts (IFRS 
17), which required the 2023 adjusted 
operating profit target under the 
previous accounting basis (IFRS 4) to be 
recalculated for the purpose of the STI 
scorecard. We discussed the different 
methodology for determining adjusted 
operating profit under IFRS 17 and 
whether a simple recalculation of the 
target was appropriate for remuneration 
purposes.It was concluded that under 
IFRS 17 the like-for-like methodology 
would lead to a measure that would not 
align remuneration to actual 
management delivery and value creation 
during the year. In order to achieve this 
alignment, it was decided to adopt a new 
STI profit measure for the 2023 
performance period taking account of 
operating change in contractual service 
margin, being a new Board-approved 
IFRS 17 alternative performance 
measure. 

Operating change in contractual service 
margin gives a view of economic value 
generated by including the impact of 
new business written and management 
actions taken in the period. Further 
details of the measure can be found on 
page 147. By adding the two metrics 
together, executive remuneration is 
better linked to strategic actions in the 
performance period in which they have 
been made.

AOP plus operating change in CSM of 
£1,152 million was above target in 2023. 
Above target AOP benefitted from 
higher than expected amortisation rates 
for the CSM in relation to with-profits 
business and also an increase in 
investment and interest income in the 
Corporate Centre. The operating change 
in CSM was also above target benefitting 
from higher than expected inflows into 
PruFund in the Wealth segment.

121

Operating Capital Generation is £996 
million and is above the maximum 
performance level, driven by higher 
underlying capital generation as a result 
of increased yields, together with higher 
other operating capital generation 
largely driven by model changes, offset 
by lower management actions.

Non-financial performance in 2023

Non-financial measures focus on our 
clients and colleagues, and ensuring we 
operate within an effective risk and 
controls environment. Non-financial 
measures ensure that the scorecards 
retain an appropriate balance between 
performance and how it is delivered, 
which is critical for M&G’s long-term 
success, sustainable shareholder value 
creation and aligning with the principles 
of the Consumer Duty. Although we did 
not achieve all of the stretching targets 
established at the beginning of the year, 
an above-target outcome was achieved 
for the non-financial section overall, and 
the Committee was pleased to observe 
stable or improving year-on-year trends 
across most client outcomes, colleague 
engagement and the control 
environment.

Our client metrics include:

– Our Life and Wealth net promoter 
score, which was 15 for 2023, a +1 
improvement on prior year and 
between the threshold and target of 
the performance range;

– With-Profits Fund investment 
performance, which again 
outperformed the benchmark 
demonstrating the benefit to 
policyholders of the strength and 
diversification of the Fund’s 
investment approach; and

– Asset Management investment 

performance, which is measured on a 
rolling quarterly average basis over 
one and three years. 70.7% of 
institutional funds outperformed their 
investment benchmark/objective to 
deliver a maximum outcome. 51% of 
wholesale funds outperformed their 
investment benchmark/objective, 
which was consistent with the 2022 
outcome and at the threshold of the 
performance range.

Employee engagement is the degree to 
which employees invest themselves to 
drive positive organisational outcomes. 
Colleague inclusion continues to be 
measured on a regular basis as part of 
our OneVoice surveys. We measure this 
in our OneVoice survey, asking 
colleagues how happy they are at work 
and if they would recommend M&G as a 
great place to work. Our response rate 
to the OneVoice survey generally 
remained stable at 77% at the end of 
2023 (2022: 79%) with our Sustainable 
engagement score also remaining 
relatively stable at 70.7 (2022:72). 

The scorecard target and performance is 
based on an average of the three 
surveys conducted in 2023. Taking into 
account the level of change across the 
Group Executive Committee during 
2023, the average outcome of 70.7, 
between threshold and target, was a 
pleasing outcome. 

Our annual assessment of risk 
management and internal control 
effectiveness identified that we made 
positive progress in 2023, while 
acknowledging that implementation 
work will continue into 2024 to reach 
target maturity. 

The positive trend of reducing the 
number of overdue high and very high 
assurance issues continued in 2023, with 
the outcome of 0.9% just below the 
maximum performance requirement. At 
63.6%, the proportion of self-identified 
high and very high issues was above 
target, and stable with the 2022 
performance level. 

As a result of this performance the 2023 
STI delivered an outcome of 79.9% of 
maximum opportunity for the Executive 
Directors (compared to an outcome of 
50.6% in 2022).

The primary measure was cumulative 
operating capital generation which was 
above target, with performance in 2023 
driven by higher yields and positive 
management actions.

25% of the scorecard was based on our 
total shareholder return relative to a peer 
group of FTSE 100 financial services 
companies (excluding investment trusts), 
with threshold performance set at the 
median of the peer group and maximum 
performance at the upper quartile. 

Performance was at the upper quartile of 
the peer group with a return of 46.1% for 
the three-year period, driven by a solid 
share price performance with a c. 12.5% 
increase over the period and the 
continuation of our dividend policy which 
continued to be at the high end of FTSE 
100 levels in 2023.

There has also been strong performance 
against the non-financial measures in the 
scorecard:

– For Risk and Conduct, the Committee 

considered a range of factors in 
determining the outcome of the 
measure. They observed that over the 
3-year period the business had 
generally operated within risk appetite 
and policy limits, with appropriate 
remediation promptly implemented in 
a limited number of instances where 
the business operated outside of this. 
In particular, policy compliance was 
maintained at a high level.

– It was observed that there had been 
incremental improvements in the 
control environment in each of the 
three years of the performance period 
and, while further improvement is 
needed in 2024, the positive progress 
over the performance period was 
acknowledged. Taking consideration 
of all of these factors, the Committee 
concluded that an outcome of 40% 
was appropriate.

– 2024 salary increases: The actual 

salary spend increase across the UK 
workforce in 2024 has been 4.6%, 
with higher increases towards more 
junior roles with an average increase 
of 5%, compared to 4% for more 
senior roles. During 2023 we remained 
mindful of the cost-of-living

payment of £500 to all colleagues

– We currently have 37% women in 

– 2023 STI outcomes: The average STI 

senior leadership, which has remained 
constant with 2022, and we remain 
committed to achieving our target of 
40% female representation in senior 
leadership by 2025. 

– Own emissions reduced by 43% 

from the 2019 baseline. The 
outperformance of the target has 
primarily been driven by positive 
management actions to reduce Scope 
1&2 emissions, particularly in relation 
to changes in our office portfolio, 
removal of natural gas from the 
Scottish offices following the 
relocation of our Stirling based 
colleagues to a new office in 2022, and 
proactive procurement of renewable 
electricity. In 2023, our Scope 3 
emissions increased due to upward 
trends in colleague travel. However, 
the 2023 level of business travel 
emissions was still 28% lower than the 
2019 baseline and ahead of the target.

Consideration of pay and 
conditions across the wider 
workforce
The Committee takes careful 
consideration of pay and conditions for 
the wider workforce with a focus on 
fairness of remuneration outcomes, 
particularly in the current challenging 
economic environment. From 2023 a 
remuneration-based question has been 
included in the all-colleague OneVoice 
survey to give the Committee additional 
insight. Workforce remuneration is also a 
key input when determining salary 
reviews and incentive outcomes for the 
Executive Directors. The key indicators 
considered by the Committee as part of 
its 2023 year-end decision making 
included:

outcome for wider workforce 
colleagues, which was 14% higher 
than it had been in 2022; and

– 2023 Total Remuneration outcome: 

The Chief Executive Total 
Remuneration Ratio, which was 28:1 
in 2023 at median (compared to 77:1 
in 2022).

The Committee noted that the decrease 
in the remuneration ratio was primarily a 
consequence of the new Group Chief 
Executive Officer not receiving an LTIP 
vesting in respect of the 2021-23 
performance period, having joined the 
Company in October 2022. It was also 
noted that the new Group Chief 
Executive Officer’s package was 13% 
lower than his predecessor, no salary 
increase had been awarded during 2023 
and on a like-for-like basis the STI award 
had increased in line with the formulaic 
outcome of the scorecard relative to the 
prior year. The Committee was therefore 
assured that the decisions taken in 
respect of remuneration outcomes were 
fair and reasonable when compared to 
the wider workforce experience over the 
period. The Committee noted that 
outputs such as the Group Chief 
Executive Officer pay ratio would 
continue to be subject to some volatility 
over a period where there have been 
changes to the Executive Directors and 
transformation activity impacts the 
demographics of our wider workforce.

In our approach to sustainability we 
continue to prioritise diversity and 
inclusion, along with climate change. We 
are proud to have been one of the first 
companies in our industry to publish an 
ethnicity in leadership target and 
voluntarily publish ethnicity pay gap 
data. 

We believe that transparency is key to 
driving real change, which is why we 
report our ethnicity pay gap in the same 
way that we report our gender pay gap 
data. See our gender pay gap report on 
our website for more detail.

We are committed to achieving year-on-
year improvement in the representation 
of gender and ethnicity in senior 
leadership roles, with ambitious targets 
to ensure fair representation of women 
and individuals who identify as Black, 
Asian or from a Minority Ethnic 
background throughout M&G. This is 
underpinned by our LTIP scorecard, with 
measures and targets aligned to 
achieving and maintaining our stretching 
public goals of 40% women and 20% 
ethnicity by the end of 2025. For more 
information on diversity and inclusion 
please refer to the colleagues section of 
this report from pages 50-53.

Other areas of focus in 2023
There has been further significant 
transformation activity and changes 
among the Group Executive Committee 
(GEC) over the course of the year, with 
the Committee overseeing remuneration 
decisions linked to transformation 
initiatives and for the hiring and exit of a 
number of below-Board executives 
during the year. We were pleased to be 
able to support the execution of 
initiatives and attract executives of the 
required calibre and experience for 
these key roles, within the parameters of 
our Group Remuneration Policy.

The Board oversaw a review across the 
Group to ensure that we meet our 
Consumer Duty responsibilities, which 
included an independent assessment of 
all incentive plan arrangements. The 
Committee received the report and 
conclusions and was pleased to note 
general alignment of the design of 
incentive plans and the approach to 
determining remuneration outcomes 
with the Consumer Duty principles. 
Areas of refinement were identified to 
strengthen alignment in some incentive 
plans and governance documentation.

Implementation in 2024
The Committee approved a salary 
increase of 4% for the Group Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer in 2024. This was the first 
increase to apply since they were hired 
during 2022.

In determining this increase the 
Committee considered external market 
benchmark data, performance/delivery 
since their hire dates and the experience 
of the wider workforce, for whom an 
overall spend of 4.6% applied.

During 2024 we will undertake a further 
review of the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration packages to ensure that 
the structure, alignment and opportunity 
are appropriate in the context of the 
scale of our strategic ambition and how 
effective we are in maintaining the 
momentum in its delivery. If changes are 
considered, we will consult with 
shareholders in advance of finalising any 
decisions.

Incentive plan measures 
for 2024
The scorecards went through a 
comprehensive review for the 2023 
performance period as part of the Policy 
review and consultation. We concluded 
that the structure and balance of 
financial and non-financial measures 
within the scorecards remained 
appropriate. Some changes have been 
applied to the underlying measures as 
we continue to monitor the effectiveness 
of alignment to our refreshed purpose 
and strategy.

Financial measures: Following the 
adoption of IFRS 17 we have retained the 
updated profit measure to add operating 
change in contractual service margin to 
adjusted operating profit before tax in 
the 2024 STI scorecard. We also 
identified that in order to more 
effectively align the Executive Directors 
to our strategic decision to re-enter the 
defined benefit pension de-risking 
market, the Committee decided to adopt 
an adapted operating capital generation 
measure for use in the STI and LTIP 
scorecards which excludes the capital 
strain on writing new business.

Non-financial measures: There is very 
little change to these measures, which 
provide effective alignment to our 
refreshed purpose and commitments to 
clients, our culture, our sustainability 
priorities (diversity and climate) and to 
operate within an effective risk and 
control environment. In defining the 
measures and targets for the 2024 
scorecards, we reviewed our 
methodology to ensure the measures 
were aligned to purpose and strategy, 
and would drive our new behaviours. 

We were also mindful of the progress 
made at the end of 2023 to ensure 
targets and performance ranges for 
sustainability measures were 
sufficiently stretching.

Additional context for the financial and 
non-financial measures can be found in 
the link to strategy and 2024 
implementation sections of this report 
on pages 130 and 144.

During 2024, we will be looking closely at 
our approach to measuring and tracking 
client outcomes with our three segment 
CEOs. We will also consider additional 
climate measures as we embed our 
strategy and interim targets for the asset 
manager and asset owner, as well as 
reviewing how we continue to 
incorporate diversity into the scorecards 
in light of our 2025 targets and the 
outcome of the FCA consultation on 
diversity and inclusion. We therefore 
expect further adaptations to the 
measures in 2025.

Conclusion
As we look forward to 2024, the 
Committee will be focused on: 

– Reviewing the Executive Directors' 
packages to ensure structure and 
opportunity are appropriate.

– Assessing the effectiveness of 

incentives in promoting long-term 
value creation through alignment with 
the refreshed purpose and strategy.

– Assessing the effectiveness of client 

and sustainability metrics in delivering 
strategic objectives and outcomes.

– Continuing focus on the fairness of 

workforce remuneration in a 
challenging economic environment.

executive packages being delivered in shares for three to five years and through the 
shareholding and two-year post-employment shareholding requirement policies.

Remuneration appropriately balanced between recognising short and long term performance.

Financial and non-financial incentive measures that are focused on indicators of sustainable 
performance that position the company strongly for continued success.

A robust and rigorous risk review of remuneration outcomes to ensure that these properly reflect 
overall company performance from a financial, key stakeholder, conduct and reputational 
perspective, and within an effective risk management framework and culture.

Clarity of our remuneration packages which are appropriately positioned relative to the scope 
and complexity of the roles and relevant market benchmarks, and designed to reflect and 
recognise performance.

Key focus on positive client outcomes and quality of client engagement.

Strong alignment with our ambitious diversity targets and objectives to maintain a positive and 
engaging culture that provides equality of opportunity for all current and prospective colleagues.

Promoting a positive culture in which the ‘how’ as well as the ‘what’ is recognised and valued, 
with a focus on colleagues and clients and demonstrable alignment between behaviours and 
remuneration outcomes.

High performing talent

Positive, safe and 
collaborative environment 
aligned to our purpose, values 
and culture

Predictability and alignment 
with stakeholders

Strong alignment for our executives with the experience of shareholders through the delivery of 
a significant proportion of remuneration in shares, with vesting and holding periods over 5 years 
and a robust shareholding requirement policy.

Incentive plan measures aligned to client outcomes and long term diversity and climate 
measures that reflect and recognise the company’s wider role and impact.

Simple and transparent

Remuneration plans and programmes that are simple to understand and provide clear linkage to 
performance set in line with business strategy.

Rationale for measures and link to strategy
During the triennial review of the Policy in 2023, our incentive scorecards underwent a comprehensive review, and the 
Committee considered alternative models for delivering long-term incentives for simplification of our incentive structure 
and alignment with our purpose, strategy, culture and operational priorities. 

We concluded that our current approach of a Short-Term Incentive (STI) and performance-based LTIP created effective alignment 
and should be retained. 

We believe our incentive scorecards retain an appropriate balance between performance and how it is delivered, which is critical 
for M&G’s long-term success, and also sustainable shareholder value creation. Key aspects of non-financial performance include 
risk management effectiveness, client experience and outcomes, conduct, culture, diversity and climate, demonstrating alignment 
with all our stakeholders:

Customers

Colleagues

Communities
Shareholders

Customer outcome measures embedded in the STI scorecard

Colleague engagement is an established measure within the STI scorecard and Diversity in our LTIP scorecard

Climate and Diversity measures embedded in the LTIP scorecard
Alignment to the shareholder experience via:
– The relative TSR component within the LTIP scorecard
– Focus on capital generation which underpins our ability to pay a dividend
– Deferral into shares of a significant proportion of annual STI awards with vesting over three years
– Post-vesting holding and share ownership requirements for our senior executives

Performance measures
Our 2024 incentive scorecards have retained the same structure and measures, aligned to our refreshed purpose and strategy. We 
have refined the definition/methodology for some measures, as we continue to monitor the effectiveness of this alignment. All 
measures have transparent, quantifiable targets and performance ranges. 

In accordance with the Policy, the performance conditions may comprise a combination of financial and non-financial measures, 
with financial measures comprising at least 50% for STI and at least 75% (including TSR) for the LTIP.

The 2024 STI scorecard will have:

– 60% financial weighting with measures aligned to profit and capital generation; and

– 40% non-financial weighting with measures aligned to client outcomes, colleagues and risk and controls.

In 2023 the Company adopted IFRS 17 for accounting for its insurance contracts which required the 2023 Adjusted Operating 
Profit Target to be recalculated for the purpose of the STI scorecard since it had been based on the previous accounting 
standard .We discussed the different methodology under IFRS 17 and whether a simple recalculation of the target was appropriate 
for remuneration purposes. It was concluded that under IFRS 17 the like-for-like methodology would lead to a measure that would 
not effectively align remuneration to actual management delivery and value creation during the year. In order to achieve this 
alignment, it was decided to adopt a new STI profit measure for the 2023 performance period taking account of operating change 
in contractual service margin, being a new Board-approved IFRS 17 alternative performance measure.

In order to more effectively align the incentive plans to our strategic decision to re-enter the defined benefit pension de-risking 
market, the Committee decided to adopt an adapted Operating Capital Generation measure in the STI and LTIP scorecards from 
2024, which excludes new business strain (NBS). Without this amendment there is an unintended risk that the STI and LTIP would 
disincentivise the executive to pursue new business with the potential to deliver attractive long-term returns on capital, but which 
produces a short-term negative impact on capital generation at the point of execution.
The definitions of the financial measures are provided on page 147.

In addition, we have refined the methodology for the risk and control measures to increase coverage and reflect performance 
throughout the year, rather than as at a discrete point in time at the end of the year.

The 2024 LTIP scorecard will have:

– 75% financial weighting (including TSR), comprising Cumulative Operating Capital Generation excluding NBS (50%) and TSR 

ranking within a peer group (25%)

– 25% non-financial weighting with sustainability measures aligned to Diversity and Climate.

The capital measure has been refined to exclude new business strain, as explained above. We have retained the same three sustainability 
measures in 2024 (Gender and Ethnicity Diversity and Own Emissions reduction), for which we have published medium-term strategic 
objectives. The Committee paid careful consideration to performance delivered up to the end of 2023 and the challenges in maintaining 
and advancing performance over the next three years when determining the targets and performance ranges.

2024 Financial measures
The financial measures in our incentive scorecards are based on the Group's Alternative Performance Measures, which are aligned 
with M&G’s long-term performance, external financial targets and shareholder experience. In line with our commitment to review 
the relative weightings of the financial measures in the consultation on the 2023 Policy review, the measures are equally weighted 
at 30% in the 2024 STI scorecard (capital was previously 40% and profit 20%). 

Operating Capital Generation excluding new business strain (short and long-term incentive) 

Operating capital generation (defined on page 147) is an alternative performance measure which demonstrates the longer-term 
view of the movements in our capital surplus. Operating capital generation is aligned to our external targets and is reflective of 
performance that is within management’s control to deliver. The Committee decided to adopt an adjusted metric that excludes 
new business strain in order to ensure the measurement of current management’s performance is not impacted by the regulatory 
requirement to hold additional capital against new business written. New business strain is a component of underlying capital 
generation in the Life and Wealth segments.

Adjusted operating profit before tax plus operating change in contractual service margin (CSM) (short-term incentive) 

Adjusted operating profit before tax (defined on page 147) is the Group’s non-GAAP alternative performance measure used to 
demonstrate the longer-term performance of the Group as it is less affected by short-term market volatility and non-recurring 
items than IFRS profit before tax. The Committee decided to adopt a new STI profit measure by adding the operating change in 
contractual service margin, our new IFRS 17 related alternative performance measure for the Life and Wealth segment (defined on 
page 366) to adjusted operating profit before tax, to ensure that the incentive recognises growth and management actions in the 
period in which they were taken.

Relative total shareholder return (long-term incentive)

A long-term measure, which ensures direct alignment of remuneration outcomes to shareholder experience relative to a peer 
group. Our peer group comprises selected FTSE 350 peers based on comparable size, business scope and geography. This 
approach ensures close alignment to M&G‘s core business activities of Asset Management, Wealth and Life, and geographic 
coverage. The peer group is consistent with that applied to the 2023 LTIP scorecard other than reflecting the removal of Liontrust, 
which is not currently a constituent of the FTSE 350, and comprises:

2024 Non-financial measures 
Across our short and long-term incentive plans, we have non-financial measures aligned with our purpose, strategy and culture. 
These measures ensure that there is an appropriate balance between our performance and how that performance has been 
delivered.

Client measures (short-term incentives)

Client measures are key to the successful execution of our strategy, and to understanding and delivering good client outcomes. 
We include the following measures:

– Life and Wealth clients: (a) a measure aligned to addressing and improving our client net promoter score; and (b) With-Profits 

Fund investment performance relative to benchmark.

– Investment management clients: (a) investment performance of wholesale funds; and (b) investment performance of institutional 

funds, relative to benchmarks and objectives. 

Colleague and Risk measures (short-term incentives)

– Colleague measure: aligned to the sustainable engagement index outcome from an average of the colleague OneVoice surveys, 

aligned with embedding our culture and supporting a safe, respectful and inclusive environment for colleagues.

– Risk and control environment measures: aligned with our commitment to operate within an embedded risk culture and strong 

risk governance framework.

Sustainability measures (long-term incentives)

Sustainability measures aligned to our strategy and external commitments for diversity and own-emissions reductions. We are 
monitoring and committed to introducing an interim net zero asset manager/asset owner measure in the future.

– Diversity (gender) – target aligned to our external commitment to achieve and maintain 40% gender representation by the end 

of 2025;

– Diversity (ethnicity) – target aligned to our external commitment to achieve and maintain 20% ethnicity representation by the 

end of 2025;

– Climate – an interim target aligned with progressing towards our external commitment to achieve a near-term carbon emissions 

reduction of 46% by 2030.

scorecard measures is available 
on pages 144 and 145

Link to strategy and purpose
The metrics used for remuneration of adjusted operating profit before tax plus operating change in CSM and operating capital 
generation excluding NBS are primary indicators of M&G’s long-term performance and how we are delivering on our strategic 
priorities. Total shareholder return aligns with our performance in delivering value to shareholders through improvements in our 
financial performance and outlook, driven by the execution of our three strategic priorities and how we serve our clients. Non-
financial measures ensure there is appropriate balance with how we deliver performance and underpin our purpose to give 
everyone real confidence to put their money to work:

Consideration of individual performance 

The Committee considered performance assessments for the Executive Directors and concluded that the formulaic outcome of the 
STI was appropriate in the context of their personal contribution over the performance period.

Deferral policy 

50% of any STI amount awarded is deferred for three years in M&G plc shares, subject to continued employment, good leaver and 
malus provisions. Dividend equivalents accrue on a reinvestment basis during the vesting period.

STI opportunity and outcome

The maximum STI opportunity for the Group Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer roles remained unchanged at 250% 
of base salary and 225% of base salary respectively. The STI amounts in the single figure table reflect awards to be delivered in 
2024 in respect of 2023 performance, inclusive of both cash and deferred elements as follows:

Risk and Conduct
The Committee considered a range of factors in determining the outcome of the qualitative Risk and Conduct measure. 
They observed that over the 3-year period the business had generally operated within risk appetite and policy limits, with 
appropriate remediation promptly implemented in the limited number of instances where the business operated outside these. 
In particular, policy compliance was maintained at a high level. It was observed that there had been incremental improvements 
in the control environment in each of the three years of the performance period and that, while further improvement is expected 
in 2024, the positive progress was acknowledged. Taking consideration of all of these factors the Committee concluded that an 
outcome of 40% was appropriate.

Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) outcome 
For the 2021 LTIP M&G plc TSR was measured against a peer group constituted of FTSE 100 Financial Services companies 
excluding investment trusts. The starting point for TSR was based on a 30-calendar day average of M&G plc and peer group 
companies preceding the performance period. The end point was based on an average of the last 30-calendar days of the 
performance period. 

Consideration of risk 

The Committee received an independent review of the control environment and key risk and compliance matters from the Chief 
Risk and Compliance Officer, as well as input from the Risk Committee and the subsidiary Risk Committees for PAC and MGG. 
The Committee noted positive progress has been made across M&G plc during 2023 in building on the risk and control framework 
foundations previously put in place. They acknowledged that implementation work continues into 2024 to reach target maturity, 
including some enhancements to elements of the framework and embedding of group-wide Key Control Assessments across the 
business. The review framework considers the management of individual risks (for example conflicts of interest risk) and risk 
outcomes, such as customer outcomes, with specific output received in respect of notifiable event impacts; compliance with Group 
policy requirements; risk appetite assessment; and regulatory feedback. Taking consideration of all information from the report the 
Committee considered it appropriate to make no adjustments to the formulaic outcome of the 2023 STI, or any risk-related 
adjustments to the vesting of the 2021 LTIP.

Total shareholder return performance graph and Group Chief Executive Officer pay 
The performance graph shows the Total Shareholder Return of M&G plc compared to the index constituents of the FTSE 100, 
FTSE 100 financial services companies (excluding investment trusts), and a peer group of FTSE 350 sectoral firms aligned to the 
Group's core business activities (asset management, wealth management and/or life insurance) for the period beginning October 
2019 and ending in December 2023. M&G plc is a member of the FTSE 100 index, and in addition the FTSE 100 financial services 
sector (excluding investment trusts) is used to measure relative TSR performance in the 2021 and 2022 LTIP scorecards, and the 
bespoke FTSE 350 sectoral peer group for LTIP awards granted from 2023 onwards (which is more closely aligned to M&G's core 
business activities and geographic coverage).

All performance conditions have straight-line vesting between points and are measured over the three-year period 1 January 2023 
to 31 December 2025.

For all performance conditions other than TSR there is 0% vesting for performance at or below threshold, 50% at target and 100% 
at maximum with straight-line interpolation between these points.

The starting point for TSR is based on a 30-calendar day average of M&G plc and peer group companies preceding the 
performance period. The end point will be based on an average of the last 30-calendar days of the performance period. For this 
metric there is 0% vesting for performance below threshold, 25% for achieving the median (threshold performance) and 100% 
vesting for achieving upper quartile or above, with straight-line interpolation between these points. The peer group consists of a 
selection of FTSE 350 sectoral peers selected on objective criteria in terms of comparable size, business scope and geography and 
aligned to M&G's core business activities (asset management, wealth management and/or life insurance), and for 2023 comprised:

Workforce remuneration
A Remuneration Policy is in place for establishing standards for the design and operation of remuneration across the Company, 
and is based on principles consistent with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The core components of remuneration and how they 
are operated for colleagues across the Company are explained in the table below.

The Board has an established approach to how it engages with colleagues, including both formal and informal meetings, and takes 
careful consideration of conditions across the wider workforce in reaching its decisions. Over the course of the year members of 
the Board attended a number of sessions held with colleagues across different geographies and seniority levels to gain insights 
into M&G's culture and to understand colleague views and interests. All Board members attended a Townhall in Milan with 
breakout groups on topics including diversity and inclusion and client-centricity. Executive remuneration was not specifically 
discussed at these events but colleagues had the opportunity to raise questions and issues of importance to them. In addition the 
Board held discussions on the all-colleague OneVoice survey that tracks engagement and feedback and reviewed the key outputs 
and themes with management. From 2023 a remuneration-based question has been included in the survey which provides the 
Committee with additional insight. 

The Board and management have continued to pay careful attention to the external environment and to conditions across the 
wider workforce, and have held regular discussions with UNITE union representatives and the Colleague Forum to obtain input on 
matters relating to their members and the wider population. Taking account of the inflationary environment and prevailing cost of 
living challenges, salary increases in 2023 were heavily weighted towards lower earners, with no increases for senior and executive 
management other than by exception. Building on previous cost of living payments delivered in 2022, UK colleagues earning less 
than the full time equivalent of £75,000 received a one-time payment of £500 in May 2023 to help provide support for household 
expenses. For 2024 the overall UK annual workforce salary increase is 4.6%, and although salary increases have been applied at all 
levels of the organisation increases are on average higher at junior and middle level roles.

Remuneration element

Details

Base salary

Base salaries are set at a competitive level taking into account a range of factors including:

– The individual’s skills, performance and experience;

– Internal relativities and wider workforce salary levels;

– External benchmark data; and

– The size, responsibility and geographical scope of the role.

The Company is an accredited Living Wage Employer in the UK.

Pension

Salaries are reviewed annually. The annual salary increase budget for the UK workforce in 2023 was 5.1%. 
This was directed via a carefully targeted approach towards lower earning colleagues, with no increases for 
executives or senior roles, taking into account the impact of the prevailing inflationary environment and 
cost-of-living challenge. For 2024 the overall UK workforce annual salary increase was 4.6%. This was again 
targeted towards colleagues at middle management levels and below (with an average increase of 5%) 
although this year all roles have been eligible for consideration for an increase. Budgets across our 
international locations are determined on the basis of local market conditions but aligned to global 
principles and guidelines.

Across the Company all colleagues are eligible to participate in a pension scheme, or equivalent according 
to local market practice, which is designed to be competitive, but not excessive, in each of the markets in 
which we operate.

Our standard defined contribution scheme in the UK offers a core contribution of 8% of salary with 
additional matching to a maximum company contribution of 13%, aligned with arrangements for the 
Executive Directors. Certain UK colleagues have retained the right to accrue benefits under defined benefit 
schemes, which are closed to new entrants (neither of the Executive Directors are accruing benefits under a 
defined benefit scheme).

Benefits

Benefit packages are designed to be competitive, but not excessive, aligning with local market practice for 
businesses with which we compete for talent, and with the culture and values of the Group. Benefits are 
benchmarked periodically to ensure they remain consistent with these principles.

A consistent core and flexible benefit offering operates across our UK businesses. Standard benefits include 
life, ill-health and critical illness insurances and private medical cover. Colleagues may supplement core 
benefits with additional cover for both themselves and family members on a self-funded basis and have 
access to a range of other voluntary programmes including cycle-to-work and payroll giving. Certain 
colleagues have entitlement to higher levels of core benefits retained from their employment prior to 2020.

Our health and well-being support is also regularly reviewed; colleagues in all countries have access to an 
employee assistance programme, supplemented by additional initiatives as appropriate to the local market 
as well as to the nature and size of our operations. This includes access to the ‘Nudge’ financial wellbeing 
platform in our two largest countries by colleague numbers, the UK and India.

All colleagues are eligible to participate in an STI plan with outcomes closely aligned with business 
performance, client outcomes and individual objectives, including the effectiveness of risk management, 
conduct, culture and behaviours. Bespoke schemes are operated for Investment Management and 
Distribution colleagues consistent with these principles. Colleagues working within a control function 
participate in a separate STI plan assessed predominantly on own function performance and overseen by 
the Risk and Audit Committee Chairs to ensure independence.

The Company operates a Group-wide deferral policy under which a proportion of STI over a threshold is 
deferred for three years, typically in M&G plc shares, unless regulation requires a higher level of deferral or 
an alternative deferral mechanism.

Short-Term 
Incentive 
Plans (STI)

Long-Term 
Incentive 
Plans (LTIP)

Participation in an LTIP is reserved for senior management colleagues with the highest influence over the 
determination and execution of strategic goals, delivery of business performance and creation of 
shareholder value.

All-colleague share 
plans

The Group Executive Committee and certain other senior management roles, not including individuals in 
control functions, participate in the performance-based share plan, aligned with that disclosed for the 
Executive Directors. Other senior management and control function roles are eligible to receive time vesting 
awards with no performance conditions. Eligibility to participate is assessed annually.
All colleagues are eligible to participate in one or more of our all-employee share plans to drive alignment 
and give the opportunity to share in the overall long-term success of the Company.

In the UK all colleagues have the option to participate in the Company Sharesave (SAYE) and Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP) on the same terms as those applicable to the Executive Directors. Both schemes are 
HMRC tax-advantaged. In addition an International Sharesave is offered in other locations.

Group Chief Executive Officer pay ratio
The table below sets out the M&G plc Group Chief Executive Officer pay ratio when compared to pay levels at the 25th, 50th and 
75th percentile of M&G’s UK workforce for both base salary and total remuneration. We have used Option B as our method for 
calculating the pay ratio for this report, as this is consistent with our approach and methodology for other publicly reported 
information on the gender pay gap. Individuals are identified using the gender pay gap methodology, with 2023 full year 
remuneration then calculated on a basis consistent with the single figure methodology.

Annual Report on Remuneration continued

The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that using this population and methodology delivers a representative pay ratio relative to 
the Group Chief Executive Officer and that the median ratio is reflective of our pay and progression policies and practices.

The changes in ratio from 2022 are as a result of the following factors:

– With respect to the salary ratio, Andrea Rossi joined the Company on a lower base pay than that which applied to John Foley, the 
previous incumbent, and did not receive an increase in 2023, compared to an overall UK workforce change of just over 5%, which 
was targeted primarily towards colleagues at junior and middle levels of the organisation. In combination these factors have led 
to a decrease in the salary pay ratio.

– The total remuneration pay gap at median has decreased significantly from 77:1 to 28:1. This is primarily due to Andrea Rossi not 

having LTIP awards vesting for the 2023 performance year; total compensation is therefore lower than that for the Chief 
Executive role in previous years where vesting LTIP values applied. Once LTIP vesting commences with effect from the 2025 
performance year onwards the ratio will be likely to show a corresponding increase. In addition the median employee total 
compensation figure has increased from £87,789 to £99,317. The changes in compensation in the employee quartiles are a factor 
of the salary increase approach applied for 2023 but will also reflect on-going changes in workforce demographics and business 
structure.

For the purpose of comparing annual changes in pay levels and determining the pay ratio at each percentile, the single figure 
methodology was used for total remuneration, as disclosed earlier in this report for the Executive Directors. The salary and total 
remuneration of the representative individuals at each quartile were as follows in the table below. Salary and total remuneration 
figures for the individuals concerned are based on actual remuneration with no estimates or assumptions made and the company 
is satisfied that the quartile positions below are representative of the overall workforce position.

Notes to the 2023 to 2022 figures 

– The percentage changes for the Directors between 2023 and 2022 have been based on the single figure tables on pages 133 

and 137.

– Members of the Audit, Risk and Remuneration Committees received a fee increase from £15,000 to £17,500, effective 

1 January 2023.

– Benefits for the Non-Executive Directors comprise the gross taxable value of expenses relating to travel, including international 
travel to and from the UK, accommodation and other expenses incurred while undertaking duties on behalf of the Company. 
Year-on-year changes are a factor of the number and location of meetings attended.

– Andrea Rossi, Kathryn McLeland, Edward Braham and Dev Sanyal joined the Board over the course of 2022 and the year-on-year 

percentage changes shown reflect full year compared to part year values.

– Clare Chapman stepped down from the Risk Committee with effect 25 May 2022 and therefore her year-on-year fees show a 

slight decrease overall.

– Fiona Clutterbuck departed the Board on 24 May 2023.

– Clare Thompson took on the role of Interim Senior Independent Director with effect 24 May 2023.

– The increase in fees for Massimo Tosato is a factor of the increase from £200,000 to £250,000 for his role as Chair of the MGG, 

MAGIM and MAGAIM Boards, effective 1 January 2023.

– Only the Executive Directors are employees of M&G plc. As remuneration is set by reference to the UK market and regulatory 

practice the UK workforce is considered the most appropriate employee population for the basis of comparison, consistent with 
that used for calculation of the Group Chief Executive Officer pay ratio.

– The 2023 salary review budget for the UK was 5.1% and was targeted primarily at lower levels of the organisation. The increase 
in average salary of 6.4% across the UK workforce over the course of 2023 reflects the focus on responding to the inflationary 
environment and cost of living challenges over the past year, and takes into account specific adjustments and promotions 
managed outside the main pay review as well as annual increases. Calculations have been run on a full time equivalent salary 
basis over a consistent full year population to ensure like-for-like comparison.

– There have been no material changes to benefits provision or rates and the annual workforce change percentage is therefore 

reflective of salary movement and employee selection choices on medical and pension benefits.

– The increase in the average STI award of 14% calculated on a consistent population basis reflects incentive plan funding relative 

to 2022 and the impact of salary increases in 2023.

Relative importance of spend on pay
The following table shows the relative importance of spend on pay in 2023 compared to shareholder dividends, adjusted operating 
profit before tax and operating capital generation. These measures have been chosen as they are key performance measures 
for the business which are linked to the financial measures in the Executive Directors’ STI performance scorecard as defined 
on page 134.

The Committee approved a salary increase of 4.0% for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer in 2024. This was the first 
increase to apply since they were hired during 2022. In determining this increase the Committee considered external market 
benchmark data, performance/delivery since their hire dates and the experience of the wider workforce, for whom an overall 
spend of 4.6% applied.

Incentive measures 2024
We have retained the same structure and balance of financial and non-financial measures within the 2024 scorecards. Some 
changes have been applied to the underlying measures as we continue to monitor the effectiveness of alignment to our refreshed 
purpose and strategy. Additional context for the measures can be found in the 'Link to Strategy' section of this report on page 130. 

All measures have transparent, quantifiable targets and performance ranges. In accordance with the Policy, the performance 
conditions may comprise a combination of financial and non-financial measures, with financial measures comprising at least 50% 
for STI and at least 75% (including TSR) for the LTIP. 

The 2024 STI scorecard will continue to have:

– 60% financial weighting with measures aligned to profit and capital generation; and

– 40% non-financial weighting with measures aligned to clients, colleagues and risk/controls.

The 2024 LTIP scorecard will have:

– 75% financial weighting (including TSR) comprising Operating Capital Generation excluding new business strain (50%) and TSR 

ranking within a peer group (25%); and

– 25% non-financial weighting with sustainability measures aligned to Diversity and Climate.

To ensure the sustainability targets and performance ranges are meaningful and sufficiently stretching the Committee considered 
the respective positions as at the end of 2023 and the level of challenge to achieve and maintain the long-term external published 
objectives.

2024 Short-term incentive 
The maximum STI opportunity for our Executive Directors in 2024 is unchanged from 2023.

– Group Chief Executive Officer – 250% 

– Chief Financial Officer – 225%

The following table sets out the 2024 STI scorecard of performance measures and weightings that will apply to both Executive 
Directors. As these measures and targets are reflective of the Company’s annual Business Plan for the year ahead, full details will 
be disclosed retrospectively, along with the performance outcomes, in the 2024 Annual Report on Remuneration, reflecting the 
associated commercial sensitivity.

performance of the Group as it is less affected by short-term market volatility 
and non-recurring items than IFRS profit before tax. The Committee decided to 
adopt a new STI profit measure by adding the operating change in contractual 
service margin, our new IFRS 17 related alternative performance measure for the 
Life and Wealth segment (defined on page 366) to adjusted operating profit 
before tax, to ensure that the incentive recognises growth and management 
actions in the period in which they were taken.

Operating capital generation is the total capital generation adjusted to exclude 
tax and market movements relative to those expected under long-term 
assumptions, and to remove other non-operating items, including shareholder, 
restructuring and other costs.

In order to ensure the measurement of current management’s performance is 
not impacted by the regulatory requirement to hold additional capital against 
new business written, the Committee decided to adopt an adapted operating 
capital generation metric that excludes new business strain. New business strain 
is a component of underlying capital generation in the Life and Wealth segments.

TSR represents the growth in the value of a share plus the value of dividends 
paid, assuming that the dividends are reinvested in the Company’s shares on the 
ex-dividend date. Relative TSR compares the performance of the Company with 
the relevant peer group.

Annual Report on Remuneration continued

External advisers to the Committee 
Deloitte were appointed as advisers to the Remuneration Committee in December 2020 following a formal tender process to 
provide guidance and advice to the Committee. Deloitte are founding members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and 
provide advice in line with its Code of Conduct. The Committee is satisfied that the advice received from Deloitte is objective and 
independent. The Committee is comfortable that Deloitte do not have any current connections with any individual M&G plc 
Directors that may impair their independence and objectivity. In addition to advice regarding remuneration, separate teams from 
Deloitte also provided other unrelated professional services to the Group during the year including technology consulting, tax 
advisory, finance and accounting and also cyber strategy services.

Key areas of advice provided to the Committee by Deloitte related to the 2023 Directors’ Remuneration Policy review, the 2022 
Directors Remuneration Report, 2024 incentive structures and measures, remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors and 
the Executive Committee and regulatory advice.

The total fees for 2024 charged by Deloitte on a time and expenses basis were £96,680.

Consideration of risk 
The design and operation of all remuneration policies and incentive schemes must be aligned with the Company’s risk 
management principles and policies through the appropriate use of performance measures and targets and the discretion to 
adjust outcomes to reflect risk, compliance and conduct events.

The Risk Committee provides independent input to the Remuneration Committee to help with the assessment of scheme design 
and outcomes to ensure that they are consistent with these principles and policies. A formal risk and compliance report, compiled 
by the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer (CRCO) and approved by the Risk Committee, is submitted to the Committee annually to 
provide an assessment of:

– The effectiveness of the risk and control environment, material events and specific conduct and compliance issues over the one 
and three-year performance periods of awards to enable the Remuneration Committee to determine if the outcome of schemes 
are appropriate or if any adjustments should be applied at scheme or individual level, and the appropriateness of scheme design 
for the coming year.

Input from the report is also used to assess whether there have been any events that warrant the consideration of malus and/or 
clawback on previously determined awards. Any adjustments applied to scheme outcomes for the Executive Directors will be 
explained in the relevant Remuneration Report.

Sustainability risk

As a responsible investor we consider the sustainability risks of all our investments and advice by taking into consideration 
sustainability factors that have the potential to have a material financial impact and seek to incorporate them into our general risk 
management framework. The effectiveness of sustainability risk management in investment decisions and advice is a 
consideration in the CRCO Risk and Compliance report and adherence to relevant principles and policies is monitored and 
reported to the Remuneration Committee as part of this report. In accordance with the M&G Remuneration Policy, any failings to 
meet the required standards of these principles and policies will be transparently reflected in the determination of remuneration 
outcomes.

Operation of the policy
The Committee is satisfied that the policy has operated as intended in respect to alignment of remuneration outcomes and 
quantum with company performance and key principles. 

Consideration of shareholder views
In the lead up to the 2023 AGM the Company engaged with our largest shareholders, comprising 60% of the shareholder base and 
institutional shareholder bodies, to understand their views on the revised Remuneration Policy and on our approach to adjusting 
the outcome for the 2020 LTIP for windfall gains. We responded to feedback and were mindful of this in our final decisions and 
proposals which received a positive level of support at our 2023 AGM. The Remuneration Committee will continue to monitor 
trends and changes in best practice guidelines issued by institutional shareholder bodies, shareholder governance teams and 
corporate governance requirements to ensure remuneration at M&G plc remains appropriate. We will also continue to engage with 
shareholders on the effectiveness of the Remuneration Policy, its implementation and on matters of importance as and when 
they arise.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy

Directors’ Remuneration Policy

Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors 
Key principles of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors

The Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 24 May 2023 AGM and has been designed to align with and support 
our strategic priorities to create long-term sustainable performance, resulting in the creation of shareholder value and positive 
client outcomes within an inclusive and engaging culture for our colleagues. There have been no changes to the policy since it was 
approved by shareholders. The Policy can be viewed within the 2022 Annual Report, available on the company's website.

In determining this policy the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) has followed a fully-informed and independent decision 
making process, receiving input from the Company’s independent remuneration advisers and ensuring that conflicts of interest 
were managed by ensuring that no individuals participated in the consideration of decisions impacting their own remuneration. 
The Committee is wholly made up of independent Non-Executive Directors who do not participate in the Company’s incentive plans.

The key principles underpinning the Policy are provided in the 'Remuneration at a Glance' section on page 125.

Performance measures

Both individual and Company 
performance will be taken into 
consideration when 
determining base salary 
increases.

There are no performance 
measures for benefits.

There are no prescribed 
maximum salary levels, but 
any increase will normally be 
below or in line with increases 
for the general workforce in 
an ordinary year.
The Remuneration Committee 
will retain the discretion to 
award increases at a level 
greater than that applied to 
the general workforce if the 
Remuneration Committee 
deems it appropriate to do so.
The Remuneration Committee 
will consider the impact of 
increasing base salary on 
other elements of 
remuneration to ensure total 
remuneration remains 
appropriate.

Cover levels are defined 
within the terms of each 
benefit with maximum 
opportunity dependent on the 
terms of the insurer and 
individual circumstances.

Base salary Base salaries are appropriately positioned to attract 

and retain executives with the required skills and 
experience to deliver our strategic objectives.
Base salaries are paid in monthly instalments and 
are normally reviewed annually with increases 
normally effective from 1 April each year.
In reviewing base salaries, the Remuneration 
Committee takes into account a number of factors, 
including but not limited to:
– Company and individual performance;
– the scope/size of the roles and the skills and 

experience of the Executive Directors;

– increases among the general workforce and 

affordability; and

– benchmarking information for other firms of a 

similar size and scope to M&G plc.

Benefits

Benefits are provided to ensure our remuneration 
packages are appropriate to attract and retain 
executives with the required skills and experience 
to deliver our strategic objectives.
Benefits are provided to Executive Directors at a 
market competitive level, taking into account 
benefits offered to other employees within M&G.
Benefits currently provided to Executive Directors 
include but are not limited to:
– Life assurance;
– Disability insurance and Critical Illness insurance;
– Private health insurance (including eligibility for 
his or her spouse or civil partner and dependent 
children); and

– Annual health screening.
The Executive Directors are able to participate in 
self-funded voluntary benefits and discounted M&G 
products in line with other employees.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in UK 
all-employee share plans, which currently 
comprises HMRC-approved Sharesave and SIP 
plans, on the same terms as other employees.

certain relocation expenses in accordance with the 
Company’s relocation policy.

Directors.

The scorecard of performance 
measures will comprise a 
combination of financial and 
non- financial measures, with 
financial measures normally 
comprising at least 50% of 
the scorecard.
Performance measures and 
weightings are determined 
annually to ensure alignment 
with the Business Plan and 
strategy.
The Remuneration Committee 
has discretion to adjust 
formulaic outcomes if they are 
not considered to be 
representative of the overall 
performance of the Company. 
Any adjustments applied will 
be explained in the relevant 
annual remuneration report.
Performance targets and 
ranges will be disclosed with 
the performance outcomes of 
STI awards in the annual 
remuneration report 
published at the end of the 
performance period for the 
STI awards.

Pension contributions as a percentage of salary are 
aligned with the general workforce at a level 
sufficient to ensure our remuneration packages are 
appropriate to attract and retain executives with the 
required skills and experience to deliver our 
strategic objectives.
Executive Directors are eligible for employer 
contributions in respect of the Company’s defined 
contribution pension scheme which may be 
received in part or in full in cash.
The approach to pension arrangements for the 
Executive Directors is in line with the wider 
workforce.

STI awards are designed to provide clear alignment 
of objectives and performance with the delivery of 
our financial and non- financial strategic objectives 
annually. The deferred share component of STI 
provides longer-term alignment with the interests of 
the Company and shareholder value creation.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in an 
annual STI plan at the discretion of the Committee. 
Performance measures, targets and weightings are 
determined annually and may vary to ensure 
alignment with the Business Plan and strategy.
A threshold, target and maximum performance level 
is set for each measure, with an outcome of 0% for 
threshold performance or below and 50% of 
maximum for on-target performance.
Performance outcomes may be subject to a 
discretionary downward risk adjustment taking 
consideration of an annual report from the Risk 
Committee, including factors such as an 
assessment of risk and compliance events and the 
effectiveness of risk management relative to M&G’s 
risk appetite during the performance period. Any 
adjustments applied will be explained in the relevant 
annual remuneration report.
50% of any STI payable to an Executive Director will 
normally be deferred for three years into an award 
of M&G shares under the Deferred Incentive Plan. 
The rate of deferral may be adjusted upwards and a 
post-vesting holding period may be applied to meet 
remuneration regulatory requirements where 
required.
Dividend equivalents may accrue on deferred share 
awards, based on dividends paid to shareholders 
during the vesting period. In line with the plan rules, 
dividend equivalents may also accrue during any 
applicable post-vesting holding period. These may 
accrue either in cash or shares on a reinvestment 
basis and are subject to the same terms, including 
vesting date, as the deferred share award.
Adjustments may be made to deferred share 
awards in certain circumstances including rights 
issues, corporate restructuring and special 
dividends, if the Remuneration Committee deems it 
appropriate to do so.
Malus and/or clawback provisions apply to both 
cash and deferred STI awards - see “Malus and

provided that the amended 
conditions are not materially 
less challenging.
Performance measures, 
targets and ranges will be 
disclosed in the 
implementation section of the 
annual remuneration report 
for the year prior to the grant 
of LTIP awards.

LTIP awards are designed to provide long term 
alignment of executive remuneration to sustained 
business performance relative to long-term 
strategic objectives and shareholder value creation.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the 
LTIP at the discretion of the Committee. Awards are 
normally granted annually over M&G plc shares.
Awards are subject to performance conditions 
which are measured over a three-year vesting 
period from 1 January of the year of grant with 
vesting occurring on the third anniversary of the 
grant date. Vested awards are subject to an 
additional holding period of two years.
A threshold and maximum performance level is set 
for each measure, with straight- line interpolation 
for performance between these levels. At threshold 
performance, 0% will vest for all metrics with the 
exception of TSR, for which 25% will vest. There is 
zero vesting for performance below the threshold. 
Maximum performance will result in 100% vesting.
Performance outcomes may be subject to a 
discretionary downward risk adjustment taking 
consideration of a report from the Risk Committee, 
including factors such as an assessment of risk and 
compliance events and the effectiveness of risk 
management relative to M&G’s risk appetite during 
the performance period. Any adjustments applied 
will be explained in the relevant annual 
remuneration report.
Dividend equivalents may accrue on LTIP awards, 
based on dividends paid to shareholders during the 
vesting period. In line with the plan rules, dividend 
equivalents may also accrue during any applicable 
post- vesting holding period. These may accrue 
either in cash or shares on a reinvestment basis and 
are subject to the same terms, including vesting 
date, performance conditions and holding period, as 
the LTIP share award.
Adjustments may be made to deferred share 
awards in certain circumstances including rights 
issues, corporate restructuring and special 
dividends, if the Remuneration Committee deems it 
appropriate to do so.

awards during the vesting and holding periods - see

Malus and clawback
All STI and LTIPs operated by M&G are subject to malus and clawback provisions in the following circumstances:

Application to STI

– Cash STI

– Clawback for 3 years from the payment date

Application to LTIP

– 3-year vesting period

– Deferred STI (in shares)

– Malus for the 3-year vesting period

– Malus for the 3-year vesting period

– 2-year holding period

– Clawback for the 2-year holding period

The circumstances in which the Remuneration Committee may consider the application of malus and/or clawback are defined in 
the plan rules and can be summarised as follows:

– a material misstatement of published accounts;

– an error in the calculation of performance outcomes or such calculation being based on inaccurate information;

– material risk management failures;

– reasonable evidence of individual misconduct or material error;

– breach of an applicable law, regulation or code of practice and/or failure by the individual to meet standards of fitness and 

propriety;

– actions or responsibility for conduct leading to significant loss(es) and/or reputational harm to the company or any Group 

Member;

– material downturn in financial performance; or

– corporate failure.

Malus can be applied to an alternative unvested award to satisfy a clawback event on a vested/released award. The periods that 
malus and clawback apply may be extended if required to meet regulatory requirements.

Legacy arrangements

The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of office, including the exercise of 
any discretions available to it in connection with such payments (notwithstanding that they are not in line with this policy), where 
the terms of payment:

– came into effect before this policy was approved and implemented (including where such payments are in line with a previously 

approved policy); and

– were agreed at a time when the individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment 

is not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director.

Details of any such payments will be set out in the applicable Annual Report on remuneration as they arise.

Remuneration Committee discretion

The Remuneration Committee retains discretion in the operation and administration of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, noting 
that no material changes will be made to the advantage of the Executive Directors without obtaining shareholder approval. Any use 
of discretion and how it was exercised will be disclosed, where relevant, in the Annual report on remuneration. 

This includes (but is not limited to) the following:

– the Executives’ participation in the Company’s incentive plans;

– the timing of awards including grant, vesting and release dates;

– the size of awards and vesting levels within the limits set out in this policy;

– the performance measures and weighting for STI and LTIP awards within the terms set out in this policy;

– the adjustment of formulaic outcomes of incentive awards for risk management issues or where the outcomes are not reflective 

of overall Company performance or aligned with shareholder and/or wider stakeholder experience;

– the settlement of any share awards in cash in exceptional circumstances;

– the determination of good leaver status and treatment of unvested awards in line with this policy and incentive plan rules;

– the extent to which malus and clawback should apply to any award;

– the adjustment of awards in certain circumstances including rights issue, corporate restructuring, change of control and special 

dividends;

– the amendment or replacement of performance measures and targets where it reasonably considers it appropriate to do so, 

provided that the amended conditions are not materially less challenging; and

– to amend the policy to ensure continued compliance with any applicable remuneration regulations.

the Company’s key short and long-term strategic priorities:

– stretching financial targets to deliver growth and create financial flexibility for investment opportunities to build capabilities in

through a rigorous process taking consideration of market conditions, competitor practices and forecasts;

– balancing the interest of policyholders and shareholders;

– creating and maintaining positive experience and outcomes for our clients;

– ensuring alignment with the Company’s strategy, purpose and values;

– creating an inclusive and engaging culture that supports the Company’s diversity and inclusion objectives to provide equality of 

opportunity for all who apply for and perform work for the Company;

– adhering to a robust risk management policy and risk appetite limits;

– aligning with the long-term sustainable success of the Company and value creation for shareholders; and

– ensuring alignment with our objectives relating to Environmental, Social and Governance factors.

Shareholding requirement

300% of base salary

250% of base salary

The purpose of the shareholding requirement is to align executives with the long-term interests of the Company, clients and 
shareholders through a requirement to hold shares both during and post-employment.

Executive Directors must normally attain the shareholding requirement and maintain this level of holding within five years of 
becoming an Executive Director.

In addition to personally owned shares, unvested shares not subject to performance conditions (deferred STI awards and LTIP 
share awards subject to a holding period) will count towards the requirement on a net-of-tax value basis. Executive Directors must 
hold vested shares until the requirement is met except in exceptional circumstances with the approval of the Chair.

Shareholding levels will be tested annually following completion of the annual grant and vesting of awards, which will be disclosed 
in the annual remuneration report.

A post-employment shareholding requirement will be operated for the Executive Directors requiring them to maintain their 
shareholding requirement or actual shareholding, if lower, at the point of departure in full for two years post-employment 
(following the same methodology as set out above).

External appointments

The Executive Directors may take up external directorships and retain the fees for such appointments with the approval of the 
Board. All external appointments and fees will be disclosed in the annual remuneration report.

Remuneration regulations

This Policy has been designed to ensure compliance with all remuneration regulations applicable to the Company. The 
Remuneration Committee reserves discretion to amend the policy if it is required to do so in order to maintain compliance with any 
new or amended regulations.

Scenario charts 

This policy is designed to ensure that executive remuneration is directly aligned with the delivery of key financial and non-financial 
performance objectives and the creation of shareholder value, achieved in accordance with the Company’s policies and values for 
risk management, conduct, client and culture. The majority of the remuneration packages are in the form of incentive awards with 
the maximum values only achievable with significant outperformance of business plans and objectives. The LTIP and 50% of the 
STI award are delivered in shares to maintain close alignment with shareholders. The table to the right illustrates the potential 
earnings of each Executive Director in four performance scenarios:

The performance scenarios incorporate the following assumptions:

Fixed remuneration

Target remuneration

Comprising the 2024 base salary, benefits (based on the annualised 2023 single figure for the 
Group Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and a 13% pension contribution.

Fixed remuneration plus the value that would arise from the incentives for achieving on-target 
performance:
STI with a 50% outcome for on-target performance.
LTIP with a 53% outcome for on-target performance (financial/non-financial measures with a 
50% outcome and TSR with a performance scale mid-point of 62.5%).

Maximum remuneration

Fixed remuneration plus the value that would arise from the incentives for achieving maximum 
performance.

Maximum remuneration with 
50% share price growth

Maximum remuneration increased for the assumption that the shares granted under the LTIP 
increase in value by 50% from the share price at grant.

Remuneration Policy for new appointments

Remuneration packages for new Executive Directors (including those promoted internally) will be in line with the requirements of 
this Policy, including maximum incentive levels, and will be determined on the principle of delivering remuneration that is 
proportionate and not more than what is necessary to recruit and secure talented individuals with the requisite levels of skills and 
experience, ensuring that the cost to secure the right candidate is appropriate. If required, awards may be granted to replace 
awards or amounts forfeited by a previous employer (buyout awards). Any buyout awards would be limited to what is considered 
to be a fair estimate of the value of remuneration forfeited and with equivalent terms (including vesting dates, performance 
conditions and malus/claw back provisions) to ensure that the cost to secure the right candidate is appropriate. As buyout awards 
may cover multiple years of awards from a previous employer, the grant value is not subject to the maximum limits described in 
this policy.

The Company may cover reasonable legal costs and certain relocation expenses in accordance with the Company’s relocation 
policy for new appointments.

The fees and benefits to be paid to a new Non-Executive Director will be determined in accordance with the terms described in the 
Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors.

Service agreements

All Executive Directors have service agreements of an indefinite duration that can be terminated by either party by serving 
12 months’ notice. Under this policy this is the maximum notice period that may be applied to Executive Directors. The terms of 
the service agreements are considered to be in line with current best practice for Executive Directors. The service contracts are 
available for inspection on request from the Company’s offices.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued

Loss of Office

In the event of the termination of an Executive Director, the terms of the termination will be determined by reference to the service 
agreement, this policy, the rules of the relevant incentive plans, relevant regulatory requirements and the signing of a settlement 
agreement, as detailed in the table below:

Element

Policy

Notice period

– 12 months from either party.

– The Company may require that all or an element of the notice period be taken as gardening leave.

– The Company may elect to pay in lieu of notice for all or a portion of the contractual notice period. In 
this instance payment would be restricted to salary only and may be delivered monthly to mitigate 
loss.

– Any holiday entitlement will be pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the year employed. Any 

outstanding holiday entitlement must be used during the notice period.

– If an executive is dismissed for cause, there will be no notice period or payment made for loss of 

office.

Termination payments Consistent with other employees, Executive Directors may receive payments to compensate them for 

the loss of employment rights on termination, subject to entering into a satisfactory settlement 
agreement. Payments may include a nominal amount for agreeing to non-solicitation and 
confidentiality clauses, insurance cover for a specified period following the termination date, 
outplacement services, legal fees or repatriation assistance.

In the event of redundancy, a payment may be made in accordance with the Company redundancy 
policy in effect at that time.
A good leaveri will be entitled to a pro-rated STI award for the period worked (excluding garden leave) 
during the year, determined and paid through the normal process and subject to normal terms, 
including deferral.

STI awards

There is no entitlement to an STI award in the year of termination for a bad leaver.

Treatment of incentive 
awards

Unvested deferred STI awards for good leavers continue to their normal vesting date. Unvested 
awards for bad leavers will lapse.

Unvested LTIP awards for good leavers will continue to their normal vesting date, pro-rated for the 
time worked during the performance period. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to waive the 
pro-ration of LTIP awards, should they deem this to be appropriate. Unvested awards for bad leavers 
will lapse.

Vested LTIP awards subject to a holding period will remain subject to the holding period until the 
original release date.

All awards continue to be subject to their original terms, including malus, clawback and holding 
periods.

Change of control

The Remuneration Committee has discretion to accelerate the vesting and release of awards for good 
leavers in exceptional circumstances.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Remuneration Committee may determine that:

– STI awards for the year during which the change of control occurred may either continue to be 

determined on the basis of the whole year or may be pro-rated to the date of the change of control.

– Unvested deferred STI awards are exchanged or replaced with equivalent awards over shares in 
another company, continuing to their normal vesting date, or that the vesting of the awards is 
accelerated to the date of the change of control.

– Unvested LTIP awards are exchanged or replaced with equivalent awards in another company, 
continuing to their normal vesting date and subject to the same or equivalent performance 
conditions, or that the vesting of awards is accelerated to the date of the change of control. If the 
awards are accelerated, they will be subject to pro-ration and an assessment of the extent to which 
the performance conditions have been achieved. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to 
waive the pro-ration of LTIP awards if this is deemed appropriate.

i

Good leaver applies in the event of death, disability, redundancy and sale of the company/business in which an individual works. Other leavers may be 
granted good leaver status at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (which may include retirement).

Rights and obligations

The rights and obligations attaching to 
the Company’s shares are set out in full 
in the Articles. There are currently no 
voting restrictions on the ordinary 
shares, all of which are fully paid, and 
each share carries one vote on a poll. If 
votes are cast on a show of hands, each 
shareholder present in person or by 
proxy, or in the case of a corporation, 
each of its duly authorised corporate 
representatives, has one vote except 
that if a proxy is appointed by more than 
one member, the proxy has one vote for 
and one vote against if instructed by one 
or more members to vote for the 
resolution and by one or more members 
to vote against the resolution. Where, 
under an employee share scheme, 
participants are the beneficial owners of 
the shares but not the registered 
owners, the voting rights are normally 
exercisable by Apex Group Fiduciary 
Services Limited and Equiniti Share Plan 
Trustees Limited (The Trustees) in 
accordance with the relevant plan rules. 
The Trustees would not usually vote any 
unallocated shares held in trust, but they 
may do so at their discretion provided it 
would be considered to be in the best 
interests of the beneficiaries of the trust 
and permitted under the relevant trust 
deed. As at 18 March 2024, Trustees 
held 0.87% of the issued share capital 
under the various plans in operation. 
Rights to dividends under the various 
schemes are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.

Restrictions on transfer

In accordance with English company 
law, shares may be transferred by an 
instrument of transfer or through an 
electronic system (currently CREST) and 
any transfer is not restricted except that 
the Directors may, in certain 
circumstances, refuse to register 
transfers of shares but only if such 
refusal does not prevent dealings in the 
shares from taking place on an open and 
proper basis. If the Directors make use of 
that power, they must send the 
transferee notice of the refusal within 
two months. 

Certain restrictions may be imposed 
from time to time by applicable laws and 
regulations (for example, insider trading 
laws) and pursuant to the Listing Rules of 
both the Financial Conduct Authority as 
well as under the rules of some of the 
Group’s employee share plans. All 
Executive Directors are required to hold 
a minimum number of shares under 
guidelines approved by the Board, 
described on page 129 of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.

Authority to issue shares

The Directors require authority from 
shareholders in relation to the issue of 
shares. Whenever shares are issued, 
these must be offered to existing 
shareholders pro-rata to their holdings 
unless the Directors have been given 
authority by shareholders to issue 
shares without offering them first to 
existing shareholders. M&G plc will seek 
authority from its shareholders on an 
annual basis to issue shares up to a 
maximum amount, of which a defined 
number may be issued without pre-
emption. Disapplication of statutory pre-
emption procedures is also sought for 
rights issues. Relevant resolutions to 
authorise share capital issuances will be 
put to shareholders at the 2024 AGM.

Authority to purchase own shares

The authority for the Company to purchase 
in the market for up to 237,471,200 of its 
ordinary shares (representing 10% of the 
issued share capital of the Company as at 
the latest practicable date before 
publication of the Notice of the Company's 
last AGM) granted at the Company's last 
AGM, expires on the date of the 
forthcoming AGM.

The Company has not utilised the 
authority obtained at the 2023 AGM. 
Shareholders will be asked to give a 
similar authority to purchase shares at 
the forthcoming 2024 AGM. 

Major shareholders

Information provided to the Company by 
substantial shareholders pursuant to the 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules (DTRs) are published via a 
Regulatory Information Service and is 
available on the Company's website. 

As at 31 December 2023, the Company 
had been notified under Rule 5 of the 
DTRs of the following holdings of voting 
rights in its shares. Between 
31 December 2023 and 18 March 2024 
(the latest practicable date for inclusion 
in this report), the Company has not 
received any additional notification 
pursuant to Rule 5 of the DTRs. 

The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of 
securities which may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights.

Directors’ Report continued

A number of dividend waivers are in 
place and these relate to shares issued 
but not allocated under the Group’s 
employee share plans. These shares are 
held by the Trustees and will, in due 
course, be used to satisfy requirements 
under the Group’s employee share plans. 
As at 18 March 2024 (the latest 
practicable date for inclusion in this 
report), the Company held 13,414,030 
shares in Treasury. Treasury shares are 
not taken into consideration in relation to 
the payment of dividends.

Cash dividend alternative

The Company operates a Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan (DRIP). Shareholders 
who have elected for the DRIP will 
automatically receive shares for all future 
dividends in respect of which a DRIP 
alternative is offered. The election may 
be cancelled at any time by the 
shareholder. Further details of the DRIP 
can be found on our website. The ability 
to receive dividend payments by cheque 
was withdrawn during 2021.

Dividends will be paid directly via bank 
mandate or shareholders can join the 
DRIP to use their dividend to purchase 
further M&G plc shares. Receiving 
dividends via bank mandate, rather than 
by cheque, means shareholders can 
receive funds more quickly, more 
securely and in a more environmentally 
friendly way.

Political donations
The Group does not make political 
donations or incur political expenditure 
within the ordinary meaning of those 
words and nor did it in 2023. However, 
the definitions of political donations, 
political parties, political organisations, 
and political expenditure used in the UK 
Companies Act 2006 are broad. As a 
result, they may cover routine activities 
that form part of the normal business 
activities of the Group and are an 
accepted part of engaging with 
stakeholders, such as sponsoring events 
or supporting policy reviews where M&G 
has a legitimate business in policy 
development. While the Group prohibits 
political donations, the Group retains the 
right to seek authority from shareholders 
in making political donations at the AGM 
in order to avoid inadvertent breaches. 

Change of control
There are a number of agreements that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the Company, such 
as commercial contracts, bank loan 
agreements, property lease 
arrangements and employee share 
plans. In the context of the Group as a 
whole, none of these are deemed to be 
significant in terms of their potential 
impact except for those listed below.

Credit facilities
Under a £1,286 million multi-currency 
revolving credit facility between the 
Company and the banks and financial 
institutions named therein as lenders 
(Lenders) dated 27 March 2019 (the 
Facility), in the event that any person or 
group of persons acting in concert 
directly or indirectly gains control of the 
Company and its subsidiaries, then any 
Lender may elect within a prescribed 
time frame to be replaced by a new 
lender, or to cancel its commitment, 
under the Facility whereupon the 
Company shall be required to repay each 
loan made to it on the last day of the 
interest period for that loan, and any loan 
repaid may be reborrowed from a new 
lender, subject to the terms of 
the Facility. 

Under a £107 million and two 
£53.6 million revolving loan facilities 
between the Company and the bank 
named therein as lender (Lender) dated 
27 March 2019 (the Facility), in the event 
that any person or group of persons 
acting in concert directly or indirectly 
gains control of the Company and its 
subsidiaries, then the Lender may elect 
within a prescribed time frame to be 
replaced by a new lender, or to cancel 
its commitment, under the Facility 
whereupon the Company shall be 
required to repay each loan made to it, 
together with accrued interest and all 
other amounts accrued under the 
Facility, which shall in each case be 
immediately due and payable, on the last 
day of the interest period for that loan.

Risk management objectives 
and policies
Details of the framework which allows 
M&G to manage risk within agreed 
appetite levels are set out on page 58. In 
this section is information on risk culture 
and governance, systems of internal 
control, how risks are categorised and 
how risk appetites and levels are set. 
Specific information around risk 
management objectives, policies (eg 
hedging) and exposure (eg price, credit, 
liquidity, cash flow risk) is contained in the 
financial statements on pages 311-332.

Environmental, employee 
and social policies
Policies relating to environmental 
matters, the Company’s employees and 
social, community and human rights 
issues can be found on page 47 
of this Report.

Equal opportunities and 
employment of disabled 
persons 
M&G plc's Global Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy ensures that equal opportunities are 
afforded to all colleagues, candidates and 
suppliers in an environment in which each 
is treated with dignity and respect. Defined 
processes are in place to ensure diversity 
and inclusion is embedded in the culture of 
the workplace and that we comply with 
statutory and regulatory requirements in 
the local labour marker; provide equal 
opportunity for all who apply for and 
perform work for M&G plc irrespective of 
sex, race, age, ethnic origin, educational, 
social and cultural background, marital or 
civil partnership status, religion or belief, 
sexual orientation or disability; and allow for 
reasonable adjustments to support those 
with special requirements. We also 
encourage the same standards of our 
recruitment and consultant suppliers.

Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association 
allow the Board to authorise conflicts of 
interest that may arise and to impose 
such limits or conditions as it thinks fit. 
The Group has established procedures 
whereby actual and potential conflicts of 
interest are regularly reviewed, 
appropriate authorisation is sought prior 
to the appointment of any new Director, 
and new conflicts are addressed 
appropriately. The decision to authorise 
a conflict of interest can only be made by 
non-conflicted Directors and, in making 
such decisions, the Directors must act in 
a way they consider, in good faith, would 
be most likely to promote the

Andrea Rossi
Group Chief Executive Officer
21 March 2024

The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.

– prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and Company will continue in 
business.

The Board requested that the Audit 
Committee review the Annual Report 
and provide its opinion on whether the 
report is fair, balanced and 
understandable. The Audit Committee’s 
opinion is on page 112.

Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance with 
UK-adopted international accounting 
standards and the Company financial 
statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework', 
and applicable law).

Under company law, Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period. In 
preparing the financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:

– select suitable accounting policies and 

then apply them consistently;

– state whether applicable UK-adopted 
international accounting standards 
have been followed for the Group 
financial statements and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 have been 
followed for the Company financial 
statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements;

– make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and

The Directors are responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:

– M&G plc’s Group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of the Group’s profit and the 
Group’s cash flows for the year then ended;

– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards 

as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006;

– the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 

Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and 
applicable law); and

– the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the Consolidated and Company statements of financial position as at 31 December 2023; the Consolidated income 
statement, Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated statement of cash flows, the Consolidated and 
Company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, comprising material 
accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in Note 9, we have provided no non-audit services to the Parent Company in the period under audit.

Our audit approach

Context
The Group is an international asset manager and insurer. Its operations primarily consist of the legal entity operations in the United 
Kingdom, Europe and Asia. Given the activities of the Group, we have built teams with the relevant industry experience in all 
significant locations in which the Group operates. In addition to forming this opinion, in this report we have also provided 
information on key audit matters we discussed with the Audit Committee, setting out a description of the matter, how we 
approached the audit in these areas, and our conclusion. In designing our audit approach we have considered the impact that 
climate change could have on the Group, including physical or transitional risks which could arise. In particular, we have assessed 
the impacts on the financial statements of the commitments related to climate change which the Group has made.

Overview
Audit scope

– Our audit scope has been determined to provide coverage of all material financial statement line items, and as part of designing 

our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.

– The Group has four reportable segments: Asset Management, Wealth, Life and Corporate Centre. Each reportable segment 

includes a number of reporting businesses across different locations and legal entities.

– We tailored our in scope components based on our assessment of inherent risk and their financial significance to the 

consolidated financial results. In particular, we considered where Management made subjective judgements; for example, in 
respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including consideration 
of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

– Three components were subject to an audit of their complete financial information. Sixteen other components were subject to an 

audit on certain balances and transactions.

– Our audit scope provided coverage of 82% of IFRS Profit before tax and 94% of Total equity.

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Valuation of insurance contract liabilities: Implementation of IFRS 17 - Judgements on transition and restatement of comparative 
information, Valuation of insurance contract liabilities: Implementation of IFRS 17 - New models and data flows, Valuation of 
insurance contract liabilities: Illiquidity premium for with profit contracts and Valuation of insurance contract liabilities: Persistency 
for with-profit contracts are new key audit matters this year. IAS 8 disclosure on the adoption of IFRS 17, which was a key audit 
matter last year, is no longer included because IFRS 17 became effective from 1 January 2023 and therefore no IAS 8 disclosure is 
required. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of insurance contract liabilities: Implementation of IFRS 17 - Judgements on transition and restatement 
of comparative information (Group)

Refer to notes 1.2.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5.2 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of related accounting policies and balances.

The Group applied IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts from 1 January 
2023 to value its insurance contract liabilities, replacing IFRS 4. 
International Accounting Standard 8 ‘Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ (“IAS 8”) requires 
that when the impact of adopting a new accounting standard 
would be material to the financial statement comparatives, 
these comparatives should be restated. As a result, the opening 
balance sheet as at 1 January 2022 (transition date) and the 
year end 2022 comparatives have been restated in order to 
comply with the requirements of IFRS 17. Given the judgements 
and uncertainty in estimating the opening balance sheet and 
restated comparatives, this has been an area of focus.

Separate to the ongoing significant risks in respect of the 
insurance liabilities, assumptions relating to annuitant mortality, 
renewal expenses, persistency, credit default for annuity 
contracts; and the illiquidity premium for with-profit contracts 
apply equally to the opening balance sheet and restated 
comparatives.

The implementation of IFRS 17 required the Group to make 
significant judgments in the development of its accounting 
policies. The key judgements impacting the Group at transition 
include:

– The determination of the date before which it is impracticable to 

apply the fully retrospective approach to calculate the 
Contractual Service Margin (CSM) on transition;

– The selection of data and assumptions made in applying the 

modified retrospective approach (MRA) to calculate the CSM on 
transition (for applicable with-profit contracts), specifically:

– The determination of the date from which MRA would apply; 

and

– The assumptions management made where necessary data 
was unobtainable at the required level of granularity for the 
historic periods.

– The approach applied in determining the fair value used to 
calculate the CSM on transition (for applicable contracts); 
including, the compensation a market participant would require 
for taking on the obligations; and, 

– The application of IFRS 17 methodology to determine the 

liabilities of with-profit contracts, specifically:

– The assessment of eligibility for the variable fee approach;

– The definition and classification of the variable fee;

– The approach to allow for mutualisation (including shareholder 

tax), the appropriate policyholders share and the 
measurement of the liability for additional amounts expected 
to be paid to current or future policyholders (in accordance 
with paragraph B71 of IFRS 17); and

– Treatment of non-profit contracts in the with-profit fund.

Due to the nature and complexity of the implementation of IFRS 17, 
we also deemed the narrative and analysis within the transition 
disclosures and accounting policies to be an area of focus because 
of the significant changes introduced by the standard.

We involved PwC actuarial specialists to evaluate the key 
judgements and assumptions made on transition for each 
Group of products. We have performed the following 
procedures:
– Obtained an understanding and challenged the key 
methodologies and judgements in applying IFRS 17;

– Understood, evaluated and assessed the relevant controls 
and governance process in place for the determination and 
approval of key IFRS 17 judgements relating to the opening 
balance sheet at the transition date and the year end 2022 
restated comparative information;

– Assessed and challenged the date of impracticability which 

determines the extent to which the fully retrospective 
approach is used to calculate the CSM on transition;

– Assessed and challenged the appropriateness of the inputs 

and judgements applied in determining the CSM on transition 
for business measured using the fully or modified 
retrospective approaches, including the use of previously 
audited or disclosed information and our expectations based 
on market experience;

– Tested the calibration and methodology to measure the fair 

value at the transition date (for applicable contracts), 
including assessing the calibration and methodology relative 
to market data (to the extent available and relevant), our 
industry knowledge and experience, and by comparing to 
other insurers of a similar nature in the market; 

– Performed substantive testing over the calculations, 

processes and tools developed to determine the full and 
modified retrospective CSMs and fair value of insurance 
contracts (for applicable contracts) on adopting IFRS 17 at 
the transition date;

– Evaluated the key actuarial judgements made in applying the 
transition approaches to the with-profit contracts specifically 
challenging the variable fee eligibility assessment, the 
definition and classification of cash flows within the variable 
fee, the approach to allowing for mutualisation, the 
calculation of the additional amounts expected to be paid to 
current or future policyholders, the derivation of shareholder 
tax and the treatment of non-profits business in the with-
profits fund;

– Assessed and tested the adequacy and compliance of the 
relevant sections of quantitative and qualitative transition 
disclosures impacted by the significant judgements made on 
adoption of IFRS 17; and

– Reconciled the relevant disclosures to underlying accounting 

records and output from the IFRS 17 infrastructure.

Based on the audit procedures performed and evidence 
obtained, we consider the methodologies used, key 
judgements and assumptions made by management on IFRS 17 
transition to be appropriate.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of insurance contract liabilities: Implementation of IFRS 17 - New models and data flows (Group)

Refer to note 1.2.1 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of related accounting policies and balances.

The implementation of IFRS 17 required the Group to develop 
and introduce new models, systems and data stores. There is a 
significant volume of data processed, transformed and 
aggregated in the new infrastructure. There is also complexity 
in the application of IFRS 17 in the data selected / excluded, the 
flow of data between systems and as used in the methodology 
and judgements within the actuarial models. 

This is particularly the case with regard to the initial 
implementation of data flows to produce the IFRS 17 year end 
2022 comparative results where new models and systems were 
used for the first time giving rise to increased risks of material 
misstatement. 

The key areas of risk and complexity are:

We have performed the following procedures:

– Obtained an understanding of the new infrastructure 

implemented for IFRS 17 reporting;

– Evaluated the design and operational effectiveness of the key 

controls in place across the new infrastructure;

– Evaluated the appropriateness of the tagging rules 

implemented in the categorisation of accounting cash flows 
based on our understanding of the business, management’s 
methodology and the requirements of IFRS 17;

– Tested the changes to the existing actuarial cash flows 
models to incorporate IFRS 17 functionality and the 
development of the new tool to determine the level of 
stresses applied in the calculation of the risk adjustment;

– The implementation of the ‘RiskAgility FM’ IFRS 17 

Calculation Engine (‘CSM engine’), specifically the application 
of IFRS 17 methodology and calculations in the engine;

– Tested the methodology and calculations in the CSM engine 
are appropriate and in line with the requirements of IFRS 17 
and the policies implemented by management;

– The enhancements made to the accounting cash flows in the 
data processing layer which is an input into the new IFRS 17 
infrastructure, specifically the tagging of transactions to 
determine fulfilment cash flows, non-distinct investment 
components, underlying items and unit of account; 

– Enhancements made to the actuarial cash flow models to 

produce the granularity of results required for the new IFRS 
17 infrastructure;

– The development of new tools to produce the level of 

stresses applied in the calculation of the risk adjustment; and 

– The completeness and accuracy of data flowing through the 
new IFRS 17 infrastructure, specifically the data into the new 
‘cash flow’ databases which were implemented to manage 
new actuarial and accounting data sets required for the CSM 
engine.

– Examined management’s iterative testing of the 

implementation of the CSM engine using their test cases to 
assess appropriateness and where necessary, we performed 
independent validation of the CSM engine; and

– Tested reconciliations to assess the completeness and 
accuracy of key data flows in the new infrastructure. 

Based on the audit procedures performed and evidence 
obtained, we consider that the new models and data flows 
implemented for transition to IFRS 17 have appropriately 
applied the requirements of the standard and management’s 
methodology in calculating the IFRS 17 results.

Valuation of hard to value financial investments (level 3) (Group)

Refer to notes 1.5.5, 31.3.1 & 31.4 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of related accounting policies, valuation 
methodologies and balances.

The Group’s financial investments are held to back the Group 
insurance contract liabilities and investment contracts within its 
Life and Wealth businesses, and to meet regulatory capital 
requirements, as well as providing returns on shareholder 
assets.

Most of the Group’s financial investments are valued by 
reference to prices on active markets. However, some are 
priced by reference to market data and/or valuation models. 
The models vary in complexity depending on the nature of the 
investments. Investments that require the use of significant 
judgement and inputs that are not market observable have a 
higher level of inherent estimation uncertainty. These 
investments are classified as Level 3 under the fair value 
hierarchy and include:

– Equity release mortgages;

– Unlisted equity investments;

– Private credit and other illiquid debt securities; and

– Investment property.

The valuation of hard to value financial investments was a key 
area of focus given the magnitude and the inherent uncertainty 
involved in the estimation. Changes in estimates could result in 
material changes in the valuation.

Equity Release Mortgages (ERMs)

The valuation of the Group’s LTM portfolio is inherently 
subjective. There are significant unobservable inputs relating to 
the No Negative Equity Guarantee. The valuation uses an 
internal discounted cash flow model with assumptions based 
on the current property value, net property growth rate and the 
discount rate (including spread assumptions to estimate an 
illiquidity premium above the risk free discount rate).

Unlisted Equity Investments

Private equity investments are held through funds managed by 
internal and external fund managers. The investments are 
valued in line with the requirements of The International Private 
Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV) Guidelines. Given 
their magnitude, the external valuations are an area of focus. 
Valuations are performed periodically by the fund managers. 
The investments are included at the most recent Net Asset 
Value (NAV) provided by the fund manager adjusted for cash 
movements, where applicable. 

We performed the following audit procedures to test the valuation 
of the investments classified as Level 3:

– Assessed the design and, where applicable, the operating 

effectiveness of controls related to the valuation of investments; 
and

– Assessed both the methodology and assumptions used in the 

calculation of the year end valuation as well as understanding the 
governance controls that the Group has in place to monitor these 
processes.

For equity release mortgages, we:

– Applied our industry knowledge and experience (using our 
actuarial specialists) to assess the appropriateness of the 
methodology, models and assumptions used against recognised 
actuarial practices;

– Tested data inputs used in the valuation models to underlying 

documentation on a sample basis;

– Evaluated the appropriateness of significant economic 

assumptions, including the spread applied above the risk free 
rate, that are used within the valuation process, with reference to 
market data and industry benchmarks where available;

– Evaluated the appropriateness of the mortality and morbidity 

assumptions used in the valuation, based on available experience 
data and industry data on expectations of future mortality 
improvements; and

– Performed testing over the model calculation . We placed 

reliance on the model baselining carried out as part of our first 
year audit (in 2022), whereby we independently replicated the 
asset cash flows for a sample of policies in order to validate that 
the model calculations were operating as intended. There are no 
changes in the model calculations over 2023.

For unlisted equity investments, we:

– Assessed the methodology used for the valuation of these 

investments and whether this is consistent with the International 
Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (‘IPEV’) guidelines;

– Where possible, independently obtained the most recent NAV 
statements from fund managers and agreed the valuation to 
underlying books and records; 

– For a sample, verified any adjustments made for subsequent 

capital movements; and

– For a sample, performed look back testing on the NAV 

statements provided by fund managers against the equivalent 
audited financial statements.

Key Audit Matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Private credit and other illiquid debt

For private credit and other illiquid debt, we:

Private credit and other illiquid debt are predominantly valued 
using discounted cash flow models. A key assumption applied 
in determining the discount rate used to calculate the fair value 
of these securities is the credit rating and the associated credit 
spread. The credit rating is determined by assessing the credit 
quality of the underlying borrower and assigning an internal 
credit rating, which is unobservable. The credit spread is then 
determined by reference to a comparable security or basket of 
securities. Determining the internal credit rating and the 
associated comparables requires expert judgement. 

For residential ground rents, the valuation could be impacted by 
the UK government’s Leasehold and Freehold Reform Bill and 
the associated consultation on potential restrictions to the level 
of residential ground rents, issued on 9 November 2023.

– Tested inputs into the valuation model to external sources, 

where possible, and contractual data;

– Engaged our valuation experts to assess the appropriateness of 

the methodology used to determine internal credit ratings;

– For a sample, assessed the application of the internal credit 

rating methodology, including challenging the assumptions used 
in setting the internal credit rating;

– For a sample of investments, reperformed the valuation using 

our independently selected internal credit ratings and 
comparables; 

– Where a management expert has been used to corroborate 
management’s Level 3 valuations, we have assessed their 
competence and capabilities. We also assessed their 
independence by discussing the scope of their work and 
reviewing the terms of their engagement for unusual terms or 
fee arrangements; and

– Assessed the impact of our findings on credit ratings and 

valuation on the portfolio of private placement loans.

In response to the recent Leasehold and Freehold Reform Bill 
and the associated consultation on potential restrictions to the 
level of residential ground rents, we have:

– Assessed the appropriateness of the judgements made in 

determining the impact of the consultation on the valuation of 
the loans secured on residential ground rent assets;

– Ensured that sufficient consideration was given to a range of 
likely outcomes of the consultation and subsequent changes 
in legislation;

– Challenged management on the changes in credit ratings and 

associated credit spread applied; and 

– Assessed and challenged the associated disclosure given the 

inherent uncertainty resulting from the consultation.

Key Audit Matter

Investment Property

The Group holds property (directly and indirectly) within the UK, 
Europe and Asia. The valuation of the Group’s portfolio is 
inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual 
nature of each property, its location and the expected future 
rentals for that particular property. There is continued 
uncertainty facing the real estate sector as a result of the 
current economic environment and the impact of climate 
change. 

Valuations are carried out by third party valuers engaged by the 
Group, who perform their work in accordance with the Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors (‘RICS’) Valuation – 
Professional Standards or equivalent local standards. The 
valuations take into account the property-specific information 
including the current tenancy agreements and rental income, 
condition and location of the property, and future rental 
prospects, as well as prevailing market yields and market 
transactions.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

For Investment property in the UK, Europe, and Asia, we:

– Engaged our own valuation experts who are qualified 

chartered surveyors with relevant market knowledge to 
support our audit of the property valuations;

– Assessed the competence and capabilities of the third party 

valuers and verified their qualifications. The valuers are 
reputable and established real estate valuation firms. We also 
assessed their independence by discussing the scope of their 
work and reviewing the terms of their engagement for 
unusual terms or fee arrangements;

– Obtained and read the external valuation reports and held 

separate meetings with the third party valuers to discuss the 
key assumptions; and

– To verify that the valuation approach was suitable for use in 
determining the carrying value for investment properties in 
the financial statements, we:

– Confirmed that the valuation approach was in accordance 

with RICS standards;

– Performed sample testing on the standing data in the 
Group’s information systems used in the the valuation 
process to verify the accuracy of the property information 
supplied to the third party valuers by Management;

– Obtained valuation details of properties held by the Group 

and set an expected range for yield and capital value 
movement, determined by reference to published 
benchmarks and using our experience and knowledge of 
the market;

– Compared the investment yields used by the third party 

valuers with our expected range of yields and the year on 
year capital movement to our expected range. Where key 
assumptions were outside the expected range or 
otherwise appeared unusual, and/or valuations showed 
unexpected movements, we undertook further 
investigations;

– Challenged the third party valuers on the extent to which 

the valuations have taken into account the impact of 
climate change and related ESG considerations; and

– For properties under development valued using the 

residual valuation method, obtained the development 
appraisal and assessed the reasonableness of the third 
party valuers’ key assumptions. This included comparing 
the yield to comparable market benchmarks, comparing 
the estimated costs to complete, to development plans and 
contracts, and considering the reasonableness of other 
assumptions that are not so readily comparable with 
published benchmarks, such as estimated rental value and 
developers’ profit.

For all asset classes we assessed the adequacy of 
the disclosures in the financial statements.

Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, 
we consider the valuations for hard to value assets to 
be appropriate.

Valuation of hard to value plan assets (level 3) and Valuation of defined benefit obligation (Group)

Refer to notes 1.5.13 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of related accounting policies and balances.

The Group has three key defined benefit schemes which are 
closed to new entrants. The schemes are run by Trustees on 
behalf of the beneficiaries. The defined benefit surplus or deficit 
presented is the net of the defined benefit obligation and the 
scheme plan assets, and a restriction on the surplus to the 
Prudential Staff Pension Scheme ("PSPS") scheme. The key 
areas of focus are the valuation of the defined benefit 
obligations and the valuation of the level 3 plan assets which 
are complex and judgemental.
The valuation of the defined benefit obligations (“DBO”) for the 
Group is performed by third party administrators with key 
assumptions initially set through the triennial valuation process 
and reassessed annually by the Group.
The estimate of the DBO is dependent on a number of 
assumptions, including the discount rate, inflation rate and 
mortality rates. Small changes in these assumptions can have a 
material impact on the valuation due to the size and the 
duration of the pension obligations. Management performs a 
review of the DBO valuation methodology and assumptions 
each year with the assistance of external experts. During the 
year there were no changes to mortality base tables. The 
financial methodologies were updated and longevity 
improvements updated based on annuity book data.
The valuation of complex plan assets includes a longevity swap 
and illiquid private credit assets. The valuation of the illiquid 
private credit assets was assessed along with similar assets 
described in the ‘Valuation of hard to value financial 
investments’ key audit matter above.
The valuation of the longevity swap has been performed by an 
external expert. The swap has been valued under the 
requirements of Fair Value, IFRS13, which is consistent with 
assuming the swap had nil value at outset. This has been 
completed by applying a fee loading to the floating leg of the 
longevity swap.
The financial assumptions, including discount rate and inflation 
rate, are updated in line with market conditions at the reporting 
date. Other assumptions, such as mortality and the fee 
collateral have been set in line with the assumptions set out in 
the longevity swap contract. 
The surplus in the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme that is 
recognised is limited to the amount which is recoverable 
through reduced future contributions.

For the pension schemes, we have:

– Understood and, evaluated the design effectiveness of key 

controls in place in respect of the DBO;

– Reviewed management expert’s IAS 19 report and 

challenged the methods adopted to determine the valuation 
of the obligations;

– Engaged our actuarial specialists to evaluate the judgements 
made by management in determining the key financial and 
mortality assumptions used in the calculation of the liability;

– Assessed the reasonableness of the methodologies and 
assumptions adopted using our knowledge of market 
practice and industry developments, including use of 
benchmarks and external market data. We also used 
sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of alternative 
assumptions;

– Evaluated the objectivity and competence of management’s 

actuarial expert; and

– Reperformed calculations of pension liabilities and compared 

these with the expert’s calculations.

For the valuation of the level 3 plan assets, our work focused on:

– For the illiquid private credit assets, we assessed the 

methods and assumptions used to value the assets (as set 
out above);

– For the longevity swap, we reviewed the assumptions used 
to calculate the collateral value of the longevity swap and 
assessed the magnitude of the change in value of the 
longevity swap since the previous year end.

For the surplus recognised in the schemes, we assessed the 
availability of the pension surplus to the Group and recalculated 
the available surplus in the PSPS scheme.

We read and assessed the disclosures made in the financial 
statements, including disclosure of the assumptions. 

Based on the evidence obtained, we found the valuation of the 
Scheme’s defined benefit obligations and hard to value plan 
assets to be appropriate.

Key Audit Matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of insurance contract liabilities: Annuitant mortality (Longevity) (Group)

Refer to note 1.4, 1.5.2, 24 and 32.7 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of related accounting policies and balances.

Annuitant mortality (longevity) assumptions are an area of 
significant management judgement, due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved. We consider these assumptions 
underpinning the insurance contract liabilities to be a key audit 
matter given the Group’s exposure to a large volume of annuity 
business. The annuitant mortality assumption has two main 
components as set out below.

Base mortality assumptions

This component of the assumption is mainly driven by internal 
experience analyses. It requires expert judgement that includes 
determining the most appropriate level at which to carry out the 
analysis; the period used for historic experience (considering 
COVID-19 in recent periods); the choice of base table / rates; 
and adjustments made within the process of fitting rates to past 
experience using management’s Prudential Retirement 
Mortality (PRM) model.

Rate of future mortality improvements

This component of the assumption is more subjective given the 
lack of data and the uncertainty over how life expectancy will 
change in the future. The allowance for future mortality 
improvements is inherently subjective, as improvements 
develop over long timescales and cannot be captured by 
analysis of internal experience data, with additional uncertainty 
around the longer term impact of COVID-19 and other trends in 
the UK on future mortality rates. The areas of judgement also 
include the selection of the mortality projection model, its 
calibration as well as re-expressing this in terms of the 
Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) Bureau industry 
standard model.

In addition, under IFRS 17, an allowance for risk in excess of the 
best estimate is held and represents the view of compensation 
for non-financial risk that management requires (known as the 
risk adjustment). The primary component of the risk adjustment 
is annuity mortality risk and the selection of the distribution and 
associated stresses is a matter of judgement.

We have performed the following procedures:

– Understood and evaluated the design effectiveness of key 
controls in place in respect of the longevity assumptions, 
including the longevity stresses for the risk adjustment 
component of the insurance contract liabilities;

– Assessed the appropriateness of the methodology for 

analysing experience and setting assumptions for longevity 
with reference to relevant rules, actuarial guidance and by 
applying our industry knowledge and experience;

– Tested the design and operation of the controls in place to 
validate the assumptions and data used in the experience 
calculations and model calibration, including the accuracy of 
the PRM model used to calculate actual and expected deaths;

– Examined the results of management’s experience analysis 

and the resulting base mortality rates;

– Assessed the appropriateness of areas of expert judgement 

used in the future mortality improvements and the 
consistency of these with observed experience from the 
Group’s annuity portfolio and market data;

– Tested and challenged significant judgements in determining 

the longevity assumptions, including assessing the 
implications of COVID-19 and other mortality trends 
in the UK;

– Tested the re-expression of the projection basis in terms of 

CMI models and their parameterisation;

– Compared the longevity assumptions selected by 

management against those adopted by peers using our 
annual benchmarking survey of the market;

– Tested the appropriateness of the results of the longevity 

contribution to the risk adjustment by comparing to Solvency 
II stresses and using our expert knowledge; 

– Examined management’s calculation of the financial impact 

of changes to the longevity assumptions, to ensure that these 
are in line with our expectations; and

– Assessed the disclosure of the longevity assumptions and 
the commentary to support the profit (or CSM deferral) 
arising from any changes made as part of 2023 reporting.

Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, 
we consider the assumptions used for annuitant mortality 
to be appropriate.

Valuation of insurance contract liabilities: Credit default allowance for annuity contracts (Group)

Refer to 1.4, 1.5.2, 24, 32.7 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of related accounting policies and balances.

The discount rate for calculating the annuity in payment and 
deferment liabilities (future cash flows and risk adjustment) is 
determined in IFRS 17 using a ‘top-down’ approach. In this 
approach the discount rate is set using the yield on a reference 
portfolio of assets (based on the actual assets held) with explicit 
deductions for both expected and unexpected credit default 
risk. 

The credit default assumptions are also used to determine the 
locked-in discount rate based on the target asset mix for new 
business written in the period (to calculate the contractual 
service margin). 

The allowance for expected and unexpected credit default risk 
is based on the credit rating of the reference portfolio of assets 
and consists of various components. The components include:

– A mechanical long-term allowance for expected defaults and 

downgrades (based on historical data);

We have performed the following procedures:

– Understood and evaluated the design effectiveness of key 

controls in place in respect of the credit default assumptions 
to value the insurance contract liabilities;

– Assessed the methodology used to derive the credit default 

assumptions with reference to relevant requirements of IFRS 
17, actuarial guidance and by applying our industry 
knowledge and experience;

– Obtained an understanding and challenged management 

over the analysis performed to assess internal credit ratings 
for illiquid assets such as equity release mortgages;

– Tested the approach, the ratings ascribed and the resulting 

default allowances;

– Tested to ensure that the inputs and calculations for the 

internal credit ratings were in line with intended methodology 
and are appropriate;

– A credit risk premium; and

– Tested and challenged key management judgements 

– A short-term overlay reflecting a prospective outlook on 

future potential experience.

Significant management judgement is required to set the 
internal credit ratings, particularly for illiquid level 3 assets (such 
as private credit assets and equity release mortgages). Once 
the credit rating has been established there is further 
judgement in selecting the short-term overlay to allow for risks 
not captured in the long-term credit default allowance.

Changes to the valuation and internal credit rating of residential 
ground rent assets (see ‘Valuation of hard to value assets’ 
above) that back annuity liabilities will impact the credit default 
allowances.

The allowance for credit risk can have a significant impact on 
the annuity liabilities, with small changes having a large financial 
impact, and hence this is a key audit matter.

including the short-term overlay, referencing industry data, 
market benchmarking where available and our industry 
knowledge. In particular, consideration has been given to the 
appropriateness of management’s proposals in the context of 
the current economic climate;

– Assessed the impact of the recent Leasehold and Freehold 
Reform Bill and the associated consultation on potential 
restrictions to the level of residential ground rents and 
ensured this was reflected in credit default risk assumptions;

– Examined management’s calculation of the financial impact 
of changes to the credit default assumptions on the liability, 
to ensure that these are in line with our expectations; and

– Assessed the disclosure of the credit default risk 

assumptions and the commentary to support the impact of 
any changes in the 2023 financial statements.

Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, 
we consider the assumptions used for credit default risk to be 
appropriate.

Valuation of insurance contract liabilities: Illiquidity premium for with profit contracts (Group)

Refer to note 1.4, 1.5.2, 24 and 32.7 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of related accounting policies and balances.

The discount rate for calculating the with-profit liabilities (future 
cash flows and risk adjustment) is determined in IFRS 17 using a 
‘bottom-up’ approach. In this approach the discount rate is set 
using a risk-free yield curve with an additional illiquidity 
premium applied to reflect characteristics of the with-profit 
liabilities. 

Significant management judgement is required to set the 
methodology used in the calculation of the illiquidity premium. 
This includes the selection of the asset portfolio and credit risk 
allowance to measure a market level of asset illiquidity 
premium; and the application of this premium to the with-profit 
liabilities.

The illiquidity premium can have a significant impact on the 
with-profit liabilities, with small changes having a large financial 
impact, and hence this is a key audit matter.

We have performed the following procedures:

– Understood and evaluated the design effectiveness of key 

controls in place in respect of the illiquidity premium 
assumptions to value the insurance contract liabilities;

– Assessed the methodology applied in calculation of the 

illiquidity premium with reference to relevant requirements of 
IFRS 17, actuarial guidance and by applying our industry 
knowledge and experience;

– Tested controls to validate the inputs and calculation 

performed or performed substantive testing to ensure that 
the inputs and calculations are in line with intended 
methodology and are appropriate;

– Challenged key management judgements including the 

choice of the reference portfolio, credit risk allowance and 
unchanged ratio, with reference to industry data and market 
benchmarking where available and relevant. In particular, 
consideration was given to the appropriateness of 
management’s proposals in the context of the current 
economic climate and the interaction with annuity credit 
allowances;

– Examined management’s calculation of the financial impact 
of changes to the illiquidity premium default assumptions, to 
ensure that these are in line with our expectations and;

– Assessed the disclosure of the illiquidity premium 

assumptions and the commentary to support the impact of 
any changes in the 2023 financial statements.

Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, 
we consider the illiquidity premium assumptions used to be 
appropriate.

Valuation of insurance contract liabilities: Renewal expenses (Group)

Refer to note 1.4, 1.5.2, 24 and 32.7 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of related accounting policies and balances.

Future maintenance expenses and expense inflation 
assumptions (or collectively the renewal expenses 
assumptions) are used in the measurement of the insurance 
contract liabilities. The assumptions reflect the expected future 
expenses that will be required to maintain the in-force policies 
at the balance sheet date, including an allowance for 
unavoidable project costs.

For IFRS 17, only those expenses which are directly attributable 
to each group of contracts are included in the valuation of 
insurance contract liabilities.

Significant judgement is required to estimate the maintenance 
expenses through the use of a cost allocation model and the 
allocation of costs to cost centres; identification of non-
attributable costs; removal of one-off costs; the allocation 
between fixed and variable costs; identification of any future 
costs and short term allowances. 

Unit costs are then set by product, based on the maintenance 
expenses and the current number of policies in force.

In addition, when calculating the liabilities, an assumption is also 
needed to reflect how these costs will change in future as a 
result of inflation rates. This assumption is set with reference to 
industry and market data; and management’s view of how their 
cost base will inflate in future.

The projection of these costs forward over the duration of the 
policies means that small changes in unit costs can lead to 
significant changes in the estimated liabilities. Due to this, and 
the management judgement involved, we have noted this as a 
key audit matter.

We have performed the following procedures:

– Understood and evaluated the design effectiveness of key 

controls in place in respect of renewal expense assumptions 
in the valuation of insurance contract liabilities;

– Examined and assessed the methodology applied in the cost 
model, choice of approach and cost drivers to confirm that 
these are reasonable and supportable.

– Tested the input data used in the cost allocation model, 

including the completeness and accuracy of the total cost 
base and allocation of expenses to the appropriate cost 
centres;

– Compared the allocations in the cost allocation model to prior 

year and understood the rationale for changes;

– Assessed the methodology used by management to derive 
the assumptions with reference to relevant rules, actuarial 
guidance and by applying our industry knowledge and 
experience;

– Assessed and challenged the appropriateness of significant 
judgements in the application of the methodology, including:

– excluded costs (for example, costs neither related to the 
insurance business nor being non-recurring in nature),

– the split of expenses between acquisition and maintenance 

expenses,

– the allocation of costs to products,

– the allowance for recurring project costs, 

– the projection of fixed costs, 

– allowances for cost savings (to the extent permissible), 

– assumptions about outsourcing costs beyond current 

contracts; and 

– treatment of look-through costs for intra-group services.

– Tested the calculation of any components of the renewal 
expense assumptions that are not based on the cost 
allocation model (for example, short term expense 
allowances), by performing a combination of controls and 
substantive testing;

– Tested the assumption derived for expense inflation by 
assessing the use of industry data, current economic 
conditions and challenged the judgements used within the 
calculations to ensure that they are reasonable;

– Examined management’s calculation of the financial impact 
of changes to the renewal expense assumptions, to ensure 
that these are in line with our expectations; and

– Assessed the disclosure of the renewal expense assumptions 

financial statements.

Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, 
we consider the assumptions used for renewal expenses to be 
appropriate.

Valuation of insurance contract liabilities: Persistency for with-profit contracts (Group)

Refer to note 1.4, 1.5.2, 24 and 32.7 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of related accounting policies and balances.

Persistency risk can cover a wide range of policyholder actions 
including lapse, retirement (normal, early, late), rate of ceasing 
regular contributions (paying up), level of premium increments, 
and option take-up rates. However the main persistency risk 
relates to lapse and retirement assumptions. Under IFRS 17, the 
with-profits insurance contract liabilities are sensitive to the 
assumptions selected. 

For these assumptions:

We have performed the following procedures:

– Understood and evaluated the design effectiveness of key 

controls in place in respect of the persistency assumptions to 
value the with-profit contract liabilities

– Examined the methodology for analysing historic experience 

and setting assumptions for persistency and assessed 
whether these are reasonable and in line with our 
expectations and market experience;

– Significant judgement is required to set the persistency 

– Tested controls to validate the assumptions and the data 

assumptions including: the choice of predictive parameters, 
applicability of historic experience to the future, the impact of 
one-off or short-term events on the data (for example COVID 
19) and potential changes in the economic and regulatory 
environment going forward;

– In some areas, there is limited historic experience on which to 
base the assumptions, for example, retirement assumptions 
for certain products beyond the initial selected retirement 
age; and

– The current economic conditions, trends and volatility which 

may increase the levels of uncertainty about future 
persistency.

Consequently we have selected persistency assumptions 
as a key audit matter.

used in the experience calculations;

– Examined the results of management's experience analysis 

and the resulting persistency assumption;

– Assessed the appropriateness and justification for significant 

judgements applied, including:

– Whether the data used is an appropriate representation of 
likely future experience or whether changes are needed;

– The potential impact on persistency of changes in 

regulation and the current economic environment which 
may change the perceived value of products, ability to 
invest or retirement habits;

– Examined the judgments applied where there is a lack of 

credible historical data to set the assumptions.

– Where available and applicable, compared the persistency 

assumptions selected by management against those 
adopted by peers using our annual benchmarking survey of 
the market;

– Examined management’s calculation of the financial impact 
of changes to the persistency assumptions, to ensure that 
these are in line with our expectations; and

– Assessed the disclosure of the persistency assumptions and 

the commentary to support the profit (or CSM deferral) 
arising from any changes for 2023 reporting in the financial 
statements.

Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, 
we consider the persistency assumptions used to be 
appropriate.

Recoverability of the carrying value of investment in subsidiaries (Parent Company)

Refer to note A to the Parent Company financial statements for disclosures of related accounting policies and balances.

In the Parent Company’s financial statements, investments in 
subsidiaries are reported at cost less impairment.

This balance is material to the Parent Company being the 
largest asset on the Parent Company’s statement of financial 
position. 

Our procedures in relation to management’s assessment of the 
carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings as at 
31 December 2023 included the following:

– Obtained and assessed the completeness of impairment 

indicators noted by management;

During the year impairment indicators have been noted, due to 
higher discount rates and the current economic environment, 
for the investments in subsidiaries and a full impairment 
assessment has been undertaken.

– Assessed investment in subsidiaries for any indication of 

impairment based on our understanding of the business and 
current market environment; and

– Where an impairment assessment was necessary, we:

Management has compared the carrying value of investments 
in subsidiaries to their recoverable value which is assessed as 
the higher of Value in Use and Fair Value less Costs of Disposal. 
This includes but is not limited to judgement regarding discount 
rates, forecasted cash flows, comparable peer companies and 
long-term growth rates.

– engaged our valuation experts to assist us in our audit;

– obtained the value in use and fair value less costs of 
disposal assessments completed by management;

– challenged the methodology and assumptions used, 

including the discount rate, the cash flows, the long-term 
growth rate, and selection of appropriate peer companies;

– tested the inputs back to source documents; and 

– recalculated the mathematical accuracy of the Value In Use 

and Fair Value Less Cost of Disposal calculations.

– Assessed the disclosures in the financial statements.

– Based on the work performed and evidence obtained, we 

consider the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries to 
be appropriate.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Parent Company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which they operate.

The Group is a global investment manager and insurer, and its operations primarily consist of the legal entity operations in the 
United Kingdom, Europe and Asia. We performed a full scope audit over the following three components:

i) the Parent Company, M&G plc; ii) Prudential Assurance Company (the key contributor to the “Life” segment); iii) M&G Group (the 
key contributor to the “Asset Management” segment).

For certain other components, we identified account balances which were considered to be significant in size or audit risk at the 
financial statement line item level in relation to the consolidated financial statements, and performed financial statement line item 
audit procedures over these specified balances. Analytical procedures over the remaining components that were not 
inconsequential were performed by the Group engagement team. We also performed audit procedures over the consolidation 
process.

As the Group audit team, we determined the level of involvement required at those components to be able to conclude whether 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as 
a whole. In our role as Group auditors, we exercised oversight of the work performed by auditors of the components including 
performing the following procedures:

– Issued Group instructions outlining areas requiring additional audit focus, including the key audit matters included above;

– Maintained an active dialogue with reporting component audit teams throughout the year;

– Attended meetings with local Management in person or via video conference;

– Attended Audit Committee meetings for certain in-scope components;

– Reviewed reporting requested from component teams, including those areas determined to be of heightened audit risk; and

– Reviewed selected working papers on component audit files, where considered relevant.

The impact of climate risk on our audit
As part of our audit we have made enquiries of Management (both within and outside of the Group’s finance functions) to 
understand the governance and process adopted to assess the extent of the potential impact of climate risk on the Group’s 
financial statements and support for the disclosures made within the Annual Report and Accounts.

In addition to enquiries with Management, we also read the Group’s climate risk assessment documentation, reviewed Board 
minutes and considered disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts in relation to climate change (including those 
recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures “TCFD”) in order to assess the completeness of 
Management’s climate risk assessment.

We have also made enquiries to understand the commitments made by the Group and how these may affect the financial 
statements and the audit procedures that we perform.

Our procedures did not identify any material impact in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, or our key 
audit matters for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Overall materiality

£60 million (2022: £55 million).

Financial statements - Group

Materiality benchmark

How we determined it

The materiality amount was selected judgmentally and 
is equivalent to 8% of 3-year average of the Adjusted 
operating profit before tax.
In determining our materiality we have considered 
financial metrics and benchmarks which we believe to 
be relevant to the primary users of the consolidated 
financial statements. Due to the disparate size of the 
Income Statement and Statement of Financial Position, 
the materiality amount was selected judgmentally by the 
Group audit team having considered a range of relevant 
benchmarks including Adjusted Operating Profit before 
tax, Profit before tax, Operational Capital Generation 
before tax, Total assets, and Shareholder SII coverage 
ratio, Net Assets plus CSM and Total Assets.

Financial statements - Parent Company

£105 million (2022: £115 million).

1% of Total assets.

As the Parent Company is balance sheet 
focused with limited income statement 
activity, we consider that total assets is an 
appropriate benchmark.

For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The 
range of materiality allocated across components was between £15 million and £55 million. Certain components were audited to a 
local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of 
our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in 
determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 65% (2022: 65%%) of overall materiality, amounting to £39 million 
(2022: £35 million) for the Group financial statements and £68 million (2022: £79 million) for the Parent Company financial 
statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and 
aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount in the middle of our normal range was 
appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £3 million 
(Group audit) (2022: £2.5 million) and £5.25 million (Parent Company audit) (2022: £5.7 million) as well as misstatements below 
those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating to going concern

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group's and the Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting included:

– Obtained the Directors’ going concern assessment and challenged the rationale for the downside scenarios adopted and 

material assumptions made using our knowledge of the Group’s business performance, review of regulatory correspondence 
and obtaining further corroborating evidence;

– Considered Management’s assessment of the regulatory solvency coverage and liquidity position in the forward looking 

scenarios which have been driven from the Group’s Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA);

– Agreed the Group Solvency II information to the draft unaudited Group Solvency II schedules prepared by Management;

– Considered information obtained during the course of the audit and publicly available market information to identify any 

evidence that would contradict Management’s assessment of going concern; and

– Reviewed the disclosures included in the financial statements in relation to going concern, including the Basis of Preparation.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group's and the 
Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the directors’ reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to 
add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of 
this report.

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors' Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below.

Strategic report and Directors' Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors' 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' Report.

Directors' Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.

Corporate governance statement

The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of 
the corporate governance statement relating to the Parent Company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as 
other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate 
governance statement, included within the Directors' Report is materially consistent with the financial statements and our 
knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

– The directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;

– The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks 

and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

– The directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 

basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and Parent Company’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;

– The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group's and Parent Company’s prospects, the period this assessment 

covers and why the period is appropriate; and

– The directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Parent Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group and Parent Company was substantially less 
in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statement; 
checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering 
whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the 
corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the 
audit:

– The directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and 
provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Parent Company's position, performance, 
business model and strategy;

– The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; 

and

– The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors’ statement relating to the Parent Company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing 
Rules for review by the auditors.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities and Financial information, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.

Independent auditors' report continued

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which 
our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations related to UK and European regulatory principles, such as those governed by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) 
and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on 
the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such 
as Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial 
statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to management bias in 
accounting estimates and judgmental areas of the financial statements as shown in our ‘Key audit matters’. The Group 
engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit 
procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or 
component auditors included:

– Discussions with the Board, Management, Internal Audit, management involved in the Risk and Compliance functions and Group 
and Parent Company’s legal function, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and 
regulation and fraud;

– Evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of Management’s controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;

– Assessment of matters reported on the Group and Parent Company’s whistleblowing helpline and fraud register and the results 

of Management’s investigation of such matters;

– Meeting with the PRA periodically and reading key correspondence with the PRA and the FCA, including those in relation to 

compliance with laws and regulations;

– Reviewing relevant meeting minutes including those of the Board of Directors, Audit, Risk, Remuneration and Disclosure 

Committees;

– Identifying and testing journal entries based on risk criteria;

– Testing of judgements and assumptions in subjective areas as set out in the key audit matters;

– Designing audit procedures to incorporate unpredictability around the nature, timing or extent of our testing;

– Reviewing the Group’s register of litigation and claims, Internal Audit reports, and compliance reports in so far as they related to 

non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud; and

– Attendance at Audit Committee and Joint Audit and Risk Committee meetings.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. 
Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing 
techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. 
We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit 
sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

– we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 

received from branches not visited by us; or

– certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

– the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 

with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 25 May 2022 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement 
is two years, covering the years ended 31 December 2022 to 31 December 2023.

Other matter

As required by the Financial Conduct Authority Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, these financial statements 
form part of the ESEF-prepared annual financial report filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the Financial Conduct Authority 
in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard (‘ESEF RTS’). This auditors’ report provides no assurance over 
whether the annual financial report has been prepared using the single electronic format specified in the ESEF RTS.

The comparative amounts have been restated for the first time adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9. See Note 1.2.1 for further information. Additionally, 
following a review of the Group's presentation of policyholder tax, comparatives for 31 December 2022 have been restated from those previously reported 
in the 2023 interim consolidated income statement.

The profit/(loss) before tax comprises the pre-tax result attributable to equity holders and an amount equal and opposite to the tax charge attributable to 
policyholder returns. This is the formal measure of profit or loss before tax under IFRS, but it is not the result attributable to equity holders. This is 
principally because the corporate taxes of the Group include taxes borne by policyholders. These amounts are required to be included in the tax charge of 
the Company under IFRS. The tax charge/(credit) attributable to policyholder returns is removed from the Group’s total profit/(loss) before tax in arriving 
at the Group’s profit/(loss) before tax attributable to equity holders. As the net of tax profits attributable to policyholders is zero, the Group’s pre-tax profit 
attributable to policyholders is an amount equal and opposite to the tax charge attributable to policyholders included in the total tax charge.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1 Basis of preparation and material accounting policies 
1.1 Basis of preparation 

The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 comprise the financial statements of M&G plc ('the 
Company') and its subsidiaries (together referred to as 'the Group'). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (IAS) and the legal requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis except for investment property measured at 
fair value, certain financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) that are measured at fair value through 
profit and loss (FVTPL), insurance contract liabilities that are measured in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 17: Insurance 
contracts, and defined benefit assets and liabilities, measured at the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined 
benefit obligations. Assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of the previous carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell.

The consolidated financial statements are stated in million pounds sterling, the Group’s presentation currency. 

The consolidated financial statements from the full year 2022 have been restated to reflect the retrospective application of IFRS 17, 
‘Insurance Contracts’ and IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ from 1 January 2023, as outlined below in Note 1.2.1.

Going concern
The Directors have reasonable expectation that the Group as a whole has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements. 

To satisfy themselves of the appropriateness of the use of the going concern assumptions in relation to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Directors have considered the liquidity projections of the Group, including the impact of applying specific liquidity 
stresses. The Directors also considered the ability of the Group to access external funding sources and the management actions 
that could be used to manage liquidity.

In addition, the Directors also gave particular attention to the solvency projections of the Group under a base scenario and its 
sensitivity to various individual economic stresses and tested the resilience of the balance sheet to adverse scenarios using 
reverse stress testing.

The impact of the following individual stresses on solvency were considered as part of the assessment: 

– 20% fall in equity prices, 

– 20% fall in property prices, 

– (50bps) parallel shift in nominal yields, 

– 20% of the credit portfolio downgrading by one full letter, 

– +100bps spread widening (A-rated assets). 

The scenarios considered as part of the assessment included a range of different scenarios (base, optimistic and pessimistic) 
taking into account the plausible pathways that the global economy would take, its impact on consumer demand and actions that 
central banks could take. We also assessed the resilience of our financial position in a high inflationary and low growth 
environment (stagflation scenario) and the economic implications resulting from it. In addition, we assessed the strength of our 
solvency position to withstand any potential legislative change that may result in the value of the residential ground rent portfolio 
falling to close to nil as a result of the Government implementing the 'peppercorn cap' described in the Department for Levelling up, 
Housing and Communities' recent consultation on residential ground rents (UK Government consultation). This is explained further 
in note 31.8.1. Where relevant, consideration was given to any impending legislative change, which may affect the financial position 
of the Group adversely as part of the assessment.

The results of the assessment demonstrated the ability of the Group to meet all obligations, including payments to shareholders 
and debt holders, and future business requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, the assessment demonstrated that the 
Group was able to remain above its regulatory solvency requirements in a stressed scenario.

For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Presentation of risk and capital management disclosures
We have provided additional disclosures relating to the nature and extent of certain financial risks and capital management in the 
Supplementary Information section of this report.

1.2 New accounting pronouncements

1.2.1 New accounting pronouncements adopted by the Group
In these financial statements, the Group has applied IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' and IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', for the first 
time. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet 
effective.

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.

The Group has applied the standard retrospectively by applying the transitional provisions in Appendix C of IFRS 17. Furthermore, 
as allowed within the transition provisions of IFRS 17, the Group has elected to not present the following information required by 
IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' on the adoption of a new standard for current and prior 
periods presented:

(i) The amount of adjustment for each financial statement line item affected; and

(ii) The impact on basic and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share.

The Group has restated comparative information for 2022 applying the transitional provisions in Appendix C to IFRS 17. The nature 
of the changes in accounting policies can be summarised, as follows:

(i) Recognition, measurement and presentation of insurance contracts
IFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, reinsurance 
contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features (DPF). It introduces a model that measures groups of 
contracts based on the Group’s estimates of the present value of future cash flows that are expected to arise as the Group fulfils 
the contracts, an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk and a contractual service margin (CSM). 

Under IFRS 17, insurance revenue in each reporting period represents the provision of services arising from the group of insurance 
contracts at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. 
This includes amounts relating to the changes in the liability for remaining coverage and the allocation of the portion of the 
premiums that relate to recovery of insurance acquisition cash flows. Investment components are not included within insurance 
revenue.

Insurance finance income and expenses are presented separately from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses. 

Previously, acquisition costs in relation to insurance contracts were recognised and presented under IFRS 4 as separate assets 
from the related insurance contract liabilities until those costs were included in profit or loss. Under IFRS 17, insurance acquisition 
cash flows in relation to all contracts in scope that arise before the recognition of the related insurance contracts are recognised as 
separate assets and are tested for recoverability. These assets are presented in the carrying amount of the related portfolio of 
contracts and are derecognised once the related contracts have been recognised.

There is no change in accounting policy for investment contracts without DPF which are not in scope of IFRS 17. For these 
contracts, deferred acquisition costs continue to be presented as separate assets and amortised into profit or loss in line with 
revenue.

Income and expenses from reinsurance contracts other than insurance finance income and expenses are now presented as a 
single net amount in profit or loss. Previously, amounts recovered from reinsurers and reinsurance expenses were presented 
separately.

For an explanation of how the Group accounts for insurance and reinsurance contracts under IFRS 17, see Note 1.5.

1.2.1 New accounting pronouncements adopted by the Group (continued)
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (continued)

(ii) Transition
Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 17 have been applied using a fully retrospective approach 
to the extent practicable. Under the fully retrospective approach, at 1 January 2022 the Group: 

– identified, recognised and measured each group of insurance contracts, investment contracts with DPF and reinsurance 

contracts as if IFRS 17 had always been applied; 

– derecognised previously reported balances that would not have existed if IFRS 17 had always been applied, such as the 

unallocated surplus of the With-Profits Fund; and 

– recognised any resulting net difference in equity, after allowing for any deferred tax adjustment. 

In addition, there are also changes in presentation in the consolidated statement of financial position line items from the adoption 
of IFRS 17:

– The inclusion of insurance receivables and payables balances as cash flows in the measurement of insurance and reinsurance 

held contracts;

– The presentation of reinsurance held contracts as an asset or liability based on the net position of all contracts within a portfolio, 

rather than the previous IFRS 4 treatment which was recognised on an individual contract basis; and

– Investment contract liabilities with DPF within the scope of IFRS 17 are presented within insurance contract liabilities. 

Where it is impracticable to apply a fully retrospective approach to a group of contracts, then the Group has, as permitted under 
IFRS 17, used either the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach.

The Group has applied the following approaches to valuing the CSM on transition to IFRS 17:

Transition approach

Fully Retrospective Approach (FRA)

Modified Retrospective Approach (MRA)

Fair Value Approach (FVA)

Applied to products
90:10 With-Profits contracts written 2020-2021i
PruProtect contracts written June 2010 – June 2016ii
Non-Profit protection in Poland written 2020-2021
Rothesay reinsurance treatyiii
90:10 With-Profits contracts written 2004-2019i
PruProtect contracts written before June 2010ii
90:10 With-Profits contracts written before 2004i
All other insurance and reinsurance contracts written up to 2021

i

iii

Shareholder transfers for most contracts in the With-Profits Sub-Fund (WPSF) are up to one-ninth of the cost of bonus declared to policyholders, in 
accordance with the Articles of Association. These contracts are referred to as 90:10 business.

PruProtect is a non-profit contract providing life and sickness cover that the Group issued through a joint venture arrangement with Vitality Life.

The Rothesay Part VII transfer in December 2021, which involved the sale of an annuity portfolio from M&G plc to Rothesay Life PLC, and consequential 
update to the reinsurance treaty for the retained annuity business is deemed to constitute a derecognition event. Therefore, for IFRS 17 purposes, the 
inception date of the reinsurance contract is 15 December 2021 and so is transitioned under FRA.

The impact of adopting IFRS 17 on total equity at 1 January 2022 is presented in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

Fully retrospective approach 
The Group has applied the fully retrospective approach on transition to products as shown above. On transition to IFRS 17, the 
Group has applied the fully retrospective approach unless impracticable. 

The reasons why the Group considers the fully retrospective approach to be impracticable for some contracts include:

– The effects of retrospective application are not determinable because the information required was not collected, or was not 

collected with sufficient granularity, or is unavailable because of system migrations or other reasons.

– The fully retrospective approach requires assumptions about what the Group management’s intentions would have been in 
previous periods that cannot be made without the use of hindsight. These include judgements about the compensation the 
Group requires for bearing non-financial risk in order to determine the risk adjustment. As the Group was established as a 
separate entity in 2019, the Group’s current business management and assumptions are not appropriate prior to 2020 and 
choosing to use these or other assumptions would require the application of hindsight. This rationale does not apply to 
PruProtect contracts, which have been managed through a joint venture and for which the approach to managing the business 
prior to 2019 (and back until 2010) is known without the need to apply hindsight.

– Where the fully retrospective approach is impracticable for the valuation of a portfolio of insurance contracts written then it is 
also impracticable for the valuation of any associated reinsurance portfolio as measurement requires similar considerations.

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (continued)

Modified retrospective approach
The objective of the modified retrospective approach is to achieve the closest outcome to retrospective application possible using 
reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort. The Group has applied each of the following 
modifications only to the extent that it does not have reasonable and supportable information to apply IFRS 17 retrospectively.

     Assessments at inception or on initial recognition
The Group has determined the identification of groups of contracts and classification of contracts using information available at 
contract inception where reasonable and supportable information is available. Where the Group does not have reasonable and 
supportable information this has been assessed based on information at 1 January 2022.

Groups of contracts valued under the modified retrospective approach contain contracts issued more than one year apart.

     90:10 with-profits contracts written 2004-2019
For groups of with-profits contracts issued between 2004 and 2019 transitioning under the modified retrospective approach, the 
Group has determined the CSM at 1 January 2022 by calculating a proxy (as permitted in IFRS 17) for the total CSM for all services 
to be provided from inception as the fair value of the underlying items at 1 January 2022 minus the fulfilment cash flows at 
1 January 2022, adjusted for:

– Amounts charged to policyholders (including charges deducted from the underlying items) before 1 January 2022.

– Amounts paid before 1 January 2022 that did not vary based on the underlying items.

– The change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk caused by the release from risk before 1 January 2022, which was 

estimated by reference to the release of risk for similar contracts that the Group issued at 1 January 2022.

If the calculation resulted in a CSM, the Group measures the CSM at 1 January 2022 by deducting the CSM related to services 
provided before 1 January 2022. The CSM related to services provided before 1 January 2022 was determined by comparing the 
remaining coverage units at 1 January 2022 with coverage units prior to 1 January 2022. 

If the calculation resulted in a loss component then the Group adjusted the loss component to nil and increased the liability for 
remaining coverage excluding the loss component by the same amount.

     PruProtect contracts written before June 2010
The PruProtect contracts written before June 2010 are transitioning under the modified retrospective approach by applying the 
modification that contracts issued more than one year apart are grouped together.

Fair value approach
The Group has applied the fair value approach on transition for contracts for which the fully retrospective approach was 
considered impracticable, and for which reasonable and supportable information to apply the modified retrospective approach 
was not available without undue cost or effort. 

The Group has determined the CSM of the liability for remaining coverage at the transition date, as the difference between the fair 
value of the group of insurance contracts and the fulfilment cash flows measured at that date. In determining fair value, the Group 
has applied the requirements of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement except for, as required, the principles relating to demand 
features. 

Using Level 3 inputs in accordance with the IFRS 13 hierarchy, the Group has measured the fair value of the contracts as the sum of:

– The best estimate of the liability, determined using a discounted cash flow technique and assumptions used for Solvency II 

reporting; and

– the compensation a market participant would require for taking on the obligation, over and above the best estimate liability, 

determined using a cost of capital approach, and for with-profits contracts an amount to reflect the risk around the quantum of 
future shareholder transfers.

For reinsurance contracts held the calculation above has been carried out twice, using gross of reinsurance cash flows and net of 
reinsurance cash flows. The fair value of reinsurance contracts held has been determined as the difference between the two 
amounts.

The allowance for the cost of capital is based on: 

– Capital at 135% of the Group Solvency II internal model Solvency Capital Requirements (SCR) on a diversified basis, plus Group 

Solvency II Risk Margin less allowance for the Group's Transitional Measure on Technical Provisions (TMTP) for pre-2016

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (continued)

Fair value approach (continued)
In addition to the allowance for the cost of capital, key assumptions underpinning the determination of the fair value are set out 
below:

– Discount rate

The discount rate used for with-profits contracts is the prescribed Solvency II risk-free curve.

The discount rate used for non-profit annuity contracts is the prescribed Solvency II risk-free curve plus the Group’s matching 
adjustment. The matching adjustment for the shareholder non-profit annuities is 106 basis points (bps) per annum and for the non-
profit annuities in the With-Profits Fund is 94 bps per annum.

– Longevity assumptions

The longevity assumptions for annuity contracts are consistent with the best estimate basis used for the Group’s Solvency II 
reporting as at 31 December 2021, as disclosed in the Group Solvency and Financial Condition Report as at 31 December 2021.

– Shareholder transfers

For with-profits contracts the level of compensation required to reflect the risk in relation to future shareholder transfers is 20% of 
the present value of future shareholder transfers.

– Expense assumptions

Renewal expenses are based on the Group's best estimate view and are considered to be in line with what other market 
participants would assume. 

Investment management fees are negotiated on an arms-length basis, including those for the assets managed by the Group’s 
asset managers. Therefore the Group assumes that a market participant would adopt comparable investment management 
expense assumptions.

The fair value was calculated at an aggregate level based on availability of Solvency II inputs. The fair value was then allocated to 
IFRS 17 groups based on estimates of the underlying inputs at a more granular level based on consideration of the characteristics 
of the portfolio and output from the SCR reporting processes.

The fair value has been calibrated based on analysis of the Group’s own data and market data including public information on 
recent transactions (to the extent relevant and available).

The Group has determined the identification of groups of contracts and classification of contracts using information available at 
1 January 2022. Groups of policies valued under the fair value approach contain contracts issued more than one year apart. 
For contracts valued under the General Measurement Model, locked-in discount rates and financial assumptions applied after 
transition have been determined as at 1 January 2022.

The table below shows the locked-in discount rates for annuity business at the transition date:

Fulfilment cash flows
The fulfilment cash flows at 1 January 2022 under all transition approaches have been measured in accordance with the accounting 
policies set out in Note 1.5. For this purpose the key assumptions are set out below.

The risk-free yield curve for with-profits and annuity contracts is shown in the table below:

Risk-free yield curve (excluding illiquidity premium)

As at 1 January 2022

1 year

 0.76% 

5 years

 1.05% 

10 years

 0.95% 

15 years

 0.91% 

20 years

 0.88% 

For with-profits contracts, future investment return assumptions and discount rates (using a bottom-up approach) are set at the 
above risk-free yield curve plus an illiquidity premium of 34 bps.

For annuity contracts, discount rates (using a top-down approach) are set at the above risk-free yield curve plus an illiquidity 
premium of 109 bps for shareholder-backed annuities and 99 bps for annuities in the With-Profits Fund.

The longevity assumptions for annuity contracts are consistent with the best estimate basis used for the Group’s Solvency II 
reporting, as disclosed in the Group Solvency and Financial Condition Report as at 31 December 2021. 

Comparison with IFRS 4
The timing of profit recognition changed significantly under IFRS 17. Under IFRS 4 profits are recognised as follows:

– For with-profits contracts that share in the profit arising in the main With-Profits Fund, profits are recognised when bonuses 
are added to policies. As a substantial proportion of the total bonus is determined when claims are paid to policyholders, 
a considerable part of the profit is recognised when policies terminate.

– For non-profit contracts (notably annuities) a substantial proportion of the lifetime expected profit is recognised at policy 

inception, reflecting the difference between the premiums received less costs incurred and the prudent liability established for 
the expected future cash flows.

In contrast, IFRS 17 does not allow upfront profit recognition for profitable contracts but rather requires that profit is recognised 
as services are provided to the policyholders.

Other differences in the measurement of the liabilities include:

– IFRS 17 requires that the discount rates include an illiquidity premium. The IFRS 4 discount rates for with-profits contracts in 

particular do not include an illiquidity premium. For annuity contracts, the IFRS 4 discount rates are similar to IFRS 17.

– IFRS 4 liabilities for non-profit contracts are determined using implicit prudent margins in the demographic and expense 

assumptions. In contrast, IFRS 17 requires a separate risk adjustment for non-financial risks which may differ from the value of 
the IFRS 4 margins.

– Under IFRS 4, the unallocated surplus of the With-Profits Fund represented the excess of the fund’s assets over policyholder 

liabilities that is yet to be appropriated between policyholders and shareholders with no allocation to equity. There is no 
unallocated surplus under IFRS 17 although IFRS 17 requires a liability to be held for the policyholders’ share of the surplus assets 
in the With-Profits Fund. Under IFRS 17 there is equity for the first time relating to the With-Profits Fund.

Value of shareholder 
transfers

Under IFRS 17 the present value of all future shareholder transfers are allowed for 
in the Variable Fee (broadly the entity's expected future profit) and so the unearned 
share of the shareholder transfers is included in the CSM.

CSM

Introduction of CSM which represents unearned profit on insurance contracts 
and investment contracts with DPF which will be released over the life of the contract 
in line with the provision of service.

Risk adjustment

Introduction of risk adjustment which represents compensation for non-financial risk 
and replaces the IFRS 4 prudent margins.

Shareholder interest in 
excess assets in the 
With-Profits Fund

As a consequence of applying the mutualisation requirements of IFRS 17, a portion 
of the with-profits estate is allocated to shareholders. Under IFRS 4, this was included 
within the unallocated surplus of the With-Profits Fund.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018. However, the Group elected, under the amendments to IFRS 4 to apply the temporary exemption from IFRS 9, 
deferring the initial application date of IFRS 9 to align with the initial application of IFRS 17.

The Company has applied IFRS 9 retrospectively and restated comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2022 for 
financial instruments in the scope of IFRS 9. Differences arising from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been recognised in retained 
earnings as at 1 January 2022 and presented in the consolidated statement of changes in equity and have been disclosed in below.

The nature of the changes in accounting policies can be summarised as follows:

(i) Classification of financial assets and financial liabilities
IFRS 9 includes three classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, Fair Value through Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) and Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL). The classification of financial assets is generally 
based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics. It eliminates the 
previous categories of held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial assets applied by IAS 39. 

IFRS 9 has not had a significant effect on the Group’s financial instruments classification as the majority were already measured at 
FVTPL. The Group does not hold any assets measured at FVOCI.

(ii) Impairment of financial assets 
IFRS 9 replaced the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) model for recording 
impairment. The new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost and contract assets under IFRS 15. 
The ECL model results in earlier recognition of impairment as compared to the previous model which required objective evidence 
of impairment to exist before any impairment was recorded.

(iii) Transition
Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively, except as described 
below:

– The comparative period has been restated adopting the overlay approach. 

– The following assessments have been made on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at 1 January 2023: 

– The determination of the business model within which a financial asset is held.

– The designation and revocation of previous designations of certain financial assets and financial liabilities as measured at 

FVTPL. 

– If a financial asset had low credit risk at 1 January 2023, then the Group determined that the credit risk on the asset had not 

increased significantly since initial recognition.

The adoption of IFRS 9 has not had a material impact on the Group’s basic or diluted EPS for the years ended 31 December 2023 
and 2022.

Details of the changes and implications resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are presented below.

Classification of financial assets and financial liabilities (continued)
The Group accounting policies on the classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 are set out in Note 1.5. The application of 
the revised Group accounting policies resulted in the reclassifications set out in the table above and explained below.

– As at 31 December 2022, Loans of £2,114m which have previously been classified as loans and receivables are managed on a fair 

value basis and are, therefore, measured at FVTPL on the basis of the business model for managing loans under IFRS 9.

The application of IFRS 9 did not have a material impact on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities.

1.3 Judgements in applying accounting policies and sources of estimation uncertainty

A full list of the Group’s material accounting policies is provided in Note 1.5. The accounting policies adopted by the Group have not 
changed materially from those applied in the Group's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022, the 
exceptions being those arising from the application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9. In applying these accounting policies, the Group has 
made a number of key judgements which have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements. The impact of climate change has been considered when preparing these consolidated financial statements, 
particularly in the context of our TCFD disclosures included on pages 69 to 90. Many of the effects arising from climate change are 
long term in nature, with an inherent degree of uncertainty associated. These have been assessed as having no material impact on 
the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. 

The following table sets out the basis of these judgements, and references the associated accounting policy and related note 
which both give further detail on the specific application.

Financial statement area

Key judgement

Consolidation of 
structured entities

IFRS 10 requires entities that the Group controls to be consolidated in the 
consolidated financial statements. Structured entities are entities that have been 
designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding 
who controls the entity. Due to the nature of structured entities, judgement is 
required to determine whether the Group controls and therefore consolidates 
structured entities. Judgement is also required where certain seed capital 
investments in structured entities are classified as held for sale investments, and 
therefore not consolidated on a line-by-line basis.

Accounting 
policy

1.5.1

Note

Classification of 
insurance and 
investment contracts

IFRS 17 requires that contracts that transfer significant insurance risk are 
accounted for as insurance contracts. Judgement is required to determine 
whether contracts written by the Group transfer significant insurance risk, unless a 
specific scope exception applies (eg equity release mortgages). 

1.5.2

Contractual Service 
Margin measurement 
model

Underlying items

Judgement is also required in the case of certain investment contracts which 
provide an additional benefit in addition to guaranteed benefits to determine 
whether they meet the criteria to be considered as discretionary participation 
features, and therefore accounted for under IFRS 17.

IFRS 17 requires an assessment of whether contracts meet the conditions for 
having direct participation features and when this is the case such contracts must 
use the Variable Fee Approach to measure the CSM. For with-profit and unit-linked 
contracts, judgement is required to assess whether the Group expects to pay to 
the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on 
the underlying items; and whether the entity expects a substantial proportion of 
any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in 
fair value of the underlying items. The assessment is carried out at the contract 
level and judgement is also applied to determine the extent to which mutualisation 
between contracts is allowed for.

Underlying items are items that determine some of the amounts payable to a 
policyholder as part of their with-profit or unit-linked contract and therefore are a 
component of the insurance contract or investment contracts with DPF liabilities. 
Judgement is required to define underlying items for with-profits contracts that 
reflect the mutualisation between contracts and how to split underlying items 
between current and future policyholders.

Provision of insurance 
contract services

The amount of CSM recognised in profit or loss in each reporting period is 
determined by reference to coverage units, which represent the insurance 
contract services provided in that period. Judgement is required to define the 
services provided, and the relative weighting if these include both insurance and 
investment services.

Method of transition 
approach

Judgement was required to assess for which contracts it would be impracticable to apply the Fully 
Retrospective Approach (FRA).

1.4 Sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These 
estimates and assumptions have not changed materially from those applied for the 2022 year end financial statements, except for 
the measurement of insurance contracts on the application of IFRS 17.

The following table sets out the assumptions and estimates which have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to 
their carrying value within the next financial year. Details of the nature of the estimate is provided in the related accounting policy 
and details of the assumptions applied at the statement of financial position date are provided in the related note.

Key estimate and assumptions

When measuring the insurance contract liabilities, a number of assumptions are 
applied to estimate future amounts due to the policyholder. The areas where the 
assumptions could have a material impact are: 
– for with-profits contracts, the assumed future investment returns on the 
backing assets, the assumptions used in determining the allowance for 
persistency and maintenance expenses, the policyholders' share of historic 
and future surpluses, and the illiquidity premium in setting the discount rate; 
and 

– for annuity contracts, the assumed rates of policyholder mortality, 

maintenance expenses, and the selection of the reference portfolio and 
allowance for credit risk in setting the discount rate.

In addition, when measuring the insurance contract liabilities, a risk adjustment is 
included. The assessment of the risk adjustment requires assumptions about the 
compensation that the Group requires for bearing uncertainty about the amount 
and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk, the most significant 
of which is the assumed rates of the policyholder mortality for annuity contracts.

value hierarchy

Determination of 
recoverable amount of 
goodwill

Defined benefit 
pension liability

Recognition of deferred 
tax asset

Key estimate and assumptions

Determination of fair value of financial assets classified as level 3 in the fair value 
hierarchy involves the use of inputs which are not observable in the market and 
hence require a high degree of estimation which could result in a significant 
change in the valuation. This includes the determination of the spread above 
risk free rate applied to value residential ground rents that are impacted by the 
recent UK Government consultation which potentially restricts future income 
on these assets.

Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis by comparing the 
recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating 
units to which goodwill has been allocated with its carrying value. Recoverable 
amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use 
where the value in use is based on the present value of future cash flows. The 
determination of the value in use requires the use of various assumptions around 
future cash flows, future growth rates and appropriate discount rates based on the 
risks associated with the cash-generating-unit or group of cash-generating units 
which can have a material impact on the calculation. 

The defined benefit pension scheme liability is calculated using actuarial valuations 
which incorporate a number of assumptions including discount rates, inflation 
rates, and expected future mortality. Due to the long-term nature of the schemes, 
the value of the pension scheme obligation is sensitive to these assumptions.
IAS 12 requires deferred tax assets to be recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax 
losses can be utilised. Judgement is required to determine the extent to which 
future taxable profits emerge and the corresponding period over which unused tax 
credits and unused tax losses will be utilised.

– for with-profits contracts, the assumed future investment returns on the backing assets, the 

assumptions used in determining the allowance for persistency and maintenance expenses, the 
level of compensation required to reflect the risk in relation to future shareholder transfers, and 
the discount rates used; and

– for annuity contracts, the assumed rates of policyholder mortality, maintenance expenses, and

1.5 Accounting policies

1.5.1 Basis of consolidation
The Group has control over an investee if all three of the following conditions are met: (i) it has power over an investee; (ii) it is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (iii) it has the ability to use its power over 
the investee to affect its own returns.

(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those investees that the Group controls. Where the Group is deemed to control an entity, the entity is treated as a 
subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities are consolidated. Where the Group holds a minority share in an entity but does not 
have control, joint control or significant influence over the entity, the investments are carried at FVTPL within financial investments 
in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The Group performs a reassessment of consolidation whenever there is a change in the substance of the relationship between the 
Group and an investee.

(ii) Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are joint arrangements arising from a contractual agreement whereby the Group and other investors have joint 
control of the net assets of the arrangement. In these arrangements, the Group’s share of the underlying net assets may be lower 
or higher than 50% but the terms of the relevant agreement make it clear that control is jointly exercised between the Group and 
the third party, for example, where significant decisions required unanimous approval of all parties, or where all parties have equal 
voting rights.

Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but which it does not control. Generally, it is presumed that 
the Group has significant influence if it holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights of the entity.

Investments in associates and joint ventures held by the Group’s insurance or investment funds, including venture capital 
businesses, mutual funds and unit trusts, are accounted for at FVTPL. All other investments in joint ventures and associates are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the Group’s share of profit or loss of its joint 
ventures and associates is recognised in the consolidated income statement and its share of movements in other comprehensive 
income are recognised in other comprehensive income.

(iii) Structured entities
Structured entities are those that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who 
controls the entity. Voting rights relate to administrative tasks. Relevant activities are directed by means of contractual 
arrangements. The Group invests in structured entities such as:

– Collective investment vehicles including Open-Ended Investment Companies (OEICs), Authorised Contractual Schemes (ACSs) 

and Luxembourg-domiciled Sociétés d’Investissement à Capital Variable (SICAVs) 

– Limited partnerships

– Collateralised debt obligations

– Mortgage-backed securities

– Similar asset-backed securities.

Collective investment vehicles
The Group invests in OEICs, ACSs, SICAVs and unit trusts, which invest mainly in equities, bonds, cash and cash equivalents, and 
properties. 

The assessment of control over OEICs, ACSs, SICAVs and unit trusts requires judgement. In assessing control, the Group 
determines whether it is acting as principal or agent. This includes an assessment of the scope of its decision-making authority, 
including rights held by third parties, which may provide these parties substantive removal rights that may affect the Group’s ability 
to direct the relevant activities and indicate that the Group does not have power. 

In addition, the assessment considers the aggregate economic interest of the Group, which includes both direct holding and 
expected management fees if the fund manager is a Group company, however, management fees in most cases forms an 
immaterial part of the aggregate economic interest of the Group. 

Holdings in such investments can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the participation of the Group and other investors in them. 
As a result, in determining control, the Group looks at the trend of ownership over a longer period (rather than at a point in time) to 
mitigate the impact of daily fluctuations which do not reflect the wider facts and circumstances of the Group’s involvement.

1.5.1 Basis of consolidation (continued)
(iii) Structured entities (continued)

Collective investment vehicles (continued)
Consolidation assessment is performed in line with the following principles having taken into account substantial removal rights:

– where the Group manages the assets of the entity, and the aggregate of the Group’s ownership holding in the entity exceeds 

50%, the Group is judged to have control over the entity;

– where the Group manages the assets of the entity, and the aggregate of the Group’s ownership holding in the entity is between 
20% and 50%, the facts and circumstances of the Group’s involvement in the entity are considered, including the rights to any 
fees earned by the asset manager from the entity, in forming a judgement as to whether the Group has control over the entity;

– where the Group manages the assets of the entity, and the aggregate of the Group’s ownership holding in the entity is less than 

20%, the Group is judged to not have control over the entity; or

– where the assets of the entity are managed externally, an assessment is made of whether the Group has existing rights that give 
it the ability to direct the current activities of the entity and therefore control the entity. In assessing the Group’s ability to direct 
an entity, the Group considers its ability relative to other investors. The Group has a limited number of OEICs and unit trusts 
where it considers it has such ability.

Where the Group is deemed to control these entities, they are treated as subsidiaries and are consolidated, with the interests of 
investors other than entities within the Group being classified as liabilities, presented as third party interest in consolidated funds. 

Where the Group does not control these entities (as it is deemed to be acting as an agent), and they do not meet the definition of 
associates, they are carried at FVTPL within equity securities and pooled investment funds in the consolidated statement of 
financial position.

Where the Group initially sets up OEICs, ACSs, SICAVs and unit trusts as part of its operations through its investment management 
business, and invests the initial seed capital which results in a significant holding resulting in control of the fund, the Group 
assesses whether there is a formal plan in place to divest its holding to below the threshold triggering control within 12 months. 
In this situation, the vehicle is not consolidated, but classified as held for sale and carried at FVTPL.

Limited partnerships
The Group invests in a number of limited partnerships, either directly or through unit trusts, through a mix of capital and loans. 
These limited partnerships are managed by general partners, in which the Group holds equity. 

Such interests in general partners and limited partnerships provide the Group with voting and similar rights to participate in the 
governance framework of the relevant activities which limited partnerships are engaged in. Accounting for the limited partnerships 
(including underlying investees) as subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates or other financial investments depends on the terms of 
each partnership agreement and the level of shareholdings in the general partners.

Other structured entities
The Group holds investments in mortgage-backed securities, collateralised debt obligations and similar asset-backed securities. 

The Group consolidates the vehicles that hold the investments where the Group is deemed to control the vehicles. When assessing 
control over the vehicles, the factors considered include the purpose and design of the vehicle, the Group’s exposure to the 
variability of returns and the scope of the Group’s ability to direct the relevant activities of the vehicle, including any kick-out or 
removal rights that are held by third parties. The outcome of the control assessment is dependent on the terms and conditions of 
the respective individual arrangements, taking into account aggregate economic interest where relevant.

(iv) Qualifying partnerships
Entities consolidated by the Group include Qualifying Partnerships as defined under the UK Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 
2008 (the 'Partnership Act'). Some of these limited partnerships have taken advantage of the exemption under regulation 7 of the 
Partnerships Act from the financial statements requirements. This is under regulations 4 to 6, on the basis that these limited 
partnerships are dealt with on a consolidated basis in these financial statements.

(v) Third party interests 
Interests of parties other than the Group in entities which the Group controls are assessed to determine whether they should be 
classified as financial liabilities or as non-controlling interests in equity on the consolidated statement of financial position. Puttable 
third party interests such as units held by external investors in unit trusts are classified as financial liabilities. Third party interests in 
private equity vehicles set up with finite lives are also classified as financial liabilities.

1.5.2 Insurance contracts 
(i) Contracts within the scope of IFRS 17
An entity must apply IFRS 17 to determine the requirements for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of: 

– Insurance contracts (including reinsurance contracts issued); 

– Reinsurance contracts held; and 

– Investment contracts with DPF issued, provided the entity also issues insurance contracts. 

IFRS 17 defines insurance contracts as contracts under which one party (the issuer) accepts significant insurance risk from another 
party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) 
adversely affects the policyholder.

Reinsurance contracts are insurance contracts issued by one entity (the reinsurer) to compensate another entity for claims arising 
from one or more insurance contracts issued by that other entity (underlying contracts).

The Group judges that a contract transfers significant insurance risk if there is at least one scenario where the amounts that could 
be payable under the contract represent 10% or more than the amounts payable if the insured event does not occur.

In addition to accepting insurance risk from the insurance contracts issued, the Group is exposed to financial risk from the 
insurance and investment contracts it issues and reinsurance contracts it holds. 

The Group’s reinsurance contracts are predominantly contracts held under which risks are transferred to an external third party. 
The Group has one reinsurance contract under which it accepts risks from with-profits contracts issued by another insurer. 

Insurance contracts can be issued and reinsurance contracts can be initiated by the Group, or they can be acquired in a business 
combination or in a transfer of contracts that do not form a business. All references in these accounting policies to ‘insurance 
contracts’ and ‘reinsurance contracts’ include contracts issued, initiated or acquired by the Group, unless otherwise stated. 

Investment contracts with DPF have the legal form of insurance contracts, but do not transfer significant insurance risk and so are 
classified as financial instruments. Nevertheless such contracts fall within the scope of IFRS 17.

An investment contract with DPF is a financial instrument that provides a particular investor with the contractual right to receive, as 
a supplement to an amount not subject to the discretion of the issuer, additional amounts:

– that are expected to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits;

– the timing or amount of which are contractually at the discretion of the issuer; and

– that are contractually based on:

– the returns on a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract;

– realised and/or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer; or

– the profit or loss of the entity or fund that issues the contract.

The Group judges that the additional discretionary benefits are significant when they are expected to be at least 5% of the total 
contractual benefits.

The Group’s investment contracts with DPF comprise the with-profits business that do not transfer significant insurance risk. This 
includes investments in the PruFund range of funds available to individual investors.

Investment contracts without DPF are not accounted for under IFRS 17 but instead fall within the scope of IFRS 9. For the Group 
these primarily comprise unit-linked contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk. Also within the scope of IFRS 9 are 
contracts issued to corporate bodies to facilitate investment in PruFund, which as a result of cancellation rights included in those 
contracts, are judged by the Group to not provide significant discretionary benefits.

If several insurance contracts are transacted with the same or a related counterparty and the Group assesses that the contracts 
are designed to achieve an overall commercial effect, the contracts are combined in order to report the substance of the 
transactions.

Some investment contracts issued by the Group provide policyholders with the option to invest their premiums in both unit-linked 
funds and with-profits funds (including access to PruFund). The Group accounts for such contracts as two separate in substance 
contracts enabling the investment in with-profits and PruFund to be accounted for under IFRS 17 and the investment in unit-linked 
funds to be accounted for under IFRS 9.

1.5.2 Insurance contracts (continued)
(i) Contracts within the scope of IFRS 17 (continued)
The Group has previously issued and still holds a book of equity release mortgages. These contracts contain a no negative equity 
guarantee which ensures that, should the policyholder pass away or move into residential care during the term of the instrument 
and the accrued loan value is in excess of the sale proceeds of the mortgaged property, then the policyholder’s beneficiaries would 
not have to repay any excess. This feature has been assessed to consider whether it gives rise to insurance risk. The Group judges 
the equity release mortgages meet the definition of an insurance contract, but the compensation for insured events is limited to the 
amount otherwise required to settle the policyholder's obligation created by the contract. In this circumstance IFRS 17 permits the 
issuer of contracts to choose whether to account for these contracts under IFRS 17 or IFRS 9. The Group has opted to account for 
these contracts under IFRS 9.

(ii) Separating components
At inception, the Group must identify and separate the following components from contracts within the scope of IFRS 17 and 
account for the components as if they were stand-alone financial instruments:

– derivatives embedded in the contract whose economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host 

contract, and where the component issued as a standalone contract is not itself a contract that falls within the scope of IFRS 17; 
and

– distinct investment components other than investment components with DPF: ie investment components that are not highly 

inter-related with the insurance components and for which contracts with equivalent terms are sold, or could be sold, separately 
in the same market or the same jurisdiction. 

After separating any financial instrument components, the Group must separate any promises to transfer to policyholders distinct 
goods or services other than insurance coverage and investment services and account for them as separate contracts with 
customers (ie these are accounted for under IFRS 15). A good or service is distinct if the policyholder can benefit from it either on 
its own or with other resources that are readily available to the policyholder. A good or service is not distinct and is accounted for 
together with the insurance component if the cash flows and risks associated with the good or service are highly inter-related with 
the cash flows and risks associated with the insurance component, and the Group provides a significant level of service by 
integrating the good or service with the insurance component.

The Group has assessed the contracts it has issued and no contracts were identified as containing embedded derivatives, distinct 
investment components or distinct goods and non-insurance services that must be separated and accounted for under other IFRS 
standards.

Certain contracts have been determined to contain non-distinct investment components, rights to a refund of premiums, and other 
non-insurance components (ie amounts payable to a policyholder that are not contingent on the occurrence of an insured event) 
which are not required to be separated from the host insurance contract but do require specific treatment under IFRS 17. These 
payments are excluded from the value of insurance revenue and insurance service expenses presented in profit and loss.

Non-distinct investment components, rights to a refund of premiums, and other non-insurance components typically arise in 
contracts where there is some form of surrender benefit payable at any time of the policyholder’s choosing. The Group has opted 
as an accounting policy choice to consistently define the surrender value to be net of surrender charges or penalties when 
determining the amounts to exclude from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses.

(iii) Level of aggregation

Insurance contracts
Insurance contracts issued are aggregated into groups for measurement purposes. Groups of insurance contracts are first 
determined by identifying portfolios of insurance contracts, each comprising contracts subject to similar risks and managed 
together.

The Group interprets that, when aggregating contracts by similar risk, all risks must be considered but ‘similar risks’ is not 
interpreted to mean ‘identical risks’. The Group judges that an appropriate method is to aggregate contracts according to which of 
the three risk categories of protection, longevity and investment is the dominant risk which the Group is exposed to from writing 
the contract. These three categories have been chosen as they best represent the risks that the Group is exposed to without 
unnecessary granularity and subdivision.

(iii) Level of aggregation (continued)

Insurance contracts (continued)
In aggregating contracts that are managed together, the Group considers the following factors:

– the existence of a common pool of assets backing the contracts;

– the approach to risk management, for example hedging strategies or the existence of reinsurance arrangements;

– for business in a with-profits fund, the approach to risk-bearing, profit-sharing and the application of discretion;

– the source of the business, eg UK or overseas; and

– the categorisation of contracts for the segmental reporting reported in the accounts or for internal management information. 

Each portfolio is divided into a minimum of: 

– a group of contracts that are onerous on initial recognition, if any; 

– a group of contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently, if any; and 

– a group of the remaining contracts in the portfolio, if any.

The Group does not currently have any groups of contracts that fall into the category that on initial recognition have no significant 
possibility of becoming onerous subsequently.

Each of these groups must then be further subdivided, if necessary to ensure that each group does not contain contracts that have 
been issued more than one year apart. 

For annuities, unisex pricing may be required under gender neutral pricing regulations, and may, for example, result in policies sold 
to females being onerous and policies sold to males being non-onerous. As the other elements of the pricing basis are identical, the 
difference in onerousness is solely due to the legal constraint. IFRS 17 permits such contracts to be included in the same group.

Reinsurance contracts held
Reinsurance contracts held are similarly aggregated into groups for measurement purposes by first identifying portfolios. 
However, rather than dividing the portfolios into three groups based on profitability, the contracts are grouped according to 
whether or not there is net gain at initial recognition for a group, that is into a minimum of:

– a group of contracts for which there is a net gain on initial recognition, if any; 

– a group of contracts for which, on initial recognition, there is no significant possibility of there being a net gain subsequently, if 

any; and 

– a group of the remaining contracts in the portfolio, if any.

As for groups of contracts issued, no group may contain contracts that have been issued more than one year apart and so the 
groups must be further subdivided to meet this requirement as necessary.

The Group does not currently have any groups of contracts that fall into the category of, on initial recognition, having no significant 
possibility of there being a net gain subsequently.

Some reinsurance contracts provide cover for underlying contracts that are included in different groups. However, the Group 
concludes that the reinsurance contract’s legal form of a single contract reflects the substance of the Group’s contractual rights 
and obligations, considering that the different covers lapse together and are not sold separately. As a result, the reinsurance 
contract is not separated into multiple insurance components that relate to different underlying groups.

(iv) Recognition
A group of contracts issued by the Group is recognised from the earliest of: 

– the beginning of the coverage period of the group (ie the period during which the Group provides services in respect of any 

premiums within the boundaries of the contracts); 

– when the first payment from a policyholder in the group becomes due or, if there is no contractual due date, when it is received 

from a policyholder; and 

– for a group of onerous contracts, when the group becomes onerous. 

The Group is required to determine whether any contracts form a group of onerous contracts before the earlier of the first two 
dates above if facts and circumstances indicate there is such a group.

An insurance contract acquired in a transfer of contracts or a business combination is recognised on the date of acquisition. 

When the contract is recognised, it is added to an existing group of contracts or, if the contract does not qualify for inclusion in an 
existing group, it forms a new group to which future contracts are added. Groups of contracts are established on initial recognition 
and their composition is not revised once all contracts have been added to the group.

The recognition date of an investment contract with DPF is the date that the entity becomes party to the contract.

A group of reinsurance contracts held is recognised from the earlier of the following:

– the beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held; and

– the date the Group recognises an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts, if the Group entered into the related 

reinsurance contract held in the group of reinsurance contracts held at or before that date.

For groups of reinsurance contracts held that provide proportionate coverage, which for the Group consists of quota share 
reinsurance contracts, recognition is delayed until the date that any underlying insurance contract is initially recognised, if that date 
is later than the beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held.

Reinsurance contracts that are acquired are recognised from the date of acquisition.

(v) Onerous groups of contracts 
The Group considers the following factors to identify if a group of contracts is onerous: 

– the Group’s pricing frameworks; 

– profit testing results; and

– calculations for individual contracts.

(vi) Contract boundary
The measurement of a group of contracts includes all of the future cash flows within the boundary of each contract in the group, 
determined as follows:

Insurance contracts 
Cash flows are within the contract boundary if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting 
period in which the Group can compel the policyholder to pay premiums or has a substantive obligation to provide services 
(including insurance coverage and any investment services).

A substantive obligation to provide services ends when:

– the Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the particular policyholder and can set a price or level of benefits that 

fully reflects those reassessed risks; or

– the Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the portfolio that contains the contract and can set a price or level of 
benefits that fully reflects the risks of that portfolio, and the pricing of the premiums up to the reassessment date does not take 
into account risks that relate to periods after the reassessment date.

The reassessment of risks considers only risks transferred from policyholders to the Group, which may include both insurance and 
financial risks, but exclude lapse and expense risks.

(vi) Contract boundary (continued)

Investment contracts with DPF
Cash flows are within the contract boundary of an investment contract with DPF if they result from a substantive obligation of the 
entity to deliver cash at a present or future date. The entity has no substantive obligation to deliver cash if it has the practical ability 
to set a price for the promise to deliver the cash that fully reflects the amount of cash promised and related risks.

Reinsurance contracts 
Cash flows are within the contract boundary if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting 
period in which the Group is compelled to pay amounts to the reinsurer or has a substantive right to receive services from the 
reinsurer. A substantive right to receive services from the reinsurer ends when the reinsurer:

– has the practical ability to reassess the risks transferred to it and can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects those 

reassessed risks; or

– has a substantive right to terminate the coverage.

In assessing contract boundaries for insurance, investment with DPF and reinsurance contracts the Group makes the following 
judgements:

Granularity of contract boundary assessment
The contract boundary is assessed at an individual contract level.

Practical ability to set a price or level of benefits that fully reflect the risks
Only policyholder risks (the insurance and financial risks that the insurance contract transfers from the policyholder to the Group) 
are considered when assessing the Group’s ability to set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects the risks. Individual 
components of a single insurance contract are assessed separately, and the full insurance contract is subject to the same single 
boundary which is the longest of the individual components.

The Group considers the practical ability to set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects the risks only exists where the Group is 
not prevented from setting the same price it would for a new contract with the same characteristics. In addition to the constraints 
that apply in relation to new business, constraints on the Group’s ability to set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects the risks 
also include wider market competitiveness and commercial considerations and contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions.

The constraints must have commercial substance to bind the Group, where commercial substance is defined as having a 
‘discernible effect on the economics of the transaction’.

Right to terminate the contract
Policyholder behaviour is not relevant in assessing whether a contract binds the Group. The Group includes, within the fulfilment 
cash flows, the probability-weighted expectation of contract terminations, including allowance for policyholder behaviour. 

Adding insurance coverage
Where there is an option to add insurance coverage to the same contract at a future date, then the cash flows arising from the 
option will only fall outside the contract boundary if the Group has the practical ability to fully reassess the risks for the entire 
contract (including the option) at the point the option is exercised.

Frequency of assessment
The assessment of the contract boundary is performed and reassessed to include the effect of changes in circumstances on the 
entity's substantive rights and obligations. 

Treatment of non-contractual premium top-ups for accumulating with-profits and PruFund range of funds
The Group judges that, on initial recognition of an accumulating with-profits contract or PruFund range of funds contract, it has no 
substantive right to any profits associated with future non-contractual premiums and no substantive obligations. Therefore future 
non-contractual premiums are considered to be outside the contract boundary of the original contract. Non-contractual top-up 
premiums for these contracts are recognised from the date of payment and are reported as new business in the year of payment.

(vii) Measurement

Insurance contracts – initial measurement
On initial recognition, the Group measures a group of insurance contracts as the total of:

– the fulfilment cash flows, which comprise estimates of future cash flows, adjusted to reflect the time value of money and the 

associated financial risks, and a risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and 

– the CSM.

(vii) Measurement (continued)

Estimates of future cash flows
The estimated future cash flows are an explicit, unbiased and probability-weighted estimate (ie expected value) of the present 
value of the future cash outflows minus the present value of the future cash inflows that will arise as the entity fulfils insurance 
contracts. For most contracts the cash inflows and outflows primarily consist of premiums, claims and costs relating to the 
fulfilment of the contracts.

The With-Profits Fund contains surplus assets that have accumulated from a number of sources over a long period. Surpluses may 
continue to arise, for example if the amounts charged to policies exceed the costs they are intended to cover. These surpluses 
accrue to the With-Profits Fund and can be utilised to meet deficits arising on other with-profits contracts or to enhance the 
benefits payable to current or future policyholders. The expression 'mutualisation' is used to refer to the feature whereby the cash 
flows of some contracts may affect or be affected by the cash flows of other contracts. 

This feature of the With-Profits Fund is recognised under IFRS 17 through:

– Adjustments to the estimated future cash flows of each with-profits group of insurance contracts to reflect the policyholders’ 

share of the future surpluses/deficits that are expected to emerge from that group of insurance contracts.

– A liability that is separate to the liabilities for the groups of insurance contracts that reflects the additional amounts expected to 

be paid to current or future policyholders (in accordance with paragraph B71 of IFRS 17).

Estimating the policyholders’ share of the surplus assets is an area requiring significant judgement.

IFRS 17 requires that only costs that are directly attributable to fulfilling the insurance contracts are included in the cash flows. 
Management considers that the majority of the expenses incurred in relation to contracts within the scope of IFRS 17 meet this 
requirement. Examples of costs that would typically be excluded are those relating to corporate restructuring, brand marketing, 
and regulatory failings.

IFRS 17 requires that cash flows within the contract boundary include costs that the entity will incur in providing an investment 
activity to enhance benefits for the policyholder. The Group’s interpretation is that the Investment Management Expenses (IMEs) 
incurred on assets backing the fulfilment cash flows are included in the fulfilment cash flows for the majority of business, with the 
exception of non-profit protection contracts. This is on the basis of the effect of the Group’s investment activities and expected 
investment returns on the benefits payable, even if the benefits are contractually fixed at inception (as for annuity contracts). If the 
Group were to invest the premiums received for annuity contracts in less risky asset classes, a lower level of benefits would then 
be offered for the same premiums. Therefore, the benefits to the policyholder if an insured event occurs are enhanced by the 
investment activities performed, and so the associated expenses are included within the fulfilment cash flows.

Where there are cash flows between different components of the reporting entity (such as policyholder funds and shareholder 
funds) IFRS 17 requires that these are not included when estimating the cash flows that will arise as the entity fulfils an existing 
insurance contract, provided these cash flows do not change the amount that will be paid to the policyholders. 

The Group’s interpretation is that expenses will reflect the costs incurred by the Group, which may differ from the internal charges 
to companies within the Group.

The cash flows of a group of insurance contracts do not reflect the Group’s non-performance risk.

Discount rates
Cash flows are discounted using risk-free yield curves adjusted to reflect the liquidity characteristics of the contracts.

The Group determines the adjustment for illiquidity using either a top-down or a bottom-up approach.

1.5.2 Insurance contracts (continued)
(vii) Measurement (continued)

Discount rates (continued)
Under the top-down approach a yield curve that reflects the current market rates of return implicit in a fair value measurement of a 
reference portfolio of assets is adjusted to eliminate any factors that are not relevant to the insurance contracts, such as cash flow 
mismatching and credit risk. There is no requirement to adjust the yield curve for differences in the liquidity characteristics of the 
insurance contracts and the reference portfolio. Judgement is required to choose an appropriate reference portfolio and to 
determine the element of the yield on the portfolio that is attributable to factors not relevant to the insurance contracts. 

Under the bottom-up approach a liquid risk-free yield curve is increased to reflect the differences between the liquidity 
characteristics of the financial instruments that underlie the risk-free rates observed in the market and the liquidity characteristics 
of the insurance contracts. Judgement is required to determine the illiquidity premium. 

The Group applies the top-down approach for non-profit annuity contracts and the bottom-up approach for all other contracts, 
including with-profits.

The reference portfolios chosen for non-profit annuities are the Assigned Portfolios used for the Solvency II Matching Adjustment. 
These are considered to be suitable as reference portfolios for IFRS 17 reporting because their objective is to closely match the 
liability cash flows and there is strong governance around their management.

The largest adjustment made to reference portfolio yield is in relation to credit risk. IFRS 17 is not prescriptive as to how the 
adjustment for credit risk is determined other than that it should reflect market risk premiums for credit risk. The Group continues 
to calculate the credit risk adjustment using the same approach previously used for IFRS 4 reporting. This methodology is 
considered appropriate for IFRS 17 reporting as it incorporates allowances for expected and unexpected credit events, including 
internal and external views on the outlook for credit risk, and considers the relationship between credit risk and yield spreads.

For with-profits contracts the illiquidity premium is derived from a portfolio of fixed interest assets, comprising highly liquid 
government bonds and less liquid corporate bonds, that have similar characteristics and duration to the liabilities. The illiquidity 
premium for this portfolio is determined as the spread over risk-free rates less an allowance for credit risk. A weighting is then 
applied to this premium to reflect the relative liquidity characteristics of the with-profits contracts.

Risk adjustment for non-financial risk
The risk adjustment for non-financial risk for a group of insurance contracts, determined separately from the other estimates, is the 
compensation that the Group requires for bearing uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-
financial risk, such as insurance risk, expense risk and lapse risk.

For all lines of business, the Group uses a confidence level technique under which the target confidence level is determined by 
consideration of the Group’s pricing framework for insurance contracts issued and the prices at which the Group has previously 
transacted reinsurance contracts held. The target confidence level is translated into product-specific non-financial assumptions by 
reference to the Group’s view of the likely risk distributions of non-financial risk events, which have a time horizon of one year. The 
risk adjustment for non-financial risk is determined as the increase in the discounted value of the future cash flows from using 
these assumptions instead of unbiased non-financial assumptions.

There is significant overlap in the risks considered between IFRS 17 and Solvency II reporting. The IFRS 17 risk adjustment does not 
include financial risks or non-financial risks that do not arise from insurance contracts.

The risk adjustment reflects the impact of diversification of non-financial risks within each entity in the Group but not diversification 
of risks between entities. The risk adjustment is calculated separately gross of reinsurance and for reinsurance contracts held.
For reinsurance contracts held, the risk adjustment represents the amount of risk being transferred by the Group to the reinsurer. 
The same approach is used to determine the risk adjustment, ie as the difference in the discounted value of future cash flows 
between using best estimate assumptions and assumptions calibrated to the required confidence level.

CSM
The CSM of a group of insurance contracts represents the unearned profit that the Group will recognise as it provides services 
under those contracts. On initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts, if the total of (a) the fulfilment cash flows, (b) any 
cash flows arising at that date and (c) any amount arising from the derecognition of any assets or liabilities previously recognised 
for cash flows related to the group is a net inflow, then the group is not onerous. In this case, the CSM is measured as the value of 
the net inflow, which results in no income or expenses arising on initial recognition.

(vii) Measurement (continued)

CSM (continued)
For groups of contracts acquired in a transfer of contracts or a business combination, the consideration received for the contracts 
is included in the fulfilment cash flows as a proxy for the premiums received at the date of acquisition. In a business combination, 
the consideration received is the fair value of the contracts at that date. 

If the total is a net outflow, then the group is onerous. In this case, the net outflow is recognised as a loss in profit or loss, or as an 
adjustment to goodwill or a gain on a bargain purchase if the contracts are acquired in a business combination. A loss component 
is created to depict the amount of the net outflow, which determines the amounts that are subsequently presented in profit or loss 
as reversals of losses on onerous contracts and are excluded from insurance revenue.

Insurance contracts – subsequent measurement
The carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts at each reporting date is the sum of the liability for remaining coverage and 
the liability for incurred claims. The liability for remaining coverage comprises (a) the fulfilment cash flows that relate to services 
that will be provided under the contracts in future periods and (b) any remaining CSM at that date. The liability for incurred claims 
includes the fulfilment cash flows for incurred claims and expenses that have not yet been paid, including claims that have been 
incurred but not yet reported.

The fulfilment cash flows of groups of insurance contracts are measured at the reporting date using current estimates of future 
cash flows, current discount rates and current estimates of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.

The method for calculating the CSM for a group of contracts subsequent to initial recognition of the group depends on whether the 
group consists of contracts that are with or without direct participation features.

A contract within the scope of IFRS 17 is considered to have direct participation features (ie required to be measured applying the 
Variable Fee Approach) if at inception:

– the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;

– the entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying 

items; and

– the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in 

fair value of the underlying items.

Conversely all contracts that do not meet the definition of being with direct participation features at inception are contracts 
without direct participation features.

Contracts must be individually assessed to determine whether they are with direct participation features and once classified they 
are not reassessed unless the contract is modified.

Where contracts are subject to mutualisation, criteria (b) and (c) are assessed allowing for the impact of mutualisation. 

The Group’s contracts with direct participation features comprise all of the with-profits business and unit-linked contracts 
accounted for under IFRS 17.

All of the Group’s other business that is within the scope of IFRS 17 are contracts without direct participation features. In particular 
IFRS 17 prescribes that reinsurance contracts, held or issued, can only be contracts without direct participation features.

Underlying items
The underlying items are items that determine some of the amounts payable to a policyholder. Underlying items can comprise any 
items, for example, a reference portfolio of assets, the net assets of the entity, or a specified subset of the net assets of the entity.

For in-force with-profits contracts the Group defines the underlying items to be the assets backing asset shares (which are the 
accumulated value of all items of income and outgo) and, where applicable, the assets backing the amounts expected to be added 
to asset shares in the future, for example to reflect miscellaneous surplus that has arisen (such as from some non-profit business 
written in the With-Profits Fund).

A liability, that is separate to the liabilities for the in-force with-profits contracts (in accordance with paragraph B71 of IFRS 17), is 
held in the With-Profits Fund that reflects the additional amounts expected to be paid to current or future policyholders. The Group 
defines the underlying items for these benefits to be:

– the entirety of the assets in the With-Profits Fund;

– less: the underlying items of the in-force with-profits contracts;

– less: the assets held to meet other liabilities of the With-Profits Fund, for example for non-profit contracts.

(vii) Measurement (continued)

Underlying items (continued)
For unit-linked contracts the Group defines the underlying items to be the assets backing the units allocated to all contracts in the 
unit of account (the ‘unit fund’). For contracts where actuarial funding is used the underlying items are defined as the funded value 
of units, that is the face value of units multiplied by the actuarial funding factor.

Insurance contracts without direct participation features
For insurance contracts without direct participation features, the carrying amount of the CSM subsequent to initial recognition is 
calculated using the General Measurement Model (GMM). Applying GMM, the carrying amount of the CSM at each reporting date 
is the carrying amount at the start of the reporting period, adjusted for:

– the effect of any new contracts that are added to the group in the reporting period;

– interest accreted on the carrying amount of the CSM during the reporting period, measured at the discount rates determined on 

initial recognition;

– changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service, except to the extent that:

– any increases in the fulfilment cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the CSM, in which case the excess is recognised as a 

loss in profit or loss and creates a loss component; or

– any decreases in the fulfilment cash flows are allocated to the loss component;

– the effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM; and

– the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the services provided in the reporting period.

Changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service comprise:

– experience adjustments arising from premiums received in the reporting period that relate to future services and related cash 

flows, measured at the discount rates determined on initial recognition;

– changes in estimates of the present value of future cash flows in the liability for remaining coverage, measured at the discount 
rates determined on initial recognition, except for changes that arise from the effects of the time value of money, financial risk 
and changes therein;

– differences between (a) any investment component expected to become payable in the reporting period, determined as the 

payment expected at the start of the reporting period plus any insurance finance income or expenses related to that expected 
payment before it becomes payable; and (b) the actual amount that becomes payable in the reporting period; and

– changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that relate to future services.

A key aspect of GMM is that adjustments to the CSM resulting from changes to the present value of future cash flows must be 
measured using the discount rate that applied at inception of the group of contracts. However, the standard does not explicitly 
state whether this is intended to extend to all financial assumptions. The Group’s interpretation is that all financial assumptions 
must be set at inception but are only ‘locked-in’ for future years, therefore the estimates of cash flows up to the measurement date 
reflect the effect of actual historical financial risk experience. For example, for index-linked annuities the estimated future cash 
flows reflect the actual inflationary increases that have been added to benefits since inception rather than the locked-in assumed 
inflationary increases.

After recognising a loss on an onerous group of insurance contracts, specified fulfilment cash flows must be allocated on a 
systematic basis between the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage and the liability for remaining coverage 
excluding the loss component. For this purpose, the proportion allocated to the loss component is determined as the ratio of the 
amount of the loss component to the discounted value of the future cash outflows plus the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.

Insurance contracts with direct participation features
Direct participating contracts are contracts under which the Group’s obligation to the policyholder is the net of:

– the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items; and

– a variable fee in exchange for future services provided by the contracts, being the amount of the Group's share of the fair value of 
the underlying items less fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items. The Group provides 
investment services under these contracts by promising an investment return based on underlying items, in addition to 
insurance coverage.

In respect of the variable fee for the Group’s in-force with-profits contracts, the Group's share of the fair value of the underlying 
items consists of:

– shareholder transfers, gross of tax; and

– the Group's share of the excess of charges and deductions taken from the asset share (such as annual management charges or 

surrender penalties) over shareholder transfers, gross of tax, and costs that vary directly with the underlying items.

(vii) Measurement (continued)

Insurance contracts with direct participation features (continued)
The fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns of the underlying items are:

– the Group's share of amounts that are expressed as a monetary amount, such as administration expenses, policy fees and the 

risk adjustment for non-financial risk. For certain types of cost, such as investment management expenses and additional death 
benefits in excess of the asset share, some costs vary directly with the underlying items and others do not. The whole amount of 
these types of cost is included in the fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns of the underlying items.

– less the fee margin charged by the Group’s asset managers for managing the investments backing the with-profits contracts.

There is no variable fee or CSM in relation to the additional amounts expected to be paid to current or future policyholders (that are 
recognised in accordance with paragraph B71 of IFRS 17).

In respect of the variable fee for the Group’s unit-linked contracts, the Group’s share of the fair value of the underlying items 
consists of charges and deductions taken from the unit fund (such as annual management charges or surrender penalties), less 
costs that vary directly with the underlying items. The fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns of the underlying 
items are amounts that are expressed as a monetary amount, such as administration expenses, policy fees and the risk adjustment 
for non-financial risk. For certain types of cost, such as investment management expenses and additional death benefits in excess 
of the unit fund, some costs vary directly with the underlying items and others do not. The whole amount of these types of cost is 
included in the fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns of the underlying items.

For insurance contracts with direct participation features, the carrying amount of the CSM subsequent to initial recognition is 
calculated using the Variable Fee Approach (VFA). When measuring a group of direct participating contracts, the Group adjusts 
the fulfilment cash flows by the whole of the change in the obligation to pay policyholders an amount equal to the fair value of the 
underlying items. These changes do not relate to future services and are recognised in profit or loss. The Group then adjusts any 
CSM for changes in the amount of the Group’s share of the fair value of the underlying items, which relate to future services, as 
explained below.

The carrying amount of the CSM at each reporting date is the carrying amount at the start of the reporting period, adjusted for:

– the CSM of any new contracts that are added to the group in the reporting period;

– the change in the amount of the Group’s share of the fair value of the underlying items and changes in fulfilment cash flows that 

relate to future services, except to the extent that:

– a decrease in the amount of the Group's share of the fair value of the underlying items, or an increase in the fulfilment cash 

flows that relate to future services, exceeds the carrying amount of the CSM, giving rise to a loss in profit or loss (included in 
insurance service expenses) and creating a loss component; or

– an increase in the amount of the Group's share of the fair value of the underlying items, or a decrease in the fulfilment cash 

flows that relate to future services, is allocated to the loss component;

– the effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM; and

– the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the services provided in the reporting period.

Changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future services include the changes relating to future services specified above for 
contracts without direct participation features (measured at current discount rates) and changes in the effect of the time value of 
money and financial risks that do not arise from underlying items eg the effect of financial guarantees.

In determining the change in CSM attributable to the effect of the time value of money and financial risk on the Group’s share of the 
fair value of the underlying items and the fulfilment cash flows, the Group has chosen not to use the risk mitigation option whereby 
the changes would be adjusted to reflect the use of derivatives, non-derivative financial instruments or reinsurance contracts held 
to mitigate the effect of financial risk.

After recognising a loss on an onerous group of insurance contracts, specified fulfilment cash flows must be allocated on a 
systematic basis between the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage and the liability for remaining coverage 
excluding the loss component. For this purpose, the proportion allocated to the loss component is determined as the ratio of the 
amount of the loss component to the discounted value of the future cash outflows plus the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.

Reinsurance contracts
To measure a group of reinsurance contracts, the Group applies the same accounting policies as are applied to insurance contracts 
without direct participation features, with the following modifications.

The carrying amount of a group of reinsurance contracts at each reporting date is the sum of the asset or liability for remaining 
coverage and the asset or liability for incurred claims. The asset or liability for remaining coverage comprises (a) the fulfilment cash 
flows that relate to services that will be received under the contracts in future periods and (b) any remaining CSM at that date.

(vii) Measurement (continued)

Reinsurance contracts (continued)
The Group measures the estimates of the present value of future cash flows using assumptions that are consistent with those used 
to measure the estimates of the present value of future cash flows for the underlying insurance contracts. The present value of the 
future cash flows for reinsurance contracts held is also adjusted for any risk of non-performance by the reinsurer. The effect of the 
non-performance risk of the reinsurer is assessed at each reporting date and the effect of changes in the non-performance risk is 
recognised in profit or loss.

The risk adjustment for non-financial risk is the amount of risk being transferred by the Group to the reinsurer. 

On initial recognition, the CSM of a group of reinsurance contracts represents a net cost or net gain on purchasing reinsurance. It is 
measured as the amount of the total of (a) the fulfilment cash flows, (b) any amount arising from the derecognition of any assets or 
liabilities previously recognised for cash flows related to the group, (c) any cash flows arising at that date and (d) any income 
recognised in profit or loss because of onerous underlying contracts recognised at that date.

However, if any net cost on purchasing reinsurance coverage relates to insured events that occurred before the purchase of the 
reinsurance, then the Group recognises the cost immediately in profit or loss as an expense.

The carrying amount of the CSM at each reporting date is the carrying amount at the start of the reporting period, adjusted for:

– the effect of any new contracts that are added to the group in the reporting period;

– interest accreted on the carrying amount of the CSM during the reporting period, measured at the discount rates determined on 

initial recognition;

– income recognised in profit or loss in the reporting period on initial recognition of an onerous group of underlying contracts;

– reversals of a loss-recovery component to the extent that they are not changes in the fulfilment cash flows of the group of 

reinsurance contracts;

– changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future services, measured at the discount rates determined on initial recognition, 
unless they result from changes in fulfilment cash flows allocated to a group of underlying contracts that do not adjust the CSM 
for the group of underlying insurance contracts;

– the effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM; and

– the amount recognised in profit or loss because of the services received in the reporting period.

Reinsurance of onerous underlying insurance contracts
The Group adjusts the CSM of the group to which a reinsurance contract belongs and as a result recognises income when it 
recognises a loss on initial recognition of an onerous group of underlying contracts, if the reinsurance contract is entered into 
before or at the same time as the onerous underlying contracts are recognised. The adjustment to the CSM is determined by 
multiplying:

– the amount of the loss that relates to the underlying contracts; and

– the percentage of claims on the underlying contracts that the Group expects to recover from the reinsurance contracts.

For reinsurance contracts acquired in a transfer of contracts or a business combination covering onerous underlying contracts, the 
adjustment to the CSM is determined by multiplying:

– the amount of the loss component that relates to the underlying contracts at the date of acquisition; and

– the percentage of claims on the underlying contracts that the Group expects at the date of acquisition to recover from the 

reinsurance contracts.

For reinsurance contracts acquired in a business combination, the adjustment to the CSM reduces goodwill or increases a gain on 
a bargain purchase.

If the reinsurance contract covers only some of the insurance contracts included in an onerous group of contracts, then the Group 
determines the portion of losses recognised on the onerous group of contracts that relates to underlying contracts covered by the 
reinsurance contract.

A loss-recovery component is created or adjusted for the group of reinsurance contracts to depict the adjustment to the CSM, 
which determines the amounts that are subsequently presented in profit or loss as reversals of recoveries of losses from the 
reinsurance contracts and are excluded from the allocation of reinsurance premiums paid.

(viii) Derecognition and contract modification
The Group derecognises a contract when it is extinguished – ie when the specified obligations in the contract expire or are 
discharged or cancelled.

The Group also derecognises a contract if its terms are modified in a way that would have significantly changed the accounting for 
the contract had the new terms always existed, in which case a new contract based on the modified terms is recognised. If a 
contract modification does not result in derecognition, then the Group treats the changes in cash flows caused by the modification 
as changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows.

On derecognition of a contract from within a group of contracts:

– the fulfilment cash flows allocated to the group are adjusted to eliminate those that relate to the rights and obligations 

derecognised;

– the CSM of the group is adjusted for the change in the fulfilment cash flows, except where such changes are allocated to a loss 

component; and

– the number of coverage units for the expected remaining services is adjusted to reflect the coverage units derecognised from 

the group (see ‘Release of the CSM’ below).

If a contract is derecognised because it is transferred to a third party, then the CSM is also adjusted for the premium charged by 
the third party, unless the group is onerous.

If a contract is derecognised because its terms are modified, then the CSM is also adjusted for the premium that would have been 
charged had the Group entered into a contract with the new contract’s terms at the date of modification, less any additional 
premium charged for the modification. The new contract recognised is measured assuming that, at the date of modification, the 
Group received the premium that it would have charged less any additional premium charged for the modification.

The Group has applied judgement in determining the appropriate treatment for the modification to the Rothesay reinsurance treaty 
which occurred when the majority of the underlying contracts that were reinsured by the treaty were transferred to Rothesay via a 
Part VII transfer on 15 December 2021. The Group judges that the amendment to the treaty to facilitate the continued long-term 
reinsurance of contracts that were originally intended to be transferred but were removed from the scope of the Part VII, resulted 
in a significant change to the contract boundary of the treaty. Therefore the appropriate treatment is to derecognise the original 
treaty and recognise the amended treaty as a new contract. As the amendment occurred shortly before the IFRS 17 transition date, 
the Group concludes that it is sufficient to determine the premium for the amended treaty as the fair value of the reinsured benefits 
as at the date of transition.

(ix) Presentation
Portfolios of insurance contracts that are assets and those that are liabilities, and portfolios of reinsurance contracts that are assets 
and those that are liabilities, are presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position. Any assets or liabilities 
recognised for cash flows arising before the recognition of the related group of contracts are included in the carrying amount of the 
related portfolios of contracts.

The Group disaggregates amounts recognised in the statement of profit or loss into (a) an insurance service result, comprising 
insurance revenue and insurance service expenses; and (b) insurance finance income or expenses. The Group has elected to 
disaggregate the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk between the insurance service result and insurance finance 
income or expenses.

Income and expenses from reinsurance contracts are presented separately from income and expenses from insurance contracts. 
Income and expenses from reinsurance contracts, other than insurance finance income or expenses, are presented on a net basis 
as ‘net expenses from reinsurance contracts’ in the insurance service result.

The Group excludes from both insurance revenue and insurance service expenses any non-distinct investment components, 
refunds of premiums and other non-insurance components. The Group has made the accounting policy choice that accounting 
estimates made in interim financial statements are changed when applying IFRS 17 in the subsequent annual reporting period.

Insurance revenue 
The Group recognises insurance revenue as it satisfies its performance obligations ie as it provides services to groups of insurance 
contracts. The insurance revenue relating to the services provided for each reporting period represents the total of the changes in 
the liability for remaining coverage that relate to services for which the Group expects to receive consideration, and comprises the 
following items:

– A release of the CSM, measured based on coverage units provided (see ‘Release of the CSM’ below);

– Changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk relating to current services;

Insurance revenue (continued)
– Policyholder tax; and

– Claims and other insurance service expenses incurred in the reporting period, measured as the amounts expected at the 

beginning of the reporting period. 

In addition, the Group allocates a portion of premiums that relate to recovering any insurance acquisition cash flows to each period 
in a systematic way based on the passage of time. The Group recognises the allocated amount, adjusted for interest accretion at 
the discount rates determined on initial recognition of the related group of contracts, as insurance revenue and an equal amount as 
insurance service expenses.

Release of the CSM
The amount of the CSM of a group of insurance contracts that is recognised as insurance revenue in the reporting period is 
determined by identifying the coverage units in the group, allocating the CSM remaining at the end of the reporting period (before 
any allocation) equally to each coverage unit provided in the current reporting period and expected to be provided in future 
reporting periods, and recognising in profit or loss the amount of the CSM allocated to coverage units provided in the current 
reporting period. The number of coverage units is the quantity of services provided by the contracts in the group, determined by 
considering for each contract the quantity of benefits provided and its expected coverage period. The coverage units are reviewed 
and updated at each reporting date.

Services provided to insurance contracts include insurance coverage and, for all direct participating contracts, investment services 
for managing underlying items on behalf of policyholders (investment-related services). In addition, insurance contracts without 
direct participation features may also provide investment services for generating an investment return for the policyholder 
(investment-return service), but only if:

– an investment component exists or the policyholder has a right to withdraw an amount (eg the policyholder’s right to receive a 

surrender value on cancellation of a contract);

– the investment component or withdrawal amount is expected to include an investment return; and

– the Group expects to perform investment activities to generate that investment return.

The Group defines the coverage units for its contracts as follows:

– Insurance coverage (where the benefit is a single lump sum payment, eg term assurances): the sum assured.

– Insurance coverage (where the benefit is a regular income, eg annuities and income protection): the annualised amount of 

income, as confirmed by the IFRS Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) in 2022.

– Investment-related service (with-profits and unit-linked): the asset share or unit fund value.

– Investment-return service (eg annuities): the transfer amount (for deferred annuities in the accumulation phase) or the payment 

of annuity benefits within a guaranteed payment period.

The expected coverage period reflects expectations of lapses and cancellations of contracts, as well as the likelihood of insured 
events occurring to the extent that they would affect the expected coverage period. The period of investment services ends no 
later than the date on which all amounts due to current policyholders relating to those services have been paid.

Where a contract provides both insurance coverage and investment services the Group must apply judgement to determine 
appropriate weightings to assign to the two types of service in order to calculate the coverage units for each reporting period. The 
weights are not locked-in at inception of the group of contracts and instead are reviewed and updated at each reporting date, 
consistent with the treatment of the coverage units.

With-profits and unit-linked contracts are predominantly investment contracts but may additionally provide insurance coverage if 
the contract provides a death benefit in excess of the underlying items. For these contracts weighted coverage units are 
determined as the maximum of the asset share or unit fund and the amount payable on death.

IFRS 17 does not provide explicit guidance as to whether the assumptions used to project the expected coverage units for future 
reporting periods should be current or locked-in (ie those that applied at inception of the group of contracts). In addition, the 
standard does not provide guidance as to whether the future coverage units should be discounted when determining the amount 
of CSM to be released in the current reporting period.

The Group judges that in regards to the assumptions used for both GMM and VFA CSM it is appropriate to use current 
assumptions to calculate the coverage units expected to be provided in the future. This is on the basis that it results in the most 
accurate estimate of the service that will be provided in future.

Release of the CSM (continued)
In respect of discounting, the Group judges that it is appropriate to discount the future coverage units as that is consistent with the 
CSM calculation allowing for the time value of money. The discounting approach follows the method applied in the CSM 
calculation, namely coverage units for GMM CSM are discounted using the rates that applied at inception and coverage units for 
VFA CSM are discounted using current rates.

Insurance service expenses
Insurance service expenses arising from insurance contracts are recognised in profit or loss as they are incurred. They exclude 
repayments of non-distinct investment components, rights to a refund of premiums, and other non-insurance components, and 
comprise the following items:

– Incurred claims and other insurance service expenses.

– Amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows: This is equal to the amount of insurance revenue recognised in the reporting 

period that relates to recovering insurance acquisition cash flows. 

– Losses on onerous contracts and reversals of such losses.

– Adjustments to the liabilities for incurred claims that do not arise from the effects of the time value of money, financial risk and 

changes therein.

– Impairment losses on assets for insurance acquisition cash flows and reversals of such impairment losses.

Net expenses from reinsurance contracts
Net expenses from reinsurance contracts comprise an allocation of reinsurance premiums paid less amounts recovered from reinsurers.

The Group recognises an allocation of reinsurance premiums paid in profit or loss as it receives services under groups of 
reinsurance contracts. The allocation of reinsurance premiums paid relating to services received for each period represents the 
total of the changes in the asset for remaining coverage.

Coverage units for reinsurance contracts held are typically consistent with the underlying insurance contracts, adjusted for 
differences in the services received from the reinsurer. For reinsurance contracts held that provide reinsurance of mortality or 
morbidity risk, the coverage units are typically defined as the sum at risk reinsured. For longevity swap reinsurance arrangements 
in relation to non-profit annuity business, the coverage units are based on the proportion of the actual annuity payments made on 
the underlying contracts that the Group recovers from the reinsurer.

For a group of reinsurance contracts covering onerous underlying contracts, the Group establishes a loss-recovery component of 
the asset for remaining coverage to depict the recovery of losses recognised:

– on recognition of onerous underlying contracts, if the reinsurance contract covering those contracts is entered into before or at 

the same time as those contracts are recognised; and

– for changes in fulfilment cash flows of the group of reinsurance contracts relating to future services that result from changes in 

fulfilment cash flows of the onerous underlying contracts.

The loss-recovery component determines the amounts that are subsequently presented in profit or loss as reversals of recoveries 
of losses from the reinsurance contracts and are excluded from the allocation of reinsurance premiums paid. It is adjusted to reflect 
changes in the loss component of the onerous group of underlying contracts, but it cannot exceed the portion of the loss 
component of the onerous group of underlying contracts that the Group expects to recover from the reinsurance contracts.

Insurance finance income and expenses
Insurance finance income and expenses comprise changes in the carrying amounts of groups of insurance and reinsurance 
contracts arising from the effects of the time value of money, financial risk and changes therein, unless any such changes for 
groups of direct participating contracts are allocated to a loss component and included in insurance service expenses. They 
include changes in the measurement of groups of contracts caused by changes in the value of underlying items (excluding 
additions and withdrawals). 

The Group has opted as an accounting policy choice to recognise all insurance finance income or expenses for the reporting period 
in profit or loss and to not recognise any part of that income or expenses in other comprehensive income (OCI).

1.5.3 Investment contracts without discretionary participation features (DPF)
(i) Investment contracts without discretionary participation features (DPF)
Investment contracts without DPF, such as unit-linked savings and similar contracts, are accounted for as financial instruments. 
This treatment reflects the deposit nature of the arrangement, with premiums and claims reflected as deposits and withdrawals 
and recognised directly on the consolidated statement of financial position as movements in the financial liability. These investment 
contracts are classified as financial instruments and designated as FVTPL because the resulting liabilities are managed, and their 
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. For unit-linked contracts, the fair value of the liability is equal to the unit value 
obligation. 

(ii) Reinsurance
The Group enters into various reinsurance arrangements in relation to unit-linked savings contracts where there is no transfer of 
significant insurance risk to the reinsurer (funded reinsurance). Such contracts are classified as a financial instruments and 
measured at FVTPL and included with Equity securities and pooled investment funds in the consolidated statement of financial 
position.

(iii) Deferred acquisition costs
The Group incurs various costs in acquiring new investment contracts without DPF. The incremental, directly attributable 
acquisition costs relating to these contracts are capitalised and amortised in line with the related revenue. If the contracts involve 
upfront charges, this income is also deferred and amortised through the consolidated income statement, as the service is provided 
in accordance with IFRS 15.

The recoverability of any deferred acquisition costs is reviewed at each reporting date, and to the extent that these are no longer 
deemed recoverable from future revenue, the carrying value is written down to the recoverable amount and the related impairment 
charge recorded in the consolidated income statement.

1.5.4 Business acquisitions
Business acquisitions are accounted for by applying the acquisition method of accounting, where the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. The excess of the fair value of acquisition 
consideration over the recorded value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded on the consolidated statement 
of financial position as goodwill. Expenses related to acquiring new business are charged to the consolidated income statement in 
the year in which they are incurred. Income and expenses of acquired entities are included in the consolidated income statement 
from the date of acquisition.

Acquisitions of entities under common control are accounted for under merger accounting principles. Under merger accounting, 
the results and statement of financial position for entities acquired are presented as if they had always been combined. Assets and 
liabilities of the entities acquired are recorded at their carrying values and a fair value measurement is not undertaken. No new 
goodwill is recognised and the differences between the cost of investment, which is its fair value, and the carrying value of assets 
and liabilities acquired is recorded within equity. 

1.5.5 Financial instruments
(i) Initial recognition 
The classification of financial instruments at initial recognition depends on their contractual terms and the business model for 
managing the instruments. Financial instruments are initially recognised on the trade date measured at their fair value.

(ii) Measurement categories
The Group classifies all of its financial assets based on the business model for managing the assets and the asset’s contractual 
terms. The categories include the following:

– Amortised cost 

– Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL).

(iii) Financial instruments measured at amortised cost 
Financial instruments are held at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: 

– The instruments are held within a business model with the objective of holding the instrument to collect the contractual cash 

flows; and

– The contractual terms of the debt instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are Solely Payments of Principal and 

Interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

The details of these conditions are outlined below.

(iv) Business model assessment 
The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its 
business objective.

The Group holds financial assets to generate returns and provide a capital base to provide for settlement of claims as they arise. 
The Group considers the timing, amount and volatility of cash flow requirements to support insurance liability portfolios in 
determining the business model for the assets as well as the potential to maximise return for shareholders and future business 
development. 

The Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios 
that is based on observable factors such as: 

– How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported 

to the Group's key management personnel;

– The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in 

particular, the way those risks are managed; and

– How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets 

managed or on the contractual cash flows collected). 

The expected frequency, value and timing of asset sales are also important aspects of the Group’s assessment. 

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios 
into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's original expectations, the 
Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business.

(v) The SPPI test 
As a second step of its classification process the Group assesses the contractual terms to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. 
‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the 
life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount). 

The most significant elements of interest within a debt arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and 
credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Group applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in 
which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set. 

(vi) Financial assets measured at FVTPL
Financial assets in this category are those that are managed in a fair value business model, or that have been designated by 
management upon initial recognition, or are mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9. This category includes 
debt instruments whose cash flow characteristics fail the SPPI criterion or are not held within a business model whose objective is 
to collect contractual cash flows.

(vii) Subsequent measurement 
After initial measurement, deposits, cash and accrued investment income and other debtors are measured at amortised cost, using 
the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method, less allowance for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. An Expected Credit Losses (ECL) is 
recognised in investment return in the consolidated income statement when the investments are impaired. 

Financial assets at FVTPL are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are 
recorded in investment return in the consolidated income statement. Interest earned on assets mandatorily required to be 
measured at FVTPL is recorded using contractual interest rates. Dividend income from equity instruments measured at FVTPL is 
recorded in investment return in the consolidated income statement when the right to the payment has been established. 

(viii) Reclassification of financial assets and liabilities 
The Group does not reclassify its financial assets subsequent to their initial recognition, apart from the exceptional circumstances 
in which there has been a change in business model.

(ix) Derecognition other than for substantial modification 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when: 

– The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or 

– The Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash 

flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either: (a) the Group has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

1.5.5 Financial instruments (continued)
(ix) Derecognition other than for substantial modification (continued)
The Group considers control to be transferred if, and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to 
an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing additional restrictions on the transfer. 

When the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained control of the asset, 
the asset continues to be recognised only to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement, in which case, the Group also 
recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights 
and obligations that the Group has retained. 

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original 
carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration the Group could be required to pay.

(x) Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions 
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it 
becomes a new instrument, with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss. In the case of debt instruments at 
amortised cost, the newly recognised loans are classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes. 

When assessing whether or not to derecognise an instrument, among others, the Group considers the following factors: 

– Change in currency of the debt instrument

– Introduction of an equity feature

– Change in counterparty 

– If the modification is such that the instrument would no longer meet the SPPI criterion.

If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in derecognition. 
Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Group records a modification gain or loss. 

(xi) Impairment of financial assets 
The Group recognises an allowance for ECLs for all debt instruments not held at FVTPL. ECLs are based on the difference between 
the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, 
discounted at the appropriate effective interest rate. 

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months 
(12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a 
loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the 
default (a lifetime ECL). 

For certain instruments with investment grade rating, the Group uses the low credit simplification and consequently, a 
determination of significant increase in credit risk will not be required and the impairment loss would always be calculated based 
on a 12-month ECL.

The Group also makes use of a simplified impairment approach for trade receivables and contract assets as allowed under IFRS 9. 
Under this approach, impairment is calculated using a provisioning matrix that is based on days past due.

(xii) Write-offs 
Financial assets are written off either partially or in their entirety only when the Group has stopped pursuing the recovery. If the 
amount to be written off is greater than the accumulated loss allowance, the difference is first treated as an addition to the 
allowance that is then applied against the gross carrying amount. Any subsequent recoveries are credited to credit loss expense. 

(xiii) Recognition of interest income 
Under IFRS 9, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR) method for all financial assets measured at 
amortised cost. The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial 
asset or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset. 

The EIR (and therefore, the amortised cost of the financial asset) is calculated by taking into account transaction costs and any 
discount or premium on acquisition of the financial asset as well as fees and costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The Group 
recognises interest income using a rate of return that represents the best estimate of a constant rate of return over the expected 
life of the debt instrument. 

If expectations of fixed rate financial assets' cash flows are revised for reasons other than credit risk, the changes to future 
contractual cash flows are discounted at the original EIR with a consequential adjustment to the carrying amount. The difference to 
the previous carrying amount is booked as a positive or negative adjustment to the carrying amount of the financial asset in the 
balance sheet with a corresponding increase or decrease in interest income.

1.5.5 Financial instruments (continued)
(xiv) Interest and similar income 
Interest income comprises amounts calculated using the effective interest method for assets measured at amortised cost. These 
are disclosed separately on the face of the consolidated income statement. 

Other interest income includes interest on all financial assets measured at FVTPL, using the contractual interest rate.

The Group calculates interest income on financial assets, other than those considered credit-impaired, by applying the EIR to the 
gross carrying amount of the financial asset.

(xv) Determination of fair value 
The Group uses current bid prices to value its investments with quoted prices. Actively traded investments without quoted prices 
are valued using prices provided by third parties. Financial assets measured at fair value are classified into a three-level hierarchy 
as described in Note 31.

If the market for a financial investment of the Group is not active, the fair value is determined using valuation techniques. The Group 
establishes fair value for these financial investments by using quotations from independent third parties, such as brokers or pricing 
services, or by using internally developed pricing models. Priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources 
when available, but overall the source of pricing and/or the valuation technique is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair 
value measurement, which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the 
measurement date. 

The valuation techniques include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially 
the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option-adjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation and may include a 
number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates. Changes in assumptions relating to these 
variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these financial investments. Details of the financial 
investments classified as ‘level 3’ to which valuation techniques are applied, and the sensitivity of profit before tax to a change in 
these items’ valuation, are presented in Note 31.

1.5.6 Fee Income
Revenue arising from contracts with customers consists of investment management and performance fee income from the Group's 
asset management business, investment contracts without DPF, platform fee and other fees and commissions.

Management fee income is based on investment assets under management and is only recognised when the Group satisfies its 
performance obligation to provide the asset management services. It is recognised in the year in which the services are rendered 
and is recognised net of rebates. Since the asset management service the Group provides is a continuous service, it satisfies its 
performance obligation over time. Therefore, the Group meets the criteria for its revenue to be recognised over time as the client 
benefits from the asset management services received from the Group. 

Performance fee income is based on the achievement of prescribed performance hurdles. It is only recognised when the 
performance obligations are satisfied or upon the crystallisation event occurring and when it is highly probable that a significant 
reversal will not occur.

Fees from investment contracts without DPF are recognised over time as the services are provided, which is the point at which the 
cash is received. Other fees and commissions such as from the provision of financial advice to customers are recognised when 
performance obligations are satisfied or upon the crystallisation of an event. The price is determined based on the agreed initial or 
ongoing adviser charge.

Platform fees are recognised as the related services are provided to the customer.

No significant judgements are applied on the timing or transaction price or the determination of the costs incurred to obtain or fulfil 
a contract.

1.5.7 Investment return
Investment return included in the consolidated income statement comprises interest income, rental income, dividends, foreign 
exchange gains and losses, realised and unrealised gains and losses on investments designated as FVTPL, and realised gains and 
losses (including impairment) on items held at amortised cost. Interest income is recognised as it accrues on an effective interest 
basis. Dividends on equity securities are recognised on the ex-dividend date and rental income is recognised on an accruals basis.

1.5.8 Derivatives and hedge accounting
The primary areas of the Group’s operations where derivative instruments are held are in the With-Profits Fund and annuity 
business. Management designates derivatives on inception and those that are not designated as hedging instruments are carried 
at fair value, with movements in fair value being recorded within investment return in the consolidated income statement.

The Group does not regularly seek to apply fair value or cash flow hedging treatment under IFRS 9 and has had no fair value or 
cash flow hedges for the years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.

1.5.9 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
The Group’s policy is to derecognise financial assets when it is deemed that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
have been transferred. Gains and losses on disposal are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset, and are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 

The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has 
expired.

1.5.10 Securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements
The Group is party to various securities-lending agreements and repurchase agreements under which securities are transferred to 
third parties on a short-term basis. The transferred securities are not derecognised; rather, they continue to be recognised within 
the appropriate investment classification. The Group’s policy is that collateral in excess of 100% of the fair value of securities 
loaned is required from all securities’ borrowers and typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities or letters of credit.

In cases where the Group takes possession of the collateral under its securities lending programme, including cash collateral which 
is not legally separated from the Group, the collateral and corresponding obligation to return such collateral is recognised as a 
financial liability on the consolidated statement of financial position. 

The Group is also party to various reverse repurchase agreements under which securities are purchased from third parties with an 
obligation to resell the securities. The securities are not recognised as investments on the consolidated statement of financial 
position. The right to receive the return of any cash paid as purchase consideration plus interest is recognised as a financial asset 
on the consolidated statement of financial position.

1.5.11 Subordinated liabilities and other borrowings
Subordinated liabilities include loan notes issued by the Group which are classified as financial liabilities as they have a fixed 
repayment date and do not represent a residual interest in the net assets of the Company on liquidation. The notes rank junior to all 
other liabilities of the Group in the event of liquidation, but above share capital.

Borrowings include operational borrowings attributable to shareholder-financed operations and other borrowings attributable to 
the With-Profits Fund.

Subordinated liabilities and other borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs. Borrowings, excluding 
those backing buy-to-let mortgages, which are managed on a fair value basis and designated at FVTPL, are subsequently 
accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method. Under the effective interest method, the difference 
between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds (net of related issue costs) is amortised through the 
consolidated income statement to the date of maturity, or for hybrid debt, over the expected life of the instrument.

Borrowings backing buy-to-let mortgages are designated at FVTPL in line with the underlying loan assets.

1.5.12 Investment property
Investments in leasehold and freehold properties not for occupation by the Group, including properties under development for 
future use as investment property, are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the consolidated income 
statement. Properties are valued annually either by the Group’s qualified surveyors or by taking into consideration the advice of 
professional external valuers using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' (RICS) valuation standards. Each property is 
externally valued at least once every three years. 

1.5.13 Defined benefit pension schemes
For the Group’s defined benefit schemes, if the present value of the defined benefit obligation for the relevant scheme exceeds the 
fair value of the scheme assets, then a liability is recorded on the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position in respect of 
that scheme. By contrast, if the fair value of the assets of the relevant scheme exceeds the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation then the surplus in respect of that scheme will only be recognised if the nature of the arrangements under the trust 
deed, and funding arrangements between the Trustee and the employing entity, support the availability of refunds or recoverability 
through agreed reductions in future contributions. In addition, if there is a constructive obligation for the employing entity to pay 
deficit funding in respect of schemes where there is no unconditional right to a refund to any surplus, this is also recognised such 
that the financial position recorded for the scheme reflects the higher of any underlying IAS 19 Employee Benefits deficit and the 
obligation for deficit funding.

The Group utilises the projected unit credit method to calculate the defined benefit obligation. This method sees each year of 
service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation. 
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a high-quality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in 
duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine its present value. These calculations 
are performed by independent actuaries.

1.5.13 Defined benefit pension schemes (continued)
The plan assets of the Group’s pension schemes may include several insurance contracts that have been issued by other entities in 
the Group. These assets are excluded from plan assets in determining the pension surplus or deficit recognised on the 
consolidated statement of financial position. The plan assets also exclude any reimbursement right assets resulting from buy-in of 
the scheme liabilities from other entities in the Group. The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently 
employed personnel, and the net interest on the net defined benefit obligation at the start of the year, is charged to the 
consolidated income statement. Actuarial and other gains and losses as a result of changes in assumptions or experience 
variances are recognised as other comprehensive income. 

Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution pension schemes are expensed when due.

1.5.14 Tax 
The Group applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income. Income tax comprises current tax and deferred tax. 
Income tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is recognised in the same statement as the related item appears. 

Current tax expense is charged or credited based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable 
amounts for the current year and adjustments made in relation to prior years. Income tax recoverable on tax allowable losses is 
recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offsetting against taxable profits arising in 
the current or prior periods. Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date.

Deferred taxes are provided under the liability method for all relevant temporary differences. IAS 12 Income Taxes does not require 
all temporary differences to be provided for, in particular, the Group does not provide for deferred tax on undistributed earnings of 
subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution and the temporary difference created is not expected 
to reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is also not recognised on temporary differences that arise from initial recognition 
of an asset or a liability in a transaction (other than a business combination) that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused 
tax losses can be utilised.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, 
based on tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.

The total tax recorded in the consolidated income statement includes tax attributable to both policyholders and shareholders. The 
tax attributable to policyholders comprises the tax on the income of the consolidated with-profits and unit-linked funds. In certain 
jurisdictions, such as the UK, life insurance companies are taxed on both their shareholders’ profits and on their policyholders’ 
investment returns on certain insurance and investment products. Although both types of tax are included in the total tax charge in 
the Group’s consolidated income statement, they are presented separately in the consolidated income statement to provide the 
most relevant information about tax that the Group pays on its profits. 

The Group is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the total tax charge inherently involves a degree of 
estimation and judgement. The positions taken in tax returns, where applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation, are 
recognised in full in the determination of the tax charge in the financial statements if the Group considers that it is probable that the 
taxation authority will accept those positions. Otherwise, the Group considers an uncertain tax position to exist and a provision is 
recognised to reflect that a taxation authority, upon review of the positions, could alter the tax returns. From recognition, the 
provision is measured based on management’s judgement and estimate of the likely amount of the liability, or recovery by 
providing for the single best estimate of the most likely outcome or the weighted average expected value where there are multiple 
possible outcomes, taking into account external advice where appropriate. Each uncertain tax treatment is considered separately 
or together as a group, depending on management’s judgement as to which approach better predicts the resolution of the 
uncertainty. It is assumed that tax authorities will examine the uncertain tax treatments and they have full knowledge of all related 
information. The judgements and estimates made to recognise and measure the effect of uncertain tax positions are reassessed 
whenever circumstances change or when there is new information that affects those judgements.

The judgements and estimates made to recognise and measure the effect of uncertain tax positions are reassessed whenever 
circumstances change or when there is new information that affects those judgements.

1.5.15 Goodwill
Goodwill arises when the Group acquires a business and the fair value consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets 
acquired. Goodwill arising on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses is capitalised and carried on the consolidated statement 
of financial position at initial value less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill impairment testing is conducted annually and 
when there is an indication of impairment. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a group of cash-
generating units. Goodwill impairment charges are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

1.5.16 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are measured at fair value on acquisition. Separately acquired intangible 
assets such as licences and software, are recognised at the price paid to acquire them. Intangible assets arising from development 
costs are capitalised when it has been established that the project is technically and financially feasible and the Group has both the 
intention and ability to use the completed asset.

Intangible assets are subsequently carried at cost less amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 

Intangible assets are amortised on a basis to reflect the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be 
consumed by reference to new business production levels unless the pattern cannot be determined reliably, in which case a 
straight-line method is applied. Impairment testing is conducted when there is an indication of impairment. If an impairment has 
occurred, an impairment charge is recognised for the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount of the asset. 
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is calculated as the present value 
of future expected cash flows from the asset, cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units to which it is allocated.

Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets is charged to the consolidated income statement. 

1.5.17 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks, debt securities and money market 
funds with less than 90 days' maturity from the date of acquisition.

1.5.18 Dividends
Dividends are recognised when the obligation becomes certain, ie when the dividend is no longer at the discretion of the Company. 
In the case of interim dividends, this occurs when the dividends are paid. For final dividends, this occurs when they are 
recommended by the Board and approved by shareholders.

1.5.19 Share capital and share premium
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group, after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Shares are classified as equity when their terms do not create an obligation to transfer assets. The nominal value of shares issued 
is recorded in share capital.

Where the consideration received from the issue or sale of existing shares exceeds the nominal value recorded in share capital, the 
difference is recorded in share premium. Share premium is recorded net of share issue costs. 

1.5.20 Treasury shares
Where any of the Group entities purchase the Company’s share capital, the consideration paid, including any attributable 
transaction costs, is shown as a deduction from total shareholders’ equity. Any gains and losses arising on treasury shares are 
included within equity.

1.5.21 Merger reserve
The merger reserve arises from the application of merger accounting principles to acquisitions of entities under common control. It 
represents the difference between the aggregate capital reserves and value of the entities acquired, which is recognised directly in 
equity. On disposal of the relevant entity, the related merger reserve is released directly to retained earnings.

1.5.22 Share-based payments
All share-based payments made to employees for services rendered are measured based on the fair value of the equity instrument 
granted. The fair value takes into account the impact of market-based vesting conditions and non-vesting conditions, but excludes 
any impact of non-market-based vesting conditions. The related share-based payment expense is recognised over the vesting 
period. The fair value is determined using an option pricing model such as Black-Scholes or a Monte Carlo simulation where 
appropriate, taking into account the terms and conditions of the award. 

For equity-settled share-based payments, the fair value of service rendered is based on the fair value of the equity instrument at 
grant date, which is not remeasured subsequently. The share-based payment expense is recognised over the vesting period and is 
based on the number of equity instruments expected to vest, with the corresponding entry to equity.

For cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of service rendered is based on the fair value of the liability related to the 
equity instrument granted. The fair value of the equity instrument granted is remeasured at each reporting date with any changes 
recognised in the share-based payment expense in the consolidated income statement for the period.

A cancellation of an award without the grant of a replacement equity instrument is accounted for as an acceleration of vesting. 
Accordingly, any share-based expense that would have been recognised over the remaining vesting period is recognised immediately.

Where replacement equity instruments are granted to employees in place of the cancelled equity instruments, the replacement 
award is treated as a modification of the original award. At the point of replacement, the awards are remeasured to the fair value at 
the date of replacement, which forms the basis of recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period.

On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the consolidated income statement and the actual cost to 
the Group is transferred to retained earnings.

1.5.23 Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding, excluding treasury shares and shares held by the employee benefit trust.

Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares, excluding treasury shares and shares held by the employee benefit trust, adjusted to take into account 
the effect of any dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group’s only class of potentially dilutive ordinary shares are share options 
and awards granted to employees. Potential ordinary shares are treated as dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares 
results in a decrease in EPS. 

1.5.24 Foreign exchange
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in million pounds sterling, the Group’s presentation currency. 
Accordingly, the results and financial position of foreign subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Group 
from their functional currencies. All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are converted at year-end exchange rates while all 
income and expenses are converted at average exchange rates where this is a reasonable approximation of the rates prevailing on 
transaction dates. 

Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the spot exchange rate for the functional currency at the 
reporting date. Changes resulting from exchange rates are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currencies at the spot rate prevailing on the date of transactions. 

Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency 
at the spot exchange rate at the date on which the fair value is determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to 
other reserves within equity. On disposal of the foreign subsidiary, the related exchange differences are transferred out of this 
reserve and are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 

The income statements and cash flows, and statements of financial position of Group entities that have a different functional 
currency from the Group's presentation currency, have been translated using the following principal exchange rates.

1.5.25 Leases 
The Group leases office property to conduct its business. At the inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, 
or contains, a lease. In simple terms this applies if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period 
of time in exchange for consideration. At inception, the Group allocates the consideration in a contract to each lease component. 
However, for the leases of land and buildings, in which the Group acts as lessee, the Group has elected to account for the lease and 
non-lease components as a single lease component. 

Where the Group acts as a lessee, it recognises a 'right of use' asset and a corresponding lease liability, representing the obligation 
to make lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Group applies the cost model to the right of use assets, except for 
those that meet the definition of an investment property, to which the fair value model is applied.

The asset is initially measured at cost which comprises the amount of the lease liability, and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date, any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of the costs related to the dilapidation of the asset that 
would be incurred, less any lease incentives received. Subsequently, the asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from 
the commencement date to the earlier of (i) the end of the right of use asset’s useful life and (ii) the end of the lease term. 

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments that are not yet paid at the commencement date, 
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s own incremental 
borrowing rate. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. From time to 
time, the lease liability is re-measured where there is a change in future lease payments for example, where the Group reassesses 
whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. Where this happens, a corresponding adjustment is made to 
the carrying amount of the right of use asset or an amount is recognised in the consolidated income statement if the carrying 
amount of the right of use asset has been reduced to zero.

The Group presents the right of use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in ‘Property, plant and 
equipment’ on the consolidated statement of financial position. The corresponding lease liabilities are presented in ‘lease liabilities’. 

Where the Group acts as lessor, it classifies and accounts for its leases as operating or finance leases. Where the Group acts as an 
intermediate lessor, as it does with some of its property leases, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease 
separately. The Group assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right of use asset arising from the head 
lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. Where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the 
lessee, the Group recognises a receivable asset on the consolidated statement of financial position, equal to the present value of 
the lease payments, within 'Accrued investment income and other debtors'. The Group recognises finance income over the lease 
term to reflect the rate of return on the net investment in the lease, within 'Other income'. The Group recognises lease payments 
received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of 'Investment return'. 

1.5.26 Property, plant and equipment (PPE) 
PPE includes Group occupied properties and other tangible assets, such as computer equipment, motor vehicles, leasehold 
improvements and fixtures and fittings. PPE including owner-occupied property is measured at cost, which represents the original 
purchase price less any expenses incurred in bringing it to its working conditions, and subsequently measured using the cost 
model.

Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful lives* as 
follows:

Type of asset

Group occupied property

Right of use asset 

Other tangible assets

Estimated useful life

20–50 years

2–50 years

2–40 years

*  Note that the useful lives stated are inclusive of PPE held by consolidated infrastructure private equity vehicles which typically have longer useful lives than 

other assets of the Group. 

Management determines useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired. The Group assesses the useful life, 
residual value and depreciation method for PPE on an annual basis and any adjustments are made where required. 

An impairment review of PPE is carried out whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. Management assesses impairment at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. 
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, which is the higher of the assets fair value 
less costs of disposal and value in use, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.

1.5.27 Assets and liabilities held for sale 
The Group classifies assets and liabilities as held for sale when the carrying amount is expected to be recovered through a sale 
transaction, usually within one year, and management is committed to the sale. 

Assets and liabilities held for sale are shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position and are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell. No depreciation or amortisation is charged on an asset which is 
classified as held for sale. 

When the Group is committed to a sale of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale 
when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group retains a non-controlling interest in its former 
subsidiary after the sale.

Income and expenses of subsidiaries sold during the year are included in the consolidated income statement up to the date of 
disposal. The gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between sale proceeds net of selling costs, less the net assets 
of the entity at the date of disposal, adjusted for foreign exchange movements attaching to the sold entity that are required to be 
recycled to the consolidated income statement under IAS 21 'The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates'.

1.5.28 Provisions and contingent assets and liabilities
Provisions are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation resulting from a past event, it is more probable than not that a loss will be made in settling the obligation and the 
amounts can be estimated reliably.

Provisions are measured based on management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the 
reporting date. Provisions are discounted and represent the present value of the expected expenditure where the effect of the 
time value of money is material. 

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations of the Group where the timing and amount are subject to significant uncertainty. 
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, unless they are assumed by the Group 
as part of a business combination. Contingent liabilities are however disclosed, unless they are considered to be remote. If a 
contingent liability becomes probable and the amount can be reliably measured, it is no longer treated as contingent and 
recognised as a liability. 

Contingent assets which are possible benefits to the Group are only disclosed if it is probable that the Group will receive the 
benefit. Mirroring the treatment of contingent liabilities, if such a benefit becomes virtually certain, it is no longer considered 
contingent and is recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position as an asset.

My Continuum Financial Limited acquisition
On 8 March 2023, M&G Wealth Advice Limited (MGWAL), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired a 49.9% holding in My 
Continuum Financial Limited (MCFL), the holding company of Continuum (Financial Services) LLP (CFSL) and My Continuum 
Wealth (MCW), collectively referred to as 'Continuum', for a purchase consideration of £22m, including an adjustment for capital. 
The Group acquired a further 25.05% stake on 19 March 2024, with a view to acquiring the remaining stake in March 2025 (see 
Note 38 for further details).

Continuum is now part of M&G Wealth within our Wealth segment and brings to M&G a fast-growing in-house discretionary Model 
Portfolio Service as its central investment offering allowing M&G to further grow and build our advisory capability across the UK, 
and to provide a wider range of investment solutions to more clients. Continuum is based in Plymouth and has more than 60 self-
employed advisers operating nationally.

The acquisition of the initial stake in Continuum has been treated as an investment in an associate accounted for under the equity 
method in the consolidated statement of financial position for the year ended 31 December 2023.

2.3 Insurance and investment contracts written by the Group’s insurance entities

A description of the main contract types written by the Group’s insurance entities is provided below. 

The Group’s with-profits contracts are written in the With-Profits Fund in which policyholders share in the profit of the fund. Up 
until 1 April 2021 there were three with-profits sub-funds: the With-Profits Sub-Fund (WPSF), the Defined Charge Participating 
Sub-Fund (DCPSF) and the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund (SAIF). On 1 April 2021 SAIF merged with the WPSF and the assets 
and liabilities of SAIF were combined with those of the WPSF.

Shareholder-backed business represents all insurance and investment contracts in the Group other than contracts written in the 
With-Profits Fund. The profit on these contracts accrues directly to the Group's shareholders. 

2.3.1 With-profits contracts 
With-profits contracts provide returns to policyholders through bonuses that are smoothed to reduce the impact of volatility of the 
investment performance of the assets in the fund. 

2.3.1.1 Conventional and accumulating with-profits contracts written in WPSF and DCPSF
Conventional and accumulating with-profits policyholders receive their share of profit by way of regular and final bonuses. 

Regular bonus rates are determined for each type of policy primarily by targeting the bonus level at a prudent proportion of the 
long-term expected future investment return on underlying assets, reduced as appropriate for each type of policy to allow for items 
such as expenses, charges, tax and shareholder transfers.

In normal investment conditions, the Group expects changes in regular bonus rates to be gradual over time. However, the Group 
retains the discretion whether or not to declare a regular bonus each year, and there is no limit on the amount by which regular 
bonus rates can change. 

A final bonus, which is normally declared annually, may be added when a claim is paid. The rates of final bonus usually vary by type 
of policy and by reference to the period, usually a year, in which the policy commences or each premium is paid. These rates are 
determined by reference to the asset shares of representative sample policies and are subject to smoothing. 

Regular bonuses are typically declared once a year, and once credited are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the 
particular product. Final bonus rates are guaranteed only until the next bonus declaration. 

Contracts are predominantly written in the WPSF, where the shareholders are entitled to an amount up to one-ninth of the bonus 
declared, which is payable as a cash transfer from the With-Profits Fund. 

For the business written in the DCPSF, the charges accrue to shareholders who also meet the corresponding expenses. Profits 
arising in the DCPSF are attributed wholly to DCPSF policyholders. The shareholders’ profit arises as the difference between 
charges and expenses.

2.3 Insurance and investment contracts written by the Group’s insurance entities (continued)

2.3.1 With-profits contracts (continued)
2.3.1.2 With-profits contracts with a PruFund investment option ('PruFund contracts')
These are a range of with-profits contracts offering policyholders a choice of investment profiles (PruFund funds). Unlike the with-
profits contracts described above, no regular or final bonuses are declared. Instead, policyholders participate in profits by means of 
an increase in their investment, which grows in line with an Expected Growth Rate (EGR). The EGR is adjusted for significant 
market movements. 

The EGR may be applied for each of the different PruFund funds within the range, varying depending on the individual asset mix of 
that fund. The applicable EGR, net of the relevant charges, is applied to calculate the ‘smoothed unit value’ of policyholder funds. 
The EGRs are reviewed and updated quarterly, with the smoothed unit value calculated daily. In normal investment conditions, the 
EGR is expected to reflect the Prudential Assurance Company's (PAC) view of how the funds will perform over the longer term. 

Policyholders are protected from some of the extreme short-term ups and downs of direct investments by using an established 
smoothing process. Prescribed adjustments are made to the smoothed unit value if it moves outside a specified range relative to 
the value of the underlying assets. 

PruFund contracts are predominantly written in the WPSF, where the shareholder is entitled to an amount up to one-ninth of the 
difference between the smoothed unit value on withdrawal and the initial investment. The DCPSF also contains PruFund contracts, 
and for these contracts the shareholders receive profits or losses arising from the difference between the charges and expenses 
on this business.

2.3.1.3 SAIF with-profits contracts
SAIF was a ring-fenced with-profits sub-fund which merged with the WPSF on 1 April 2021. No new business was written in SAIF, 
although regular premiums and top-ups were still being collected on in-force policies. The fund was solely for the benefit of 
policyholders of SAIF. Shareholders had no entitlement to a proportion of the bonuses declared and this remains the case post-
merger with the WPSF. The process of determining policyholder bonuses of SAIF with-profits policies was similar to that for the 
with-profits policies of the WPSF. In addition, the surplus assets in SAIF were allocated to policies in an orderly and equitable 
distribution over time as enhancements to policyholder benefits. 

The Group’s main exposure to guaranteed annuity options arises through contracts in SAIF. More detail on the provisions held in 
respect of guaranteed annuity options is provided in Note 24.1.3.

2.3.2 Unit-linked contracts
Unit-linked contracts are contracts where the value of the policy is linked to the value of underlying investments (such as collective 
investment schemes, internal investment pools or other property) or fluctuations in the value of underlying investments or indices. 
Investment risk associated with the product is primarily borne by the policyholder. Some unit-linked contracts provide an element 
of insurance coverage, such as a benefit payable on death in excess of the value of the units, and these contracts are classified as 
insurance contracts and accounted for under IFRS 17 (see Note 24.1.4).

Charges are deducted from the unit-linked funds for investment and administration services and, for certain contracts, insurance 
coverage. Benefits payable will depend on the price of the units prevailing at the time of surrender, death or the maturity of the 
product.

2.3.3 Annuities
Annuities are contracts which offer policyholders a regular income over the policyholder’s life, in exchange for an upfront premium, 
and may be immediate or deferred. For immediate annuities, the regular income starts immediately after the premium payment 
but, for deferred annuities, the regular income is delayed until a specified date in the future. There are various types of annuity 
contracts written across the Group: level, fixed increase, inflation-linked (all referred to as 'non-profit annuities') and with-profits 
annuities. 

– Level annuities: provide a regular (for example, monthly) fixed annuity payment over the policyholder’s life.

– Fixed increase annuities: provide a regular annuity payment which incorporates automatic increases in annuity payments by 

either fixed percentages or fixed amounts over the policyholder’s life.

– Inflation-linked annuities: provide a regular annuity payment to which an additional amount is added periodically based on the 

increase in an inflation index. 

– With-profits annuities: are written in the With-Profits Fund. These combine the income features of annuity contracts with the 

investment smoothing features of with-profits products and enable policyholders to obtain exposure to investment returns on 
the With-Profits Fund.

During the year, the Group has also re-entered the bulk purchase annuity market where it has transacted with certain pension 
schemes to secure the annuitant benefits of the immediate and deferred members. In addition, some non-profit annuities have 
been written in the With-Profits Fund, and profits relating to this business accrue to the With-Profits Fund.

3 Segmental analysis
The Group’s operating segments are defined and presented in accordance with IFRS 8: Operating Segments on the basis of the 
Group’s management reporting structure and its financial management information. The Group’s primary reporting format is by 
product type. The Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Group is the Group Executive Committee.

The Group’s operating segments have been revised during the year to reflect a change in management structure. Our previous 
operating segment, 'Retail and Savings' has been replaced with two new operating segments: 'Life' and 'Wealth'. Comparatives for 
2022 are re-presented on the new segment basis.

3.1 Operating segments 

The Group’s operating segments are:

Asset Management
The Group's investment management capability is offered to both wholesale and institutional clients. The Group's wholesale clients 
invest through either UK domiciled OEICs or Luxembourg domiciled SICAVs and have access to a broad range of actively managed 
investment products, including Equities, Fixed Income, Multi-Asset and Real Estate. The Group serves these clients through its 
many business-to-business relationships both in the UK and overseas, which include independent financial advisers, high-street 
banks and wealth managers. The Group's institutional investors, include pension funds, insurance companies and banks from 
around the world, who invest through segregated mandates and pooled funds into a diverse range of Fixed Income and Real Estate 
investment products and services. 

The Asset Management segment generates revenues by charging fees which are typically based on the level of assets under 
management. The Asset Management segment also earns investment management revenues from the management of a 
significant proportion of Life and Wealth assets it manages.

Life
The Life business operates in the savings and pensions market and includes corporate risk, individual and international solutions. 
The majority of the products in the Life business are closed to new customers but may accept further contributions from existing 
policyholdersi. During the year, the Life business re-entered the bulk purchase annuity market and transacted with certain 
schemes to secure the annuity benefits of immediate and deferred annuity members. The bulk purchase annuities, along with 
workplace pensions make up our corporate risk solutions.

Individual products include annuity contracts: level annuities, which provide a fixed annuity payment; fixed increase annuities, 
which incorporate a periodic automatic fixed increase in annuity payments; and inflation-linked annuities, which incorporate a 
periodic increase based on a defined inflation index. Some inflation-linked annuities have minimum and/or maximum increases 
relative to the corresponding inflation index. The life products are primarily whole of life assurance, endowment assurances, term 
assurance contracts, lifetime mortgages, income protection, and critical illness products. Investment products include unit-linked 
contracts and the Prudential bond offering, which mainly consists of single-premium-invested whole of life policies, where the 
client has the option of taking ad hoc withdrawals, regular income or the option of fully surrendering their bond.

International solutions include our savings businesses based in Ireland (Prudential International Assurance plc) and Poland. The 
Group's products which give non-UK clients access to the PruFund investment proposition are also included. 

Some of the Group's products written through conventional and accumulating with-profits contracts, in the PAC with-profits sub-
funds, provide returns to policyholders through ‘regular’ and ‘final’ bonuses that reflect a smoothed investment return.

Wealth
M&G Wealth provides access to a range of retirement, savings and investment management solutions to its clients. These 
products are distributed to clients through the wrap platform, intermediaries and advisers, and include the Retirement Account (a 
combined individual pension and income drawdown product), individual pensions, ISAs, collective investments and a range of on-
shore and off-shore bonds. 

All of the Group's products that give access to the UK PruFund investment proposition are included in M&G Wealth. The UK 
PruFund investment proposition gives customers access to savings contracts with smoothed investment returns and a wide 
choice of investment profiles. Unlike the conventional and accumulating with-profits contracts in the Life business, no regular or 
final bonuses are declared. Instead, policyholders participate in profits by means of an increase in their investment, which grows in 
line with an expected growth rate.

The Group's other reportable segment is:

Corporate Centre
Corporate Centre includes central corporate costs and debt costs.

i

The Group accepts new members to existing Corporate Pension schemes and writes a small number of new annuity policies with customers who have a 
pension issued by PAC.

3.2 Adjusted operating profit before tax methodology

Adjusted operating profit before tax is the Group’s non-GAAP alternative performance measure, which complements IFRS GAAP 
measures and is key to decision-making and the internal performance management of operating segments.

The Group’s adjusted operating profit before tax methodology has been updated since it was disclosed in the 2022 consolidated 
financial statements following the adoption of IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ (as first reported in the interim reporting for the six 
months ended 30 June 2023). Where relevant, the principles used to derive adjusted operating profit before tax remain consistent 
with IFRS 4. Other changes to the methodology have also been made to exclude from adjusted operating profit the foreign 
exchange movements on non-GBP denominated subordinated debt and the fair value movement on strategic investments since 
these movements reflect short-term fluctuations in investment return (again, first reported in the interim reporting for the six 
months ended 30 June 2023). Details of the methodology are presented below:

Fee based business
For the Group's fee based business written by Asset Management, Life and Wealth segments, adjusted operating profit before tax 
includes fees received from clients and operating costs for the business including overheads, expenses required to meet 
regulatory requirements and regular business development/restructuring and other costs. Costs associated with fundamental 
Group-wide restructuring and transformation are not included in adjusted operating profit before tax.

Business written in the With-Profits Fund
For the Group’s business written in the With-Profits Fund in the Life and Wealth segments, adjusted operating profit before tax 
includes the release of the risk adjustment and the expected release of the CSM for the period. The expected CSM release for the 
period is calculated as the CSM at the start of the period updated to reflect long-term expected investment returns multiplied by 
the expected amortisation factor for the period.

– The long-term expected investment returns are calculated on the assumption of real-world investment returns, which are 

determined by reference to the risk-free rate plus a risk premium based on the mix of assets held to back the asset shares. In the 
calculation of the expected CSM release for with-profits business, the long-term expected investment returns for the year ended 
31 December 2023 were 8.5% p.a. (4.8% p.a. for the year ended 31 December 2022).

– The expected amortisation factor for the period reflects the expected pattern of release of the CSM for the with-profits business 
over the life of the contracts. The expected amortisation factor used for the year ended 31 December 2023 was 12.7% p.a. (11.9% 
p.a. for the year ended 31 December 2022).

Adjusted operating profit before tax for the Group’s business written in the With-Profits Fund also includes the expected 
investment return for the shareholder’s share of the IFRS value of the excess assets in the Fund. For the year ended 31 December 
2023, the return was 6.0% p.a. (2.4% p.a. for the year ended 31 December 2022).

Adjusted operating profit does not include the impact of any margins on investment management fee earned by other Group 
entities. These are recognised in the Asset Management segment as they emerge.

The application of IFRS 17 to non-profit contracts in the with-profits funds results in a mismatch due to the difference between 
their value under the IFRS 17 General Measurement Model accounting for these contracts (primarily annuities) and how these 
contracts are treated in determining their fair value when assessing current and future with-profits contracts under the Variable 
Fee Approach (VFA). Although the impact of this mismatch balances over the life of the current and future with-profit contracts as 
the CSM under the VFA is set up and released, results for the period do not reflect the long-term economics of the transaction. 
Therefore, the impact of the mismatch has been excluded from adjusted operating profit before tax.

Shareholder annuity business
For the Group's shareholder annuity products written by the Life segment, adjusted operating profit before tax includes the release 
of the CSM and the risk adjustment for the period. Adjusted operating profit before tax also includes the returns on surplus assets 
in excess of IFRS 17 liabilities based on long-term expected investment returns, which are determined by reference to the risk-free 
rate plus a risk premium based on the mix of assets. For the year ended 31 December 2023 the long-term expected investment 
returns for shareholder annuities were 6.6% p.a. (2.2% p.a. for the year ended 31 December 2022). The net effect of changes to the 
valuation rate of interest due to asset trading and portfolio rebalancing, and experience variances are also included in adjusted 
operating profit before tax.

The results of the intercompany buy-in transaction executed between the trustees of M&G Group Pension Pension Scheme 
(M&GGPS) and PAC in 2023 are included in adjusted operating profit before tax as this generates economic value for the Group. 

Adjusted operating profit before tax for shareholder annuities excludes the impact of the mismatch resulting from the 
measurement of fulfilment cash flows using current interest rates and any changes to CSM being measured using locked-in rates. 

Corporate Centre
For the Corporate Centre adjusted operating profit before tax is the expense incurred to run the head office and the actual 
investment return on treasury activities.

3.2 Adjusted operating profit before tax methodology (continued)

Key adjusting items between IFRS profit before tax and adjusted operating profit before tax
Certain adjustments that are considered to be non-recurring or strategic, or due to short-term movements not reflective of longer-
term performance are made to IFRS profit or loss before tax to determine adjusted operating profit before tax. Adjustments are in 
respect of short-term fluctuations in investment returns, mismatches arising on the application of IFRS 17, impairment and 
amortisation in respect of acquired intangibles, costs associated with fundamental Group-wide restructuring and transformation, 
profit or loss arising on corporate transactions and profit or loss before tax from any discontinued operations.

Short-term fluctuations in investment returns
The adjustment for short-term fluctuations in investment returns represents:

– Difference between actual CSM release for the period and expected CSM release for the period for with-profit contracts; 

– Movements in the fair value of instruments held to mitigate equity risk in the future with-profits shareholder transfer and to 

optimise the Group’s capital position on a Solvency II basis;

– Difference between actual and long-term expected investment return on surplus assets backing the shareholder annuity capital 

and shareholders' share of excess assets in the With-Profits Fund measured on an IFRS basis;

– Foreign exchange movements on the US dollar subordinated debt held in the Corporate Centre;

– Fair value movements on strategic investments;

– Impact of short-term credit risk provisioning and experience variances on the measurement of best estimate liabilities, 

specifically:

– The impact of credit risk provisioning for short-term adverse credit risk experience;

– The impact of credit risk provisioning for actual upgrade and downgrade experience during the year. This is calculated by 

reference to current interest rates;

– Credit experience variance relative to long-term assumptions, reflecting the impact of defaults and other similar experience, 

such as asset exchanges arising from debt restructuring; and

– The impact of market movements on bond portfolio weightings and the subsequent impact on credit provisions.

Mismatches arising on the application of IFRS 17
The application of IFRS 17 results in the following mismatches in valuation basis being recognised in total profit/loss before tax. For 
the purposes of calculating adjusted operating profit before tax the impact of the mismatch has been excluded.

– Difference between the value under IFRS 17 General Measurement Model for non-profit contracts (primarily annuities) written in 
the With-Profits Fund and how these contracts are treated in determining their fair value when assessing current and future 
with-profits contracts under the VFA; and

– Mismatch resulting from measurement of fulfilment cash flows for shareholder non-profit business (primarily annuities) using 

current interest rates while related changes to the CSM are measured using locked-in rates.

Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (including goodwill) acquired in business combinations are excluded from 
adjusted operating profit before tax.

Profit/(loss) on disposal of businesses and corporate transactions
Certain additional items are excluded from adjusted operating profit before tax where those items are considered to be non-
recurring or strategic, or considered to be one-off, due to their size or nature, and therefore not indicative of the long-term 
operating performance of the Group, including profits or losses arising on corporate transactions and profits or losses on 
discontinued operations.

Restructuring costs and other
Restructuring costs and other primarily reflect the shareholder allocation of costs associated with the transformation of our 
business. These costs represent fundamental Group-wide restructuring and transformation and are therefore excluded from 
adjusted operating profit before tax.

This also includes the elimination on consolidation of the results of the intercompany buy-in transaction executed between the 
trustees of M&G Group Pension Pension Scheme (M&GGPS) and PAC in 2023.

3.3 Analysis of Group adjusted operating profit before tax by segment 

On 1 January 2023 we adopted the new accounting standard IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts which has led to changes to our 
adjusted operating profit methodology. As a result, adjusted operating profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2022 has 
been restated from that reported previously. The restatement is driven by the change in profit recognition profile of the annuities 
and with-profits business in the Life and Wealth segments as a result of the new insurance standard and also other changes to our 
adjusted operating profit methodology, unrelated to the adoption of IFRS 17, which were implemented at the same time. These 
unrelated changes to our adjusted operating methodology are to classify foreign exchange movements on non-GBP denominated 
subordinated debt and fair value movements on strategic investments as non-operating items.

The overall impact of the restatement on adjusted operating profit before tax is summarised in the table below for the year ended 
31 December 2022:

ii  Market conditions have led to lower losses from short-term fluctuations in investment returns in the current period with the impact of rising rates for the 

year ended 31 December 2023 not being as significant as the year to 31 December 2022. The overall losses primarily comprise of a £4m gain (2022: £989m 
loss) on interest rate swaps purchased to protect PAC's Solvency II capital position against falls in interest rates and £159m loss (2022: £1,301m loss) from 
the difference in actual and long-term expected investment return on surplus assets backing the annuity portfolio, both of which have significantly 
improved due to the smaller increase in yields in 2023 compared to 2022. There were also losses of £123m (2022: £104m gain) on the hedging instruments 
held to protect the Solvency II capital position from falling equity markets, which moved to a loss as a result of increases in US and European equity 
markets.

iii  Restructuring costs and other excluded from adjusted operating profit includes costs that relate to the transformation of our business which are allocated 

to the shareholder. These differ to Restructuring costs incurred in the analysis of administrative and other expenses in Note 7 which include costs 
allocated to the Policyholder. In the year ended 31 December 2023 restructuring costs and other include £73m (2022: £48m) in relation to operational 
transformation, £30m (2022: £36m) in respect of investment spend in building out capability in our Asset Management business, and £19m (2022: £32m) in 
respect of the development of the M&G Wealth platform business.

Following a review of the Group's presentation of policyholder tax, comparatives for 31 December 2022 have been restated from those previously reported 
in the 2023 interim financial statements.

The Asset Management segmented fee income differs from the fee income in Note 6 due to the netting of certain items that have no profit impact in 
adjusted operating profit. Asset management fee income includes net inter-segment fee income of £165m (2022: £164m).

The Group has a widely diversified client base. There are no clients whose revenue represents greater than 10% of fee income.

plant and equipment, investment property, and investment in joint ventures and associates accounted for using the equity method.

Following a review of the Group's presentation of policyholder tax, comparatives for 31 December 2022 have been restated from those previously reported 
in the 2023 interim financial statements.

Insurance revenue is recognised as services under the group of insurance contracts are provided to policyholders at an amount 
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those services but excludes investment 
components.

The amount of CSM recognised in the profit or loss in the period is based on coverage units provided during the current period. 
The number of coverage units is the quantity of services provided by the contracts in the group, determined by considering for 
each contract the quantity of benefits provided and its expected coverage period.

Services provided to insurance contracts include insurance coverage and, for all direct participating contracts, investment services 
for managing underlying items on behalf of policyholders (investment-related services). In addition, insurance contracts without 
direct participation features may also provide investment services for generating an investment return for the policyholder 
(investment-return service). The number of coverage units is a quantification of services provided under the contracts in the group.

In relation to the business in scope of IFRS 17, the table above provides detail of the total investment income (income and gains) 
and detail of the resulting or corresponding changes in liabilities included in insurance and reinsurance finance income/(expenses). 

The key offsetting movements in liabilities are:

– the offsetting change in liabilities due to changes in the underlying items of contracts measured under the VFA;

– the offsetting changes in liabilities due to changes in interest rates and other financial assumptions; and

– the interest accreted to contracts measured under the GMM.

As a result, the overall net position reflects income and gains on surplus assets.

10.1.1 Allocation of profit/(loss) before tax and tax charge between equity holders and policyholders
The profit before tax reflected in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2023 of £749m (2022 
(Restated): £3,019m loss before tax) comprises profit attributable to equity holders and pre-tax profit attributable to policyholders 
of unit-linked and with-profits funds. This is the formal measure of profit before tax under IFRS but it is not the result attributable to 
equity holders. 

This is principally because the corporate taxes of the Group include those on the income of consolidated with-profits and unit-
linked funds that, through adjustments to benefits, are borne by policyholders. These amounts are required to be included in the 
tax charge of the Company under IAS 12. Consequently, this measure of profit before all taxes is not representative of pre-tax 
profits attributable to equity holders. 

The tax charge attributable to policyholder returns is removed from the Group’s total profit before tax in arriving at the Group’s 
profit before tax attributable to equity holders. As the net of tax profits attributable to policyholders is zero, the Group’s pre-tax 
profit attributable to policyholders is an amount equal and opposite to the tax charge attributable to policyholders included in the 
total tax (credit)/charge.

The equity holders impact of £15m credit (2022: £5m charge) relates to changes in estimates of prior year positions. The policyholders impact of £8m 
charge primarily also relates to changes in estimates of prior year positions (2022: £24m credit primarily due to changes in estimates to deferred tax assets 
due to agreement reached with HMRC to amend the application of income allocation methodology within the life insurance business).

vii Benefit arising on deferred tax movements in the period booked at the future rate of corporation tax in the UK of 25% compared to the current period rate 

of 19%.

The Group’s profits are taxed at different rates depending on the country or territory in which the profits arise. The key applicable 
tax rate for 2023 is the UK Corporation tax rate of 25% (effective from 1 April 2023) (2022: 19.0%) as the majority of the Group's 
profits are earned and taxed in the UK.

10.1.3 Factors that may impact the future tax rate
The majority of the Group’s profits are generated in the UK. Taking into account recurring tax adjusting items, the underlying effective 
tax rate for equity holders' portion of profits is expected to be marginally higher than the statutory rate in the UK of 25% (effective 
from 1 April 2023).

The Group has unused tax losses carried forward of £548m (2022: £481m), primarily UK capital losses, on which no deferred tax is 
recognised. Should appropriate capital gains arise in future periods it will result in tax benefits thereby reducing the future effective 
tax rate in the relevant periods.

During 2023, the UK Government, where the Parent Company is incorporated, enacted the Pillar Two income taxes legislation 
effective from 1 January 2024. Under the legislation, the Parent Company will be required to pay top-up tax on profits of its 
subsidiaries that are taxed at an effective tax rate of less than 15%. The Group’s taxable profits are predominantly in the UK and given 
the mainstream UK corporation tax rate is 25%, it is not expected that any material top-up tax will be required (see 'Independent 
auditors' report' for further details of materiality). The Group completed a high-level impact assessment which resulted in an expected 
immaterial Pillar Two top up tax. The Group is continuing to assess the impact of the Pillar Two income taxes legislation on its future 
financial performance. On 23 May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 ‘International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules’, 
which became effective immediately and were approved for adoption by the UK Endorsement Board on 19 July 2023. The Group has 
applied the IAS 12 exemption from recognising and disclosing information on associated deferred tax assets and liabilities.

10.1.4 Use of accounting estimates and judgements
The calculation of the Group's tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement. The two principal areas of judgement that 
could impact the reported tax position are the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and the level of provisioning for 
uncertain tax positions.

The recognition of a deferred tax asset relies on an assessment of the probability of future taxable profits, future reversals of existing 
taxable temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. 

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. In considering their recoverability, the Group assesses the likelihood of them 
being recovered within the expiry of losses and/or while operating as a going concern. This takes into account the future expected 
profit profile and business model of each relevant company or country, and any potential legislative restrictions on use. Short-term 
timing differences are generally recognised ahead of losses and other tax attributes as being likely to reverse more quickly.

The provisions for uncertain tax positions cover a wide range of issues, only a fraction of these are expected to be subject to challenge 
by a tax authority at any point in time. The Group engages constructively and transparently with tax authorities with a view to early 
resolution of uncertain tax matters. Estimated positions are based on the probability of potential challenge within certain jurisdictions 
and the possible outcome based on relevant facts and circumstances. The judgments and estimates made to recognise and measure 
the effect of uncertain tax positions are reassessed whenever circumstances change or when there is new information that affects 
those judgments.

Not withstanding any origination and reversal of temporary differences in the year, the Group does not consider there to be 
a significant risk of a material adjustment in the next financial year to the deferred and current tax balances from either recognition 
and measurement of deferred tax assets or the level of provisioning for uncertain tax positions.

10.2 Deferred tax

10.2.1 Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Under IAS12, deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability settled, based on tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting 
period. Deferred tax assets are recognised as recoverable to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it is regarded as 
probable there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be 
deducted or tax losses utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off and an 
intention to settle on a net basis.

10.2.2 Deferred tax in the statement of financial position
The table below shows movements on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year. The amounts are different from those 
disclosed on the balance sheet as the below amounts presented before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal 
right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.

Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. On 10 June 2021, the UK Government’s 
proposal to increase the rate of UK corporation tax from 19% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023 was enacted into UK law. In line 
with the changes to the UK rate of corporation tax, the carrying values of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued in 
2022, the impact of which was limited primarily due to the majority of the UK deferred tax balances being measured at a 
policyholder rate of tax which remains unaffected.

The comparative amounts have been restated for the first time adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9. See Note 1.2.1 for further information.

Deferred tax on unrealised gains/(losses) on investments primarily arise on two key components. The largest component relates to gains/(losses) on 
certain investments which are only taxed when realised, ie when an asset is sold. The second component relates to gains/(losses) on certain investments 
held by life insurance companies, which for UK corporation tax purposes are deemed to have been disposed of and immediately reacquired at market 
value at the end of each accounting period. Any gain/(loss) arising on the deemed disposal is required to be spread over a seven year period.

The UK Government made substantial changes to the rules relating to the taxation of life insurance companies which applied from 1 January 2013. A net 
deferred tax liability was recognised for the temporary difference that arose on the transition to the new regime. The deferred tax balances were fully 
reversed at 31 December 2022.

The closing balance at 31 December 2023 primarily comprises £77m (2022: £83m) of deferred tax assets on subordinated debt together with a £27m 
(2022: £33m) of deferred tax liability in relation to customer related intangible assets arising on acquisitions of MGSA, Sandringham & responsAbility. 
The remaining balance primarily relates to deferred tax assets on employee related compensation. 

The Group incurs various incremental, directly attributable acquisition costs in obtaining new contracts. For UK corporation tax purposes, acquisition 
expenses incurred until 31 December 2022 in respect of certain life insurance business were required to be spread over a seven year period. A deferred 
tax asset was recognised for the expected future tax deductions.

vi

The tax losses carried forward at 31 December 2022 relate to £1,970m of UK tax losses (2022: £2,024m) and £52m (2022: £82m) of UK capital losses.

vii Deferred tax recognised in relation to differences arising on accounting for insurance contracts between IFRS17 and FRS103 - Insurance Contracts (used 

for the preparation of the statutory accounts of one of the Group’s subsidiaries, The Prudential Assurance Company Limited).

The Group’s net deferred tax liability at 31 December 2023 of £239m reduced from the net deferred tax liability at 31 December 
2022 of £350m representing an overall net movement of £111m. The movement is predominantly due to a decrease of deferred 
tax liability (DTL) arising on unrealised losses in the period. 

The recognition of a deferred tax asset (DTA) relies on an assessment of the probability of future taxable profits. The Group’s 
expectations of future UK taxable profits require management judgement, and take into account the Group’s long-term financial 
and strategic plans and projected future shareholder transfers. 

The DTA on tax losses carried forward at 31 December 2023 of £505m (2022: £528m) comprises of £492m in relation to UK income 
tax losses (2022: £508m) and £13m (2022: £20m) in respect of UK capital losses. The DTA on UK income tax losses has been 
recognised in full based upon sufficient future taxable profits arising from shareholder transfers. These transfers are considered a 
reliable source of profit and are a consistent measure used in the Group’s Business Plans and Solvency II calculations. The DTA on 
UK capital losses has been partially recognised and is based upon expected reversal of the taxable temporary differences 
recognised on unrealised gains on investments, only a proportion of which are expected to be available for offset against the UK 
capital losses.

10.2 Deferred tax (continued)

10.2.2 Deferred tax in the statement of financial position (continued)
Modelling was undertaken to review the recovery period of the DTA on both the income and capital losses. Under current UK tax 
legislation, there is no time limit on utilisation of both the income and capital losses, however, these tax losses can only be used 
against 50 per cent of taxable income profits and capital gains in future periods. These restrictions in utilisation mean that the value 
of the DTA in respect of income tax losses is only expected to be fully recovered by 2038 in the base case forecast. An impaired 
scenario was also modelled which reflected a 10% reduction of forecast shareholder transfer in each period, this extended the 
recovery to 2040. The income tax losses arising in 2022 are not expected to be recurring in future periods and given the forecast of 
future profitability and the Group’s commitment to the UK market, in management’s judgement it is probable that the value of the 
DTA on losses will be recovered by the Group while still operating as a going concern. The modelling of future capital gains arising 
on investments show that the recognised DTA on capital losses is expected to be recovered by 2029. It is possible that future tax 
law changes could materially affect the timing of recovery and the value of these losses ultimately realised by the Group. 

The deferred tax balances arise in the following parts of the Group:

10.2.3 Unrecognised deferred tax
Tax losses and temporary differences
At the end of the reporting period, the Group's continuing operations have unused tax losses of £548m (2022: £481m) for which 
no deferred tax asset is being recognised. The Group's unused tax losses primarily relate to capital losses in the UK of £540m 
(2022: £472m). No deferred tax asset is recognised on the unused tax losses of £548m (2022: £481m) as it is considered not 
probable that future taxable UK capital gains or other appropriate profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Under 
UK law, capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

Group investments in subsidiaries, branches and investments
Retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries are expected to be re-invested indefinitely or remitted to the UK free from further 
taxation by virtue of Parent Company exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and on capital gains on disposal. Consequentially, 
the Group does not consider there to be any significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
branches, associates and joint arrangements.

10 Tax (continued)
10.3 Current tax assets and liabilities (continued)

One of the Group’s subsidiaries, The Prudential Assurance Company Limited (PAC), is the lead litigant in a combined group action 
against HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) concerning the correct historical tax treatment applying to dividends received from 
overseas portfolio investments of its With-Profits Fund. 

In February 2018, the Supreme Court heard HMRC’s appeal against the earlier Court of Appeal decision in PAC’s favour. The 
decision of the Supreme Court, released in July 2018, upheld the main point of dispute in PAC’s favour but reversed the decisions 
of the lower courts on some practical points of how to apply that principle. The Supreme Court issued its order giving effect to its 
decision in October 2019, stating any remaining issues of computation be remitted back to the High Court. PAC and HMRC are 
working through the mechanics of implementing the Supreme Court decisions. To date, this work has led to a reduction in the 
estimate for policyholder tax credit recoverable, and the associated estimate of interest receivable. 

As at 31 December 2023, PAC has recognised a total policyholder tax credit of £114m (2022: £114m) in respect of its claim against 
HMRC. Of this amount, £40m (2022: £40m) has been paid by HMRC leaving a tax recoverable balance of £74m (2022: £74m) 
recorded as an amount of tax due from HMRC. PAC will be entitled to interest on the tax repaid. As a result of the COVID pandemic 
the timing to finalise the issue has been further delayed. It is now expected to be finalised during 2024 at which point PAC expect 
to receive full and final payment.

11 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2023 was 12.7p (2022: (83.6p)) and diluted earnings per share was 12.4p 
(2022: (83.6p)). Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding after deducting treasury 
shares and shares held by the employee benefit trust. Diluted EPS is based on the potential future shares outstanding resulting 
from exercise of options under the various share-based payment schemes in addition to the weighted average ordinary shares 
outstanding. 

The following table shows details of basic and diluted earnings per share:

Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other groups of assets and thus is assigned to a group of cash-generating 
units for the purposes of impairment testing. 

The group of cash-generating units are based upon how management monitors the business and represent the lowest level to 
which goodwill can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

13 Goodwill and intangible assets (continued)
13.1 Impairment assessment (continued)

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and where there is an indication of impairment, by comparing the carrying amount of 
the group of cash-generating units, including any goodwill, with its recoverable amount. 

None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 

Asset Management cash-generating units
The carrying value of Asset Management goodwill predominantly relates to that arising on the acquisition of M&G Group Limited, 
split between the Wholesale Asset Management cash-generating unit (excluding MandG Investments Southern Africa (Pty) 
Limited), the Institutional Asset Management cash-generating unit (excluding responsAbility Investments AG), and the Internal 
Asset Management cash-generating unit. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of the MandG Investments Southern Africa (Pty) 
Limited cash-generating unit and the responsAbility Investments AG cash-generating unit is also recognised. 

M&G Group Limited 
An impairment assessment has been undertaken, which resulted in no impairment charge being recognised.

The recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units was determined by calculating the value in use. The value in use 
represents the present value of future cash flows based on the business plan to 2026 approved by management, and relevant 
assumptions for cash flows for later years. 

The future cash flows used in the value in use calculation are based on a set of economic, market and business assumptions. 
These include the direct and secondary effects of recent developments, such as changes in global equity markets and trends in 
fund flows, which are considered by management in arriving at the expectations for the final projections for the business plan. 
The business plan considers the growth in customer preference for ESG products, including those aimed at managing and 
addressing climate risk, and its impact on projected AUMA flows based on our strategy. M&G Group Limited being an asset 
manager does not hold material investments on its balance sheet which would directly be impacted by climate risk. Given this is an 
emerging area, and given the current available data and the sophistication of the models, forecast cash flows may not fully reflect 
the potential impact of climate risk.

Based on the assessment, the value in use of the group of cash-generating units was higher than the carrying value and no 
impairment has been recognised as at 31 December 2023 in respect of goodwill arising on the acquisition of M&G Group Limited.

The value in use is particularly sensitive to a number of key assumptions as follows:

– The cash flow forecast has been extrapolated beyond the business plan period to incorporate a five-year value in use 

assessment, estimating growth rates for 2027 and 2028, tapering the growth expected in 2026 down over the two-year period, 
to the long-term growth rate (based on long-term inflation and nominal gross domestic product rates for the UK).

– The pre-tax discount rate as at 31 December 2023 was 11% (2022: 11%) and is based on the weighted average cost of capital for 
M&G Group Limited derived using an estimated cost of equity, under the capital asset pricing model and cost of debt. A 50bps 
increase in the discount rate would result in the value in use decreasing by £175m (2022: £187m). This would not result in any 
impairment charge being recorded for goodwill.

– The terminal value was calculated using a standard growth model, using a discount rate of 11% (2022: 11%) as stated above and 

a long-term growth rate of 2% (2022: 2%). A 50bps decrease in the long-term growth rate would result in the value in use 
decreasing by £127m (2022: £122m). This would not result in any impairment charge being recorded for goodwill.

– That asset management contracts continue on similar terms.

No reasonable change in assumptions stated above that would result in any impairment being recorded. Furthermore, there would 
be no impairment recorded even if the individual stresses to assumptions stated above were to apply concurrently which 
demonstrates the significant headroom available on the carrying value. 

responsAbility Investments AG
During the year to 31 December 2023 an impairment of £25m (2022: £nil) has been recognised in respect of the responsAbility 
Investments AG cash-generating unit to bring the carrying value down to its recoverable amount which is its value in use of £132m 
(2022: £186m). The change primarily reflects a revised view of timing of revenue synergies, as anticipated at the date of acquisition, 
being delivered or achieved. The responsAbility Investments AG cash generating unit consists of the net assets and goodwill and 
other intangibles arising from the acquisition of responsAbility Investments AG in May 2022. All of the impairment has been 
allocated against goodwill with the expense recorded in administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement. The key 
assumptions in determining the value in use were a discount rate of 10.5% (2022: 10.0%), a long-term growth rate of 1.6% (2022: 
2.0%) and a terminal value earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin of 31.6% (2022: 
27.7%).

13.1 Impairment assessment (continued)

Acquisition of subsidiaries held by the With-Profits Fund
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries held relates to acquisitions made within consolidated infrastructure private equity 
vehicles which are held by the With-Profits Fund. Management have undertaken an impairment assessment by comparing the fair 
value of the subsidiaries with their carrying value. As a result of the assessment, no impairment was recognised for the year ended 
31 December 2023 (2022: £nil).

There is no share of other comprehensive income from joint ventures or associates.

14.1.1 Investment in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method
All of the Group’s investments in joint ventures which are accounted for using the equity method are property vehicles held in the 
With-Profits Fund. The results of the Group’s joint ventures therefore do not affect shareholders’ results.

No joint ventures are considered to be material individually or in aggregate to the Group for the years ended 31 December 2023 
and 31 December 2022. None of the Group’s joint ventures are listed and financial information of these investments covering 
the same reporting period as that of the Group has been used for accounting for these investments using the equity method.

14.1.2 Investment in associates accounted for using the equity method
The Group has investments in associates which are accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated 
financial statements. All of the Group’s associates which are accounted for using the equity method are held by the shareholder-
backed business. No associates are considered to be material individually or in aggregate to the Group for the years ended 
31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022. None of the Group’s equity-accounted associates are listed, and the reporting date 
and reporting period of the Group’s associates accounted for using the equity method are the same as the Group.

On 8 March 2023, the Group acquired an initial stake in Continuum. Further details are set out in Note 2.2.

14.2 Interests in joint ventures and associates accounted for at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

The Group has investments in OEICs, unit trusts, property unit trusts and venture capital investments of the With-Profits Fund 
where the Group has significant influence or joint control. These investments are accounted for on a FVTPL basis and are included 
within equity securities and pooled investment funds in the consolidated statement of financial position. 

14.2.1 Associates accounted for at FVTPL
During the year ended 31 December 2022, M&G European Property Fund (MEP) was deconsolidated from the Group and is now 
accounted for as an associate on a FVTPL basis. As at 31 December 2023, the Group held 29.4% of MEP (2022: 29.8%) with a fair 
value of £1,008m (2022: £1,143m). No other associates accounted for at FVTPL are considered individually material to the Group for 
the years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.

The aggregate fair value of associates accounted for at FVTPL, including MEP, at 31 December 2023 was £2,004m 
(2022: £1,850m).

14.2.2 Joint ventures accounted for at FVTPL
The aggregate fair value of joint ventures accounted for at FVTPL at 31 December 2023 was £209m (2022: £190m). None of the 
joint ventures accounted for at FVTPL are considered individually material to the Group for the years ended 31 December 2023 
and 31 December 2022.

Consideration was given to potential impacts on PPE related estimates and judgements arising from the climate scenario 
modelling on infrastructure assets within our TCFD disclosures (starting on page 69). The assessment concluded that no 
impairment indicator is present and no adjustments would be required for useful lives and residual values for the current reporting 
year.

15.1 Right of use assets

The Group recognises right of use assets for leases of land and buildings which are used as office space across various locations. 
Some leases include lease break options that are exercisable at the option of the Group. 

As at 31 December 2023, £23m (2022: £29m) of right of use assets were held by the With-Profits Fund.

15.2 Other tangible assets

As at 31 December 2023, other tangible assets with a net book value of £1,784m (2022: £1,513m) were held by the With-Profits 
Fund, of which £174m (2022: £217m) are assets under construction. The other tangible assets within the With-Profits Fund are held 
by the Group's infrastructure capital private equity vehicles. 

During the year £54m (2022: £9m) of impairments, net of reversals, were recognised in respect of tangible assets held by the 
Group's infrastructure capital private equity vehicles.

The Group’s policy is to let investment property to tenants through operating leases. The leases typically include clauses to enable 
periodic rent reviews according to prevailing market conditions. In some agreements, the rents might be variable and linked 
to an index. Certain leases contain options to break before the end of the lease term by either party.

17 Defined benefit pension schemes
17.1 Background and summary economic and IAS 19 financial positions

The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes, which historically have been funded by the Group. The largest defined 
benefit scheme as at 31 December 2023 is the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme (PSPS), which accounts for 83% (2022: 82%) of 
the present value of the defined benefit pension obligation.

The Group also operates two smaller defined benefit pension schemes that were originally established by the M&G Group Limited 
(M&GGPS) and Scottish Amicable (SASPS) businesses.

On 18 September 2023, M&GGPS Trustees executed a buy-in transaction with PAC covering all deferred and pensioner member 
liabilities. A premium of £329m was transferred to PAC as part of the transaction. The assets transferred to PAC as premium are 
recognised in the relevant line within financial assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. As a result of the buy-in 
the relevant plan assets transferred were replaced with a single line insurance policy reimbursement right asset which is 
eliminated on consolidation. This reimbursement right asset, although available to the Scheme does not constitute a plan asset 
under IAS 19. The value of this insurance policy at 31 December 2023 was £298.1m.

In addition, on 30 September 2023, M&GGPS agreed to transfer the liability related to all active members to the PSPS scheme. 
This resulted in a premium of £50.4m and related liability £29.0m being transferred to PSPS. This is accounted for as a settlement 
and accordingly, M&GGPS record a loss of £21.4m on derecognition and PSPS record a corresponding gain which is eliminated on 
consolidation.

Under IAS 19: Employee Benefits and IFRIC 14: IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements 
and their Interaction, the Group can only recognise a surplus to the extent that it is able to access the surplus either through an 
unconditional right of refund or through reduced future contributions relating to ongoing service of active members. The Group has 
no unconditional right of refund to any surplus in PSPS. Accordingly, PSPS’s net economic pension surplus is restricted up to the 
present value of the Group’s economic benefit, which is calculated as the difference between the estimated future cost of service 
for active members and the estimated future ongoing contributions. The level of the restriction is set out in the table below. 
Subsequent to the transfer of active members from M&GGPS to PSPS, a portion (23% as at 31 December 2023) of the net 
economic pension surplus of PSPS is attributable to M&G FA Limited and reflected in M&G FA Limited’s financial statements. The 
remainder is then attributed 70% to the With-Profits Fund and 30% to the Group’s shareholders. The remaining policyholder and 
shareholder allocation of PSPS is reflected in the financial statements of PAC and M&G Corporate Services Limited respectively.

In contrast, the Group is able to access the surplus of SASPS and M&GGPS through an unconditional right of refund. Therefore, the 
surplus resulting from the schemes (if any) would be recognised in full. As at 31 December 2023 the SASPS scheme is in surplus 
and the M&GGPS schemes is in deficit based on the IAS 19 valuation.

M&GGPS is in a net economic surplus position but in deficit on an IAS 19 basis as a result of the elimination of the reimbursement right 
asset recognised in respect of the buy-in of the Scheme by PAC as explained below. The Scheme also has investments in insurance 
policies issued by Prudential Pensions Limited (PPL), a subsidiary of the Group, through which it invests in certain pooled funds. Under IAS 
19, non-transferable insurance policies issued by a related party do not qualify as plan assets and these are eliminated.

The gross economic position of M&GGPS which includes the PPL policies and reimbursement is reflected in the financial 
statements of M&G FA Limited. 

The SASPS net economic pension deficit is attributed 40% to the With-Profits Fund and 60% to the Group’s shareholders. Both 
the policyholder and shareholder allocation of SASPS is reflected in the financial statements of PAC.

We recognise climate change has potential to affect the value of investments within the Schemes. Both PSPS and M&GGPS 
incorporate climate-related factors when executing their strategic objectives.

17.1.1 Triennial actuarial valuations
A full actuarial valuation is required for defined benefit pension schemes every three years in order to assess the appropriate level 
of funding for schemes in relation to their commitments. These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the 
assets held within the separate trustee administered funds. The actuarial valuation differs from the IAS 19 accounting basis 
valuation in a number of respects, including the discount rate assumption where IAS 19 prescribes a rate based on high-quality 
corporate bonds while a more prudent assumption is typically used for the actuarial valuation.

Summary information on the latest completed actuarial valuation for each of the schemes, as at 31 December 2023, is shown 
in the table below.

Note that this includes the estimate amount in respect of PSPS members at the last triennial valuation plus the expected contribution at the minimum level 
in respect of members transferred from M&GGPS.

The contributions detailed above broadly represent the Group's current expectation of amounts that will be paid to each respective 
plan in the next annual reporting period.

The triennial valuations of the schemes are currently being progressed but have not been completed as at 31 December 2023. 

17.1.2 Risks to which the defined benefit schemes expose the Group
The plans are subject to the statutory funding objective requirements of the Pensions Act 2004, which require that plans be funded 
to at least the level of their technical provisions (an actuarial estimate of the assets needed to provide for the benefits already built 
up under the plan). Where there is a deficit, the employers of the schemes would agree a deficit recovery plan. Accordingly, the 
pension schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are interest rate risk, equity risk, inflation 
risk, credit risk and mortality risk.

17.1.3 Corporate governance
The Group’s pension schemes are established under trust and are subject to UK legal requirements; this includes being subject to 
regulation by the Pensions Regulator in accordance with the Pensions Act 2021. Each scheme has a corporate trustee to which 
some Directors are appointed by Group employers with the remaining Directors nominated by members in accordance with UK 
legal requirements. The Trustees have the ultimate responsibility to ensure that each scheme is managed in accordance with its 
Trust Deed and Rules. The Trustees act in the best interests of the schemes’ beneficiaries; this includes taking appropriate account 
of each employer's legal obligation and financial ability to support the schemes when setting investment strategy and when 
agreeing funding with the employers. The employers’ contribution commitments are formally updated at each triennial valuation; 
between valuations funding levels and employer strength continue to be monitored, with the Trustees being able to bring forward 
the next triennial valuation if they consider it appropriate to do so.

All of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are final salary schemes, which are closed to new entrants. The pensionable 
salaries for most members are capped at the levels as at 30 September 2019. The Trustee of each scheme sets the general 
investment policy and specifies any restrictions on types of investment and the degrees of divergence permitted from the 
benchmark, but delegates the responsibility for selection and realisation of specific investments to the investment managers. 
The Trustees consult with the principal employer for each scheme on the investment principles, but the ultimate responsibility for 
the investment of the assets of the schemes lies with the Trustees.

17 Defined benefit pension schemes (continued)
17.1 Background and summary economic and IAS 19 financial positions (continued)

17.1.3 Corporate governance (continued)
The Trustees of each of the schemes manage the investment strategy of the scheme to achieve an acceptable balance between 
investing in the assets that most closely match the expected benefit payments and assets that are expected to achieve a greater 
return in the hope of reducing the contributions required or providing additional benefits to members. For all three schemes, and 
especially PSPS and SASPS, a significant portion of the scheme assets are invested in liability matching assets such as bonds and 
gilts, including index-linked gilts, to partially hedge against inflation. In addition, the schemes maintain portfolios of interest rate and 
inflation swaps to match more closely the duration and inflation profiles of their assets to their liabilities.

As noted above, the Trustees of M&GGPS executed a buy-in transaction with PAC, whereby the longevity and investment risk in 
respect of all deferred and pensioner members was transferred to PAC. Furthermore, liabilities relating to all active members of the 
scheme were transferred to PSPS during the year which further de-risks the scheme.

All three schemes have invested in a mix of both return-seeking assets, such as equities and property, and matching assets, 
including leveraged liability-driven investment portfolios to reflect the liability profile of the scheme. They manage the risks of the 
return-seeking exposure by investing in a diversified mix of investments. 

During 2020 PSPS entered into a longevity swap transaction with Pacific Life Re Limited. This arrangement provides long-term 
protection for PSPS against costs that could result from unexpected increases in life expectancy relating to the pensions that were 
in payment on 6 April 2019, excluding any future discretionary increases. As at 31 December 2023, the longevity swap covered 
£2.0bn (2022: £2.0bn) of current pensioner scheme liabilities, on an IAS 19 basis.

17.2 Assumptions

17.2.1 Demographic assumptions

Post-retirement mortality
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation for the Group's schemes requires assumptions to be set for both current mortality 
and the allowance for future mortality improvements. The table below sets out the mortality tables and mortality improvement 
model used for the Group’s schemes, along with the associated life expectancies.

The mortality assumptions are adjusted to make allowance for future improvements in longevity. As at 31 December 2023, this allowance was based on 
the CMI 2021 mortality improvements model with improvement factors of 1.60% for males (Sk = 7.25 and A parameter varies by age) and 1.60% for 
females (Sk = 7.75 and A parameter varies by age) (2022: this allowance was based on the CMI 2020 model with improvement factors of 1.60% for males 
(Sk = 7.25) and 1.60% for females (Sk = 7.75)).

The discount rate has been determined using a cash flow matching approach based on an 'AA' corporate bond index. The single equivalent rates in the 
table above are illustrative as the full yield curve is used in the calculation of the liability.

Due to the scheme changes during 2019, a cap to future pensionable salary increase came into effect and, as a result, salary growth inflation is only applied 
for certain levels of pensionable salary which represent a very small proportion of the total liability.

The long-term margin between RPI and CPI reflects expected changes in RPI from 2030 as a result of the UK Statistics Authority stated intention to align 
RPI with CPI including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH). The rate of inflation used reflects the long-term assumption for UK RPI or CPI, depending on 
the particular tranche of scheme benefits, with caps and floors applied in accordance with the scheme rules. Certain tranches of scheme benefits within 
PSPS have statutory pension increases in line with the higher of CPI up to a maximum level, or a discretionary level determined by the employer. Other 
tranches are not guaranteed and determined by the employer on a discretionary basis. The single equivalent rates in the table above are illustrative as the 
full yield curve is used in the calculation of the liability.

17.2.3 Other assumptions
In October 2018, the High Court ruled that pension schemes are required to equalise benefits for the effect of guaranteed minimum 
pensions (GMPs). GMPs are a minimum benefit that schemes that were contracted-out on a salary-related basis between 1978 and 
1997 are required to provide. There was a further Court ruling in November 2020 which required benefits in respect of past 
transfers out of the schemes to also be equalised. In light of these Court rulings, at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the 
Group has recognised an estimated allowance for GMP equalisation within the IAS 19 valuation for all the UK schemes - comprising 
£32m for PSPS, £11m for SASPS, and £3m for M&GGPS as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £31m for PSPS, £11m for SASPS and £3m 
for M&GGPS).

17.2.4 Sensitivity of the pension scheme liabilities to key variables
The sensitivity information below is based on the core scheme liabilities and assumptions at the balance sheet date. 
The sensitivities are calculated based on a change in one assumption with all other assumptions being held constant. As such, 
interdependencies between the assumptions are excluded. The impact of the rate of inflation assumption sensitivity includes the 
impact of inflation on the rate of increase in salaries, where applicable, and on the rate of increase of pensions in payment.

The sensitivities of the underlying pension scheme liabilities as shown below do not directly equate to the impact on the Group's 
comprehensive income due to the effect of restriction on surplus for PSPS and the allocation of a share of the interest in the 
financial position of PSPS and SASPS to the With-Profits Fund as described above. In addition, the sensitivities shown do not 
include the impact on assets, which for all schemes would significantly offset the impact of the discount rate and inflation 
sensitivities on the IAS 19 surplus or deficit. For the PSPS scheme, the mortality rate sensitivity impact would also be partially 
mitigated by the longevity swap asset held.

As at 31 December 2023 81% of the total value of the scheme assets, excluding the reimbursement asset, were derived from 
quoted prices in an active market (2022: 84%), while the value of the remaining assets is derived from the use of various 
observable and unobservable inputs. None of the scheme assets included property occupied by the Group. The IAS 19 basis plan 
assets as at 31 December 2023 of £5,496m is different from the economic basis plan assets of £5,508m as shown above due to the 
exclusion of investment in Group insurance policies by M&GGPS as described in 17.1. Due to the disinvestment in non-qualifying 
insurance policies by M&GGPS as at 31 December 2022 the economic basis plan assets is the same as the IAS 19 basis plan assets.

Included in the share of remeasurement gains and losses for the year ended 31 December 2023 are losses relating to shareholders totalling £109m (2022: 
gains of £31m) which are recognised in other comprehensive income. The amounts attributable to the With-Profits Fund for the year ended 31 December 
2023 amount to losses of £15m (2022: losses of £2m) are recognised in other comprehensive income.

iii  As noted above, M&GGPS executed a buy-in transaction with PAC (a Group entity). The reimbursement right asset resulting from the transaction is 

eliminated on consolidation. However, due to different measurement bases applied for determining the value of this asset and the related liability by PAC 
for accounting purposes, the premium paid by the scheme exceeded the valuation of the scheme asset recognised by £78.6m. In the table above, this has 
been recognised as a loss in the actual return on assets.

Amounts recorded in share capital represent the nominal value of shares issued with any difference between proceeds received 
on issue of shares, net of issue costs, and the nominal value of shares issued being credited to the share premium account. 

In 2023, 2,253,878 treasury shares and 7,345,996 newly issued shares were used to satisfy obligations under the SAYE scheme. 
Further details are outlined in Note 37.2. The newly issued shares resulted in an increase in share capital of £0.4m and share 
premium of £9.1m.

In March 2022, the Group commenced a share buy-back programme to purchase ordinary shares of 5 pence each up to a 
maximum consideration of £500m, and the programme concluded on 27 October 2022 for a total consideration, including 
expenses and stamp duty, of £503m. Shares with a nominal value of £11m were cancelled, with the recognition of an £11m capital 
redemption reserve. Further details can be found in Note 22.2.

22 Shares held by employee benefit trusts and other treasury shares
The Group buys and sells its own shares in relation to its employee share schemes, via transactions undertaken by authorised 
investment funds that the Group is deemed to control and through the share buy-back programme. These authorised investment 
funds undertake transactions in the Group's shares as part of their investment decisions. The cost of own shares of £47m as at 
31 December 2023 (2022: £117m) is deducted from equity.

22.1 Shares held by employee benefit trust

The M&G Employee Share Trust (the Trust) was created on 20 September 2019 to facilitate the procurement, holding and 
distribution of M&G plc shares under the various employee incentive schemes in operation. The Trust is funded by M&G plc. In 
addition, there is a separate trust that holds shares in respect of Share Incentive Plan (SIP) schemes. 

The movement in the M&G plc shares held in employee benefit trusts are detailed below:

equity.

22.2 Other treasury shares

In March 2022, the Group commenced a share buy-back programme to purchase ordinary shares of 5 pence each up to a 
maximum consideration of £500m. As at 31 December 2022, ordinary shares bought back but not cancelled were 26,867,908 with 
a carrying value of £47m. During 2023, 2,253,878 shares with a carrying value of £4m have been distributed in relation to employee 
share schemes. An additional 11,200,000 shares with a carrying value of £22m were transferred to the employee benefit trust. As 
at 31 December 2023, the remaining 13,414,030 treasury shares with a carrying value of £21m are disclosed as a deduction to 
Shareholders equity within the Treasury shares reserve.

All share transactions were made on an exchange.

The merger reserve arises from the application of merger accounting principles to the acquisition of entities under common 
control. It represents the difference between the aggregate capital reserves and the value of the entities acquired. On disposal of 
the relevant entity, the related merger reserve is released directly to retained earnings.

24 Insurance liabilities
24.1 Determination of insurance, investment with DPF and reinsurance contract balances for different components of business

Note 2.3 describes the different types of insurance and investment contracts across the business. A description relating to the 
determination of the policyholder and reinsurance contract balances with the key assumptions for each component of business is 
set out in the notes below. The sensitivity of IFRS profit after tax to the key economic and non-economic assumptions is shown in 
Note 32.7.

24.1.1 Discount rates
Cash flows relating to insurance and reinsurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held are discounted using risk-free 
yield curves adjusted to reflect the liquidity characteristics of the contracts. As described in Note 1.5, the Group determines the 
adjustment for illiquidity using either a top-down approach (for non-profit annuity contracts) or a bottom-up approach (for all other 
contracts, including with-profits).

For with-profits contracts, the illiquidity premium is determined at each reporting date by applying a weighting of 75% to the 
illiquidity premium for the reference portfolio of fixed interest assets. The illiquidity premium included in the discount rate as at 
31 December 2023 was 47bps (2022: 55bps). The assumed investment returns are consistent with the discount rates applied to the 
cash flows. The volatility of investment returns is set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where 
available, or on a best estimate basis where not.

The unit-linked contracts are considered to be highly liquid as they can be surrendered at any time by the policyholder for a 
surrender value which is the value of the units less any surrender charge. Therefore the cash flows are discounted using rates 
derived from the risk-free yield curve without addition of an illiquidity premium. The assumed unit fund growth rates are consistent 
with the discount rates applied to the cash flows.

For non-profit annuity contracts, the illiquidity premium is derived from the yield of a reference portfolio of assets which is adjusted 
to eliminate any factors that are not relevant to the annuity contracts. It is not required to adjust the yield curve for any differences 
in the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts and the reference portfolio. The reference portfolios chosen for in-force 
annuities are the assigned portfolios used to determine the SII matching adjustment. These are considered to be suitable as 
reference portfolios for IFRS 17 reporting because their objective is to closely match the liability cash flows and there is strong 
governance around their management. The discount rates at the inception of each contract are based on the yields within a 
reference portfolio of assets which the Group expects to acquire to back the portfolio of new insurance contracts (the 'target 
portfolio'). A weighted average of these discount rate curves is determined for the purpose of locking-in and calculating 
movements in the CSM relating to each group of contracts. The point of sale discount rate curves are weighted by the premiums in 
each group. On subsequent measurement of the fulfilment cash flows the yield at the valuation date on the reference portfolio is 
adjusted, where necessary, in respect of new contracts incepting in the period to allow for a period of transition from the actual 
asset holdings to the target portfolio. Typically, this period of transition can be up to 12 months but may be dependent on the 
volume of new business.

The largest adjustment made to reference portfolio yield is in relation to credit risk. IFRS 17 is not prescriptive as to how the 
adjustment for credit risk should be determined other than that it should reflect market risk premiums for credit risk. The Group 
continues to calculate the credit risk adjustment using the same approach previously used for IFRS 4 reporting. This methodology 
is considered appropriate for IFRS 17 reporting as it incorporates allowances for expected and unexpected credit events, including 
internal and external views on the outlook for credit risk, and considers the relationship between credit risk and yield spreads. The 
credit risk allowance comprises an amount for long-term best estimate defaults and downgrades, a provision for credit risk 
premium and, where appropriate, an additional short-term overlay to reflect the prospective outlook for experience over the 
coming period, including uncertainty in the outlook. The allowance for credit risk within the discount rate for shareholder-backed 
annuities as at 31 December 2023 was 56bps (2022: 50bps). The allowance for credit risk within the discount rate for annuities in 
the With-Profits Fund as at 31 December 2023 was 57bps (2022: 50bps). Due to the uncertainty of credit outlook in the UK and 
given that the credit spreads have widened, primarily during the first half of 2023, the short-term overlay has been increased for 
reporting as at 31 December 2023.

The derivation of the discount rates includes the impact of the UK Government consultation on residential ground rents (further 
explained in note 31.8.1) and the resulting impact on the portfolio yield and the credit risk allowances.

The tables below show the discount rates used as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.

(continued)

24.1.3 With-profits business
The With-Profits Fund mainly contains with-profits contracts but also contains some non-profit business (annuities, unit-linked, 
and term assurances). 

The with-profits contracts are a combination of insurance contracts, investment contracts with discretionary participation features 
(DPF) and investment contracts without DPF. The investment contracts without DPF are within the scope of IFRS 9 and are 
presented in Note 25.

For the with-profits contracts the insurance contract liability is the sum of the liability for incurred claims and the liability for 
remaining coverage, which comprises: 

– the fair value of the underlying items for in-force contracts, ie the value of the asset shares and the expected future additions to 

asset shares, plus the present value of future costs less charges;

– the allowance for 'mutualisation' on in-force business;

– the risk adjustment for non-financial risk;

– the CSM; and

– the historical allowance for 'mutualisation' (based on the underlying items for the additional amounts expected to be paid to 

current or future policyholders).

These items are described further below.

Future costs less charges
The future costs include a market-consistent valuation of the costs of guarantees, options and smoothing and this amount is 
determined using stochastic modelling techniques. The main assumptions used to value the future costs less charges are listed 
below:

– Assumptions relating to persistency (see Note 24.1.2) and the take-up of options offered on certain with-profits contracts are set 
based on the results of the most recent experience analysis looking at the experience over recent years of the relevant business, 
and supplemented by expert judgement within the business. In line with legislative changes, including pension freedoms, the 
Group expects all policyholders of pension contracts to choose alternative post-vesting options;

– Management actions under which the Fund is managed in different scenarios;

– Maintenance and, for some classes of business, termination expense assumptions are expressed as per policy amounts (see 
Note 24.1.2). They are set based on forecast expense levels, including an allowance for ongoing investment management 
expenses, and are allocated between entities and product groups in accordance with the Group’s internal cost allocation model. 
They reflect the costs incurred by the Group which may differ from the internal charges to companies within the Group;

– Expense inflation assumptions are set consistent with the economic basis and based on the inflation swap spot curve;

– The contract liabilities for with-profits business also require assumptions for mortality. These are set based on the results of 

recent experience analysis. Mortality experience over 2020 and 2021 was significantly higher than previous years as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with broader industry approach, no weight has been given to pandemic experience; and

– Future investment return assumptions and discount rates are set at a risk-free yield curve plus an illiquidity premium (as set out 

in Notes 1.5 and 24.1.1). 

Allowances for mutualisation
The allowance for mutualisation on in-force business is the policyholders’ share, which is assumed to be 90% (consistent with the 
division of profits permitted by the Articles of Association), of the expected future surpluses arising from with-profits contracts, 
which are determined as:

– the discounted value of the amounts that will be charged to policies;

– less: the discounted value of future shareholder transfers, gross of tax;

– less: the discounted value of other costs directly attributable to the group of insurance contracts; and

– less: the amount of any additional tax attributable to the above items.

The allowance for mutualisation on in-force business is included in the liabilities of the groups of insurance contracts.

(continued)

24.1.3 With-profits business (continued)
Allowances for mutualisation (continued)
The historical allowance for mutualisation is the policyholders’ share of the surpluses that have arisen in the past, which are 
determined as the policyholders’ share of the fair value of the underlying items for the additional amounts expected to be paid to 
current or future policyholders less, if required, an allowance for any further tax balances that should be apportioned between 
policyholders and shareholders. The policyholders’ share is assessed on a prospective basis and is assumed to be 90%, consistent 
with the division of profits permitted by the Articles of Association. The fair value of the underlying items reflects inter alia the fair 
value of the annuity contracts in the With-Profits Fund, which is determined using the fair value methodology outlined in Note 1.2.1 
but using current estimates of the expected cash flows and discount rate.

The historical allowance for mutualisation is separate from the liabilities of the groups of insurance contracts (in accordance with 
IFRS 17 paragraph B71) and the Group has chosen to present this as part of the liability for remaining coverage.

With-profits options and guarantees
Certain policies written in the Group’s With-Profits Fund give potentially valuable guarantees to policyholders, or options to change 
policy benefits which can be exercised at the policyholders’ discretion. 

Most with-profits contracts give a guaranteed minimum payment on a specified date or range of dates or on death if before that 
date or dates. For pensions products, the specified date is the policyholder’s chosen retirement date or a range of dates around 
that date. For endowment contracts, guarantees apply at the maturity date of the contract. For with-profits bonds it is often a 
specified anniversary of commencement, in some cases with further dates thereafter.

The main types of options and guarantees offered for with-profits contracts are as follows: 

– For conventional with-profits contracts, including endowment assurance contracts and whole of-life assurance contracts, 

payouts are guaranteed at the sum assured together with any declared regular bonus;

– Conventional with-profits deferred annuity contracts have a basic annuity per annum to which bonuses are added. At maturity, 
the cash claim value will reflect the current cost of providing the deferred annuity. Regular bonuses when added to with-profits 
contracts usually increase the guaranteed amount;

– For unitised with-profits contracts and cash accumulation contracts the guaranteed payout is the initial investment (adjusted for 
any withdrawals, where appropriate), less charges, plus any regular bonuses declared. If benefits are taken at a date other than 
when the guarantee applies, a market value reduction may be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of 
the units and the market value of the underlying assets;

– For certain unitised with-profits contracts and cash accumulation contracts, policyholders have the option to defer their 

retirement date when they reach maturity, and the terminal bonus granted at that point is guaranteed;

– For with-profits annuity contracts, there is a guaranteed minimum annuity payment below which benefit payments cannot fall 

over the lifetime of the policies; and

– Certain pensions products have guaranteed annuity options at retirement, where the policyholder has the option to take the 

benefit in the form of an annuity at a guaranteed conversion rate.

The table below shows the confidence level used to determine the risk adjustment for with-profits contracts:

24.1.4 Unit-linked business
Only unit-linked contracts that transfer significant insurance risk are within the scope of IFRS 17. For these contracts the insurance 
contract liability is the sum of the liability for incurred claims and the liability for remaining coverage, which comprises: 

– the fair value of the underlying items, ie the value of the unit funds, plus the present value of future costs less charges;

– the risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and

– the CSM.

Future cash flows
The present value of future costs less charges is determined using best estimate assumptions for the non-financial risks of 
mortality, on a basis that is appropriate for the policyholder profile, expenses and persistency (see Note 24.1.2). The assumed unit 
fund growth rates are consistent with the discount rates applied to the cash flows (see Note 24.1.1). 

Certain parts of the unit-linked business are reinsured externally by way of fund reinsurance. Where this is the case, the fair value 
of the underlying asset and liability is equal to the unit value obligation.

24.1.5 Annuities and other long-term business
The majority of the policyholder liabilities in the ‘annuities and other long-term business’ component relate to annuity contracts. 
The annuity insurance contract liabilities are calculated as the sum of the liability for incurred claims and the liability for remaining 
coverage, which comprises:

– the expected value of future annuity payments and expenses;

– the risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and

– the CSM.

Future cash flows
The key assumptions used to value the future cash flows for annuity contracts, both insurance contracts issued and reinsurance 
contracts held, are described below.

Mortality
Mortality assumptions for annuity business are set in light of recent population and internal experience, with an allowance for 
expected future mortality improvements. Given the long-term nature of annuity business, annuitant mortality remains a significant 
assumption in determining insurance liabilities. The assumptions used reference recent England & Wales population mortality data, 
consistent with the CMI mortality projections model with specific risk factors applied on a per policy basis to reflect the features of 
the Group’s portfolio. 

An increase in mortality rates was observed over 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher mortality experience may 
be expected to continue to some extent over the short-term, with significant excess deaths observed in the population over 2022. 
However, there is significant uncertainty and the longer-term implications for mortality rates among the annuitant population are 
unknown at this stage. In line with broader industry approach, zero weight has been given to pandemic experience. This is an area 
that will continue to be monitored by the Group. 

No changes have been made to best-estimate assumptions for current mortality in the year ended 31 December 2023. The 2023 
mortality improvements assumption is expressed in terms of the CMI 2021 model, updated from the CMI 2020 used in 2022 while 
the parameters of the model have been maintained. A full review of the best estimate assumptions was carried out in 2022 
including a bottom-up review of the mortality improvements assumption following the COVID-19 pandemic.

A parameter in the model to reflect socio-economic differences between the portfolio and population experience is also utilised. This adjusts initial 
mortality improvement rates, varying by age and gender. This is unchanged at all ages relative to 31 December 2022. 

The tapering of improvements to zero is set to occur between ages 90-110 at 31 December 2023 which is unchanged from 31 December 2022.

The smoothing parameter controls the amount of smoothing by calendar year when determining the level of initial mortality improvements.

The mortality assumptions for in-force vested annuities also cover annuities in deferment.

Valuation interest rates
See Note 24.1.1. The same approach is also used to derive the discount rates applied to reinsurance cash flows.

Expenses
Maintenance expense assumptions are expressed as per policy amounts (see Note 24.1.2). They are set based on forecast expense 
levels, including an allowance for ongoing investment management expenses and are allocated between entities and product 
groups in accordance with the Group’s internal cost allocation model. They reflect the costs incurred by the Group which may differ 
from the internal charges to companies within the Group. Expense inflation assumptions are set consistent with the economic 
basis and based on the inflation swap spot curve. These assumptions therefore take recent increases in inflation into account, and 
allow for the market-driven long-term view of future inflation. Increases in costs that are expected to follow an inflation index are 
considered by the Group to relate to financial risk.

Risk adjustment for non-financial risk
The table below shows the confidence level used to determine the risk adjustment for annuities and other long-term business:

Confidence level (percentile of the Group’s one year risk distributions)

Confidence level (percentile of the risk distributions over the remaining lifetime)

CSM
The General Measurement Model is used to measure the CSM for annuities and other long-term business. For annuities in 
payment the amount of the services provided in any given period is the annualised amount of income.

24.2 Movements in insurance, investment with DPF and reinsurance contract balances 

The breakdown of groups of insurance, investment with DPF and reinsurance contracts issued, and reinsurance contracts held, 
that are in an asset position and those in a liability position is set out in the table below:

The following reconciliations show how the net carrying amounts of insurance, investment with DPF and reinsurance contracts in 
each group of insurance contracts issued, and reinsurance contracts held, changed during the year as a result of cash flows and 
amounts recognised in the statement of profit or loss. 

For insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held, tables are presented that analyse changes in the estimates of 
the present value of future cash flows, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk and the CSM and separate tables that analyse 
movements in the liabilities for remaining coverage and liabilities for incurred claims, reconciling these movements to the line items 
in the statement of profit or loss.

For insurance contracts issued, these analysis tables are then presented for each line of business. For reinsurance contracts held 
98% (2022: 99%) relates to annuity and other long-term business contracts and so separate tables for each line of business are not 
presented.

The insurance contracts issued represents the run off of the net of insurance assets and insurance liabilities CSM. The amounts 
presented in the table represent the current discounted value of the CSM amortisation expected to be recognised in the insurance 
service result in future periods. The actual CSM amortisation in future periods will differ from that presented due to the impacts of 
future new business, recalibrations of the CSM, changes in estimates reflected in the CSMs and changes in the future coverage 
units.

25 Investment contract liabilities without discretionary participation features
Investment contract liabilities without DPF comprise unit-linked contracts that contain little or no insurance risk and certain 
contracts invested in PruFund with a low level of discretion (see following paragraph). For the former, the assets and liabilities 
arising under the contracts are distinguished between those that relate to the financial instrument liability, and the deferred 
acquisition costs and deferred income that relate to the component of the contract that relates to investment management. 
Deferred acquisition costs and deferred income are recognised in line with the level of service provision.

Certain contracts invested in PruFund which are sold via wholesale distribution agreements with certain European financial 
institutions and that are not considered to have DPF are also included in investment contract liabilities without DPF. Accordingly, 
the contracts are measured at FVTPL under IFRS 9. The carrying value of these liabilities as at 31 December 2023 is £294m 
(31 December 2022: £164m). 

The table below presents the analysis of change in investment contract liabilities without DPF:

Investment-related items and other movements, foreign exchange differences and change in reserving basis closely align to the net change in investment 
contract liabilities without DPF income statement amount. The difference between the values relates to policyholder tax, reclassifications and annual 
management charges.

Certain parts of the unit-linked business are reinsured externally by way of fund reinsurance. Where this is the case, the fair value 
of the underlying asset and liability is equal to the unit value obligation.

26 Subordinated liabilities and other borrowings (continued)
26.1 Subordinated liabilities

The Group's subordinated liabilities consist of subordinated notes which were transferred from Prudential plc on 18 October 2019 
and were recorded at fair value on initial recognition. The transfer of the subordinated liabilities was achieved by substituting the 
Company in place of Prudential plc as issuer of the debt, as permitted under the terms and conditions of each applicable 
instrument. All costs related to the transaction were borne by Prudential plc.

30 Structured entities
Structured entities are those that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding 
who controls the entity. The Group invests in structured entities such as:

– Pooled investment vehicles, including OEICs, unit trusts, SICAVs and limited partnerships. 

– Debt securitisation vehicles, including collateralised debt obligations, mortgage-backed securities and other similar 

asset-backed securities.

Structured entities which the Group is deemed to control are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements. 
As at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the Group has not provided, and has no intention to provide, non-contractual 
financial or other support to consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities that could expose the Group to a loss.

30.1 Investments in unconsolidated structured entities

The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks in these investments commensurate to its participation and does not 
have any further exposure to the residual risks or losses of the investments or the vehicles in which it holds investments. Further 
details on risks associated with financial assets and how they are managed are provided in Note 32.

Included in equity investments and pooled investment funds as at 31 December 2023 were £4,170m (2022: £6,858m) of 
investments in structured entities managed by the Group. Investment management fees for the year end 31 December 2023 of 
£414m (2022: £416m) were recognised from managing these entities.

The maximum exposure to loss for unconsolidated structured entities in which the Group holds an investment is the carrying value 
of the Group’s investment and the loss of future fees.

The Group also has interests in structured entities managed by the Group in which it holds no investment through the collection of 
investment management fees. The maximum exposure to loss for these interests is loss of future fees.

Investment management fees recognised for the year end 31 December 2023 from managing these entities were £151m 
(2022: £168m). The comparative has been restated following a review of the entities within the scope of the disclosure. 
There is no impact on the fees earned by the Group.

31 Fair value methodology
31.1 Determination of fair value hierarchy

The fair values of assets and liabilities for which fair valuation is required under IFRS are determined by the use of current market 
bid prices for exchange-quoted investments, by using quotations from independent third parties such as brokers and pricing 
services, or by using appropriate valuation techniques. Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability 
settled in an arm’s length transaction.

To provide further information on the approach used to determine and measure the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, the 
following fair value hierarchy categorisation has been used. This hierarchy is based on the inputs to the fair value measurement and 
reflects the lowest level input that is significant to that measurement.

Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 1 principally includes exchange-listed equities, mutual funds with quoted prices, exchange-traded derivatives such as futures 
and options, and national government bonds, unless there is evidence that trading in a given instrument is so infrequent that the 
market could not be considered active. It also includes other financial instruments where there is clear evidence that the year-end 
valuation is based on a traded price in an active market.

Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from 
prices)
Level 2 principally includes corporate bonds and other national and non-national government debt securities which are valued 
using observable inputs, together with over-the-counter derivatives such as forward exchange contracts and non-quoted 
investment funds valued with observable inputs. It also includes investment contract liabilities without DPF that are valued using 
observable inputs.

Level 3 - significant inputs for the asset or liability are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)
Level 3 principally includes investments in private equity funds, directly held investment properties and investments in property 
funds which are exposed to bespoke properties or risks and investments which are internally valued or subject to a significant 
number of unobservable assumptions. It also includes debt securities which are rarely traded or traded only in privately negotiated 
transactions and hence where it is difficult to assert that their valuations have been based on observable market data.

31.2 Valuation approach for level 2 assets and liabilities

A significant proportion of the Group’s level 2 assets are corporate bonds, structured securities and other national and non-
national government debt securities. These assets, in line with market practice, are generally valued using independent pricing 
services or quotes from third party brokers. These valuations are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as monthly price 
variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis on prices achieved on subsequent trades.

Pricing services, where available, are used to obtain third party broker quotes. When prices are not available from pricing services, 
quotes are sourced directly from brokers. The Group seeks to obtain a number of quotes from different brokers so as to obtain the 
most comprehensive information available on their executability. Where quotes are sourced directly from brokers, the price used in 
the valuation is normally selected from one of the quotes based on a number of factors, including the timeliness and regularity of 
the quotes and the accuracy of the quotes considering the spreads provided. The selected quote is the one which best represents 
an executable quote for the security at the measurement date.

31.3 Level 3 assets and liabilities

31.3.1 Valuation approach for level 3
Investments valued using valuation techniques include financial investments which by nature do not have an externally quoted 
price based on regular trades, and financial investments for which markets are no longer active as a result of market conditions 
eg market illiquidity. The valuation techniques used include comparison to recent arm’s length transactions, reference to other 
instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option-adjusted spread models and, if applicable, 
enterprise valuation. These techniques may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest 
rates. Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these 
instruments. When determining the inputs into the valuation techniques used, priority is given to publicly available prices from 
independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value 
measurement that reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the 
measurement date.

Exposure to climate risk is mitigated as part of the acquisition and asset management of real estate properties through careful 
assessment of potential acquisitions and regularly monitoring the energy intensity and carbon emissions of our existing portfolio. 
Where relevant, we procure independent third party advice to assess our portfolio’s potential and cost of retrofitting to minimise 
carbon emissions and energy intensity.

31.3 Level 3 assets and liabilities (continued)

31.3.1 Valuation approach for level 3 (continued)
Where certain debt securities are valued using broker quotes, adjustments may be required in limited circumstances. This is 
generally where it is determined that the third-party valuations obtained do not reflect fair value (eg either because the value is 
stale and/or the values are extremely diverse in range). These are usually securities which are distressed or that could be subject 
to a debt restructure, or where reliable market prices are no longer available due to an inactive market or market dislocation. In 
these instances, prices are derived using internal valuation techniques including those described below with the objective of 
arriving at a fair value measurement that reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market 
participants on the measurement date. The techniques used require a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit 
risk and interest rates. Examples of such variables include an average credit spread based on the corporate bond universe and the 
relevant duration of the asset being valued. The input assumptions are determined based on the best available information at the 
measurement dates. Securities valued in such manner are classified as level 3 where these significant inputs are not based on 
observable market data.

Certain debt securities were valued using matrix pricing, which is based on assessing the credit quality of the underlying borrower 
and allocating an internal credit rating which is unobservable. The internal credit rating implicitly incorporates Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) considerations through the analysts' views of the industry and issuer. Under matrix pricing, these 
debt securities are priced by taking the credit spreads on comparable quoted public debt securities and applying these to the 
equivalent debt securities, factoring in a specified liquidity premium. The selection of comparable quoted public debt securities 
used to determine the credit spread is based on a credit spread matrix that takes into account the internal credit rating, maturity 
and currency of the debt security. During the year, the methodology for valuing the securities was further enhanced to place focus 
on the use of comparable instruments or a comparable basket of securities to derive a credit spread for each in scope private debt 
investment. This approach aligns to views of best practice and considers key features of the investment being valued.

The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon any available market information and judgements about 
the financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of 
counterparties. Such estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time a 
significant volume of a particular financial instrument, nor do they consider the tax impact of the realisation of unrealised gains or 
losses from selling the financial instrument being fair valued. In some cases, the disclosed value cannot be realised in immediate 
settlement of the financial instrument. In accordance with the Group Risk Framework, the estimated fair value of derivative financial 
instruments valued internally using standard market practices are subject to assessment against external counterparties’ 
valuations.

The investment properties of the Group are externally valued by professionally qualified external valuers using the RICS valuation 
standards which includes the issued Guidance Note “Sustainability and ESG in commercial property valuation and strategic 
advice”. The Group's investment properties are predominantly valued using an income capitalisation technique. This technique 
calculates the value through the yield and rental value depending on factors such as the lease length, building quality, covenants 
and location. Typically these variables used are compared to recent transactions with similar features to those being valued. The 
valuation of investment property inherently captures the impact of climate change if it were located in an area subject to climate 
change events. The key inputs of yield and rental value are proxies for a range of factors which will include climate change. The 
trend is towards greener buildings achieving better rents and yields than comparable buildings, all other factors being equal.

As the comparisons are not with properties that are virtually identical to the Group’s investment properties, adjustments are made 
by the valuers where appropriate to the variables used.

31.3 Level 3 assets and liabilities (continued)

31.3.2 Analysis of internally valued level 3 financial instruments
Level 3 financial assets, net of financial liabilities, which were internally valued as at 31 December 2023 were £7,878m 
(2022 (Restated): £8,630m), representing 6.0% of the total fair-valued financial assets net of financial liabilities (2022: 6.7%).

Internal valuations are inherently more subjective than external valuations. These internally valued assets and liabilities primarily 
consist of the following items:

– Debt securities of £7,278m as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £7,083m), of which £5,746m (2022: £5,885m) were valued using 
discounted cash flow models with an internally developed discount rate.These include senior and junior notes backed by 
residential ground rents with a carrying value of £1,241m (2022: £1,423m). Please see notes 31.8.1 and 31.8.2 for more information 
on these assets. The remaining debt securities were valued using other valuation methodologies such as enterprise valuation 
and estimated recovery (such as liquidators' reports). 

– Private equity investments in both debt and equity securities of £325m as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £497m), of which 

investments of £325m (2022: £497m) were valued internally using a discounted cash flow model. The most significant inputs to 
the valuation are the forecast cash flows of the underlying business, internally derived discount rate, and terminal value 
assumption, all of which involve significant judgement. The valuation is performed in accordance with International Private Equity 
and Venture Capital Association valuation guidelines. These investments are held by the Group's consolidated private equity 
infrastructure funds. 

– Equity release mortgage loans of £928m as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £934m) and a corresponding liability of £239m 

(2022: £246m), which were valued internally using discounted cash flow models. The inputs that are most significant to the 
valuation of these loans are the internally derived discount rate, the current property value, the assumed future property growth 
and the assumed future annual property rental yields. 

– Other commercial loans of £1,417m as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £1,114m) were valued using discounted cash flow models 

with an internally developed discount rate.

– Liabilities of £2,967m as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £1,688m), for the third party interest in consolidated funds in respect of the 

consolidated investment funds, which are non-recourse to the Group. These liabilities were valued by reference to the 
underlying assets.

31.3.3 Governance of level 3
The Group’s valuation policies, procedures and analyses for instruments categorised as level 3 are overseen by management 
committees as part of the Group’s wider financial reporting governance processes. The procedures undertaken include approval of 
valuation methodologies, verification processes, and resolution of significant or complex valuation issues. In undertaking these 
activities, the Group makes use of the extensive expertise of its asset management function. In addition, the Group has minimum 
standards for independent price verification to ensure valuation accuracy is regularly independently verified. Adherence to this 
policy is monitored across the business units.

The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of levels as at the end of each half-year reporting period, except 
for material transfers, which are recognised as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. 
Transfers are deemed to have occurred when there is a material change in the observed valuation inputs or a change in the level of 
trading activities of the securities.

The transfers in debt securities from level 1 to 2 (and level 1 to 3) are in line with the Group's levelling policy during the year ended 31 December 2023.

During the year additional information has been identified in relation to a number of collective investment holdings (within equity securities and pooled 
investment funds) with a value of £658m now reflected within level 3.

The transfers in debt securities from level 2 to level 1 are primarily driven by increased liquidity in the bond markets towards the end of December 2023, 
compared to a fall in liquidity towards the end of December 2022, and refinements made to our levelling methodology.

31.8.1 Level 3 assets inputs
Where possible, the Group assesses the sensitivity of the fair value of level 3 assets to reasonably possible changes in the most 
significant unobservable inputs. 

The most significant unobservable inputs in determining the fair value of level 3 assets are presented within the tables below.

Included within private placement loans are senior and junior notes backed by residential ground rents with a carrying value of £1,241m (2022: 
£1,423m), of which £859m are held in the shareholder-backed fund (2022: £994m). In November 2023, the Department for Levelling up, Housing and 
Communities, a department of the UK Government, issued a consultation titled, "Modern leasehold: restricting residential ground rent for existing 
leases" . The consultation, which is now closed to comments, included five options for capping ground rents in existing leases. One of the potential 
options is to cap ground rents in existing leases at the nominal value of a peppercorn (peppercorn cap), which would eliminate materially the full value 
of the asset. We have been engaging with the UK Government and, together with other industry participants, have provided constructive responses to 
the consultation. However, the outcome of the consultation in terms of any proposed change in legislation is still uncertain. 

The impact of the potential outcomes of the consultation have been reflected in the valuation through a ratings downgrade to all senior notes impacted 
from AA- to A+ and the application of an incremental illiquidity spread of 0.60% above the comparable spread implied by the rating to reflect the 
compensation that a market participation would require at reporting date due to the uncertainty in future values. Consequently, the risk premium on 
the residential ground rents as at 31 December 2023 ranges between 1.80% and 2.69% on the senior notes and between 3.81% and 4.49% on the 
junior notes. The impact of these assumption changes is a decline in the value of the residential ground rent portfolio of £170m, of which £121m relates 
to assets held in the shareholder-backed fund. The corresponding impact to insurance contract liabilities and profit after tax is disclosed in note 32.7.3.

The equity release mortgages have a no-negative equity guarantee (NNEG) that caps the loan repayment in the event of death, or entry into long-term 
care, to be no greater than the proceeds from the sale of the property that the loans are secured against. The value of the NNEG, which is recognised as a 
deduction from the value of the loans, is based on a Black-Scholes option pricing valuation utilising a real-world approach and is estimated using 
assumptions, including future property growth rate and property price volatility.

The equity release mortgage loans of £928m as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £934m) and a corresponding liability of £239m (2022: £246m), which were 
valued internally using discounted cash flow models. Future cash flows are estimated based on assumptions, including prepayment, death and entry into 
long-term care, and discounted using an appropriate discount rate, which references market rates for equity release mortgage loans.

Infrastructure fund investments comprises £104m (31 December 2022: £213m) of equity securities and pooled investment funds and £220m 
(31 December 2022: £284m) of debt securities. These investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Association 
valuation guidelines (latest edition December 2022). Valuations are also benchmarked against comparable infrastructure fund transactions. The discount 
rate is made up of cash flows from dividends due in respect of the equity investments and principal and interest from loan notes in respect of debt 
investments.

These investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Association valuation guidelines (latest edition December 
2019). Valuations are also benchmarked against comparable infrastructure transactions. The discount rate is made up of cash flows from dividends due in 
respect of the equity investments and principal and interest from loan notes in respect of debt investments.

The discount rate is made up of a risk-free rate and a credit spread. The risk-free rate is taken from an appropriate gilt of comparable duration and the 
spread is taken from a basket of comparable securities.

vii Of the £6,725m (31 December 2022: £7,077m) of level 3 assets held in shareholder-backed funds, £367m (2022: £549m) is held by unit-linked business. 
These assets are included in the analysis presented however, as the investment risk is borne by the unit-linked policyholders, there is no impact on IFRS 
profit after tax and shareholder's equity. 

viii

Included within private placement loans is senior and junior notes backed by residential ground rent assets with a carrying value of £1,241m of which 
£859m were held in the shareholder-backed fund (2022: £1,423m of which £994m in the shareholder-backed fund) which are subject to the UK 
Government consultation mentioned in note 31.8.1. An increase in the illiquidity spread of 50bps would result in the value of the assets decreasing by 
£100m, of which £70m would relate to the assets held in the shareholder-backed fund. In the event of a ‘peppercorn cap’, the assets would have a value of 
close to Nil. The corresponding impact to insurance contract liabilities and profit after tax is disclosed in note 32.7.3.

31.9 Unrealised gains and losses in respect of level 3 assets and liabilities

The estimated fair value of subordinated liabilities are based on the quoted market offer price. The fair value of the liabilities in the

observable market interest rate has been used and the assets and liabilities are classified within level 2. Otherwise, they are 
included as level 3 assets or liabilities.

32 Risk management and sensitivity analysis
32.1 Risk overview

The Group’s business involves the acceptance and management of risk. The Group’s risk management process is governed by the 
Risk Management Framework (RMF). The RMF is designed to manage risk within agreed appropriate levels, aligned to delivering its 
strategy and creating long-term value for clients and shareholders. Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, 
managing and reporting current and emerging risks, supported by embedded risk culture and strong governance. Effective risk 
management enables better decision-making and safeguards its ability to meet commitments to its shareholders, customers and 
clients, comply with regulation, manage disruption and protects its reputation. For more information on the RMF, please refer to 
page 58.

Risk appetite is the amount and type of risk that the Group is willing to accept in pursuit of its business objectives, and is approved 
by the Board. The risk appetite statements and limits specify the risk appetite and tolerance to take on risk. The statements and 
thresholds are aligned to the business model and strategy and cover significant financial and non-financial risks. For more 
information on risk appetite and limits please refer to page 59.

A number of risk factors affect the Group’s results and financial position. The financial risk categories affecting the Group’s 
financial instruments and insurance assets and liabilities are set out below:

Risk type

Market risk

Credit risk

Definition

The risk of loss or adverse change in the financial situation of the business or that of the Group's customers 
and clients resulting, directly or indirectly, from fluctuations in the level or volatility of market prices of assets 
and liabilities.

The risk of loss or adverse change in the financial situation of the business, or that of the Group's customers 
and clients, resulting from fluctuations in the credit standing of issuers of securities, counterparties and any 
debtors in the form of default or other significant credit event, such as downgrade or spread widening.

Insurance risk

The risk of loss, or of adverse change in the financial situation of the business, or that of the Group's 
customers and clients, resulting from changes in the level, trend or volatility of the following:
– Morbidity/Mortality risk: the risk of unexpected impact resulting from adverse morbidity and/or 

mortality experience.

– Persistency risk: the risk of unexpected impact resulting from an adverse persistency experience.
– Expenses and margin pricing: the risk of unexpected impact resulting from adverse expense 

experience.

Liquidity risk

– Longevity: the risk of unexpected impact resulting from adverse longevity experience.

The risk that the Group and/or its business are unable to meet financial obligations (eg claims, creditors and 
collateral calls) as they fall due because they do not have or are unable to generate sufficient liquid assets. 
Fund liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet liabilities arising from a mismatch in liquidity of the 
underlying assets and the frequency of liability requirements of the fund.

These risks are described in more detail in the following sections.

The Group’s exposure to risks arising from financial instruments and insurance assets and liabilities is different for each component 
of the Group’s business. The Group’s consolidated statement of financial position is presented below for the different components 
of business.

32.2 Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss or adverse change in the financial situation of the Group's business or that of the Group's 
customers and clients resulting, directly or indirectly, from fluctuations in the level or volatility of market prices of assets and 
liabilities.

Market risk comprises six types of risk, namely:

– Interest rate risk: fluctuations in the level and volatility of interest rates or the shape or curvature of the yield curve or spread 

relationship

– Inflation risk: fluctuations in actual or implied inflation rates

– Equity risk: fluctuations in the level or volatility of equity investments

– Property risk: fluctuations in the level or volatility of property investments

– Currency risk: fluctuations, including translation risk, in the level or volatility of currency exposures

– Alternative investments risk: fluctuations in the level or volatility of alternative investment exposures

The primary market risks that the Group faces are equity risk, property risk and interest rate risk. Most assets the Group 
holds are investments that are either equity or property-type investments and subject to equity or property price risk, or 
bonds, mortgages and cash deposits, the values of which are subject to interest rate risk. Alternative investments may 
exhibit some or all of these risks depending on the type of investment. The amount of risk borne by the Group’s 
shareholders depends on the extent to which its customers share the investment risk through the structure of the Group’s 
products.

The split of the Group’s investments between equity investments and interest-sensitive instruments depends principally on 
the type of liabilities supported by those investments and the amount of capital the Group has available. This mix of liabilities 
allows the Group to invest a substantial portion of its investment funds in equity and property investments that the Group 
believes produce greater returns over the long term. 

Market risk is managed through a robust market risk framework which includes: policies, risk appetite statements and risk limits 
and triggers covering key market risk exposures; asset and liability management programmes; a quality of capital framework; 
strategic asset allocations; investment and hedging strategies; and investment constraints.

32.2.1 Interest rate risk and inflation risk
The majority of the Group’s interest rate exposure arises from shareholder-backed annuities. The liabilities are exposed to interest 
rate movements, but these are closely matched with assets of an appropriate duration. The matching of assets of appropriate 
duration to the annuity liabilities is based on management of regulatory capital reporting requirements. The assets held in excess of 
the liabilities, which back the capital requirements of the annuity business, result in an exposure to interest rate risk.

Exposure to interest rate risk also arises on the shareholders' share of the excess assets in the With-Profits Fund.

The assets and liabilities for the with-profits and unit-linked components of business are sensitive to interest rates, but the 
shareholder is not directly exposed to changes in the value of these assets and liabilities. The shareholder is indirectly exposed to 
interest rate risk through the value of future shareholder transfers from with-profits business and charges levied on unit-linked and 
asset management business.

Inflation risk primarily arises from certain annuity contracts that have benefit escalation linked to a price index. The Group manages 
this exposure by matching inflation-linked annuity liabilities with corresponding inflation-linked assets.

32.2.2 Equity and property risk 
While the Group holds significant amounts of equity and property assets on its consolidated statement of financial position, the 
shareholders' exposure to equity and property risk for the with-profits and unit-linked business is limited as the risk is 
predominantly borne by the policyholder. For with-profits business, the impact of market risk is reduced due to the 'smoothed' 
basis of bonus declaration, so the sensitivity to short-term investment performance is relatively low. However, long-term 
investment performance may affect future shareholder transfers. The Group has entered into a partial equity hedge of the 
shareholder transfers expected to emerge from the WPSF in order to mitigate this risk. 

The Group’s direct exposure to this risk arises from the 'annuities and other long-term business' component’s holdings in equity 
securities and property, which are not hedged or matched by corresponding liabilities.

32.2 Market risk (continued)

32.2.3 Currency risk
The Group invests significant amounts of policyholder funds in overseas assets as part of its investment strategy. The direct 
currency risk exposure to the shareholder from the with-profits and unit-linked components of business is minimal, although the 
shareholder is indirectly exposed to currency risk in relation to the future value of shareholder transfers from with-profits business 
and charges levied on unit-linked and asset management business. Currency risk exposure arising from overseas assets held by 
the shareholder-backed annuity and other long-term business is mitigated through the use of derivatives.

The currency risk analysis for the year ended 31 December 2022 presented below has been restated to better reflect the currency 
exposure of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group held 50% (2022: 48%) and 38% (2022: 38%) of its financial assets and financial liabilities 
respectively, in currencies other than pounds sterling, the presentation currency of the Group. The non-sterling currencies are 
primarily US dollar and euro. 

Of these financial assets, as at 31 December 2023, 92% (2022: 90%) are held by the With-Profits Fund, allowing the fund to obtain 
exposure to foreign equity markets. Of these financial liabilities, as at 31 December 2023, 74% (2022: 88%) are held by the With-
Profits Fund, mainly relating to foreign currency borrowings. The exchange risks inherent in these exposures are mitigated through 
the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts.

For the year ended 31 December 2023, exchange losses of £126m (2022 restated: gains of £576m) were recognised in the 
consolidated income statement; mainly arising on assets held by the With-Profits Fund, the majority of which are offset by changes 
in with-profits and unit-linked liabilities. This excludes exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency investments 
measured at FVTPL, which are included as part of gains and losses included in investment return, which is shown in Note 5.

The Group is also exposed to structural currency translation risk as a result of overseas operations which contribute to equity. The 
assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into the Group’s presentational currency, pounds sterling. Foreign 
exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in the translation reserve.

32.3 Credit risk

The Group’s exposure to credit risk primarily arises from the annuity funds, which hold substantial volumes of public and private 
fixed income investments on which a certain level of defaults and downgrades are expected. 

Exposure to the credit risk also arises on the shareholders' share of the excess assets in the With-Profits Fund.

While the with-profits and unit-linked funds have large holdings of assets subject to credit risk, the shareholder results of the 
Group are not directly exposed to credit defaults on assets held in these components of business. However, the shareholder is 
indirectly exposed to credit risk from these components of business in relation to the future value of shareholder transfers from 
with-profits business and charges levied on unit-linked and asset management business. The direct exposure of the Group’s 
shareholders' equity to credit default risk in the 'other' component is small in the context of the Group.

Credit risk is managed through a robust credit and counterparty framework which includes: policies, standards, appetite 
statements, limits and triggers (including relevant governance and controls); investment constraints and limits on the asset 
portfolios, in relation to credit rating, seniority, sector and issuer, and counterparties in particular for derivatives, reinsurance and 
cash; and a robust credit rating process.

32.3.1 Financial assets
The following tables provide an analysis of the quality of financial assets which are exposed to credit risk. The financial assets 
below are analysed according to external credit ratings issued, with equivalent ratings issued by different ratings agencies 
grouped together. Standard & Poor’s ratings have been used where available. For securities where Standard & Poor’s ratings are 
not immediately available, those produced by Moody’s and then Fitch have been used as an alternative.

In the table above, AAA is the highest possible rating. Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to 
BBB ratings. Financial assets which fall outside this range are classified as below BBB- and are non-investment grade.

The Group is exposed to the risk of counterparty default on its reinsurance assets. The Group evaluates the financial condition of 
its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk to minimise its exposure from reinsurer insolvencies. The split of the 
reinsurance asset by credit rating is shown above.

Loans that were impaired are not significant to the Group. Further information on the loans portfolio is provided in Note 18.

Debt securities with no external credit rating are classified as 'other'. The following table shows the majority of debt securities 
shown as 'other' are allocated an internal rating and are considered to be of investment grade quality:

32.3.3 Derecognition, collateral and offsetting
Securities lending and repurchase agreements
The Group has entered into securities lending and repurchase agreements whereby blocks of securities are transferred to third 
parties, primarily major brokerage firms, in exchange for collateral. Typically, the value of collateral assets pledged to the Group in 
these transactions is in excess of the value of securities transferred, with the excess determined by the quality of the collateral 
assets granted. Collateral requirements are calculated on a daily basis. The securities lent and securities subject to repurchase 
agreements are not derecognised from the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position. Collateral typically consists of 
cash, debt securities, equity securities and letters of credit. Cash collateral received is recognised on the consolidated statement of 
financial position and a financial liability for the obligation for the Group to repay the cash is also recognised. Non-cash collateral 
received is not recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position. Collateral pledged by the Group under reverse 
repurchase arrangements, aside from cash, is not derecognised from the consolidated statement of financial position as the risks 
and rewards are still retained by the Group. Cash collateral pledged is derecognised as it is pledged under right to use by the 
counterparty and a financial asset is recognised for the obligation for the counterparty to repay the cash to the Group. 

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had £7,308m (2022: £3,638m) of collateral pledged under securities lending and repurchase 
agreements, primarily relating to the With-Profits Fund. The cash and securities collateral accepted under securities lending 
agreements was £6,961m (2022: £5,471m). As at 31 December 2023, the Group had entered into reverse repurchase transactions 
under which it purchased securities and had taken on the obligation to resell the securities. The fair value of the collateral held in 
respect of these transactions was £10,165m (2022: £15,316m).

Collateral and pledges under derivative transactions
At 31 December 2023, the Group had pledged £2,116m (2022: £2,818m) for liabilities and held collateral of £468m (2022: £1,318m) 
in respect of over-the-counter derivative transactions. 

These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to collateralised transactions including, where 
relevant, standard securities lending and repurchase agreements.

Other collateral
At 31 December 2023, the Group had pledged collateral of £635m (2022: £552m) in respect of other transactions. This primarily 
arises from collateral pledged in relation to consolidated funds held by the With-Profits Fund, in addition to deferred purchase 
consideration on lifetime (equity release) mortgages.

Offsetting assets and liabilities
The Group’s derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are subject to master netting 
arrangements and collateral arrangements. A master netting arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts 
due to and due from that same counterparty that is enforceable in the event of a default or bankruptcy. The Group recognises 
amounts subject to master netting arrangements on a gross basis on the consolidated statement of financial position. 

The following tables present the gross and net information about the Group’s financial instruments subject to master netting 
arrangements:

In the tables above, the amounts of assets or liabilities included on the consolidated statement of financial position would be offset 
first by financial instruments that have the right of offset under master netting or similar arrangements, with any remaining amount 
reduced by the amount of cash and securities collateral. The actual amount of collateral may be greater than the amounts 
presented in the tables. Reverse repurchase agreements shown in the tables above are included within deposits on the 
consolidated statement of financial position.

32.3.4 Impairment of financial assets
Significant increase in credit risk
When determining whether the credit risk (ie risk of default) on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial 
recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or 
effort. This includes both qualitative and quantitative information and analysis based on the Group’s experience, expert credit 
assessment and forward-looking information.

The Group primarily identifies whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for an exposure by comparing:

– the remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) as at the reporting date; with

– the remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated on initial recognition of the exposure.

The Group considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than 30 days past due. 
Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment 
has not been received. Due dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the debtor.

Some qualitative indicators of an increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbearance, may be indicative of an increased risk 
of default that persists after the indicator itself has ceased to exist. In these cases, the Group determines a probation period during 
which the financial asset is required to show a period of good payment behaviour.

If there is evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, then the loss allowance 
on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL.

32.3 Credit risk (continued)

32.3.4 Impairment of financial assets (continued)
Low credit risk debt instruments
The Group has used the low credit risk exemption for financial instruments when they meet the following conditions:

– the financial instrument has a low risk of default;

– the borrower is considered to have a strong capacity to meet its obligations in the near term; and

– the Group expects, in the longer term, that adverse changes in economic and business conditions might, but will not necessarily, 

reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its obligations.

The Group considers a financial asset to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood 
definition of ‘investment grade’. The Group considers this to be BBB- or higher based on Moody's ratings. The Group defines low 
credit risk financial assets as financial assets that are BBB- investment grade at the reporting date, based on the Group’s credit 
grading policies. For such instruments, the significant increase in credit risk is not assessed, and the impairment allowance is 
calculated and the financial asset is measured using the 12-month ECL, as long as the financial asset meets the criteria above.

Definition of default
The Group considers any exposure to financial assets in default to be credit impaired. 

The impact of any collateral received will not be considered for the assessment of whether an asset is credit impaired. The 
collateral is considered for the estimate of the related ECLs.

Write-off
Financial assets are written off either partially or in their entirety only when the Group has stopped pursuing the recovery. If the 
amount to be written off is greater than the accumulated loss allowance, the difference is first treated as an addition to the 
allowance that is then applied against the gross carrying amount. Any subsequent recoveries are credited to credit loss expense.

Modified financial assets
The contractual terms of a financial asset may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions and 
other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the debtor. An existing financial asset whose terms have 
been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated asset recognised as a new financial asset at fair value plus eligible 
transaction costs. The new asset is allocated to Stage 1 under IFRS 9 (assuming that it is not credit-impaired at the date of 
modification). 

When the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, the determination of 
whether the asset’s credit risk has increased significantly reflects a comparison of: 

– its remaining lifetime PD as at the reporting date based on the modified terms; with 

– the remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data on initial recognition and the original contractual terms.

Measurement of ECL
Where modelling of a parameter is carried out on a collective basis, the financial instruments are grouped on the basis of shared 
risk characteristics, which include: 

– instrument type; 

– credit risk grade; 

– collateral type; 

– date of initial recognition; 

– remaining term to maturity; 

– industry; and 

– geographic location of the borrower.

The groupings are subject to regular review to ensure that exposures within a particular group remain appropriately homogeneous.

Loss allowance
The Group has used the low credit risk exemption for deposits and accrued investment income and other debtors and calculates 
the loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.  The carrying amounts and ECL allowances are shown in the following table:

There were no financial assets that were still subject to enforcement activity as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.

The table presenting an analysis of the credit risk exposure of financial instruments for which an ECL allowance is recognised is 
included in Note 32.3.1. The carrying amount of financial assets above also represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk 
on these assets.

32.4 Demographic and expense risk

The Group is exposed to significant levels of demographic risk. This arises mainly from the annuity business in the form of longevity 
risk, which is the risk of unexpected changes in the life expectancy (longevity) of policyholders. If mortality improvement rates 
significantly exceed the level assumed, the Group’s results could be adversely affected. Further to this, any major medical 
breakthrough (for example, in the treatment of cancer or other life-threatening diseases) that would require the Group to 
strengthen its longevity assumptions would have an impact on the Group’s results.

Longevity risk for both shareholder-backed business and policyholder-backed business has been predominantly managed 
through:

– Annual reviews of best estimate assumptions, supported by detailed assessments of actual mortality experience versus best 

estimate assumptions;

– Regular monitoring of longevity exposure;

– Longevity research; and

– Longevity risk transfer transactions, assessed against principles and guidance provided in internal standards.

The Group is also exposed to expense risk in relation to maintenance expense levels from the shareholder-backed annuity 
business.

For with-profits business, mortality and other demographic risks are relatively minor factors in the determination of the 
policyholder bonus rates. Adverse persistency experience can affect the level of profitability from with-profits contracts, but in any 
given year the shareholders’ share of cost of bonus may only be marginally affected. However, altered persistency trends may 
affect future expected shareholder transfers.

For unit-linked business, by virtue of the design features of most of the contracts which provide low levels of mortality cover, profit 
is relatively insensitive to changes in mortality experience. Persistency experience variances can affect the level of profit in the 
year. The shareholder is also exposed to variances in expenses relative to the charges levied on these products. 

The risk arising from the other long-term business is not significant in the context of the Group’s overall liabilities.

Liquidity risk is the risk of loss for the Group's business, or of adverse changes in the financial situation, resulting from the Group’s 
inability to meet financial obligations (for example, claims, creditors and collateral calls) as they fall due because they do not have or 
are unable to generate sufficient liquid assets.

Fund liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet liabilities arising from a mismatch in liquidity of the underlying assets and the 
frequency of liability requirements of the fund.

The Group’s IFRS results are indirectly exposed to fund liquidity risk, for example, through reputational damage leading to lower 
funds under management and lower revenue through charges collected. However, as the effect on the Group’s IFRS results is 
indirect, this risk is not discussed further and the remainder of this section refers to liquidity risk. 

Liquidity management in the Group seeks to ensure that, even under adverse conditions, the Group has access to the funds 
necessary to cover surrenders, withdrawals and maturing liabilities.

Liquidity risk is carefully managed, in particular in relation to: bank balances, cash flow forecasting, appropriate fund management 
(to ensure that assets are not unduly concentrated in less liquid investments) and detailed cash flow matching for the annuity 
business. Specific arrangements are also in place to manage liquidity in the unit-linked funds, particularly property funds where the 
underlying assets are relatively illiquid.

The comparative amounts have been restated for the first time adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9. See Note 1.2.1 for further information.

Most investment contracts have options to surrender early, often subject to surrender or other penalties. Therefore, most 
contracts can be said to have a contractual maturity of less than one year, but the additional charges and term of the contracts 
mean surrenders are unlikely to be exercised in practice.

The vast majority of the Group’s financial assets are held to back the Group’s policyholder liabilities. Although asset/liability 
matching is an important component of managing policyholder liabilities (both those classified as insurance and those classified as 
investments), this profile is mainly relevant for managing market risk rather than liquidity risk. Within each business unit this asset/
liability matching is performed on a portfolio-by-portfolio basis.

In terms of liquidity risk, a large proportion of the policyholder liabilities contain discretionary surrender values or surrender 
charges, meaning that many of the Group’s liabilities are expected to be held for the long term. Many of the Group’s investment 
portfolios are in marketable securities, which can therefore be converted quickly to liquid assets. As a result, an analysis of the 
Group’s assets by contractual maturity is not considered appropriate to evaluate the nature and extent of the Group’s liquidity risk.

The following tables provide a maturity analysis of the Group’s insurance and reinsurance contract liabilities, which reflects the 
dates on which the cash flows are expected to occur. The Group has elected to analyse the estimates of the present value of the 
future cash flows by estimated timing. It excludes the release of the CSM which is in Note 24.4. 

For reinsurance contracts held 98% (2022: 99%) relates to annuity and other long-term business contracts and so analysis by each

32.6 Derivatives and hedging

The Group uses derivatives for the purpose of efficient portfolio management or the reduction in investment risk. In doing so, the 
Group obtains cost-effective and efficient exposure to various markets and manages exposure to equity, interest rate, currency, 
credit and other business risks. The Group has opted not to apply hedge accounting to derivatives.

The Group uses various interest rate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and swap options to reduce exposure to 
interest rate volatility. The Group also uses various currency derivatives in order to limit volatility due to foreign currency exchange 
rate fluctuations arising on securities denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.

All over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transactions are conducted under standardised International Swaps and Derivatives 
Association Inc (ISDA) master agreements and Credit Support Annexes (CSA). The Group has collateral agreements between the 
individual entities in the Group, of which the Company is one, and relevant counterparties in place under each of these market 
master agreements. The Group also has the ability to enter into cleared derivative positions under European Market Infrastructure 
Regulation (EMIR).

The total fair value balances of derivative assets and liabilities are shown in Note 18.

There are hedging arrangements in place for the with-profits liabilities, including some product-specific arrangements. The actual 
and required hedging positions are monitored at least monthly and rebalanced if required.

Under Article 11 of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation on derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories 
EMIR and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251 supplementing EMIR, market participants transacting in non-cleared 
OTC derivatives are required to exchange collateral to cover variation and initial margin. However, trades between counterparties 
belonging to the same group are exempt from these margin requirements subject to certain criteria. 

Prudential Capital Plc (Legal Entity Identifier reference (LEI) CHW8NHK268SFPTV63Z64) has entered into such derivative 
agreements with the following group entities. These counterparties pairings meets the criteria to be eligible for intra-group 
exemptions to the margin requirements:

32.6.1 Hedges in respect of shareholder transfers arising from the with-profits business
The shareholders' exposure to market risk from with-profits business arises from the shareholder transfers which depend on 
investment return of the funds. These shareholder transfers, while smoothed, are particularly exposed to equity risk. 

The Group has entered into a partial equity hedge of the shareholder transfers expected to emerge from the WPSF in order to 
mitigate this risk. The effect for the year ended 31 December 2023 was an unrealised loss of £8m (2022: unrealised gain of £121m) 
and a realised loss of £109m (2022: realised loss of £119m).

PAC's shareholder fund had also previously entered into a risk management arrangement with the WPSF in relation to the 
shareholder transfers expected to emerge from the WPSF, specifically with regard to the PruFund new business written during 
2018 to 2020. This arrangement was designed to protect the shareholders against extremely weak market returns. This 
arrangement was terminated in 2023. The arrangement resulted in a £9m realised loss for the year ended 31 December 2023 
(2022: unrealised loss of £8m).

In 2023, PAC's shareholder fund entered into a further arrangement with the WPSF in relation to the shareholder transfers 
expected to emerge from PruFund business written to 31 December 2022. The shareholder fund accepted a one-off cash 
payment in lieu of 20% of future shareholder transfers. This arrangement is mutually beneficial since it generates certainty and 
cash for the shareholder while reducing the WPSF exposure to a potential mismatch between the value of the shareholder 
transfers and the fixed charges taken to cover those transfers. In addition, under the arrangement the shareholder paid the WPSF 
for a higher share of future surplus from certain cohorts of business. For the year ended 31 December 2023 this arrangement 
resulted in a loss of £36m (2022: n/a).

32 Risk management and sensitivity analysis (continued)
32.6 Derivatives and hedging (continued)

32.6.2 Other shareholder hedging arrangements
The Group’s shareholder fund has purchased interest rate swap instruments to protect the capital position against interest rate 
movements. For the year ended 31 December 2023, these instruments resulted in an unrealised gain of £116m (2022: unrealised 
loss of £803m) and a realised loss of £36m (2022 unrealised loss of: £186m).

32.7 IFRS profit and liability sensitivity analysis

The Group uses a wide ranging stress and scenario testing approach to, among other things, understand the potential volatility of 
earnings, and capital requirements and for the purposes of efficient capital management. Results of the IFRS profit and liability 
sensitivity analysis for the long-term business to reasonable possible movements in key economic and non-economic risk factors 
are summarised below (sensitivity of the capital position is detailed separately in the supplementary notes). For sensitivities arising 
from financial assets refer to Note 31.8.

The risks are described in further detail throughout this note. For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in 
a single factor is shown, with other assumptions left unchanged. The sensitivities applied are described below. The sensitivities 
capture the immediate effects of an event occurring, as opposed to the longer-term or second-order effects which may impact 
future years’ profits, and do not reflect management actions which could be taken to mitigate the impacts of these events 
occurring. The results shown include the impacts on both the with-profits business and the non-profit annuity business.

The interest rate stresses reflect a parallel shift in the nominal rate of interest at all durations. As described in Note 32.2.1, the 
impact on IFRS profit after tax predominantly arises from assets held in excess of the IFRS liabilities. These assets are held to back 
the regulatory capital requirements.

The main impact to the Group of changes in equity and property asset values is through the entity’s share of the returns in the with-
profits fund through future shareholder transfers. Under IFRS reporting, the change in expected future profits adjusts the CSM and 
is released over the remaining lifetime of the business. The key impact to post-tax profit arises from the change in the level of CSM 
amortised in the current reporting period.

The impact of the non-economic sensitivities to expenses, mortality and mortality improvements are the opposite of the result that 
may be expected, and which may be seen in other financial metrics (eg in general we would expect an increase in mortality rates 
would result in an increase in IFRS profits, whereas a reduction is observed in the stress scenario). As detailed in Note 3.2, the 
application of IFRS 17 results in mismatches due to the use of locked-in rates for the CSM for annuities under GMM and in relation 
to the measurement of the non-profit business in the With-Profits Fund. This results in the sensitivity analysis reflecting an increase 
in IFRS profits when there is a strengthening of mortality assumptions, whereas the opposite effect might have been expected. The 
primary reasons for this are i) interest rates at the time of recognising most of the in-force annuity business were substantially 
lower than current rates, resulting in a larger reduction in the CSM (from discounting the change in future cash flows at locked-in 
rates) than the increase in the fulfilment cash flows (from discounting the change in future cash flows at current rates), and ii) the 
fair value of non-profit business written in the With-Profits Fund is reflected in the liabilities for with-profits policyholders, resulting 
in a mismatch in the timing of when the change in mortality assumptions impacts the with-profits liabilities and when the IFRS 17 
CSM for non-profit business is recognised as insurance revenue.

As described above, the main impacts of the sensitivities on profit arise through either short-term fluctuations in investment 
returns or through mismatches arising on the application of IFRS 17. As a result there is limited impact on adjusted operating profit 
(in line with the methodology detailed in Note 3.2).

The presentation above reflects a change in insurance contract liabilities where insurance contract liabilities are expressed as a 
positive liability amount and reinsurance contracts are a positive asset amount. Insurance contracts are insurance contract 
liabilities net of insurance contract assets. Reinsurance contracts are reinsurance contract assets net of reinsurance contract 
liabilities.

32 Risk management and sensitivity analysis (continued)
32.7 IFRS profit and liability sensitivity analysis (continued)

32.7.2 Sensitivity – Insurance and investment contract liabilities (continued)
The vast majority of the Group’s financial assets are held to back the Group’s policyholder liabilities. Consistent with this, the 
changes in the insurance and investment contract liabilities in the economic sensitivities are offset by corresponding changes in 
the value of the assets, with only the changes in the surplus assets contributing to changes in profit after tax (as detailed in Note 
32.7.1).

32.7.3 Other estimates in measurement of insurance contract liabilities
As a consequence of applying the mutualisation requirements of IFRS 17, a portion of the with-profits surplus assets are allocated 
to policyholders and a portion to shareholders. Under IFRS 4, this was included within the unallocated surplus of the With-Profits 
Fund. The portion of the with-profits surplus assets allocated to policyholders and shareholders under IFRS 17 reflects a judgement 
on the division of surplus in the With-Profits Fund. The policyholders’ share is assessed on a prospective basis and is assumed to 
be 90%, consistent with the division of profits permitted by the Articles of Association. The portion of the surplus assets allocated 
to shareholders, £1,037m (after tax) at 31 December 2023 (2022: £1,053m) is not easily or practicably fungible to shareholders in 
the short term. 

IFRS 17 liabilities include an explicit risk adjustment, covering the Group’s assessment of the margin required to cover non-financial 
risks. The assessment of the risk adjustment requires assumptions about the compensation that the Group requires for bearing 
uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk, the most significant of which is the 
assumed rates of policyholder mortality for annuity contracts. The Group has calibrated the risk adjustment at the 75th percentile 
of its internal calibrations of the risk distributions (which have a time horizon of one year) and amounts to £488m (2022: £478m) net 
of reinsurance. Increasing the calibration to the 80th percentile (over a one year time horizon) would increase the risk adjustment 
(net of reinsurance) at 31 December 2023 by around £90m (2022: £90m). The increase would be offset by a corresponding 
reduction in CSM, but with the CSM impact being assessed at locked-in rates as described above.

The UK Government's consultation on residential ground rents has had an impact on the value of the assets that back insurance 
contract liabilities as discussed in note 31.8.1. The main impact on the insurance contract liabilities has been through a change in 
discount rate which has resulted in the carrying value decreasing by £98m, of which £50m relates to annuities which are 
shareholder-backed. 

The net asset and liability impact is to reduce profit after tax by £54m in 2023.

If the yield on the residential ground rents were to increase by 50bps to reflect a change in illiquidity spread (aligned to the asset 
sensitivity in note 31.8.2), the carrying value of the insurance contract liabilities will decrease by £50m, of which £22m would relate 
to the annuities which are shareholder-backed. 

The net asset and liability impact of an increase in spread of 50bps would be to reduce the profit after tax by £38m.

In the event that the Government implements the peppercorn cap, the value of the insurance contract liabilities would be impacted 
due to a change in the overall portfolio yield on the writing down of the underlying residential ground rent assets. The impact would 
be dependent on replacement assets that are used to rebalance the portfolio.

32.7.4 Limitations
The sensitivity results demonstrate the effect of an instantaneous change in a key assumption while other assumptions remain 
unchanged. In reality, changes may occur over a period of time and there may be a correlation between the risks. The sensitivity 
analysis does not take into consideration active management of the Group’s assets and liabilities, and that this may change the 
impact of an emerging risk scenario. It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts 
should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results. 

The sensitivity analysis includes the use of ‘hypothetical’ market movements to demonstrate potential risk exposures, for example:

– The sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rates at all terms. These results cannot be used to calculate the impact 

of non-parallel yield movements.

– The sensitivity analysis assumes equivalent assumption changes across all markets eg all equity and property assets rise (fall) by 

10%. The actual impact on the Group’s assets may not be identical to the observed changes in market indices and so actual 
impacts on the Group cannot be inferred by applying the sensitivities to observed changes in key indices.

33 Contingencies and related obligations
33.1 Litigation, tax and regulatory matters

In addition to the matters set out in Note 10.3 regarding the portfolio dividend tax litigation, the Group is involved in various 
litigation and regulatory issues. While the outcome of such litigation and regulatory issues cannot be predicted with certainty, the 
Directors believe that their ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition, results of 
operations, or cash flows.

33.2 Guarantees

Guarantee funds provide for payments to be made to policyholders on behalf of insolvent life insurance companies and are 
financed by payments levied on solvent insurance companies based on location, volume and types of business. The estimated 
reserve for future guarantee fund assessments is not significant, and adequate reserves are available for all anticipated payments 
for known insolvencies.

M&G plc acts as guarantor for certain property leases where a Group company is a lessee. The most material of these is the 
guarantee provided in respect of the 10 Fenchurch Avenue lease between Saxon Land B.V. and M&G Corporate Services Limited.

The Group has also received guarantees in respect of subleasing arrangements, entered into in the normal course of business.

On acquisition of a controlling interest in MGSA, M&G Group Limited provided a guarantee in respect of an existing loan facility 
between Thesele, the seller of MGSA, and Nedbank, a third party bank amounting to ZAR 220m. The guarantee is secured on 7% of 
the shares that Thesele retains in MGSA.

On acquisition of 49.9% holding in My Continuum Financial Limited (MCFL) Limited, the holding company Continuum (Financial 
Services) LLP (CFSL) and My Continuum Wealth (MCW), M&G Regulated Entity Holding Company Limited (M&G REH) provided a 
guarantee in respect of the obligations under the Sale and Purchase agreement up to a maximum value of £33m. 

M&G REH is guarantor for the obligations of M&G Corporate Services Limited to make payments under the Scottish Amicable Staff 
Pension Scheme.

The Group has also provided other guarantees and commitments to third parties entered into in the normal course of business, but 
the Group does not consider that these would result in a significant unprovisioned loss.

33.3 Support for the With-Profits Fund by shareholders

PAC is liable to meet its obligations to with-profits policyholders even if the assets of the with-profits sub-funds are insufficient to 
do so. The assets in excess of amounts expected to be paid for future terminal bonuses and related shareholder transfers ('the 
excess assets') in the with-profits sub-funds could be materially depleted over time by, for example, a significant or sustained 
equity market downturn. In the unlikely circumstance that the depletion of the excess assets within the with-profits sub-funds was 
such that the Group’s ability to satisfy policyholders’ reasonable expectations was adversely affected, it might become necessary 
to restrict the annual distribution to shareholders or to contribute shareholders’ funds to the with-profits sub-funds to provide 
financial support.

There are a number of additional arrangements between the shareholder and the With-Profits Fund as follows:

– The With-Profits Fund contributed to the costs of establishing the Polish branch of PAC, and receives repayment through 

income from charges levied on the business. There is an obligation on the shareholders to ensure that the with-profits fund will 
be repaid in full with interest, and an amount is recognised for the estimated cost to the shareholder of any shortfall at the end of 
the term of the agreement. The policyholders share of the impact is included in the insurance contract liabilities for the with-
profits fund, with changes in value recognised in finance income or expenses from insurance contracts issued in the 
consolidated income statement. The amount held within insurance contract liabilities is £56m as at 31 December 2023 
(2022: £32m).

– Part of the acquisition costs incurred in the early years of M&G Wealth Advice Limited (formerly Prudential Financial Planning 

Limited) were funded by the With-Profits Fund. In return, M&G Wealth Advice Limited is required to deliver cost savings to the 
With-Profits Fund. In the event of closure of M&G Wealth Advice or, the cost savings not being delivered and M&G Wealth 
Advice stops writing new business, the shareholder will reimburse the With-Profits Fund for any remaining shortfall. The time 
period for repayment is not defined.

– Transformation costs associated with with-profits new business will be recovered in the pricing of future new business (subject 
to a shareholder underpin whereby the shareholder will compensate the With-Profits Fund if any of these costs are not fully 
recovered at the end of the term of the agreement). The policyholders’ share of the impact is included in the insurance contract 
liabilities for the With-Profits Fund, with changes in value recognised in finance income or expenses from insurance contracts 
issued in the consolidated income statement. The amount held within insurance contract liabilities is £6m as at 31 December 
2023 (2022: £nil).

33.3 Support for the With-Profits Fund by shareholders (continued)

– PAC has undertaken a project to rationalise fund structures (The Target Investment Model programme) achieved by combining 
existing, smaller funds with the main With-Profits asset share fund in a fund umbrella structure, and is expected to yield various 
benefits for the business over time. If expected benefits do not materialise to the With-Profits Fund, the shareholder is 
committed to compensate the fund for any implementation costs borne which were not fully recouped. The assessment period 
for the underpin arrangement is five years, running to the end of 2025.

– PAC has priced new with-profits business on a basis that is expected to be financially self-supporting or, where this has not been 

the case, the shareholder is required to cover the cost (known as the New Business Supportability Test (NBST)). The 
policyholders share of the impact is included in the insurance contract liabilities for the With-Profits Fund, with changes in value 
recognised in finance income or expenses from insurance contracts issued in the consolidated income statement. The amount 
held within insurance contract liabilities is £15m as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £6m).

The following matters are of relevance with respect to the With-Profits Fund: 

33.3.1 Pension mis-selling review
The Pensions mis-selling review covers customers who were sold personal pensions between 29 April 1988 and 30 June 1994, and 
who were advised to transfer out, not join, or opt out of their employer's Defined Benefit Pension Scheme. During the initial review 
some customers were issued with guarantees that redress will be calculated on retirement or transfer of their policies. The 
expense to cover these customers continues to be recognised within insurance contract liabilities.

While PAC believed it met the requirements of the FSA (the UK insurance regulator) to issue offers of redress to all impacted 
customers by 30 June 2002, there is a population of customers who, while an attempt was made at the time to invite them to 
participate in the review, may not have received their invitation. These customers have been re-engaged, to ensure they have the 
opportunity to take part in the review. The liability also covers this population. Currently, an expense amounting to £140m as at 
31 December 2023 (2022: £226m) is being held in relation to this within insurance contract liabilities.

The key assumptions underlying the liability are:

– average cost of redress per customer;

– proportion of liability (reserve rate) held for soft close cases (where all reasonable steps have been taken to contact the 

customer but the customer has not engaged with the review).

Sensitivities of the value of the liability to a change in assumptions are as follows:

+/-30

Changes in the value of the pension mis-selling liability would not immediately impact profit or loss as the changes would be offset 
by changes in the allowance for mutualisation and the CSM.

Costs arising from this review are met by the excess assets of the with-profits sub-fund and hence have not been charged to the 
asset shares used in the determination of policyholder bonus rates. An assurance was given that these deductions from excess 
assets would not impact PAC's bonus or investment policy for policies within the with-profits sub-funds that were in force at 31 
December 2003. This assurance does not apply to new business since 1 January 2004. In the unlikely event that such deductions 
would affect the bonus or investment policy for the relevant policies, the assurance provides that support would be made available 
to the sub-fund from PAC's shareholder resources for as long as the situation continued, so as to ensure that PAC's policyholders 
were not disadvantaged. PAC’s comfort in its ability to make such support available was supported by related intra-group 
arrangements between Prudential plc and PAC, which formalised the circumstances in which capital support would be made 
available to PAC by Prudential plc. These intra-group arrangements terminated on 21 October 2019, following the demerger of 
M&G plc from Prudential plc, at which time intra-group arrangements formalising the circumstances in which M&G plc would make 
capital support available to PAC became effective. 

33.3.2 With-profits options and guarantees
Certain policies within the With-Profits Fund give potentially valuable guarantees to policyholders, or options to change policy 
benefits which can be exercised at the policyholders’ discretion. These options and guarantees are valued as part of the 
policyholder liabilities. Please refer to Note 24 for further details on these options and guarantees.

34 Commitments
The Group leases various offices to conduct its business. In line with the requirements of IFRS 16, the Group has recognised a lease 
liability in respect of these leases representing the obligation to make future lease payments. For further information on the lease 
liability see Note 27.

In addition, the Group has provided, from time to time, certain guarantees and commitments to third parties including funding the 
purchase or development of land and buildings and other related matters. The contractual obligations to purchase or develop 
investment property as at 31 December 2023 were £711m (2022: £805m). Commitments also arise in relation to the refurbishment 
of investment properties, however these would not be material to the financial statements, either individually or in aggregate.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had undrawn commitments of £3,773m to third parties (2022: £4,027m) of which £2,618m 
(2022: £2,566m) was committed by its private equity and infrastructure funds. These commitments were entered into in the normal 
course of business and no material adverse impact on the operations is expected to arise.

35 Related party transactions
The Group and its related parties comprise members of the M&G plc Group, as well as the Group’s joint ventures and associates, 
and any entity controlled by those parties. 

35.1 Transactions with the Group’s joint ventures and associates 

The Group received dividends of £89m for the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: £91m) from joint ventures or associates 
accounted for using the equity method. In addition, the Group had balances due from joint ventures or associates accounted for 
using the equity method of £43m as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £88m). There were no balances due to joint ventures or 
associates accounted for using the equity method at 31 December 2023 or 31 December 2022.

Furthermore, in the normal course of business a number of investments into and divestment from investment vehicles managed by 
the Group were made. This includes investment vehicles which are classified as investments in associates and joint ventures 
measured at FVTPL. The Group entities paid amounts for the issue of shares or units and received amounts for the cancellation of 
shares or units. These transactions are not considered to be material to the Group.

35.2 Compensation of key management personnel

The members of the Board and the Group Executive Committee are deemed to have power to influence the direction, planning and 
control the activities of the Group, and hence are also considered to be key management personnel.

Key management personnel of the Company may from time to time purchase insurance, asset management or annuity products 
marketed by the Group companies in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the 
time for comparable transactions with other persons. 

Other transactions with key management personnel are not deemed to be significant either by virtue of their size or in the context 
of the key management personnel’s respective financial positions. All of these transactions are on terms broadly equivalent to 
those that prevail in arm’s length transactions.

The summary of compensation of key management personnel is as follows:

36 Capital management
36.1 Capital regulations of entities within the Group

The Group is regulated under Solvency II and supervised as an insurance group by the Prudential Regulation Authority. The Group 
manages Solvency II own funds as its measure of capital. As at 31 December 2023 estimated and unaudited Group Solvency II own 
funds are £11.3bn (2022: £11.8bn).

The Solvency II surplus represents the aggregated capital (own funds) held by the Group less the solvency capital requirement 
(SCR). Own funds is the Solvency II measure of capital available to meet losses, and is based on the assets less liabilities of the 
Group, subject to certain restrictions and adjustments. The SCR is calculated using the Group's Internal Model, which calculates 
the SCR as the 99.5th percentile (or 1-in-200) worst outcome over the coming year, out of 100,000 equally likely scenarios, 
allowing for the dependency between the risks the business is exposed to.

The regulated entities within the Group are also subject to local capital regulations. Capital is actively managed to ensure that local 
regulatory requirements are met. The main regulated entities in the Group and the regulatory framework to which they must 
adhere are listed below:

Investment Firms Prudential Regime under MIFIDPRU – Prudential Sourcebook for MiFID Investment Firms.

All Group entities that were subject to externally imposed regulatory capital requirements complied with them throughout the year.

36.2 Group capital position

In 2020, the Government announced that it would undertake a review of the Solvency II regime. Following a consultation process, 
His Majesty's Treasury (HMT) has published the final proposed Solvency II reform package and plans for implementing the changes 
to the UK’s prudential regime. 

The reforms to the risk margin, moving to a modified cost of capital approach with a reduction in the cost of capital from 6% to 4%, 
have been implemented as at 31 December 2023. The lower cost of capital and increase in the rate at which the risk margin runs off 
have resulted in a reduction in risk margin of c.£800m (unaudited). This is largely offset by a corresponding reduction in the 
Transitional Measure on Technical Provisions (TMTP); the net impact is a c.£74m (unaudited) increase in surplus, largely arising 
because there is no TMTP in respect of the PIA business. As part of the reform package, the PRA also invited firms to apply for 
removal of the Financial Resources Requirement (FRR) restriction, which limits the amount of TMTP benefit. PAC received approval 
to remove the restriction as at 31 December 2023, resulting in an increase in surplus of £103m (unaudited). The total impact of 
implementing the Solvency II reforms is £177m (unaudited). 

Reforms of the matching adjustment (MA) are expected to come into force as at 30 June 2024. The proposals include greater 
investment flexibility, revised MA eligibility rules, and more flexibility in processes. They also cover a requirement for senior 
manager attestations on the level of Fundamental Spread and MA, and changes to the way the MA is calculated (eg requiring a 
greater level of granularity in the calculation) and reported (eg the introduction of a new regular Matching Adjustment Asset and 
Liability Information Return).

The remainder of the new reforms are expected to come into force as at 31 December 2024. 

Furthermore, the impact of the UK Government's consultation on residential ground rents has been reflected in the capital position. 
The overall impact is a decrease in own funds due to the fall in the valuation of the underlying residential ground rent asset which is 
offset partly by a fall in the value of the technical provisions due to the changes in portfolio yield. 

In addition, incremental capital has been held in the SCR to reflect the implementation of the ‘peppercorn cap’ in a stand-alone 1-
in-200 event. However, there is significant diversification against the Group’s existing risk exposure, which results in the diversified 
risk capital being materially lower than the full loss amount and therefore, reflects the diversified impact of the possible outcomes 
set out in the consultation. 

This net impact of the items stated above is a reduction in surplus of £264m.

36.2 Group capital position (continued)

36.2.1 Regulatory capital position
The regulatory capital position of the Group takes into account all Group exposures, including that of the With-Profits Fund. This 
view of capital recognises the ring-fenced nature of the With-Profits Fund, and on consolidation, surplus in the fund can only be 
recognised to the level of associated SCR with any excess surplus being eliminated as a ring-fenced fund restriction, effectively 
restricting the solvency coverage ratio of the With-Profits Fund to 100%. As such, the combined 'regulatory' solvency coverage 
ratio is highly resilient to movements in the With-Profits Fund's own funds.

The estimated and unaudited Solvency II capital position for the Group as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 is shown below:

Solvency II coverage ratio has been calculated using unrounded figures.

The results include transitional measures, which are presented assuming a recalculation as at the valuation date, using 
management’s estimate of the impact of operating and market conditions. As at 31 December 2022, the recalculated transitional 
measures did not align to the latest approved regulatory position and therefore the estimated and unaudited Solvency II capital 
position differed from the position disclosed in the formal regulatory Quantitative Reporting Templates and Group Solvency and 
Financial Condition Report of the same date. As at 31 December 2023, the recalculation has been approved for the reporting date 
and the positions are aligned.

36.2.2 Shareholder capital position 
The Group focuses on a shareholder view of the Solvency II capital position, which is considered to provide a more relevant 
reflection of the capital strength of the Group. The Group's shareholder Solvency II capital position excludes the contribution to 
own funds and SCR from the ring-fenced With-Profits Fund. Further information on the ring-fenced With-Profits Fund's capital 
position is provided in Section 1.5 of Supplementary Information. Shareholder Solvency II own funds also assume transitional 
measures on technical provisions which have been recalculated using management’s estimate of the impact of operating and 
market conditions at the reporting date (regardless as to whether the recalculation was approved for the reporting date).

The estimated and unaudited shareholder Solvency II capital position for the Group is shown below.

36.3 Meeting of capital management objectives

The Group manages its capital on a Solvency II basis to ensure that sufficient own funds are available on an ongoing basis to meet 
regulatory capital requirements. This is achieved by targeting a capital buffer significantly in excess of regulatory capital 
requirements. This buffer is intended to absorb the impact of stressed market conditions and thus make the Solvency II balance 
sheet under the regulatory view resilient to stresses that affect the Group’s business. 

A range of stress and scenario testing is carried out across the business, including certain scenarios mandated by the regulator. 
The sensitivity of liabilities and other components of total capital vary, depending upon the type of business concerned, and this 
influences the approach to asset/liability management.

In addition, projections are performed to understand how the own funds and capital position is expected to develop and how this 
might be affected by adverse events taking place. Informed by the results of these projections there are a number of actions 
available to management to strengthen the own funds position. 

As well as holding sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements, the Group also closely manages the cash it holds so that it can:

– maintain flexibility, fund new opportunities and absorb shock events;

– meet liabilities to policyholders and other obligations;

– fund dividends; and

– cover central costs and debt payments.

37 Share-based payments
The Group operates various share-based payment schemes that award M&G plc shares to participants upon meeting the required 
vesting conditions. Details of those schemes are stated below:

37.1 Description of the plans

Discretionary schemes initiated prior to demerger:

Scheme

Description

Long-term 
Incentive Plan 
(LTIP)

The LTIP is a conditional share plan: the shares awarded will ordinarily be released to participants after three 
years to the extent that performance conditions have been met. 
If performance conditions are not achieved in full, the unvested portion of any award lapses. 
The performance conditions attached to LTIP awards include market performance conditions; Relative 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR); and other non-market conditions, including measures linked to profit. 
The performance conditions attached to each award are dependent on the role of the participants. 
Threshold and maximum achievement levels will be set at the beginning of the performance periods in line 
with the business plan. The last of these awards vested in 2022.

Annual Incentive 
Plan (AIP)

Certain senior executives participate in the AIP where a portion of the individual's bonus is delivered 
in the form of shares that are released after three years. There are no performance conditions associated 
with the plan. The last of these awards vested in 2022.

Group Deferred 
Bonus Plan (GDBP)

Under these plans, part of the participant’s annual bonus is paid in the form of a share award that vests after 
three years. Other than the service condition, there are no other performance conditions associated with 
this plan. The last of these awards vested in 2022.

Restricted Share 
Plan (RSP)

Awards under this plan are discretionary and ad hoc, and the vesting of awards may be subject to 
performance conditions. These awards may be retention awards, new joiner awards and promotion 
related awards. The last of these awards vested in 2023.

Prior to demerger, all discretionary schemes mentioned above were based on Prudential plc awards. At the point of demerger and 
subsequent listing of M&G plc, all outstanding discretionary awards were replaced with equivalent awards based on M&G plc 
shares. The scheme rules for the awards remain the same in principle, except for the LTIP awards, for which the relevant metrics 
would be based on M&G plc as opposed to Prudential plc performance.

In accordance with IFRS 2, the replacement awards have been accounted for as a modification of the previous scheme and the 
expense in relation to the scheme will continue to be recorded over the remaining vesting period.

Discretionary schemes initiated post-demerger:

Scheme

Description

Performance 
Share Plan (PSP)

The PSP is a conditional share plan: the shares awarded will ordinarily be released to participants after a 
predetermined period, usually three years, to the extent that performance conditions have been met. 
If performance conditions are not achieved in full, the unvested portion of any award lapses. The 
performance conditions attached to PSP awards include market performance conditions; Relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR); and other non-market conditions, including measures linked to profit as well as 
sustainability-related measures. The performance conditions attached to each award are dependent on the 
role of the participants. Threshold and maximum achievement levels will be set at the beginning of the 
performance periods in line with the business plan.

Deferred Incentive 
Plan (DIP)

Under these plans, part of the participant’s Annual Bonus is paid in the form of a share award that vests 
after three or four years. Other than the service condition, there are no other performance conditions 
associated with this plan.

Approved schemes:

Share scheme

Description

Save As You Earn 
(SAYE) plans

The Group operates SAYE plans, which allow eligible employees the opportunity to save a monthly amount 
from their salaries, over either a three or five-year period, which can be used to purchase shares in M&G plc 
at a predetermined price subject to the employee remaining in employment for three years after the grant 
date of the options and satisfying the monthly savings requirement. 

Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP)

The Group operates SIPs, which allow eligible employees to invest a monthly or annual amount from their 
salaries in M&G plc shares; M&G plc will then contribute a share for every two the employee purchases. 

All approved and discretionary schemes are accounted for as equity-settled as the awards would be settled in M&G plc shares.

37.4 Share-based payment expense charged to the consolidated income statement

Total expenses recognised in the year in the consolidated financial statements relating to equity-settled share-based 
compensation as at 31 December 2023 was £32m (2022: £34m). The Group has no outstanding liabilities at the year end relating to 
awards which are settled in cash.

38 Post-balance sheet events
On 27 February 2024, the With-Profits Fund declared a distribution of £3.5bn to the policyholders comprised of the annual with-
profits bonus declaration, and an extra distribution to eligible policyholders. 

On 19 March 2024, the Group, via M&G Wealth Advice Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired a further 25.05% 
stake in My Continuum Financial Limited (MCFL), the holding company of Continuum (Financial Services) LLP and My Continuum 
Wealth, collectively referred to as 'Continuum', a fast-growing in-house discretionary Model Portfolio Service. The execution of this 
second tranche increases the Group’s holding from 49.90% to 74.95% and results in the Group gaining control over MCFL. The 
results of Continuum will be consolidated in the Group’s financial statements going forward.

Notes to the Company financial statements

Company accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation

These separate financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101) and Part 15 
of the Companies Act 2006.

In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-
adopted international accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. 

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost basis and are presented rounded 
to the nearest million pounds sterling, see Note 1 of the Group financial statements for information of the Directors’ assessment of 
the going concern basis.

The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in 
accordance with FRS 101:

– Statement of compliance with IFRS

– Outstanding shares comparative

– Requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including statement of cash flows

– Additional comparative information

– Capital management disclosures

– Statement of cash flows

– Financial instruments disclosure

– Effect of IFRSs issued but not effective

– Related party transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries

The Company adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for the first time from 1 January 2018. This did not have a material 
impact on the Company as it does not hold significant financial instruments. This differs from the Group treatment whereby the 
Group met the required eligibility criteria for temporary exemption and the adoption of IFRS 9 was deferred until 1 January 2023 to 
coincide with the adoption of IFRS 17.

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its own income 
statement in these financial statements. The auditors' remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in Note 9 of the Group 
financial statements. During the year, the Company had two (2022: three) employees.

(b) Key judgements and critical accounting estimates 

A full list of the Company’s material accounting policies is provided in Section (c) of this Note below. 

The preparation of these financial statements require management to apply judgement in relation to certain accounting policies. In 
addition, management have to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses arising during the year. Estimates are 
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 

The area which required management to apply critical accounting estimates and assumptions which were material to the financial 
statements is as follows:

Financial statement area

Key estimate and assumptions

Impairment of 
investment in 
subsidiaries

When assessing impairment of subsidiaries where indicators of impairment exist the 
carrying value is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair 
value less cost of disposal and value-in-use. The determination of the recoverable 
amount, especially in relation to the value-in-use calculation requires the use of 
various assumptions that can have a material impact on the calculation.

Accounting 
policy

(c) (ii)

Note

A

(c) Critical accounting policies 

(i) Dividend income
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders' right to receive payments has been established.

(ii) Investment in subsidiaries
Investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost less, where appropriate, allowances for impairment. Investments are reviewed annually 
to assess whether there are indicators of impairment. Where indicators of impairment exist, the carrying value of the investment in 
the subsidiary is compared against its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell or the value-in-use, 
with any resulting impairment recorded in the income statement.

Company accounting policies (continued)
(c) Critical accounting policies (continued)

(ii) Investment in subsidiaries (continued)
Investment in subsidiaries under common control transactions which are acquired as part of a group reorganisation are recorded 
at fair value of the consideration received, which is deemed to be the cost at the point of initial recognition. Any gains and losses 
arising on disposal of subsidiaries are recorded in profit or loss.

(iii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand with an original maturity date of 90 days or less. Cash and cash 
equivalents are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and 
are subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9.

(iv) Tax
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date and any adjustment to income tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax is charged or credited to the 
income statement, except when it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax
Deferred taxes are provided under the liability method for all relevant temporary differences. IAS 12 'Income Taxes' does not 
require all temporary differences to be provided for, in particular, the Company does not provide for deferred tax on undistributed 
earnings of subsidiaries where the Company is able to control the timing of the distribution and the temporary difference created is 
not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is more likely than not that 
future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised. 

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, 
based on tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.

(v) Share capital and share premium
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Shares are classified as equity when their terms do not create an obligation to transfer assets. The nominal value of 
shares issued is recorded in share capital.

Where the consideration received from the issue or sale of existing shares exceeds the nominal value recorded in share capital, the 
difference is recorded in share premium. Share premium is recorded net of share issue costs. 

(vi) Treasury shares
Where any of the Group entities purchase the Company’s share capital, the consideration paid, including any attributable
transaction costs, is shown as a deduction from total shareholders’ equity.

(vii) Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve arises from the cancellation of shares following the share buy-back programme in 2022. 

(viii) Dividends
Dividends are recognised when the obligation becomes certain, ie, when the dividend is no longer at the discretion of the 
Company. In the case of interim dividends, this occurs when the dividends are paid. For final dividends, this occurs when they are 
recommended by the Board and approved by shareholders.

(ix) Subordinated liabilities 
Subordinated liabilities include loan notes issued by the Company which are classified as financial liabilities as they have a fixed 
repayment date and do not represent a residual interest in the net assets of the Company on liquidation. The notes rank junior to all 
other liabilities of the Company in the event of liquidation, but above share capital.

Subordinated liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs. 

(x) Share-based payments
All share-based payments made to employees for services rendered are measured based on the fair value of the equity instrument 
granted. The fair value takes into account the impact of market-based vesting conditions and non-vesting conditions, but excludes 
any impact of non-market-based vesting conditions. The related share-based payment expense is recognised over the vesting 
period. The fair value may be determined using an option pricing model such as Black-Scholes, where appropriate, taking into 
account the terms and conditions of the award. 

For equity-settled share-based payments, the fair value of service rendered is based on the fair value of the equity instrument at 
grant date which is not remeasured subsequently. The share-based payment expense is based on the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest over the vesting period, with the corresponding entry to equity.

(x) Share-based payments (continued)
For cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of service rendered is based on the fair value of the related liability to the 
equity instrument granted. The fair value equity instrument granted is remeasured at each reporting date with any changes 
recognised in the share-based payment expense for the period.

A cancellation of an award without the grant of a replacement equity instrument is accounted for as an acceleration of vesting. 
Accordingly, any share-based payment expense that would have been recognised over the remaining vesting period is recognised 
immediately.

Where replacement equity instruments are granted to employees in place of the cancelled equity instruments, the replacement 
award is treated as a modification of the original award. At the point of replacement, the awards are remeasured to the fair value at 
the date of replacement, which forms the basis of recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period.

(xi) Provisions and contingent assets and liabilities
Provisions are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation 
resulting from a past event, it is probable that a loss will be made in settling the obligation and the amounts can be estimated 
reliably.

Provisions are measured based on management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the 
reporting date. Provisions are discounted and represent the present value of the expected expenditure where the effect of the 
time value of money is material. 

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations of the Company where the timing and amount are subject to significant uncertainty. 
Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the statement of financial position, unless they are assumed by the Company as part of 
a business combination. Contingent liabilities are however disclosed, unless they are considered to be remote. If a contingent 
liability becomes probable and the amount can be reliably measured it is no longer treated as contingent and is recognised as a 
liability. 

Contingent assets which are possible benefits to the Company are only disclosed if it is probable that the Company will receive the 
benefit. Mirroring the treatment of contingent liabilities, if such a benefit becomes virtually certain, it is no longer considered 
contingent and is recognised on the statement of financial position as an asset.

(xii) Financial instruments
Recognition and initial measurement
A financial asset is initially measured at fair value plus, for a financial asset not measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), 
transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.

Classification and subsequent measurement
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified and measured at either amortised cost or FVTPL.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

– it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

– its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 

amount outstanding.

All financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost, as described above, are measured at FVTPL. 
This includes assets that are held for trading or are part of a portfolio that is managed on a fair value basis. 

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the entity changes its business model for 
managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period 
following the change in the business model.

Financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, 
are recognised in profit or loss.

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The 
amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are 
recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

Impairment losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost are measured using an expected credit loss impairment model. 
Impairment losses representing the expected credit loss in the next 12 months are recognised unless there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk from initial recognition, in which case, lifetime expected losses are recognised. Where relevant, the Company 
makes use of the exemption available for financial instruments with low credit risk, for which, an assessment of a significant 
increase in credit risk is not required.

(iv) Impairment
An impairment of £933m was recognised in relation to the Company’s investment in M&G Group Regulated Entity Holding 
Company Limited (M&G REH) during the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: none).

M&G REH is the main subsidiary of the Company and acts as the main holding entity for all of the Group’s regulated businesses. An 
impairment assessment was undertaken in relation to the subsidiary by comparing its recoverable amount with the carrying value. 

The recoverable amount of the subsidiary was based on its value in use. As the subsidiary acts as a holding company with no 
operations, the value in use was determined as the sum of the values in use of the underlying subsidiaries in which the subsidiary 
has investment in. At 31 December 2023, the M&G Group Limited (MGG) and The Prudential Assurance Company Limited (PAC) 
collectively represented 96% of the carrying value of M&G REH. The values in use of these material indirect subsidiaries were 
determined based on discounted cash flows and standard growth models based on management forecasts.

The impairment recorded this year partly includes the impact of write-downs in the value of the asset management and platform 
businesses, MGG and Investment Funds Direct Limited (IFDL) respectively, recorded in previous years. This was primarily due to 
the prevalent macroeconomic volatility and its impact on market valuations and consumer demand. These write-downs had 
previously been off-set by the headroom in the insurance business, PAC, which resulted in no impairment being required in the 
financial statements of the Company. However, this year, the headroom on the valuation of PAC has been eroded resulting in an 
impairment in the value of the business and the crystallisation of impairment losses previously recognised in respect of the 
investment in MGG and IFDL.

Notes to the Company financial statements continued

A. Investment in subsidiaries (continued)
The valuation of PAC has had to be reduced due to general decline in market multiples seen in the insurance sector during the year 
and the assumptions used to determine the terminal value in the value in use basis. Also, allowance has been made for uncertainty 
by risk adjusting the cash flows used in the terminal value due to the inherent uncertainties involved in the growth of the new 
Corporate Risk and Investments Solutions which includes the entry into the bulk purchase annuity market and other propositions 
launched that will be linked to the with-profits fund.

The value in use calculation of the underlying subsidiaries is based on a set of economic, market and business assumptions used to 
derive the cash flow forecasts. The calculation is particularly sensitive to a number of key assumptions as follows:

– In respect of MGG, the value in use was calculated using a standard growth model, using a discount rate of 11%, based on a 
weighted average cost of capital approach, and a long-term growth rate of 2%. A simultaneous increase of 50 bps in the 
discount rate and 50bps decrease in the growth rate would result in the carrying value of MGG reducing by £288m. This would 
result in an impairment of £288m recorded by the Company in respect of M&G REH.

– In respect of PAC, the value in use was calculated using a dividend discount model, using a discount rate of 11%, based on a cost 
of equity approach, and an implied price/own funds multiple of 0.67x to determine the terminal value. A simultaneous increase of 
50bps in the discount rate and a 10% decrease in the price/own funds multiple would result in the carrying value of PAC 
reducing by £472m. This would result in an impairment of £472m recorded by the Company in respect of M&G REH. 

No impairment was recognised in relation to any other of the Company’s subsidiaries.

B. Tax 
(i) Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Under IAS 12, deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability settled, based on tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable, that is to the extent that, on the basis of all 
available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying temporary differences can be deducted or tax losses utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when 
there is both a legal right to set off and an intention to settle on a net basis.

Of the £138m (2022: £141m) deferred tax assets at 31 December 2023, £77m (2022: £83m) relates to short-term timing differences 
arising on the subordinated notes and £56m (2022: £55m) on tax losses carried forward. The remaining £5m (2022: £3m) relates to 
the deferred tax asset on share-based compensation. The prior year income statement movement primarily relates to £55m on 
unutilised tax losses carried forward and the amortisation of the subordinated liabilities in the period.
Unrecognised deferred tax
Retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries are expected to be re-invested indefinitely or remitted to the UK free from further 
taxation by virtue of Parent Company exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and on capital gains on disposal. Consequently, 
the Company does not consider there to be any significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in 
subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint arrangements.

1.1 Alternative performance measures

Overview of the Group's key performance measures
The Group measures its financial performance using a number of key performance measures (KPM). The Group also uses a number 
of alternative performance measures (APM), which are most commonly derived from the financial statements prepared in 
accordance with the IFRS financial reporting framework or the Solvency II requirements, but are not defined under IFRS or 
Solvency II. The APMs are used to complement and not to substitute the disclosures prepared in accordance with IFRS and 
Solvency II, and provide additional information on the long-term performance of the Group. 

A list of the APMs used by the Group along with their definitions and how they can be reconciled to the nearest IFRS or Solvency II 
measure, where applicable, is provided in the table below.

All information included in this section does not form part of the independent audit performed by the external auditors.

The Group’s KPMs are summarised below, along with which of these measures are considered APMs by the Group. 

Key performance 
measure

IFRS result after 
tax

Adjusted 
operating profit 
before tax 

Type

Definition

KPM IFRS result after tax demonstrates to our shareholders the financial performance of the Group during 

the year on an IFRS basis.

APM, 
KPM

Adjusted operating profit (AOP) before tax is the Group’s non-GAAP alternative performance 
measure, which complements the IFRS GAAP measures and is useful as it allows a deeper 
understanding of the Group's performance over time. It is therefore key to decision-making and the 
internal performance management of our operating segments.

Certain adjustments that are considered to be non-recurring or strategic, or due to short-term 
movements not reflective of longer-term performance are made to the IFRS result before tax to 
determine adjusted operating profit before tax. Adjustments are in respect of short-term fluctuations 
in investment returns, mismatches arising on the application of IFRS 17, costs associated with 
fundamental Group-wide restructuring and transformation, profits or losses arising on corporate 
transactions, impairment and amortisation in respect of acquired intangible assets, and, where 
relevant, profit/(loss) from discontinued operations. Included in the adjustments is the elimination on 
consolidation of the results of the intercompany buy-in transaction executed between the trustees of 
M&G Group Pension Pension Scheme (M&GGPS) and PAC in 2023 which are included in AOP before 
tax. AOP before tax does not include the impact of any margins on investment management fee 
earned by other Group entities and these are recognised in the Asset Management segment as they 
emerge.

Operating 
change in CSM

APM, 
KPM

The AOP methodology has been updated following the adoption of IFRS 17 'Insurance contracts' and 
is described in Note 3.2, along with a reconciliation of AOP before tax to IFRS result after tax.
Operating change in Contractual Service Margin (CSM) is a new APM introduced on the adoption of 
IFRS 17 and supplements the AOP metric for the Life and Wealth segments.

Operating change in CSM represents changes resulting from new business, interest accretion, 
experience changes and release of CSM but excludes the impact of short-term market movements 
and mismatches arising on the adoption of IFRS 17. The impact on these items also includes the 
intercompany buy-in transaction, consistent with AOP. 

For the VFA business, non-operating includes the variance between long-term expected returns and 
actual returns and the impact of the mismatch arising on the application of the GMM to the non-
profits business written in the With-Profits Fund, similar to the methodology for AOP. 

The APM is a useful measure of economic value generated as it includes the impact of new business 
and management actions taken during the year, which are not included in AOP.
Net client flows represent gross inflows less gross outflows and provides useful insight into the 
growth of the business. Gross inflows are new funds from clients. Gross outflows are money 
withdrawn by clients during the period. This measure does not include the net outflows in our 
Heritage business, which is mostly closed to new clients, as it runs off but consists of net client flows 
in Asset Management, PruFund and Other Wealth.

Net client flows includes flows on assets held on the Group’s consolidated statement of financial 
position for our clients, and external client flows on assets belonging to wholesale and institutional 
clients outside of the Group which are not included in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial 
position and as a result, this measure is not directly reconcilable to the financial statements.

(AUMA)

Type

Definition

APM,
KPM

Closing AUMA represents the total market value of all assets managed, administered or advised on 
behalf of clients at the end of each financial period and is a key indicator of the scale of the business. 
Assets managed by the Group include those managed on behalf of our institutional and wholesale 
clients.

Assets administered by the Group include assets which we provide investment management services 
for, in addition to assets we administer where the client has elected to invest in a third party 
investment manager. 

Assets under advice are advisory portfolios where clients receive investment recommendations such 
as Strategic Asset Allocation & model portfolios but retain discretion over executing the advice.

AUMA includes assets recognised in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position 
together with certain assets administered by the Group belonging to external clients outside of the 
Group which are therefore not included within the Group’s statement of financial position and, as a 
result, this measure is not directly reconcilable to the financial statements.

Shareholder 
Solvency II 
coverage ratio

APM, 
KPM

Management focuses on a shareholder view of the Solvency II coverage ratio, which is considered to 
provide a more useful reflection of the capital strength of the Group. The shareholder view includes 
future with-profits shareholder transfers, but excludes the shareholders’ share of the ring-fenced 
with-profits estate.

The regulatory Solvency II capital position considers the Group’s overall own funds and SCR.

The shareholder Solvency II coverage ratio is the ratio of own funds to SCR, excluding the 
contribution to own funds and SCR from the Group’s ring-fenced With-Profits Fund. Own funds 
assume transitional measures on technical provisions which have been recalculated using 
management’s estimate of the impact of operating and market conditions at the valuation date. Both 
the shareholder view and the regulatory view reflect eligible own funds, in line with the thresholds set 
by the regulator that set out how much capital of each tier can be used to demonstrate solvency.

APM For insurance entities and their underlying subsidiaries, underlying capital generation includes the

expected Solvency II surplus capital generated from in-force business and the impact of writing new 
life insurance business. For non-insurance entities, underlying capital generation is equal to adjusted 
operating profit before tax, with certain adjustments made in respect of items that do not reflect the 
underlying result. It also includes other items such as head office expenses and debt interest costs 
that contribute to the underlying capital position of the business.

Operating capital generation is the total capital generation before tax, adjusted to exclude market 
movements relative to those expected under long-term assumptions and to remove other non-
operating items, including shareholder restructuring and other costs. Management use this as an 
indicator on the longer-term components of the movements in the Group’s surplus capital as it is less 
affected by short-term market volatility and non-recurring items as total capital generation.

Total capital generation measures the change in surplus capital during the period, before dividends 
and capital movements. Management consider it to be integral to the running and monitoring of the 
business, our decisions on capital allocation and investment, and ultimately our dividend policy. 
Surplus capital is the amount by which eligible own funds exceed SCR under Solvency II.

1.3 Operating change in Contractual Service Margin (CSM)

The CSM balances split by line of business disclosed in Note 24 include the CSM attributable to policyholders arising from non-
profit annuities written in the With-Profits Fund and the CSM in respect of M&G Group Limited (MGG) future profits from the 
management of PAC assets that arises on consolidation of the Group entities. The change during the year in the CSM attributable 
to policyholders and the CSM from the MGG future profits from the management of PAC assets is not included in operating change 
in CSM and is included in non-operating and other changes in the CSM. 

The CSM arising on the underlying products based on the actual investment management charges applied to the policies and 
excluding the CSM attributable to policyholders is shown in the tables below. The amortisation factor for the CSM each year is 
based on the CSM in the table.

Operating change in CSM and reconciliation to total CSM is further analysed in the tables below:

earned by Group entities are excluded. Therefore, the numbers above for New business differ to the values for contracts initially recognised in the period 
in Note 24.2 analysis by measurement component.

1.5 Solvency II capital position

Solvency II overview
The Group is supervised as an insurance group by the Prudential Regulation Authority. Individual insurance undertakings within the 
Group are also subject to the supervision of the Prudential Regulation Authority (or other supervisory authorities) on a solo basis 
under the Solvency II regime.

The Solvency II surplus represents the aggregated capital (own funds) held by the Group less the Solvency Capital Requirement 
(SCR). Own funds is the Solvency II measure of capital available to meet losses, and is based on the assets less liabilities of the 
Group, subject to certain restrictions and adjustments. Available own funds reflect all capital available to the Group and eligible 
own funds are net of restrictions applied in line with the thresholds set by the regulator that limit the amount of each tier of capital 
that can be used to demonstrate solvency. The SCR is calculated using the Group's Internal Model, which calculates the SCR as the 
99.5th percentile (or 1-in-200) worst outcome over the coming year, out of 100,000 equally likely scenarios, allowing for the 
dependency between the risks the business is exposed to.

The key items in the reconciliation are explained below:

– Goodwill and intangible assets: these assets are not recognised under Solvency II as they are not readily available to meet 

emerging losses.

– Policyholder liability and reinsurance asset valuation differences: there are significant differences in the valuation of technical 

provisions between IFRS 17 and Solvency II. One of the key drivers of the increase in equity moving from IFRS 17 to Solvency II is 
the requirement to hold a CSM and risk adjustment under IFRS 17; these are removed under Solvency II. In addition, IFRS 17 
captures the shareholder share of surplus assets on the With-Profits Fund in shareholder equity whereas 100% of with-profits 
surplus assets are captured in Solvency II excess of assets over liabilities, however this is subsequently restricted by the ring-
fenced fund restrictions. This increase in equity is partially offset by differences in the liability discount rate; the IFRS17 discount 
rate includes an illiquidity premium which is slightly higher than the Solvency II matching adjustment on annuity business, 
resulting in slightly higher annuity liabilities under IFRS 17.

– Solvency II risk margin (net of transitional measures): the risk margin is a significant component of technical provisions required 
to be held under Solvency II. These additional requirements are partially mitigated by transitional measures which allow the 
impact to be gradually introduced over a period of 16 years from the introduction of Solvency II on 1 January 2016.

– Subordinated debt capital: subordinated debt is treated as a liability in the IFRS financial statements and in determining the 

excess of assets over liabilities in the Solvency II balance sheet. However, for Solvency II own funds, the debt can be treated as 
capital.

– Ring-fenced fund restrictions: any excess of the own funds over the solvency capital requirement from the With-Profits Fund is 

restricted as these amounts are not available to meet losses elsewhere in the Group. 

– There are limits, prescribed by the regulator, on the amount of different types of own funds that can be used to demonstrate 

solvency. As at 31 December 2023, the sum of capital classed as Tier 2 and Tier 3 exceeds 50% of the regulatory Group Solvency 
Capital Requirement by £216 million. While this capital remains available to the Group, as it is above this regulatory threshold 
own funds must be restricted by this amount to determine eligible own funds.

The Group’s Tier 2 capital consists of subordinated debt instruments. The terms of these instruments allow them to be treated as 
capital for the purposes of Solvency II. The instruments were originally issued by Prudential plc, and subsequently substituted to 
the Parent Company, as permitted under the terms and conditions of each applicable instrument, prior to demerger. The details of 
the Group’s subordinated liabilities are shown in Note 26. The Solvency II value of the debt differs to the IFRS carrying value due to 
a different basis of measurement on the respective balance sheets. 

The Group's Tier 3 capital of £0.5bn (2022: £0.6bn) relates to deferred tax asset balances.

As stated above, the eligible own funds restriction reflects the fact that the sum of Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital exceeds the threshold 
set by the regulator for the purpose of demonstrating solvency, although the capital above this threshold remains available to the 
Group.

Estimated shareholder view of the Solvency II capital position
The Group focuses on a shareholder view of the Solvency II capital position, which is considered to provide a more relevant 
reflection of the capital strength of the Group.

Solvency II coverage ratio has been calculated using unrounded figures. On a regulatory approved transitional measures on technical provisions basis, the 
surplus is £4.5bn (2022: £4.8bn) and the solvency coverage ratio is 167% (2022: 168%).

The results include transitional measures, which are presented assuming a recalculation as at the valuation date, using 
management's estimate of the impact of operating and market conditions. As at 31 December 2022, the recalculated measures did 
not align to the latest approved regulatory position and therefore the estimated Solvency II capital position differed from the 
position disclosed in the formal regulatory Quantitative Reporting Templates and the Group Solvency and Financial Condition 
Report of the same date. As at 31 December 2023, the recalculated and regulatory positions are aligned. 

1.6 Capital generation 

The level of surplus capital is an important financial consideration for the Group. Capital generation measures the change in surplus 
capital during the reporting period, and is therefore considered a key measure for the Group. It is integral to the running and 
monitoring of the business, capital allocation and investment decisions, and ultimately the Group’s dividend policy. 

The overall change in Solvency II surplus capital over the period is analysed as follows: 

Total capital generation is the total change in Solvency II surplus capital before dividends and capital movements, and capital 
generated from discontinued operations. As set out in the overview of the Solvency II capital position, as at 31 December 2023 
eligible own funds has been restricted by £216m (2022: £Nil) as the sum of tier 2 and tier 3 capital is above the threshold set by the 
regulator, although the capital remains available to the Group.

Operating capital generation is the total capital generation before tax, adjusted to exclude market movements relative to those 
expected under long-term assumptions and to remove other non-operating items, including shareholder restructuring and other 
costs as defined under adjusted operating profit before tax. It has two components: 

i Underlying capital generation, which includes: the underlying expected surplus capital from the in-force life insurance business; 

the change in surplus capital as a result of writing new life insurance business; the adjusted operating profit before tax and 
associated regulatory capital movements from Asset Management; and other items, including head office expenses and debt 
interest costs. 

ii Other operating capital generation, which includes non-market related experience variances, assumption changes, modelling 

changes and other movements. 

Dividends and capital movements primarily represent external dividends paid to shareholders, the impact of the share buy-back 
programme and changes to the capital structure of the Group, such as issuing or repaying debt instruments. Also included within 
capital movements are the Solvency II impact of the Group’s share-based payment awards over and above the amount expensed in 
respect of those awards, and the surplus utilised or generated from transactions relating to the acquisition of business as defined 
by IFRS.

The expected surplus capital from the in-force life insurance business is calculated on the assumption of real-world investment 
returns, which are determined by reference to the risk-free rate plus a risk premium based on the mix of assets held for the 
relevant business. For with-profits business, the assumed average return was 4.0% for the year ended 31 December 2023 
(2022: 4.1%). For annuity business, the assumed average return on assets backing capital was 6.6% for the year ended 
31 December 2023 (2022: 2.2%).

The Group’s capital generation results in respect of the years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 are shown below 
alongside a reconciliation of the total movement in the Group’s Solvency II surplus. The reconciliation is presented showing the 
impact on the shareholder Solvency II own funds and SCR, which excludes the contribution to own funds and SCR from the 
Group’s ring-fenced With-Profits Fund. The shareholder Solvency II capital position, and how this reconciles to the regulatory 
capital position, is described in detail in the previous section of this supplementary information.

Average AUMA represents the average total market value of all financial assets managed and administered on behalf of clients during the financial period. 
Average AUMA is calculated using a 13-point average of monthly closing AUMA for full-year periods.

Fee margin is calculated by annualising underlying fee-based revenues earned, which excludes performance fees, in the period divided by average AUMA 
for the period. Fee margin relates to the total margin for internal and external revenue.

1.8 Credit risk 

The Group’s exposure to credit risk primarily arises from the annuity portfolio, which hold substantial volumes of public and private 
fixed income investments on which a certain level of defaults and downgrades are expected.

While the with-profits and unit-linked funds have large holdings of assets subject to credit risk, the shareholder results of the 
Group are not directly exposed to credit defaults on assets held in these components of business. However, the shareholder is 
indirectly exposed to credit risk from these components of business in relation to the future value of shareholder transfers from 
with-profits business and charges levied on unit-linked and asset management business. The direct exposure of the Group’s 
shareholders’ equity to credit default risk in the Other component is small in the context of the Group.

Credit risk is managed through a robust credit and counterparty framework which includes: policies, standards, appetite 
statements, limits and triggers (including relevant governance and controls); investment constraints and limits on the asset

Bonuses refer to the non-guaranteed benefit added to participating life insurance policies and 
are the way in which policyholders receive their share of the profits of the policies. There are 
normally two types of bonus:

guaranteed that a regular bonus will be added each year, but once it is added, it cannot be 
reversed, also known as annual or reversionary bonus.

– Final bonus: an additional bonus expected to be paid when policyholders take money from the 
policies. If investment return has been low over the lifetime of the policy, a final bonus may not 
be paid. Final bonuses may vary and are not guaranteed.

Scottish Amicable 
Insurance Fund (SAIF)

Sustainable Finance 
Disclosure Regulation 
(SFDR)

Was a ring-fenced sub-fund of the With-Profits Fund following the acquisition of the mutually 
owned Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society in 1997. The fund is solely for the benefit of 
policyholders of SAIF. On 1 April 2021 SAIF merged with PAC’s main with-profits sub-fund and 
the assets and liabilities of SAIF combined with those of the with-profits sub-fund.

The EU’s SFDR is a regulation designed to make it easier for investors to distinguish and 
compare between the many sustainable investment strategies that are now available within the 
European Union; the framework classifies asset managers’ funds as either an article 6, 8, or 9 
funds depending on their level of sustainability, and regardless if they are promoting their fund as 
an ESG investment.

Shareholder Solvency II 
coverage ratio

Is the ratio of eligible own funds to solvency capital requirement (SCR), excluding the 
contribution to own funds and SCR from our ring-fenced With-Profits Fund.

Solvency II

Solvency II surplus

Taskforce on Nature-
Related Financial

Task Force on Climate-
Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD)

A SICAV is an open-ended investment fund offered by European financial companies, similar to 
the UK’s unit trust. SICAVs are effectively share companies aimed at collectively investing the 
assets collected through the public offering of shares, whose value amounts to the net worth of 
capital account divided by their number.

SCR represents the 99.5th percentile (or 1-in-200) worst outcome over the coming year, out of 
100,000 equally likely scenarios, allowing for the dependency between the risks the business is 
exposed to. The SCR is calculated using our Solvency II Internal Model.

A regime for the prudential regulation of insurance companies that was introduced by the EU on 
1 January 2016.

Solvency II surplus represents the eligible Own Funds that we hold less the solvency capital 
requirement.

Is an international initiative that builds on a model developed by the TCFD. Its mission is to 
provide a framework for how organisations can address nature-related risks and opportunities 
with the ultimate goal of channelling capital flows into positive action.

Created by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to develop consistent climate-related financial risk 
disclosures. The FCA require all premium listed companies to disclose, on a comply or explain 
basis, against the recommendations of the TCFD. The TCFD has now been disbanded with the 
IFRS Foundation (ISSB) taking over the monitoring of companies climate-related disclosures 
from the FSB.

Total capital generation

Is the total change in Solvency II surplus capital, on an eligible own funds basis, before dividends 
and capital movements, and capital generated from discontinued operations.

Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR)

TSR represents the growth in the value of a share plus the value of dividends paid, assuming that 
the dividends are reinvested in the Company’s shares on the ex-dividend date.

Transitional measures on 
technical provisions (TMTP)

Transitional measures on technical provisions are an adjustment to Solvency II technical 
provisions, to smooth the impact of the change in the regulatory regime on 1 January 2016. This 
decreases linearly over 16 years following the implementation of Solvency II, but may be 
recalculated in certain cases, subject to agreement with the PRA.

Disclaimer on forward-looking statements

Information provided in climate and sustainability disclosures

This document may contain certain ‘forward-looking statements’ with 
respect to M&G plc (M&G) and its affiliates (the Group), its plans, its current 
goals and expectations relating to future financial condition, performance, 
results, operating environment, strategy and objectives. Statements that are 
not historical facts, including statements about M&G’s beliefs and 
expectations and including, without limitation, statements containing the 
words ‘may’, ‘will’, ‘could’, ‘should’, ‘continue’, ‘aims’, ‘estimates’, ‘projects’, 
‘believes’, ‘intends’, ‘expects’, ‘plans’, ‘seeks’, ‘outlook’ and ‘anticipates’, and 
words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. These statements 
are based on plans, estimates and projections which are current as at the 
time they are made, and therefore persons reading this announcement are 
cautioned against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements. By 
their nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent assumptions, risk 
and uncertainty, as they generally relate to future events and circumstances 
that may not be entirely within M&G’s control. A number of factors could 
cause M&G’s actual future financial condition or performance or other 
indicated results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-
looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to:changes in 
domestic and global political, economic and business conditions; market-
related conditions and risk, including fluctuations in interest rates and 
exchange rates, the potential for a sustained low-interest rate environment, 
corporate liquidity risk and the future trading value of the shares of M&G; 
investment portfolio-related risks, such as the performance of financial 
markets generally; legal, regulatory and policy developments, such as, for 
example, new government initiatives and regulatory measures, including 
those addressing climate change and broader sustainability-related issues, 
and broader development of reporting standards; the impact of competition, 
economic uncertainty, inflation and deflation; the effect on M&G’s business 
and results from, in particular, mortality and morbidity trends, longevity 
assumptions, lapse rates and policy renewal rates; the timing, impact and 
other uncertainties of future acquisitions or combinations within relevant 
industries; the impact of internal projects and other strategic actions, such as 
transformation programmes, failing to meet their objectives; changes in 
environmental, social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and 
similar events beyond the Group’s control; the Group’s ability along with 
governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the 
impacts of climate change and broader sustainability-related issues 
effectively; the impact of operational risks, including risk associated with 
third-party arrangements, reliance on third-party distribution channels and 
disruption to the availability, confidentiality or integrity of M&G’s IT systems 
(or those of its suppliers); the impact of changes in capital, solvency 
standards, accounting standards or relevant regulatory frameworks, and tax 
and other legislation and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates; and the impact of legal and regulatory actions, investigations 
and disputes. These and other important factors may, for example, result 
in changes to assumptions used for determining results of operations or 
re-estimations of reserves for future policy benefits. Any forward-looking 
statements contained in this document speak only as of the date on which 
they are made. M&G expressly disclaims any obligation to update any of the 
forward-looking statements contained in this document or any other 
forward-looking statements it may make, whether as a result of future 
events, new information or otherwise except as required pursuant to the UK

Annual Report and Accounts may be amended and updated, as market 
practice and data quality and availability develop, and underlying 
judgements, assumptions and estimates change. These factors could also 
lead to actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or 
conditions differing from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any 
forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate and 
sustainability disclosures. 

Disclaimer

In preparing the climate and sustainability content included within the 
Group’s Annual Report and Accounts, we have:

– made key judgements, estimations and assumptions, for example in 
relation to financed emissions, measurement of climate risk and 
scenario analysis.

– used climate and sustainability models, methodologies and data most 
appropriate and suitable as at the date on which they were used, but 
which are subject to certain limitations. These limitations relate to (but 
are not limited to): the nascent and evolving nature of methodologies 
in this area which results in limited availability of reliable climate and 
sustainability-related data; data gaps; limited ability to rely on 
historical data; the limited standardisation of climate and 
sustainability-related data; and future uncertainty (due to, amongst 
other factors, changing projections arising from technological 
development and legal, regulatory and policy change). 

– used climate and sustainability models, methodologies and data in this 
Annual Report and Accounts that may have been made available by 
third parties or other public sources – The methodologies, 
interpretations or assumptions underpinning that information may not 
be capable of being independently verified and may therefore be 
inaccurate. Whilst the Group bears primary responsibility for the 
information included in this annual report, it does not accept 
responsibility for the external input provided by any third parties for 
the purposes of developing the information included in this Annual 
Report and Accounts; 

– noted that there are external factors which are outside of our control, 

such as changes in accounting and/or reporting standards, 
improvements in data quality and data availability, or updates to 
methodologies and models and/ or updates or restatements of data 
by third parties, which could affect the climate and sustainability 
content within the Annual Report and Accounts. In particular, we note 
that, as climate and sustainability-related models, methodologies and 
data, market principles and reporting standards evolve and mature, 
and data quality and availability in this area improves, this may impact 
the metrics, data, and targets included in the climate and sustainability 
content within this Annual Report and Accounts. As such, we may look 
to review and further develop our approach accordingly to reflect such 
developments. In future reports, we may present some or all of the 
information for this reporting period, using updated or more granular 
data or improved models or methodologies. We may also need to re-
baseline, restate, revise, or recalculate information included in our 
climate and sustainability-related data on the basis of such updated 
information.
