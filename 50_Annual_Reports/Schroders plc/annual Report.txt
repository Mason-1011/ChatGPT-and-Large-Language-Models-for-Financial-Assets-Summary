Chair’s statement

Long-term  
active strategy

Dame Elizabeth Corley
Chair

We delivered an increase in our assets 
under management to £750.6 billion and 
attracted new clients with net new business 
of £9.7 billion (before joint ventures and 
associates), a notable achievement given 
the difficulties facing active asset managers 
across the world. We are pleased with the 
quality of new business we secured, but 
acknowledge that this was not sufficient to 
deliver year-on-year bottom line growth 
despite rigorous and thoughtful cost control. 
In 2023, we reported operating profit of 
£661.0 million and profit before tax of 
£487.6 million. 

As Peter Harrison, our Group Chief Executive, 
and Richard Oldfield, Chief Financial Officer, 
set out in their sections of this report, we 
have managed our resources very carefully, 
but always with key imperatives in mind. 
These are that clients should continue to 
receive the services and attention they 
expect; that our control environment remains 
strong; that we continue to innovate for the 
future, and that talented employees see us 
as the preferred place to work.

Achieving balance takes agility and skill, for 
which I and the Board are grateful to our 
executive Directors and their teams. With 
continued market uncertainty and some 
sectoral headwinds likely to continue, this 
approach to running the business will 
remain in 2024.

We continue to have a strong capital 
position and this, combined with our financial 
performance, has enabled the Board to 
recommend an unchanged final dividend of 
15.0 pence per share (2022: 15.0 pence). This 
brings the full year dividend to 21.5 pence 
per share (2022: 21.5 pence). 

In my first Chair’s statement last year, I 
highlighted Schroders’ singular long-term 
approach, which arises largely from its 
ownership structure and its 220-year 
history of navigating change. 2023 
brought renewed headwinds and 
geopolitical uncertainty, and as I write in 
these pages again, I continue to see that 
long-term approach as one of Schroders’ 
distinctive attributes.

Taking a truly strategic view has enabled 
the business to act with conviction. Strategy 
must always be actively managed and evolve 
over time to reflect changes in circumstances, 
and it is the Board’s responsibility to test 
continuously both the viability and 
deliverability of that strategy on behalf of all 
stakeholders. Conviction requires leadership 
positions to be taken across all aspects of 
the strategy – delivery for clients, operational 
efficiency, regulation and broader factors 
such as sustainability. 

Our approach also enables innovation 
and the thoughtful application of new 
technologies. The focus is always to ensure 
that our clients reap the rewards, while 
other stakeholders also benefit – including 
Schroders’ employees, shareholders, 
suppliers and the wider communities in 
which we operate.

While our long-term approach and conviction 
in our strategic diversification continue to 
provide resilient results, the Board is acutely 
aware of the need to adapt to changes in our 
sector to preserve and grow value. We are 
not complacent; the current environment 
demands constant review and attention. 
In 2023, we drove growth in areas of our 
strategic focus, such as Wealth Management 
and Private Markets. We also won significant 
mandates in Solutions, where we are 
entrusted with full fiduciary responsibility for 
our clients’ assets. 

Our strength is our 
ability to look beyond 
the distractions of today 
and remain committed 
to our strategy.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Sadly, our next AGM will see the departure of 
Rhian Davies who, having served almost nine 
years, has decided not to seek re-election. 
We owe Rhian a huge debt of gratitude for 
the contribution she has made, especially 
during her tenure as Chair of the Audit and 
Risk Committee. Her thoroughness and 
attention to detail are legendary and have 
served us well. Rhian will be succeeded by 
Iain Mackay.

I would like to thank all my colleagues on the 
Board for their diligence and contribution. 
Every year we expect more from our 
Directors, both non-executive and executive, 
and they always continue to deliver.

Dame Elizabeth Corley
Chair

28 February 2024

Subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting the final dividend 
will be paid on 2 May 2024 to shareholders 
on the register on 22 March 2024. 

Our resilience in the face of challenging 
circumstances has arisen from our deliberate 
and carefully executed long-term strategy. 
First set out by Peter Harrison in 2016, it has 
been regularly reviewed, stress-tested and 
ratified by the Board. 

The strategy, to bring together global 
asset management capabilities across 
public and private markets, and to develop 
world-leading wealth management 
services, is working. It has shown how the 
core investment management, services and 
platform strengths of the business can be 
applied to counter a more challenging 
operating environment.

Our position as a leading global active 
manager brings responsibility. One aspect of 
the business in which I take particular pride 
is our recognised leadership in sustainability. 
We view the consideration of sustainability as 
fundamental to our fiduciary responsibilities 
to deliver long-term returns. We constantly 
search for investment opportunities in 
transition technologies, mitigation and 
renewable energy sources. We look for 
investable opportunities to achieve a more 
circular economy, while also considering the 
societal and community aspects of the goal 
to reach net zero by 2050. 

This, coupled with active engagement as 
a way of adding value to clients’ assets, is a 
true differentiator for Schroders and delivers 
stronger returns over the longer term.

Our People
In 2023, we redoubled our collective efforts 
to improve inclusion and diversity across 
Schroders, an area of focus that the Board 
cares deeply about. We met with leaders 
of our Employee Resource Groups last year 
to understand how the Company can 
encourage inclusion. We plan to meet 
with them again this year to discuss 
our progress.

Linked to our “Inclusion at Schroders” 
report was the inaugural publication of 
our ethnicity pay gap report, a significant 
milestone, after a comprehensive 
programme of engagement with our 
employees to gather the required data. 
There has been plenty to learn, and we 
acknowledge we are not where we aspire 
to be. 

This coming year, we will work tirelessly to 
address the inclusion and diversity imbalance 
across not just our workforce, but also 
the wider asset management industry, as 
we believe an inclusive and diverse workforce 
is directly linked to better outcomes for 
our clients, and thus our shareholders.

We are a people business. This is not a trite 
phrase but a fundamental truth about 
how we create value for our stakeholders. 
We rely on the talent and dedication of each 
member of our team wherever they are 
located and whatever their role. The Board 
and management team may determine the 
strategy, but only our people can execute it 
and deliver value for our clients.

Whenever I meet colleagues, I am 
consistently impressed by their ability to 
innovate and adapt and by their commitment 
to the Company. The professionalism and 
resilience of our people continues to inspire 
me. On behalf of the whole Board, I would 
like to express our thanks for your 
tremendous efforts.

The Board
Just as we need to keep evolving our strategy, 
so the skills around the Board table need to 
develop. We have seen several changes on 
the Board in the last year. In August, Paul 
Edgecliffe-Johnson stood down as he needed 
to focus on his new executive role. In the 
short time he was with us, Paul added a 
valuable new perspective and, on behalf of 
the Company, I would like to thank him for 
his contributions. Annette Thomas joined us 
in September as an independent non-
executive Director. Her digital, data and 
analytics expertise will be of great benefit 
to us as we continue to invest in these 
important areas.

At the end of the year we said goodbye to 
Richard Keers, our Chief Financial Officer for 
the last 10 years. Richard has been not only a 
highly effective and dedicated CFO, but also a 
great colleague to Peter Harrison and many 
others. The Board is grateful to Richard for 
all he has done for the Company. After a 
thorough search, we appointed Richard 
Oldfield as CFO and a Director in October. 

In January 2024, Iain Mackay and Frederic 
Wakeman joined the Board as independent 
non-executive Directors, bringing invaluable 
global public company and private assets 
experience respectively. Further details of 
their skills and backgrounds, together with 
more information on all the Board changes 
are provided in the Governance section of 
this report.

Group Chief Executive’s statement

Performing 
strongly despite 
headwinds

Peter Harrison 
Group Chief Executive

The foundations of 
change and growth are 
in place; the benefits 
are already apparent 
and more will follow.

Seven years ago, we set out Schroders’ 
strategy based on our analysis of the 
trends likely to play out in the years ahead. 
That strategy has stood the test of time. 
It gave us resilience in the challenging 
year of 2023 and enabled us to perform 
strongly relative to the wider industry. 
It remains relevant for the future.

When we set our strategy in 2016, we were 
witnessing a shift from active to passive 
investment management. Fees were under 
pressure. Public markets were dropping from 
favour, with both investors and fund raisers 
looking increasingly to private markets. 
Technology innovation was a catalyst for 
change and more was on the horizon. 

Over recent years, the capabilities and size 
of our business have changed significantly, 
and we are fortunate that our stable 
ownership structure allows us to keep our 
sights on the long term. We have pivoted 
towards higher longevity and higher margin 
areas of strategic growth such as Wealth 
Management and Private Markets, which 
generated positive growth for the business in 
2023. We have reshaped the business for the 
future, and the resilient performance in 2023 
was a proof point of our success.

Our performance underlines how our 
strategy differentiates us from our peers. 
Getting to this position has taken years of 
planning and investment, and while the 
benefits are apparent now, we can be 
confident that more will come through.

In 2023, our revenues and profits were 
impacted by the fall in markets the year 
before. However, despite the industry 
headwinds, we saw notable growth in 
assets under management and positive 
net new business, winning some important 
and valuable clients.

Navigating a year  
of global turbulence
Many of the problems confronting investors 
in 2023 have been years in the making. 
They were evident a decade ago but today 
they are more acute, more visible and in 
some cases – for those not prepared – 
more damaging.

Those issues were important then: they have 
become critical now. 

There are wider external factors which are 
harder to prepare for. In 2023, geopolitical 
stress-points formed only part of the 
backdrop to a period of extreme change 
– socially and economically. With inflation and 
interest rates having risen rapidly in 2022, 
last year was still very much about navigating 
the aftermath of one of the largest monetary 
experiments in history. The record flows of 
$1.7 trillion into US money market funds in 
2023, boosting assets to $6.3 trillion1, was 
evidence of this: cash, for the first time in 
many years, became a viable competitor to 
risk assets.

Central banks battled to quell inflation, with 
average inflation across the G7 group of 
major economies declining to 3% year-on-
year in December, from a peak of almost 
8% in 2022. This continued to drive volatility 
in public and private markets, posing 
challenges for us and our clients.

The imperative of decarbonisation 
gained further momentum, increasingly 
underpinning the everyday decisions that 
we make as investors and our clients make in 
their businesses. While 2023 was hailed as 
“the year of AI”, it marked only the first chapter 
in a new wave of technological disruption.

We have seized opportunities 
in structural trends
Core to the strategy we set out seven years 
ago was to identify opportunities within what 
appeared, at first glance, to be threats to 
the industry. Hence the careful, deliberate 
build-out of Schroders Capital, our private 
markets business. The explosive growth 
in private markets since then, and the 
comparative decline in public ones, has 
posed a mounting dilemma for our clients.

Initial public offering exits in the US totalled 
$6.8 billion in 2023. This was just 2% of the 
$297 billion total value of IPOs in 2021’s 
bumper year.3 By the start of 2023 less than 
15% of US companies with revenue of over 
$100 million were listed on a stock market.4

Schroders Capital offers a solution to 
investors with public-only exposure – but it 
has become more than that; it has become 
a source of innovation within the private 
market space in its own right. For example, 
through Schroders Greencoat, we are giving 
investors access to private infrastructure and 
at the same time, driving cutting-edge wind 
and solar technologies. 

As part of our strategic goal of connecting 
more closely with clients we have built our 
multiple wealth brands serving different 
market segments from affluent to ultra-high-
net-worth customers. Similarly, the growth of 
outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO) 
offerings in the pensions arena was initially 
a concern, but the creation of Schroders 
Solutions, as an independent unit within the 
wider Group, has become a significant draw 
for new business.

As part of our conviction that active 
management is the right approach, we have 
taken a leadership position in sustainability 
and stewardship. We have amassed deep 
intellectual capital in Schroders’ range of 
tools, for instance SustainEx™, which helps us 
better understand and measure sustainability 
exposures, risks and opportunities. This is 
also true of our data and governance 
processes. Our investment into all of these 
areas is increasingly validated by both 
external events and clients’ expectations.

2023 was the warmest year on record, 
registering a global temperature of 1.48°C 
above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average.5 
Our industry is responsible for reallocating 
billions of dollars of capital that will be 
needed to realise net zero commitments. 
88% of our public market AUM had a better 
SustainEx™ score6 than their benchmark, 
up from 86% in 2022. Schroders’ portfolio 
temperature score of in-scope7 assets fell to 
2.5°C as at the end of 2023. The huge risks 
and opportunities posed by the energy 
transition mean many clients expect 
sustainability considerations to be deeply 
embedded in our oversight of their assets. 

The narrowness of markets in 2023 
was striking; this is a tricky backdrop for 
investment performance for active managers, 
particularly given the significant volatility in 
bond markets. Over three and five years, 60% 
and 77% of client assets have outperformed 
their respective benchmarks8. These figures 
are impacted by the performance of multi-
asset portfolios that are measured against 
absolute return benchmarks.

Group Chief Executive’s statement continued

The groundwork for future growth 
is in place and it is delivering
Our capabilities and the scope of our client 
offering have developed significantly over 
recent years, anticipating the increasingly 
complex needs of our clients.

As part of this, we made a series of 
acquisitions and funded organic growth 
in several areas within the private markets 
sphere. In 2017, Schroders bought private 
equity specialist Adveq. Subsequent 
acquisitions added a wider range of 
capabilities to our offering: we bought 
majority stakes in leading impact manager 
BlueOrchard in 2019 and renewable energy 
specialist Greencoat Capital in 2022. These 
have become key components of Schroders 
Capital’s capability. 

Today, our reach is broad: Schroders 
Greencoat funds are the largest financial 
owner of operational solar and wind assets 
in the UK. We have financed 30 million micro, 
small and medium enterprises and have 
created or maintained over 100 million jobs, 
a feat made possible by the impact expertise 
and vast experience within BlueOrchard. 

In 2023, we launched a European Long-Term 
Investment Fund (ELTIF) to clients within the 
EU. In August, we were approved to launch 
the first equivalent UK investment vehicle, 
the Long-Term Asset Fund (LTAF). These 
investments help “democratise” private 
assets, allowing access to a wider audience 
of individual investors, something we see as 
a core theme in private markets. 

In Wealth Management our platform has 
similarly widened. As a result, in 2023 we saw 
new business flows as more clients across 
the wealth spectrum entrusted us with their 
assets. In the high and ultra-high-net-worth 
segments, our investment in regional UK 
branches of Cazenove Capital has paid off. 
Our 2018 partnership with Lloyds Banking 
Group is delivering in this space and through 
the ongoing growth of our mass affluent joint 
venture, Schroders Personal Wealth.

Our solutions business continued on the 
success of earlier years. The gilt crisis of 
2022 had alerted pension clients to potential 
tsunamis as markets adjusted to higher 
rates. In light of those dangers, our model 
and the levels of service we were able to 
provide, following the acquisition of River and 
Mercantile’s UK solutions division in 2022, 
emerged as winners. We subsequently saw 
the business return to net inflows with 
positive feedback from clients and 
consultants alike.

In all, we have acquired and integrated 14 
specialist businesses since 2016, reshaping 
our client offering, differentiating ourselves 
from competitors and remaining faithful to 
the tenets of our strategy.

Making our voice heard in the 
interest of clients, shareholders 
and society
The problems we seek to address as a 
business are those our clients grapple with 
too. We are clear in the positions we take on 
sustainability, impact, diversity and inclusion, 
as we see these as aligned with the success 
of our clients and their investments.

We also raise our concerns on other issues. 
In the UK, for example, I am pleased to be 
part of the UK Treasury’s Capital Market 
Industry Taskforce, established in 2023 with 
the aim to shape capital market reform in 
the UK but also to influence the conversation 
about the role of investment more widely. 
This is not a UK-specific debate.

At their heart, these conversations all return 
to the vital role investment can play in 
delivering fairer, more prosperous societies 
– and a more sustainable environment. We 
would argue, as is central to our approach 
of stewardship and active management, that 
there need not be a binary choice between 
growth and public interest: we can seek both.

Last year, we focused on re-shaping the 
world-class technology platform we have 
developed, enabling us to offer Schroders’ 
expanded range of products to clients. This 
process of unlocking additional value by 
bringing different components of the Group’s 
capabilities together for clients was a major 
piece of work in 2023 and the foundations 
are laid for success stretching far into 
the future.

The mass arrival of generative AI heralds 
painful disruption for many industries. But 
it promises big wins for businesses which 
become early adopters, identifying and 
harnessing its potential. In 2023, we rolled 
out our AI tool, Genie, to our people 
worldwide. We are actively developing 
use-cases in our investment processes 
and across diverse business functions.

AI captures headlines, but new technologies 
are driving disruption on other fronts also. 
We see digital assets and tokenisation as 
a powerful emergent trend which will 
significantly impact investment management, 
increasing transparency, efficiency and 
security – and driving down costs. As an 
example of Schroders’ work in this area, 
2023 saw the formal launch of the “Project 
Guardian” initiative, in collaboration with 
regulators and partners in Asia and 
elsewhere, which will explore the capabilities 
of tokenised investment vehicles.

The migration of growth around the globe 
is both a challenge and an opportunity for 
businesses. Capturing geographic growth 
is part of the story of our strategic success, 
and we have made recent gains in Asia, 
but geographic expansion is not something 
limited to Schroders’ recent history. In 
October 2023, we were proud to celebrate 
100 years of Schroders in New York, where 
in 1923 we founded a bank with the stated 
ambition of becoming a “first-class name”. 
Thanks to the work of generations of 
colleagues that aspiration has been 
achieved and maintained.

Future growth will come from many parts of 
the world. We now operate in 38 locations 
and we continue to see China as a key 
market in the decades ahead. Following the 
launch of our Wealth Management Company 
venture with Bank of Communications in 
April 2022, in December 2023 we reached 
another significant milestone, launching the 
first product within our new wholly-owned 
Fund Management Company, which raised 
RMB 1.3 billion (£140 million) in its first 
two weeks.

I would like to wish Richard Keers, our 
out-going Chief Financial Officer, a fulfilling

strategic ambitions over his ten-year tenure. 

Finally, a thank you to all our talented

our ongoing success. 

Peter Harrison 
Group Chief Executive 

28 February 2024

We are active in working with governments 
and regulators to steer the reforms that are 
beneficial to clients and all our stakeholders. 
The work we have done in 2023 in 
supporting the ELTIF and LTAF initiatives 
in Europe and the UK, for example, and 
ground-breaking developments of tokenised 
solutions in Singapore, are the early fruit of 
our growing expertise and presence.

Quality of execution
Strategy does not win on its own: it needs 
quality execution.

Schroders’ long-term DNA means that our 
decisions are executed with commitment and 
thoroughness. The achievements outlined 
above are multi-year in nature and have 
involved significant backing. We understood 
the importance of the commitment. By virtue 
of our ownership structure and long-term 
culture we have been able to attract the 
first-class talent to deliver it. We empower, 
develop and aim to retain our people. We 
are proud that 96% of our highly-rated 
employees remain with us year after year. 
Our people are proud to work for Schroders, 
and it is that connected empowerment that 
drives excellence for clients.

In October, we welcomed Richard Oldfield 
as Chief Financial Officer. Richard was Vice 
Chairman and Global Markets Leader at 
PwC where he led market-facing initiatives. 
He brings valuable expertise from a global 
advisory environment, where clients sit in 
the heart of a complex ecosystem.

Strategy

Our strategy is 
driving growth…

Our strategy has been in progress for more than seven years. It was 
founded on our understanding of the changing needs of clients and 
wider changes triggered by macroeconomic and industry trends. We 
have deliberately shifted our business to capture these opportunities.

Our strategy

Build closer 
relationships  
with clients 

Close connections with clients enable us 
to provide more relevant and tailored 
investment solutions. They also promote 
longer client relationships. 

We are growing our wealth management 
business across the spectrum of client 
needs. We are also expanding our role as 
a provider of tailored solutions to pension 
and insurance clients, and other owners 
of long-term assets.

Answering increasing client demand for 
holistic advice helps us address downward 
pressure on fees.

Expand our  
private markets 
business

Grow  
asset  
management

By building a more comprehensive set of 
capabilities across all private asset classes – 
infrastructure, private debt, private equity 
and real estate – we can now service clients 
who are under-allocated to private markets 
and who seek exposure. The ongoing decline 
in public markets relative to their private 
counterparts supports this element of 
our strategy.

Identifying businesses with the greatest 
potential for excess returns from future 
growth remains a key client need. We have 
built a core set of global and differentiated 
products that are actively managed. This 
helps us meet growing demand for thematic, 
sustainable solutions, and the characteristics 
of these products shelter us from some 
pricing pressures.

Future innovations such as tokenisation will 
enable us to offer these assets to a wider 
range of clients.

Our strategic partnerships give us access 
to some of the world’s largest and most 
promising markets such as the US, China 
and India.

Leadership in sustainability is central to our ambition to deliver for stakeholders over the long term.

…in a changing landscape

Global forces

Debt
Growing public debt around the world 
increasingly shapes the market backdrop 
and government fiscal policies.

Decarbonisation
The transformation of global energy 
systems needed to meet 2050 net zero 
emissions targets demands enormous 
investment. Estimates suggest $100 trillion 
is needed between now and 2050.

Demographics
Ageing populations and migration are 
driving increased need for healthcare and 
pension spending in wealthier countries. 
At the same time, debt and low growth 
are creating economic constraints.

Deglobalisation
Growing conflicts and geopolitical 
tensions are leading governments and 
industries to rethink supply chains and 
allocation of capital.

Disruptive technologies
Generative AI and robotics will change 
industries and economies in unpredictable 
ways. Significant improved efficiencies are 
possible, while potential challenges include 
data management, lost employment and 
regulatory challenges.

Opportunities
Global growth  
in pensions  
and savings

By 2026, an additional $2 trillion 
investable assets will be accrued 
by affluent and mass affluent 
people in Asia alone.1

UK advice gap

The number of financial advisers 
working in the UK has fallen by 
200,000 between 1991 and 2021.2

Private market 
expansion

The share of global asset 
management revenues derived 
from private markets is expected 
to reach 55% by 2027.3

Demand for 
sustainable 
investment

71% of expert investors strongly 
agree that active engagement 
adds value.4

Industry trends

The search for  
investment performance

By the start of 2023, less than 
15% of US companies with 
revenue of over $100 million 
were listed on a stock market.5

In contrast, private markets are 
growing as companies seek 
alternative sources of capital.

Pricing pressures

The popularity of passive 
investments, which track indices, 
is driving down fees across  
the market.

The cost of doing business – 
including technology, data, cyber 
security defences and regulation 
– continues to rise.

Changing investor needs

Demands for decarbonisation 
and sustainability play an 
increasing role in clients’ 
investment decisions.

With higher interest rates,  
cash is playing a greater role  
in clients’ active allocations.

Meanwhile, pension fund 
trustees are increasingly 
reviewing governance  
and assessing the potential 
benefits of an outsourced 
investment approach.

Our progress in 2023 

How we delivered in our areas of strategic focus while improving operational efficiency

Grew Wealth Management  
while reducing costs
We delivered strong flows of 8% 
for advised Wealth Management. 
This was achieved while 
relocating roles from our service 
centre in Zurich to the UK, to 
drive efficiencies and support 
our growth ambitions for our 
wealth management businesses 
globally. We saw positive organic 
growth in our high-net-worth, 
ultra-high-net-worth and charity 
businesses during the year, with 
particularly strong net new flows 
at Cazenove Capital in the UK.

The current cost-of-living crisis 
saw some investors prioritise 
immediate spending. Despite 
this, Benchmark Capital, our 
adviser business, and Schroders 
Personal Wealth, our joint 
venture with Lloyds Banking 
Group in the mass affluent client 
segment, both attracted positive 
flows, demonstrating resilience 
in the current climate. 

*  Build closer relationships 

with clients.

Continued to pioneer  
new investment vehicles
We see digital assets and 
tokenisation – turning 
investment units into digital 
tokens – as a powerful trend 
which will impact asset 
management, increasing 
transparency, efficiency and 
security, and driving down costs.

In June 2023, we announced our 
participation in the Monetary 
Authority of Singapore’s initiative 
with key industry partners to test 
the feasibility of tokenised assets 
while considering and managing 
risks to financial stability and 
integrity. This is one of several 
collaborations on tokenisation.

*  Expand our private  
markets business.

Introduced AI platform 
for employees 
Schroders’ internal AI assistant, 
Genie, became available to 
employees globally. Built on the 
latest GPT models, Genie was 
deployed rapidly and has over 
1,800 weekly active users. There 
are 80+ distinct use-cases across 
the Group, including investment 
research, translations and 
software development.

Expanded our  
renewables portfolio 
Schroders Greencoat  
entered into a joint venture  
with UK independent energy 
infrastructure development 
company Carlton Power in early 
2023; by the end of the year, the 
venture – known as the Green 
Hydrogen Energy Company – 
had secured its first three 
contracts from the Government 
for sites across the 

UK for hydrogen production. 
The green hydrogen produced 
will be used for industrial and 
manufacturing companies in 
local areas, helping decarbonise 
their operations. Our focus is 
on financing the projects, 
leveraging the UK’s renewable 
energy expertise.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023As we seek continued progress 
against our strategy in 2024, 
we are targeting these near-
term areas of focus

Client connection 
Delivering our broad set of capabilities to 
diverse, global clients requires a renewed focus 
on productivity. Ensuring our Client Group has 
the tools and data to deliver the whole firm to 
the client is essential.

Wealth performance 
Remaining committed to exceptional client 
service and investment outperformance will 
support continued growth.

Strategic partnerships
Schroders has a long history of successful 
partnerships. Forming new partnerships and 
nurturing existing ones is central to our 
near-term growth strategy.

AI transformation
2024 will see continued assessment of how 
we can embed the power of AI and other 
technologies to drive greater efficiency and 
improved products and service. 

Employee engagement
Our people are our greatest asset, and we 
want to be an employer of choice. Motivating, 
rewarding and retaining our employees, and 
creating an inclusive, diverse culture, will enable 
us to better serve our clients.

*   Our progress helps us deliver our strategy.  

Read more on our strategic pillars on page 14.

Delivered innovative ways  
to access private markets
The opportunities for individual 
investors to access private markets 
are limited. To expand the options 
available, the Financial Conduct 
Authority introduced a Long-Term 
Asset Fund (LTAF), to facilitate 
investment in less liquid assets 
such as private equity, property 
and infrastructure. In March 2023, 
Schroders Capital received 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
approval to launch the UK’s 
first LTAF.

In addition, BlueOrchard launched 
the Green Earth Impact Fund and 
the Gender, Diversity and Inclusion 
Fund; and the £1.1 billion

commercial real estate mandate 
we secured was a compelling 
endorsement a prestigious family 
office client placed in our 
operational and sustainability 
expertise. Schroders Greencoat 
plays a key role in allowing our 
clients to finance the energy 
transition. We were delighted  
to be awarded a mandate by a  
partnership of local government 
pension schemes seeking to 
deliver local impact and their 
pathway to a greener grid.

*  Expand our private markets 

business, Lead in sustainability.

Reached further  
milestones in sustainability
Our introduction of a new active 
equity solution, the Customised 
Decarbonisation Pathway, is 
allowing us to help clients 
effectively manage their climate 
commitments. It is enabled by 
our net zero alignment and 
engagement framework and 
overseen by an advisory group 
comprising a range of specialists 
from across our business.

In May, we launched carbon offset 
share classes, providing investors 
in our Global Climate Leaders 
portfolio with the choice to offset 
carbon emissions associated with 
their underlying fund holdings. 
Schroders was named “top 
financial institution” in the Global 
Canopy Forest 500 report, and we 
were a 2023 signatory to the UK 
Stewardship Code.

*  Grow asset management, 

Lead in sustainability.

Attracted new clients to  
our solutions business
We saw £12 billion of inflows into 
Solutions this year, driven by 
strong demand for OCIO and LDI 
services, one of our largest Asset 
Management mandate wins, 
cementing our position as a 
trusted partner of choice 
in Solutions. 

We were awarded LDI Manager 
of the Year at the European 
Pensions awards, recognition 
of our exceptional work in 

navigating challenging market 
conditions. 

Mandate wins from high profile 
charities highlighted our ability to 
provide bespoke offerings to 
clients by combining expertise 
across our UK charities business 
(in Cazenove Capital) and fiduciary 
management specialists in our 
solutions business.

Acting with purpose

Long-term sustainability is a key basis 
on which we assess the companies we 
invest in. It is also central to the way 
we operate our own business, and we 
expect to lead by example.

Our people
The commitment, drive and innovation  
of our people enable us to deliver our 
strategy successfully.

We aim to attract people with the skills and 
passion to help us achieve our purpose.

This means creating a high-performing 
culture that is inclusive, encourages diversity 
of thought and provides employees with 
opportunities to grow.

To maintain our position as an employer 
of choice, we aspire to offer:

•  Purpose, inspiration and inclusion.
•  Fair pay for performance.
•  A positive environment that prioritises 

wellbeing.

•  High-quality work and personal growth 

opportunities.

Purpose, inspiration and inclusion

Fair pay for performance

Data supports our view that an inclusive 
culture and cognitive diversity deliver the 
best outcomes for clients. This year, we 
launched our 2030 inclusion and diversity 
goals, covering multi-year inclusion, 
transparency and diversity aspirations. 

We hold ourselves accountable to change 
through voluntary disclosures. We have 
voluntarily published our gender pay gap 
since 2017 and published our UK Ethnicity 
Pay Gap this year, having achieved 80% 
disclosure from our UK employees. For 
further details on our workforce diversity 
targets and progress, see page 96.

In keeping with our Equal Opportunities 
policy, we give full and fair consideration to 
all employment applications, including those 
from disabled people, considering their 
aptitudes, skills, behaviours and abilities. 
If employees become disabled, we continue 
to employ them wherever possible, with 
retraining if necessary to enable continued 
career development.

  Find out more in our Inclusion Report at 
www.schroders.com/paygap.

We aim to recognise and reward employees 
with holistic compensation and benefits.

Our remuneration approach centres around 
inclusion and fairness. Salary and bonus 
decisions are governed by our Fair Pay for 
Performance framework, meaning each 
decision takes into account:

•   Annual performance – Group-wide, team 

and individual performance, including 
behaviours and conduct.

•  Market context – reviewing pay levels  

and outlook among relevant comparators, 
as well as wider economic conditions.

•  Relativities and diversity – validation and 
challenge of compensation proposals to 
ensure fairness versus peers and markets.

•  Individual context – considering  

the skills, experience and potential of  
each employee.

Carefully balancing all these factors allows 
annual pay outcomes to be fair and drive 
high performance.

We aim to provide generous benefits and 
support to our employees compared with 
local market norms. Our flexible offering 
empowers people to choose options that 
suit them.

Our values

Excellence 
Our commitment to excellence 
fuels our drive to create value  
for all stakeholders and a thriving 
long-term future for our business.

Innovation and teamwork 
We disrupt the status quo, 
anticipate future opportunities, 
and embrace the transformative 
power of teamwork. We aim to 
deliver value by valuing individual 
contributions and by harnessing 
the power of collaboration.

Passion and integrity 
We are determined in our ambition 
and pragmatic in delivery. We carry 
out our responsibilities with great 
care, energy and determination. 
This is complemented by a culture 
of transparency and accountability.

Our business model

Delivering the  
whole firm

We have two business segments, Asset and Wealth 
Management. The breadth of capabilities within these 
segments gives us scale and reach to understand and 
serve our clients’ complex needs, with actively managed 
investment solutions across public and private markets.

Asset Management
Active investment management across public and private  
markets through mutual funds and institutional mandates.

Public Markets

Private Markets

Our investment expertise across publicly-
listed asset classes and markets means 
we can meet clients’ investment needs at 
different phases of the economic and market 
cycle. Our mutual funds deliver a wide range 
of investment strategies that are distributed 
to retail clients through intermediaries and 
investment platforms. Segregated accounts 
support institutional clients by enabling us to 
provide more tailored investment strategies 
across asset classes.

Private markets offer investors the 
opportunity to access returns from assets that 
are not otherwise available through public 
markets. Investment opportunities across 
private equity, private debt, real estate and 
infrastructure have historically been available 
only to institutional investors and ultra-high-
net-worth clients. Innovations we are making 
in new collective investment vehicles mean 
they are increasingly available to a wider 
range of clients.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023How our business works
We aim to achieve our purpose by combining investment expertise with extensive market 
data to actively manage clients’ investment capital. 

To do this we need to attract and develop talented employees and maintain a robust, 
scalable operating platform. By serving clients’ needs we aim to deliver positive outcomes 
for all stakeholders. 

Create innovative  
products and solutions 
We recognise that clients have a wide 
variety of needs and goals. By combining 
client insights with market knowledge, data 
and our strong investment capabilities, we 
can design bespoke products and solutions. 

These are designed to fit  
our clients’ risk and return profiles, and any 
sustainability preferences. They are 
rigorously tested to ensure that they are fit 
for purpose.

Understand our  
clients’ needs 
We develop a clear view of clients’ evolving 
needs by focusing our resources around key 
client segments. This supports our goal to 
build deeper, longer-lasting relationships. In 
Asset Management we offer investment 
opportunities across public and private

different circumstances. In Wealth 
Management, we also direct our resources 
to meet clients’ needs across the wealth 
spectrum through differentiated brands and 
tailored client services.

Conviction in  
our strategy

Richard Oldfield
Chief Financial Officer

This year’s results continue to 
demonstrate that our strategy is the 
right one. We generated growth through 
positive net inflows of £9.7 billion 
(excluding joint ventures and associates). 
Our financial performance remained 
resilient, showcasing the benefits of 
our client-centric strategy in the face 
of what continue to be challenging 
market conditions.

We reported an operating profit of 
£661.0 million (2022: £723.0 million)  
and profit before tax of £487.6 million  
(2022: £586.9 million). Profit after tax was 
£402.6 million (2022: £486.2 million). The 
Board has recommended a final dividend  
of 15.0 pence per share (2022: 15.0 pence 
per share). This results in a total dividend  
for the year of 21.5 pence per share  
(2022: 21.5 pence per share), and a  
payout ratio of 66% (2022: 57%).

Growth through our  
client-centric strategy
Our strategy, as outlined in the Group 
Chief Executive’s statement, is built on a 
deep understanding of both investment 
markets, and importantly, our clients’  
needs. This informs our decisions, and 
enables us to develop the right expertise  
to deliver the solutions that address their 
specific requirements. The investments 
we have made in our strategic growth 
areas of Wealth Management, Private 
Markets and Solutions, combined with 
our know-how in Public Markets, have  
positioned us with the investment  
capabilities required to achieve this. 

The value of this strategy is highlighted by 
the positive net new business we generated 
across these three strategic growth areas. In 
2023, our combined net inflows from Wealth 

Management, Private Markets and Solutions 
amounted to £23.1 billion (excluding joint 
ventures and associates). The closing AUM 
of these areas rose by 9% to £404.7 billion 
(2022: £371.6 billion), and the net operating 
revenue generated by them now accounts 
for 48% of our total net operating revenue 
(2022: 45%). 

Importantly, these businesses not only 
showed solid growth during the year, they 
also provide a revenue stream with greater 
longevity. The three-year average longevity 
for these businesses ranges between 7 and 
11 years, helping dampen the impact of a 
risk-off environment and further supporting 
the longer-term rebalancing of our business. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, our public markets 
business, comprising Mutual Funds and 
Institutional business areas, was not immune 
to the broader industry headwinds. In 
addition, amid heightened market volatility, 
the rise in interest rates made cash a 
competing option for generating returns. 
These factors led to net outflows of 
£13.4 billion in this business. 

Overall, across the Group we generated 
net inflows of £9.7 billion (excluding joint 
ventures and associates) during the year. 
In addition, the investment returns we 
generated further bolstered our AUM.  
As a result, and despite a foreign exchange 
headwind of £19 billion, our closing AUM 
(excluding joint ventures and associates) 
increased by 4%, to £642.4 billion (2022: 
£616.5 billion). We also continued to provide 
long-term returns to our clients, with 77% of 
our assets outperforming their benchmarks 
over a five-year period.

Despite the growth in closing AUM, the 
timing of movements meant that our 
average AUM was 3% lower than in 2022 

In the five months 
since joining,  
I have witnessed  
the remarkable daily 
innovation that sets 
Schroders apart.  
The energy and 
enthusiasm are truly 
astonishing. From 
product development 
to artificial intelligence, 
Schroders is ahead of 
the curve, delivering 
cutting-edge solutions 
to our valued clients.

24

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023at £619.7 billion (2022: £636.2 billion). This 
reflected the impact of the significant market 
falls towards the end of 2022, which did 
not recover until late 2023. We were able to 
largely mitigate the impact of this through 
an increase in performance-based revenues, 
which were 42% higher on the back of 
returns generated for our clients. The growth 
in net banking interest helped to offset the 
impact further, meaning we saw only a 
marginal 1% reduction in our net operating 
revenue. This provides a further illustration 
of the benefits of our diversified business 
model. Overall, we generated net operating 
revenue of £2,334.4 million (2022: 
£2,361.4 million). 

In recent years, we have seen significant 
growth from our strategic partnerships 
in Asset Management, including our 
longstanding interest in our venture with 
Bank of Communications. Developing these 
relationships continues to be an important 
part of our strategy. That said, in 2023, their 
financial performance was impacted by 
adverse foreign exchange movements 
and the unfavourable market sentiment, 
particularly in China. Within Wealth 
Management, our joint venture, Schroders 
Personal Wealth, began a strategic 
restructuring to position itself for future 
growth as part of its next phase of 
development. Overall, across the Group, our 
returns from joint ventures and associates 
reduced to £51.1 million (2022: £77.6 million). 
The returns from these interests are included 
in our net operating income, which totalled 
£2,419.0 million for the year (2022: 
£2,475.5 million).

Our growth in recent years has led to a 
broader client base, with different segments 
requiring increasingly sophisticated, 
specialist solutions. As part of our client-
focused approach, we have realigned our 
Client Group to better meet the requirement 
of clients across Wealth, Long-term Asset 
Owners, Pensions and Retirement and 
Insurance. This change positions us well 
for the next phase of our evolution.

Simplifying and streamlining  
our operating platform
Increasing the scalability of our operating 
platform enables us to focus our resources 
on adding value for our clients.

This year, we have made further progress 
in simplifying our technology, leveraging 
centres of excellence and streamlining 
our processes. 

The implementation of our Cloud 
programme has yielded significant IT 
improvements, providing us with enhanced 
efficiency, agility and a reduced carbon 
footprint as we move away from legacy 
hardware assets and infrastructure. 
Moreover, we have successfully avoided the 

need for substantial costs associated with 
overheads such as server enhancements, 
and the simplification of our operating 
structure has enabled us to carry out a 
focused restructuring programme during 
the year.

We are also continuing to benefit from 
our centres of excellence. Our Schroders 
campus in Horsham is a prime example of 
this. Established in 2019, this campus has 
been instrumental in providing operational 
support to a significant portion of our Group 
globally. In 2023, we took the decision to 
leverage this capability further by 
commencing the relocation of our wealth 
management service centre from Zurich. 
The move, which will complete in 2024, 
brings together our Asset Management 
and Wealth Management operating centres, 
allowing us to benefit from operational 
synergies and deliver ongoing cost savings. 

The year was also marked by further 
streamlining efforts following the acquisitions 
we completed in 2022. In Solutions, we 
completed the integration of River and 
Mercantile’s solutions business which has 
allowed us to meet the increasingly complex 
needs of pension fund clients and furthers 
our ambition to become the provider 
of choice for fiduciary management. 
In Schroders Capital, the acquisitions in 
2022 mean we have largely completed 
the build-out of our capabilities. We 
are now focused on enhancing our 
operating platform across these asset 
classes to provide a scalable platform for 
further growth. 

These changes clearly benefit our business 
and enable us to serve our clients better. 
They also demonstrate the fact that we are 
working hard to combat the inflationary 
pressures we are seeing around the globe. 

Our non-compensation costs for the 
year increased by 2% to £645.6 million 
(2022: £631.3 million). This reflects our 
continued focus on cost discipline in the face 
of inflationary pressures along with some 
one-off benefits received during the year.

We have been equally disciplined in our 
approach to compensation costs. These 
costs reduced slightly to £1,112.4 million 
(2022: £1,121.2 million). This represents 
an operating compensation ratio of 46% 
(2022: 45%), which balances strong cost 
management with the need to support our 
talent and continue to invest in strategic 
growth areas. Our people are paramount to 
the successful delivery of our strategy and we 
are therefore proud to note that 96% of our 
high-performing employees were retained 
in 2023. 

After bringing all of these components 
together, we generated an operating profit 
of £661.0 million (2022: £723.0 million). 

Restructuring costs and  
other non-operating items
Our commitment to building a healthy 
business and proactively dealing with change 
in the industry has meant we have reviewed 
our operating activities and restructured 
parts of the Group. This has led to a 
restructuring charge of £86.2 million. 

The costs are largely compensation in nature, 
and principally relate to the simplification of 
our technology footprint, the relocation of 
our wealth management servicing platform 
along with reorganising our Client Group and 
other parts of the business. These initiatives 
allow us to reinvest our resources in the 
capabilities needed for long-term growth 
and in creating value for our clients 
and shareholders.

Central costs increased to £52.9 million from 
£48.8 million in 2022. These represent costs 
associated with the corporate management 
and governance of the Group and the costs 
incurred as part of our strategic corporate 
development and treasury activities. 

The Group holds seed and investment capital 
and we generated a net gain on financial 
instruments and other income of 
£32.1 million (2022: loss of £6.7 million) and 
net interest income increased to £23.6 million 
(2022: £5.8 million). Acquisition costs and 
related items increased slightly to 
£90.0 million (2022: £86.4 million), principally 
due to higher amortisation costs. 

The combined impact of these movements 
along with the profit from our operating 
segments resulted in a profit before tax 
for the year of £487.6 million (2022: 
£586.9 million). Profit after tax was 
£402.6 million (2022: £486.2 million).

Reflecting on 2023
While the year brought considerable 
challenges to the asset management 
industry, I am proud of Schroders’ resilient 
performance and am convinced that this 
is due to our unwavering commitment to 
our strategy. 

Through the incremental steps taken 
to develop all parts of the business, we 
are positioning ourselves to serve clients 
across all parts of the investment 
management sphere.

1.  Real Estate Securities and externally managed GAIA funds have been reclassified to align with management responsibility. Associated revenues and margins have also 

been restated throughout this Business and financial review.

2.  Our interest in BoCom wealth management company has been reclassified from a subsidiary to an associate.
3.  Includes markets, foreign exchange and investment performance. Foreign exchange decreased AUM (including joint ventures and associates) by around £25.8 billion 

(2022: increase of £37.3 billion) and decreased AUM (excluding joint ventures and associates) by £18.6 billion (2022: increase of £34.0 billion).

Our business experienced good fundraising 
in 2023 despite the broader slowdown in 
market activity, winning £9.3 billion 
(2022: £14.2 billion) of gross fundraising. 
This drove strong net new business flows of 
£4.5 billion (2022: £6.6 billion) with positive 
flows across our four pillars: private equity, 
private debt, infrastructure and real estate. 
As at 31 December 2023, we had an 
additional £4.0 billion (2022: £4.0 billion) 
in non-fee-earning dry powder ready to be 
deployed. Flows in our real estate business 
were particularly strong, at £1.6 billion 
(2022: £4.8 billion). Overall, net operating 
revenue grew by 14% to £422.8 million 
(2022: £369.8 million), with an increase in 
management fees as well as record 
performance-based revenues of £54.5 million 
(2022: £18.8 million). The net operating 
revenue margin, excluding performance fees 
and carried interest, reduced to 57 basis 
points (2022: 60 basis points) principally due 
to lower real estate transaction fees.

Solutions generated impressive net inflows 
of £12.0 billion (2022: nil), driven by strong 
flows into our OCIO and LDI businesses. This 
demonstrates the strength of our fiduciary 
services following last year’s acquisition of 
River and Mercantile’s solutions business. 
Due to the timing of these flows, in particular 
strong net new business in the latter part of 
the year, and the impact of the gilt crisis on 
the value of AUM towards the end of 2022, 
our average AUM reduced to £212.1 billion 
(2022: £225.0 billion). Net operating revenue 
therefore declined to £268.5 million (2022: 
£293.6 million) and the associated margin 
excluding performance fees decreased to 
12 basis points (2022: 13 basis points).

The rise in risk-free rates alongside wider 
market volatility led to £4.2 billion and 
£9.2 billion of outflows in our traditional 

asset management businesses, Mutual 
Funds and Institutional. While management 
fees declined in the year, we continued to 
perform for clients, generating £20.8 million 
of institutional performance fees (2022: 
£32.1 million). Overall, net operating revenue 
for Mutual Funds and Institutional reduced 
to £1,219.9 million (2022: £1,303.7 million). 
Given the outflows from higher-margin 
equity products, Mutual Funds net operating 
revenue margin excluding performance fees 
decreased to 69 basis points (2022: 71 basis 
points). Our Institutional net operating 
revenue margin increased by 1 basis point to 
35 basis points (2022: 34 basis points) due to 
outflows from lower-margin mandates.

The share of profits from our Asset 
Management associates and joint ventures 
generated a return of £48.7 million (2022: 
£73.6 million), representing a reduction from 
2022. Our strategic partnerships, such as 
Bank of Communications in China and Axis in 
India, are not only key contributors to Asset 
Management operating profit but also 
enable us to take advantage of further 
opportunities in the markets in which they 
operate. Performance during 2023 was 
however impacted by adverse foreign 
exchange movements and unfavourable 
market sentiment. 

Operating expenses in Asset Management 
remained largely flat at £1,471.7 million 
(2022: £1,475.6 million), reflecting our 
continued focus on cost control despite 
inflationary pressures. 

Overall, these movements resulted in 
operating profit of £510.5 million 
(2022: £593.1 million) for the Asset 
Management segment.

Our Asset Management segment 
experienced robust performance despite 
ongoing market challenges. 

The growth of our Asset Management 
AUM to £532.2 billion (2022: £518.4 billion) 
reflects our ability to navigate changing 
market conditions through our diversified 
business model and deliver value to 
our clients. 

This growth in AUM was driven by two 
of our strategic growth areas: Private 
Markets and Solutions, demonstrating 
the alignment of our business strategy 
with the market opportunity. 

Net operating revenue, however, 
reduced by 3% to £1,911.2 million 
(2022: £1,967.1 million) largely as a result 
of the market dynamics facing our public 
markets business.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Within Wealth Management, the subsidiaries 
that provide banking services are legally 
responsible for the banking assets and 
liabilities. They are therefore included in the 
consolidated statement of financial position. 
The assets are managed to earn a net 
interest margin whilst having regard for the 
liquidity demands that may arise from clients.

After adjusting for these structures, the 
Group’s total assets comprised cash and 
other financial assets of £2.2 billion (2022: 
£2.4 billion) and other assets of £4.1 billion 
(2022: £4.1 billion). 

Cash and financial assets includes both 
investment capital (mainly comprising cash, 
cash-like funds and other funds managed by 
the Group) and seed capital. During 2023, 
investment capital increased by £73 million to 
£257 million (2022: £184 million) and our 
seed capital decreased to £314 million (2022: 
£363 million). 

Other assets include goodwill and intangible

purposes, and assets that support our 
ongoing operating activities in the form of 
working capital.

Our year-end capital position remains strong, 
with a capital surplus of £630 million (2022:

The Group’s net assets were £4.5 billion 
(2022: £4.5 billion). The different forms of 
business that we conduct affect our total 
assets and liquidity. Generally, assets that 
are managed by the Group on behalf of 
clients are not included in the consolidated 
statement of financial position. There are, 
however, certain exceptions to this.

Within Asset Management, certain clients 
invest through life insurance policies that 
are managed by our life company, Schroder 
Pensions Management Limited. The assets 
backing these policies are held by the life 
company and are therefore included in the 
consolidated statement of financial position 
along with a matching policyholder liability. 
Additionally, we consolidate certain pooled 
funds which we are deemed to control under 
accounting standards.

Wealth Management thrived in 2023, 
achieving strong performance across all 
three service lines: advice, managed assets 
and our Benchmark platform.

A record high AUM of £110.2 billion 
(2022: £98.1 billion) was supported by strong 
net inflows of £6.6 billion: £4.9 billion in 
advised; £0.5 billion in platform; and 
£1.2 billion from managed assets. 

Our advised business in particular had an 
excellent year, achieving an NNB growth rate 
of 8% and gaining further market share 
through our UK regional development and 
the strength of our charities business.

Across the Wealth Management segment, 
net operating revenue increased by 7% to 
£423.2 million (2022: £394.3 million), with 
good growth in management fees and 
higher net interest income. The net operating 
revenue margin increased to 41 basis points 
(2022: 40 basis points) reflecting the rise in 
interest rates.

Schroders Personal Wealth was more 
impacted by the UK’s difficult economic 
environment but delivered positive net 
flows of £0.3 billion regardless. Our Wealth 
Management associates and joint ventures 
generated £2.4 million of share of profits 
during the year (2022: £4.0 million).

Operating expenses increased slightly to 
£286.3 million (2022: £276.9 million). 
The increase in the year principally reflects 
our continued investment in this growth 
area, both through strategic hires and 
enhancements to our IT platform. As a result 
of these movements, operating profit for the 
segment increased by 16% to £150.5 million 
(2022 £129.9 million).

In light of the overall market environment, 
this represents very strong performance.

Investing sustainably

Understanding and managing  
social and environmental change…

Sustainability is integral to the way we 
advise many of our clients, solve their 
investment problems, and manage 
their investments for the long term – 
it is not a standalone activity.

Our operating context
Environmental and social change has the 
potential to impact every economy, industry 
and investment portfolio. Exposure to the 
risks and opportunities these changes create 
is unavoidable. Social and political views of 
climate change, nature loss, inequality and 
human rights failures are diverse. Our clients, 
however, share a common goal of requiring 
investment returns against a backdrop 
of change.

2023 saw further backlash from some 
quarters towards the premise of sustainable 
investment. At the same time, many 
advocates became increasingly vocal. This 
divergence of views is likely to continue. It 
does not alter our conviction that to deliver 
the portfolios and performance our clients 
expect, it is critical we continue to proactively 
understand, measure and manage 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

Our approach to 
investing sustainably
The current focus by regulators is helping 
establish common standards for sustainable 
investment products and increased 
transparency about the sustainability 
characteristics of our funds. However, we 
believe that effective sustainable investment 
goes beyond complying with standard, 
“off-the-shelf” ratings.

Our approach is centred on incorporating an 
understanding of social and environmental 
trends into investment decisions and 
stewardship. Trends like climate change, 
nature loss, inequality and social unrest 
can pose material risks. They can also 
provide sources of opportunity. We treat 
sustainability as a key investment question, 
into which we invest time and resources to 
establish distinctive insights. These are 
underpinned by decades of sustainable 
investment experience.

We recognise that clients have a wide 
variety of needs and goals in relation to 
sustainability, and we have established clear 
frameworks to deliver thoughtful solutions. 
Some clients seek opportunities to invest in 
strategies that provide exposure to specific 
sustainability themes, or which have a 
positive impact on tackling those challenges. 
We are able to provide strategies focused 
on those goals. Doing so is not simple. 
Identifying and understanding sustainability 
themes and their consequences requires a 
combination of sustainability, industry and 
investment expertise.

A focus in 2023 has been on establishing 
an impact framework building on more 
than two decades of experience and industry 
leadership in BlueOrchard. We became a 
signatory to the Operating Principles for 
Impact Management in 2022, and in 
2023 we were pleased to be added to 
BlueMark’s Practice Leaderboard, following 
its assessment of our alignment to 
those principles.

Active ownership
Constructive and committed engagement 
with management teams at the companies 
and assets we invest in is an important part 
of our active investment approach. The table

in numbers.

Climate+ LTAF

Democratisation of private markets is 
something we were eager to make 
available to our clients, and in March 
2023, Schroders received FCA approval 
to launch the UK’s first LTAF.

The fund, Climate+, is focused on private 
asset investments that relate to climate 
mitigation, adaption, biodiversity and 

social vulnerabilities – an area we know 
is important to many pension savers. 

It is managed by Schroders Capital, our 
private markets business, and available 
to UK savers in certain pension funds 
that have appointed Schroders to 
manage their assets.

Understanding

Active engagement in 
our clients’ interests

Meeting demand 
with new solutions

The integration and application of 
sustainability factors into investment 
decisions are an important part of our 
strategy. Our dedicated Sustainable 
Investment Team works with investment 
colleagues across public and private 
markets to develop research and build 
proprietary models. SustainEx™, which 
focuses on public market securities, 
helps investment teams understand 
and measure sustainability exposures, 
risks and opportunities. 

Individual investment desks, covering 
Schroder-managed strategies, are 
accredited on how sustainability issues 
are identified, examined and incorporated 
into investment decisions.

Engaging with the management teams 
of companies in which we invest to 
encourage and support them in adapting 
to emerging social and environmental 
pressures can be an important source 
of value.

Our Engagement Blueprint, recently 
extended to include private markets, 
describes the areas on which we focus 
and our approach. Each quarter, we 
report our progress on engagement 
with portfolio companies.

We view engagement and voting as 
opportunities to influence portfolio 
companies, which must be considered  
on a case-by-case basis.

Demand for sustainable investment 
strategies continues to outpace the 
wider global fund market. There is 
particularly strong growth in demand for 
products providing exposure to specific 
sustainability themes or which deliver 
positive impacts to help tackle social and 
environmental challenges.

It is important that sustainable investment 
strategies deliver the outcomes clients 
want to achieve – rather than simply 
comply with standardised requirements.

Meeting our climate 
commitments

Climate change represents an unavoidable risk to global 
economies, industries and investment portfolios, but also  
a source of opportunity. Meeting the commitments global 
leaders made in Paris in 2015 to limit temperature rise to 
below 2°C – and the targets to reach net zero, which have 
been established in countries representing close to 90%  
of global economic output – will inevitably be disruptive. 
As a global investment manager, it is our responsibility to 
deliver investment performance for our clients through 
our understanding of how the impacts of climate change 
and nature loss will affect assets and investments.

Our climate change strategy
We have made a series of climate and nature-related commitments 
to support achieving net zero by 2050 or sooner. These span 
both the investments we manage and our own operations. These 
commitments build on years of research, risk analysis, proprietary 
tool development and action to understand and manage the 
risks and transition opportunities posed by climate change and 
biodiversity loss. We were among the first 20 financial institutions 
to have our targets formally validated by the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi). The validation confirmed that our Scope 1 and 2 
targets are in line with a 1.5°C trajectory and that our relevant AUM 
is also targeted to be fully aligned with a 1.5°C pathway by 2040.

Our transition plan has four key pillars of action: our insights, 
our influence, our innovation and our ability to use our position 
to inspire others.

For Earth Day in April, our employees 
volunteered to support six 
impact-led environmental events 
and initiatives across the globe. 

Reporting on climate matters
The following section is in accordance with the Companies 
(Strategic Report) (Climate-related Financial Disclosures) 
Regulations 2022. We have also produced a supplemental 
detailed Climate Report to provide a more comprehensive 
and tailored view for our stakeholders in accordance with 
the FCA Listing Rule 9.8.6R(8). The following, read together 
with our detailed Climate Report (which can be found on our 
website1) is our response to, and is consistent with, all the 
recommendations and relevant recommended disclosures  
of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 
These disclosures describe how we incorporate climate-related 
risks and opportunities into governance, strategy, risk 
management, metrics and targets and how we are responding 
to the expectations of our stakeholders.

Strategy
Our sustainability strategy is embedded throughout our business. 
Our strategic and financial planning process includes an assessment 
of any changes needed to respond to climate and nature-related risks 
and opportunities.

Risks and opportunities
By setting and meeting our targets, we expect the assets we invest in 
will be less exposed to the risks of the transition. To embed this across 
our investment business, our consistent, principles-based framework 
for ESG integration requires each investment desk to consider 
climate-related risks and opportunities. We complement this process 
with an annual accreditation requiring each investment desk to 
articulate how these factors are incorporated into their investment 
process. This annual submission is reviewed and approved by the 
central Sustainable Investment team. 

The approach to identifying, assessing and managing climate risks 
and opportunities differs depending on the category of asset class 
and business: 

•  For our listed assets, the models and data encompassed in our 

Climate Analytics Framework supports our investment teams to be 
able to identify and assess climate-related risks and opportunities, 
augmenting their own company and industry insights.

•  For our private markets business, individual asset classes have 

developed dedicated scorecards. 

•  In our wealth management business, and multi-manager teams, 
we assess third-party managers on their alignment to the Paris 
Agreement and the extent to which they consider climate-related 
risks and opportunities in their investments. 

For our own operations, we identify and assess climate-related risks 
and opportunities by carrying out an annual inventory of all relevant 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our key operational risks and 
opportunities are managed by the relevant business functions, 
supported by the Corporate Sustainability team. The Group 
Sustainability and Impact (GSI) Committee recommends the overall 
strategy and monitors the progress against our targets.

The following tables show the climate-related risks and opportunities 
related to the investments we manage and our own operations, along 
with the time horizons in which we expect them to materialise.

•  Short term: 0–5 years aligns with our strategic planning, business 

forecasting, and viability assessment. Our RCA methodology 
focuses on identifying and assessing risks that may crystallise 
within the next five years, including physical climate risks for our 
offices. It also reflects the typical investment duration of our clients. 

•  Medium term: 6-10 years is considered “near term” by the SBTi. This 
timeframe reflects the period in which we expect material changes 
in the climate exposures of investee companies resulting from our 
engagement with their management teams.

•  Long term: Beyond 10 years, the physical impacts of climate 

change will intensify and the level of political action to address 
climate change will become clearer. Our business may be 
influenced by different climate scenarios over this extended period.

   Insights: Measure and manage exposure  

in our clients’ investment portfolios

In 2023, the near-term (2030) Scope 1 and 2 temperature score of 
our listed equity, corporate bond, REITs and ETF exposure reduced 
from 2.6°C to 2.5°C, and the long-term Scope 1, 2 and 3 
temperature score from 2.9°C to 2.8°C.

The investments we manage are exposed to climate risks but also 
opportunities associated with the net zero transition. Climate risk 
and opportunities exposure can vary widely between asset classes, 
sectors and regions, which highlights the value in diversification. 
In Schroders Capital, we have sought to take advantage of the 
opportunities associated with the transition by investing in 
technology that aims to tackle climate change. This is evidenced by 
our acquisition of a leading renewables infrastructure investment 
manager, Greencoat Capital (now Schroders Greencoat) in 2022. 
This disparity in exposures across asset classes means we cannot 
take a single approach to the integration of climate-related risks 
and opportunities by our investment teams. Different factors will 
be more relevant to certain asset classes than others. An Implied 
Temperature Rise (ITR) metric that assesses a company’s net zero 
ambition will be less relevant for an infrastructure strategy that aims 
to assess the emissions saved over the lifetime of the asset: a wind 
turbine replacing a coal power plant, for instance. To tackle this 
challenge, in 2023 we upgraded our ESG integration accreditation 
framework, requiring each of our more than 65 investment desks to 
outline how they systematically consider climate-related risks and 
opportunities in their investment process and evidence with case 
studies how they have engaged on the topic of climate. This 
framework is global, covering Schroders’ public-markets, private-
markets, and wealth businesses. It is principles-based, requiring 
each of the business areas to consider climate related risks and 
opportunities in a way that is relevant to them. 

2023 scenario analysis findings
We consider climate scenario analysis to be a valuable tool for 
better understanding climate risks and opportunities. Climate 
scenario analysis can inform investment decision-making. Where 
possible, we have quantitatively analysed the exposure of our 
investment holdings to physical and transition climate risks under 
a range of climate scenarios. We align our choice of scenarios to 
the externally defined set of reference scenarios provided by the 
Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)1. Some scenarios 
assume stringent carbon policies and rapid decarbonisation, while 
others assume slow and uncoordinated policy action. 

The scenarios used are not intended to be predictions of the future, 
but rather to enable us to understand and consider the risks and 
opportunities from different possible outcomes. The models are 
built on the assumption that companies in which we invest make no 
change or adaptation over time. Furthermore, this analysis is based 
on a snapshot of current holdings and does not consider action to 
mitigate risk, such as engagement or portfolio changes. 

Under the lens of aggregated climate VaR2 in Figure 1, our covered 
investments are most exposed to climate risks under a 1.5°C 
scenario, with a potential impact of -14% of current market value. 
This impact diminishes slightly under 2°C (-12%) and 3°C (-10%) 
scenarios. In general, the model shows that transition risks are 
greater than physical risk. It is important to note that the model 
outputs are one view of the world and do not necessarily reflect 
the potential longer term physical implications of climate change, 
particularly given the complex and connected nature of physical 
risks, such as the catalytic effect of tipping points. The horizontal 
lines in Figure 1 represent the aggregated climate VaR of the 
covered investments, while the columns represent the value for 
each individual sector. There are marked differences in the profiles

of different sectors of the economy, with aggregated climate risk 
becoming progressively more concentrated in sectors like basic 
materials and oil and gas under more aggressive transition scenarios.

The negative implications of physical climate impacts are outweighed 
by the transition risk impacts under the stringent policy scenario that 
will be needed to deliver global climate goals. The chart in Figure 2 
summarises the sector exposures in a high-risk scenario for both 
physical and transition risks. The size of the bubbles represents the 
share of our in-scope AUM invested in that sector.

Climate scenario analysis is more challenging for our private markets 
business, where a consistent quantitative approach is not feasible. 
Each asset class integrates climate differently, based on how 
climate change risks or opportunities impact investments and the 
availability of data and methodologies. Proprietary ESG scorecards 
inform this approach, with climate change categories weighted based 
on their materiality for specific sectors, regions, or asset types, and 
contribute to the overall ESG score for each investment.

   Influence: Track and hold  

investee companies to account

We believe we can most effectively manage climate exposure by 
engaging with the most material carbon emitters in the portfolios 
we manage. We do not believe that divestment is the best starting 
point for investors to decarbonise portfolios. We apply this principle 
across both listed equities and corporate bond investments. Our 
approach is summarised in a five-point Climate Engagement and 
Escalation Framework:

1.  Climate expectations: the climate objectives we expect large and 

medium-sized companies to adopt.

2.  Company prioritisation and selection: how we develop our climate 

engagement priority list.

3.  Monitor progress: we use our tools to monitor progress against 

our climate expectations.

4.  Voting policy: we either endorse resolutions that align with our 

climate approach or provide an explanation for our non-
endorsement of resolutions.

5.  Escalation policy: where we see no meaningful progress towards 

our objectives, we have a framework for escalation.

A solutions approach to net zero

In 2023, we engaged with 743 companies setting 677 objectives. 
We also undertook 119 collaborative engagements over the period. 

The distinct characteristics of private markets investment strategies 
– typically longer investment horizons – provide us with an 
opportunity to build operational and financial value from origination 
to exit. In many cases for private markets, our first goal is to improve 
the quality and level of disclosure on climate materiality, emissions 
and decarbonisation, or to gain a deeper understanding of how 
potential risks have been considered, priced and mitigated. When we 
directly own a real asset, we look at how the asset’s exposure and 
impact on climate change can be reduced, how the asset will evolve 
to ensure its resilience to climate risks, and how the asset interacts 
with local stakeholders.

In Wealth Management, we engage directly with our investment 
managers. Approximately 60% of our managers have made a net 
zero commitment, yet very few have formally implemented those 
commitments into their underlying funds. By engaging them to 
promote progress towards net zero within their funds, our objective 
is that they, in turn, will encourage the underlying companies they 
own. In the short term, our engagement will focus on accelerating 
progress by building our understanding and sharing best practice. 
We will concentrate our efforts on the managers still yet to make a 
commitment, prioritising those with business models that make 
setting a commitment less challenging.

3    Innovate: A solutions approach to net zero

We understand that our clients are at different stages of their net 
zero transition journey and have different views of the climate 
challenge. This is why we have designed our climate product 
framework to focus more on our clients’ targeted decarbonisation 
outcomes, while also expanding the options available to our clients. 
Since we launched the Global Climate Change (GCC) strategy in 2007, 
our climate-focused range has grown to over 15 strategies across 
public and private markets. Though our aim is for all Schroders 
strategies to align to our commitments, given their unique investment 
approach, their trajectories will vary and may not always be linear.

   Inspire: Transitioning  

our own operations to net zero

Our operational climate change strategy focuses on reducing GHG 
emissions and resource use across our operations. We are doing this 
by decreasing energy demand, increasing energy efficiency and 
switching to low-carbon electricity sources. We also aim to reduce our 
business travel and engage with our supply chain to encourage them 
to set their own science-based targets.

In 2023, our total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions decreased by 35% 
from the 2019 base year and decreased by 2% compared with 2022. 
The SBTi defines a 4.2% reduction in GHG emissions in linear annual 
terms, to be in line with a 1.5°C trajectory. This means that our 2023 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions should represent a minimum of 16.8% 
reduction against our 2019 base year emissions, against which we 
achieved a 35% reduction. Although we recognise our progress will 
not be linear, we are currently on track with a 1.5°C aligned science-
based pathway.

We have also increased the annual sourcing of renewable electricity 
to 98%, compared with 95% in 2022. Our 2023 figures are in line with 
the RE100 criteria, which will be assessed and verified in our 2024 
CDP submission. This increase was primarily due to the increased 
purchase of renewable electricity certificates for our global locations, 
where we could not directly influence the electricity supply, as well as 
electricity contracts being changed to renewable-based supplies.

We continue to develop site-specific net zero action plans and to 
attain ISO 14001 Environmental Management System certification 
across our largest office sites, as well as transition our company car 
fleet to hybrid or fully electric by 2025 to support these targets.

Our operational Scope 3 value chain emissions (excluding our 
financed emissions) are about 31 times larger than our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions. As 96% of these Scope 3 emissions relate to business 
travel and our supply chain, we have chosen to set additional targets 
for these areas. Business travel emissions have decreased by 39% 
from the 2019 base year, but have increased by 53% compared with 
2022 as business travel continued to increase. We will continue to 
manage this closely and challenge ourselves on the purpose, 
frequency and mode of travel.

Taking a similar approach to our active ownership programme with 
investee companies, we have a supplier engagement plan under 
which we encourage and support our suppliers to act more 
sustainably. In 2023, 23% of our suppliers in scope1 (by GHG 
emissions) had set a science-based target. This is a 2% decrease, 
compared to 2022, and is due to changes in supplier spend and 
updated emissions factors in sectors that contribute a high 
proportion to our spend. 

Risk management
Our principal risks are set out on pages 41 to 43. Given the 
importance of climate-related risks to our business, ‘Sustainability risk 
including climate change’ has been identified as one of our principal 
risks. There is an accompanying risk appetite statement, approved by 
the Board, which enables us to provide an assessment of risk position 
versus our risk appetite on an annual basis, while monitoring 
performance throughout the year. 

Climate and nature-related risks are managed in accordance with 
the same ‘three lines of defence’ model we use for all risks. The 
heads of each business area are ultimately responsible for ensuring 
risks are identified, assessed and managed by investment teams. 
Independent monitoring is then carried out by the second line of 
defence. Internal Audit provides independent assurance over the 
operation of controls. We recognise that climate change in particular 
is a pervasive risk across many of our key risk types. Heads of 
business areas across the Group are responsible for identifying these 
risks and assessing the impacts to their business areas in line with 
their functional responsibilities. 

36

Governance
The Board is responsible for approving the Group’s strategy, which 
includes our sustainability strategy. The Board has delegated overall 
responsibility for the delivery of the Group’s strategy to the Group 
Chief Executive, who has the authority to delegate further while 
retaining overall responsibility for the delivery of our strategy. In 
discharging its responsibilities, the Board takes appropriate account 
of the interests of our stakeholders, including clients and wider 
society. Our governance framework enables the Board to have 
oversight of the climate and nature-related risks and opportunities 
impacting our business. Through this framework, the Board receives 
regular briefings on sustainability matters, including climate and 
nature-related issues. 

•  The Board was updated on how sustainability trends, for both our 

own operations and the investments we manage, were shaping our 
industry, and on progress on some key issues including climate 
change, biodiversity, human rights and community investment. 

•  At our annual Board strategy meeting, the Board noted our 

leadership position in sustainability as part of the Group Chief 
Executive’s strategy paper. The Board also noted several climate 
and nature-related developments as part of the Governance report. 

The Audit and Risk Committee receives reports from management 
on key risks to ensure they are considered at Board level. As 
‘Sustainability risk including climate change’ is identified as a key 
business risk, the Audit and Risk Committee received information 
quarterly to assess how it is being managed. During 2023, the Audit 
and Risk Committee had five meetings. For more information on the 
Audit and Risk Committee, see pages 66 to 73.

Within our governance structure, sustainability is integrated across 
our business areas. There are a number of management committees 
and working groups that assess, advise on and oversee climate and 
nature-related risks and opportunities. 

Our key sustainability management committee is the GSI Committee. 
The GSI Committee provides advice to the Group Chief Executive to 
assist him in discharging his responsibilities regarding sustainability 
and impact. The GSI Committee monitors our climate and nature-
related targets with progress reported to the Board (for more 
information on our targets, see our Climate Report 2023)2. The 
obligations of our climate transition plan are monitored by the GSI 
Committee as part of reviewing our sustainability strategy. This 
includes monitoring progress towards our science-based targets. 
During 2023, the GSI Committee had six meetings. For further 
information on our climate and nature governance structure,  
see our Climate Report 2023.2

Our remuneration structures emphasise the strategic importance 
of climate-related issues. Executive Directors have sustainability 
measures in their annual bonus and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
scorecards. Performance against these measures impacts their 
compensation outcomes. 

Metrics and targets
We use a number of metrics and targets to track progress against 
our climate change strategy to ensure that we are responding 
appropriately to the climate-related risks and opportunities facing 
our business. Please refer to page 31 for more detail on our net 
zero targets. 

We have developed an ESG Risk Dashboard to monitor financed 
emissions and portfolio risks. This is incorporated into the investment 
risk management processes and includes, among other sustainability 
metrics, a product’s carbon footprint Weighted Average Carbon 
Intensity (WACI) for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, plus Carbon VaR, 
calculated using our proprietary Carbon VaR tool.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023We recognise that emissions data is frequently based on estimates 
or proxy data and, as a result, provides an imperfect view of portfolio 
exposures or risks. The data we rely on can also change materially 
from one year to the next, as data quality improves or estimation 
methods change. We continue to work to ensure the data we use 
is as accurate as possible, but highlight that any outputs should be 
interpreted as approximate and not precise.

Our operational data is reviewed internally; through an environmental 
accounting tool, we are able to log targets and track progress. We also 
make sure that the most up-to-date, relevant emission factors are 

used in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a global standardised 
framework to measure and manage greenhouse gas emissions. 

Our operational GHG emissions, target progress, waste and water 
data are externally assured by Incendium Consulting Ltd.

The SBTi requires that targets shall be reviewed, and if necessary, 
recalculated and revalidated at least every five years, to reflect 
material changes in climate science and business context.  
We review our GHG inventory annually and will restate our data  
and/or recalculate our science-based targets when required.

and the implied temperature rise of our entire portfolio across all 
in-scope asset classes (listed equities, corporate bonds, real estate

available, we use the estimates provided by our data vendor, and we 
use our own methodology, which is based on Partnership of Carbon

estimation is to provide as complete and representative a picture of 

portfolio emissions as we believe is possible. Carbon and climate 
data reported by companies is frequently incomplete and based on 
inconsistent assumptions. This data forms the basis of our financed 
emissions calculations, which should be considered estimates rather 
than precise figures. We have followed PCAF principles in calculating 
our financed emissions, but recognise that the underlying data can 
change materially as reported data increases and estimation 
methodologies improve.

Risk management

Our risk 
management 
framework

We are exposed to a variety of risks as a result of our global 
business activities and are committed to operating within 
a strong system of internal control. Our Risk Management 
framework enables management to identify, manage and 
escalate risks so that we can pursue our business strategy 
without exposing the Group to significant regulatory  
breaches, losses or reputational damage.

As our business has continued to expand into areas of strategic 
growth, we have pivoted resources towards supporting these 
areas. We appointed a Head of Risk, Private Markets in 2023 
to consolidate our oversight of the Schroders Capital business. 
Additionally, we have adapted our Risk and Compliance 
recruitment strategy to focus on recruiting staff with private 
markets experience to enable us to provide knowledgeable 
and effective oversight across our diverse business.

Managing risks
The Board is accountable for the maintenance of a prudent and 
effective system of internal control and risk management. It 
assesses the most significant risks facing the business, and also 
uses quantitative exposure measures, such as stress tests, where 
appropriate, to understand the potential impact on the business.

Non-executive oversight of the Risk Management framework 
process with respect to standards of integrity, risk management and 
internal control is exercised through the Audit and Risk Committee. 

Risk management is embedded in all areas of the Group. The Group 
Chief Executive and Group Management Committee (GMC), as an 
advisory committee to the Group Chief Executive, regularly review 
the key risks we face. They are also responsible for monitoring that 
the individual behaviours in the teams they manage reflect the 
values and control standards of the business. Legal entity boards 
fulfil their obligations for managing risks in line with regulatory and 
legal requirements.

The executive oversight of risk is delegated by the Group Chief 
Executive to the Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Financial Officer

is responsible for the Group’s risk and control framework, and 
chairs the Group Risk Committee (GRC). The GRC supports the Chief 
Financial Officer in discharging his risk management responsibilities. 
The GRC reviews and monitors the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
Group’s Risk Management framework, including relevant policies and 
limits. It also reviews emerging risks and changes to existing risks. 

The GRC is supported by a number of sub-committees, including 
the Group Conflicts Committee, the Financial Crime Committee 
and the Information Security Risk Oversight Committee. These 
sub-committees review and challenge risks and report significant 
risk matters to the GRC.

Lines of defence
The first line of defence in managing and mitigating risk consists of 
the business functions and line managers across the Group. Heads 
of each function take the lead role in identifying potential risks and 
implementing and maintaining appropriate controls to manage 
these risks. They do this by applying our Risk and Control 
Assessment (RCA) process.

Line management is supplemented by oversight functions, including 
Risk, Compliance, Legal, Governance, Finance, Tax and Human 
Resources. These constitute the second line of defence. The 
compliance assurance programme reviews the effective operation 
of relevant key processes against regulatory requirements.

Internal Audit provides retrospective, independent assurance 
over the operation of controls, and forms the third line of defence. 
The internal audit programme includes reviews of risk management 
processes and recommendations to improve the control 
environment. The team also carries out thematic compliance 
monitoring work.

We maintain comprehensive insurance cover with a broad range 
of policies covering a number of insurable events.

Risk appetite
Our risk appetite statements articulate the levels of risk the Board 
is willing to take in pursuit of the Group’s strategy. They cover 
all our key risks (excluding strategic risk, as this risk type mainly 
comprises factors that are external to our operating model). 
We have a Group level risk appetite statement and a number 
of entity level statements. 

Each risk appetite statement is supported by a number of metrics 
and tolerances to enable us to provide an assessment of risk 
position against risk appetite using a Red, Amber, Yellow, Green 
rating. In 2023, we reviewed the way we describe each rating and 
updated the descriptions to provide additional clarity to the Audit 
and Risk Committee and Board on the situations in which they 
would need to take action. 

Market shocks (and volatility)
Market shocks in 2023 continued to test our emerging risk and 
crisis management processes. The collapse of Silicon Valley and 
First Republic Banks reiterated the need for us to maintain strong 
oversight enabling early identification of potential issues. Our ability 
to gather exposures quickly across the Group was tested and 
proved effective.

Credit Suisse’s vulnerability was flagged by Group Credit Risk at an 
early stage. At the time of the eventual collapse of the bank we had 
immaterial exposures as the credit risk process and early warning 
signs mitigated any material business impact to portfolios and our 
corporate balance sheet.

We are mindful of a number of elections, globally, in 2024 which 
may impact the business environment in which we operate.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Developments 
in our risk 
management 
approach

Supporting areas of strategic growth
To support the implementation of robust controls within Schroders 
Capital as it expands, and enhance our oversight at the appropriate 
pace, we have adapted our risk and compliance approach. We have 
consolidated our oversight of Schroders Capital business processes 
and investment portfolios by appointing a Head of Risk, Private 
Markets and we have actively recruited risk and compliance staff 
with private markets experience to enable comprehensive 
oversight of diverse business areas such as Real Estate and 
Insurance-Linked Securities. This enhanced supervision supports 
the ‘‘democratisation’’ of private markets initiative within Schroders 
Capital, including oversight of product development processes.

Our Wealth Management Risk and Compliance function continues 
to provide effective oversight while the business expands. A key 
focus in 2023 (and into 2024) was the provision of guidance 
and second-line oversight on a strategic initiative to close the 
existing service centre in Zurich and transfer the functions to 
the Schroders campus in Horsham.

Regulatory initiatives
The Consumer Duty, which came into force in the UK on 31 July 
2023, has been implemented across the Group. A comprehensive 
programme, involving first-line and second-line representatives, was 
completed to support compliance with the new rules. This included 
staff training and enhancements to functional area policies and 
procedures. A Consumer Duty Forum has been established to 
oversee these new rules across the business. To demonstrate 
ongoing compliance, each UK-regulated entity board reviews and 
endorses an assessment of the entity’s delivery of good outcomes 
for its retail customers, at least annually.

Given the Group’s strategic focus on sustainability and the level 
of regulatory scrutiny on sustainability matters in connection with 
asset managers, we have performed a review of our second-line 
oversight processes for sustainability. The review resulted in 
enhanced collaboration with our Sustainability team to bring 
our existing controls together.

Investment risk
Despite strong performance through the gilt crisis in 2022, we have 
continued to enhance the resilience of our LDI offering. In addition 
to larger liquidity buffers and enhanced internal systems, we have 
created a library of playbooks, templates and guidance notes to 
record the lessons from 2022 and be well prepared for a future 
crisis. The effectiveness of our crisis preparations has been recently 
validated in a cross-functional ‘‘war game’’, where participants were 
presented in real time with a series of different scenarios, which 
progressively increased in severity. This successfully tested our ability 
to identify high-risk areas quickly. 

To support the oversight of investment risk control frameworks across 
the Group we have developed robotic process automation. This is 
embedded in our investment risk process and checks that controls 
across a wide range of portfolios are implemented and documented 
accurately. The use of robotic automation replaces a manual process 
introducing significant efficiency, allowing investment risk managers 
to focus on other value-add initiatives, and reduced operational risk.

The assets of the solutions business acquired from River and 
Mercantile in 2022 have been migrated to our core investment 
management system. This integration into the Group operating 
model has reduced risk and created efficiencies in first-line and 
second-line oversight. Front-office systems to support the investment 
desks, along with client and consultant portals, are now integrated 
with our core investment management system, yielding further 
operational efficiencies. 

Cyber risk
The Information Security Risk Oversight Committee continues 
to oversee the management of cyber risk. Our Group-wide multi-year 
programme to accelerate the evolution of our cyber defences is 
progressing well. We have recently developed advanced attacker 
metrics to enable the Audit and Risk Committee and GRC to monitor 
and challenge progress to improve the cyber risk profile. Attacks by 
organised crime groups (for example, targeted ransomware) remain 
a risk for financial services, and Schroders is no exception.

Managing the risks associated 
with Artificial Intelligence (AI)

As a business we are harnessing the power of AI to boost 
productivity and decision-making. As well as starting to 
test and adopt third-party products such as Microsoft365 
Copilot, we have developed an internal AI tool leveraging 
models such as ChatGPT, that enables employees to 
interact with and query data efficiently while maintaining 
the security of our client and proprietary information. 
While AI provides opportunities, there is a risk it increases 
the effectiveness of cyber threats such as deep fakes (where 
a video/audio recording of a person is digitally manipulated) 
or produces inaccurate information. Consuming this 
information could impact investment decisions or our 
reputation. To manage potential risks, we have established 
a set of principles and guidelines that govern the use of AI 
within Schroders. They support our goal to use AI in a way 
that aligns with our corporate values and complies with 
relevant laws and regulations including data confidentiality 
obligations. A Steering Committee has been set up to 
provide strategic direction, supported by a Responsible 
AI Working Group for oversight and guidance, and an AI 
Use Case Working Group which provides a central review of 
our use of AI throughout the firm. A core principle of our 
approach to AI is that all outputs are reviewed for accuracy 
and reliability prior to being used.

How we are performing: Risk management continued

Risk assessment

During the normal course of business, emerging risks and changes 
to our existing risks are identified throughout the year. Risks are 
reviewed and discussed at relevant risk committees (for example, 
the GRC) and Board meetings. Periodically, we also complete a 
formal assessment of the risks faced by our business using a 
top-down and bottom-up approach.

The top-down approach uses analysis from the Risk team and 
discussions with GMC members and subject matter experts around 
the Group. Existing risks and emerging risk trends are reviewed 
against the current internal and external environment, geopolitical 
factors, market conditions, changing client demand and regulatory 
sentiment. Our regulators aim to ensure market integrity, good 
conduct, appropriate consumer protection, and the promotion 
of competition within the industry are also taken into account. 
Each risk is then analysed to assess how it can be managed 
and mitigated.

The bottom-up approach uses the results from our RCAs, trends 
in risk events and high-impact issues logged in our operational 
risk database.

The results of these assessments are used to inform our key risks, 
which are presented to the GRC prior to the GMC, Audit and Risk 
Committee and Board meetings.

We have reviewed the list of key risks and identified a sub-set that 
we believe represents the Group’s principal risks. This is not an 
exhaustive list, but these are the principal risks most likely to impact 
our strategy, business model, external reputation and future 
performance. The numeric icons are for presentational purposes

Business model disruption

How we manage this

Our business model could be disrupted by a range of external factors including 
technology advancements such as AI, product evolution and market participants.

We continue to invest in our technology platform to support 
our business and embrace new technologies such as AI.

Geopolitical turmoil, including sanctions and conflict, could impact our domestic 
business activities. For example, heightened tension between China and the 
West may result in us losing our license to operate in China, and could affect the 
value of Chinese assets in which we invest on behalf of our clients. 

The rise of AI and the threat to the asset management industry means that this 
risk has increased in 2023.

We regularly monitor developments in countries subject 
to geopolitical risk and take steps to protect our people 
and assets where necessary. This includes monitoring 
and reviewing portfolio exposures, potential single name 
and/or sector vulnerability, and possible outcomes under 
different scenarios.

2

Changing investor requirements

Client requirements are evolving rapidly. Failing to adapt or evolve our business 
model and product range to reflect these changes could lead to a decrease in 
AUM. Sustainability is a significant part of many of our clients’ considerations 
and we expect climate risks to feature more heavily in future investment 
requirements and offerings.

The advice gap means demand for many wealth management products 
continues to persist. There is a risk we do not grow and evolve to respond to 
this demand and retain and attract the right people to serve our wealth 
management clients.

3

Conduct and regulatory risk

The risks of client detriment arising from inappropriate conduct of our staff or 
those of counterparties, suppliers and other third parties we engage, including 
failure to meet regulatory requirements (including those with respect to conflicts 
and financial crime), poor behaviour, or failing to meet appropriately our clients’ 
expectations. Regulators continue to take varying approaches to sustainability, 
making implementation more difficult and scrutiny of greenwashing risk 
remains high. 

This risk has stabilised at the elevated level reported last year as our compliance 
framework remains effective and enables us to manage our business in line with 
regulatory expectations.

4

Fee attrition

The integration of the River and Mercantile solutions 
business and Greencoat Capital have allowed us to evolve 
our products to meet a wider range of client needs.

We continue to focus on developing our investment 
capabilities, expanding into new investment types and 
specific areas of expertise, and commit seed capital to 
support product innovation for future growth.

We focus our attention where we believe we are able to 
make a more significant difference to our clients through 
current or planned future capabilities; for example, closing 
the UK private client advice gap through SPW and 
Benchmark Capital.

We promote a strong compliance culture and seek to 
maintain good relationships with our regulators. We also 
encourage appropriate conduct and regulatory compliance 
via our conduct risk framework, supported by training and 
compliance assurance programmes. Our Group Regulatory 
Oversight Committee and Sustainability Regulatory Steering 
Committee provide oversight and challenge of the 
implementation of regulatory change.

Fee attrition caused by clients allocating more of their assets to passive 
products, and less to active managers, coupled with a lower allocation to 
public markets, and a greater allocation to private markets (where we have 
a lower market share). This has resulted in increased competition on price 
in the traditional active management market and remains at the elevated level 
reported in prior years. We are also exposed to the risk of intermediaries taking 
a greater share of revenue streams.

We have continued to focus on solutions and outcome-
orientated strategies, thematic products and growing 
our market share within private markets, to diversify our 
fee income. Our fiduciary business within solutions 
continued to be successful during 2023. We are also 
increasingly diversifying our product offering, supporting 
long-term profitability.

We are moving to vertical integration and getting closer to 
clients allowing us to better understand their needs. This 
has also given us opportunities to access a greater share 
of available revenue.

5

Financial instrument risk

We face market, credit, liquidity and capital risks from movements in the financial 
markets in which we operate, arising from holding investments as principal. Due 
to ongoing geopolitical events generating market fluctuations and contributing 
towards inflation, movements in interest rates and commodity prices, we have 
seen continued higher volatility in several asset classes. There have also been 
shifts in correlations between asset classes.

Failure to manage market, credit and liquidity risks arising from managing AUM 
on behalf of clients would be considered an Operational Process risk.

We manage capital, liquidity and the Group’s own 
investments through Board-set limits and through the 
Group Capital Committee. Equity market and credit 
spread risks in seed capital are hedged where it is 
economic and practicable to do so and foreign currency 
Group investments are hedged back to sterling. We monitor 
our credit and counterparty exposure in the Group balance 
sheet, bank lending portfolios and in our client assets.

While volatility remains elevated in several asset classes, this risk has stabilised 
at the heightened level reported last year, and some asset classes have seen a 
gradual decline in risk levels. This is supported by recent falls in global inflation 
rates and the current outlook for declining interest rates.

Description

How we manage this

6

Information security and technology

We have a dedicated Information Security function 
responsible for the design and operation of our information 
security risk framework, which includes oversight of critical 
third parties’ cyber capabilities. Information security risk is 
overseen by specialists within both the second and third 
lines of defence and is monitored by the Information 
Security Risk Oversight Committee. We operate a Global 
Technology Risk Committee to oversee operational risk 
associated with IT services across the organisation. 

Information security risk relates to the confidentiality, integrity or availability 
of services being negatively impacted by the activities of a malicious insider 
or external party. Technology risk relates to the failure in delivering scalability, 
privacy, security, integrity and availability of systems that leads to a negative 
impact on the Schroders business and our client experience. Advances in AI 
and deep fake technology creates opportunities for more advanced social 
engineering techniques to be used in cyber attacks. These advances and other 
information identified through our threat intelligence and active cyber testing 
progress continue to provide insight on the areas we should focus on to 
enhance our cyber defence capabilities.

While the overall risk trend remains consistent with the level reported last year, 
there have been changes in the risk trends of individual components. Our 
technology risk has decreased, owing to the substantial completion of our 
migration to the Cloud, which has bolstered our resilience. Cyber threats, 
stemming from highly capable criminal organisations and state-sponsored 
entities, persist, and are amplified by advances in AI and deep fake technologies 
but we continually adapt and advance in response to these threats. 

7

Investment performance risk

There is a risk that portfolios may not meet their investment objectives or that 
there is a failure to deliver consistent and above-average performance. There is 
a risk that clients will move their assets elsewhere if we are unable to outperform 
competitors or unable to deliver the investment objectives. The higher interest 
rate environment can impact clients’ performance expectations and our ability 
to meet them and may require adjustments within strategies. Strong investment 
performance is critical to the success of Schroders.

We have clearly defined investment processes designed to 
meet investment targets within stated parameters, which 
are subject to independent review and challenge.

Oversight of both risk and performance is embedded in our 
business processes and governance. In 2023, 60% of client 
assets outperformed benchmarks over three years and 
77% outperformed benchmarks over five years.

8 Market returns

Our income is mainly derived from the value of the assets we manage. Falling 
markets reduce our AUM and therefore impact revenues. Market falls may be 
exacerbated by geopolitical risks, for example in response to the situation 
in Ukraine and the Middle East which remains heightened. Foreign exchange 
rates are a key factor in our financial performance as we are sterling 
denominated with earnings in other currencies.

We have diversified income streams across a range of 
markets to mitigate a considerable fall in any one area. 
Excluding associates and joint ventures, AUM from Private 
Markets, Solutions, and Wealth Management increased 
from £372 billion in 2022 to £405 billion in 2023, further 
increasing our diversification.

In addition, economic uncertainty and geopolitical developments presented 
a risk in 2023. The impact of higher inflation on interest rates, wages and 
economic growth could impact asset prices and markets, as could an 
acceleration of climate risk, leading to a fall in AUM. 

Throughout 2023 market conditions continued to be challenging so this risk 
remains at the same level reported in previous years.

Our focus on growing our Schroders Capital product range 
and investment capabilities, including the launch of the first 
Schroders Greencoat products, allows us to have a broader 
range of income streams which are less directly linked 
to markets.

9

Operational process risk

The risk of failure of significant business processes, such as compliance with 
fund or mandate restrictions, fund pricing, trade execution for investment 
portfolios and client suitability checks, whether these occur within Schroders 
or appointed third parties. It includes operational integration of acquisitions as 
there may be some risks while newly acquired firms are operating on different 
platforms, and before they are fully aligned to Schroders’ policies. It also includes 
the ineffective management of joint ventures and associates. 

Our key business processes are reviewed regularly and the 
risks assessed through the RCA process. Operational risk 
events are reviewed to identify root causes and implement 
control improvements. When we undertake change, such 
as acquisitions, we assess new processes that may arise. 
We work with acquired firms to move them onto our 
platforms (where appropriate) and to align our policies. 
We have a well-established process to assess the risks 
within our supply chain. We review suppliers throughout 
the supplier life cycle to identify potential risks which may 
impact the quality or continuity of service.

10

People and employment practices

People and employment practices risk may arise from an inability to attract 
or retain key employees to support business activities or strategic initiatives; 
non-compliance with legislation; or failure to manage employee performance. 
Inclusion and diversity remain a key focus for the company. The morale of 
the workforce remains good overall which is evidenced with our latest pulse 
survey results.

This risk has stabilised at the lower level reported last year as turnover remains 
low and within tolerance. 

We have a competitive remuneration and employee value 
proposition, with appropriate deferred compensation 
targeted at key employees. Sustainable succession and 
development plans are in place. We also have policies and 
procedures to encourage inclusion and diversity and to 
manage employment issues appropriately, handling them 
consistently, fairly and in compliance with local legislation.

42

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Description

How we manage this

11

Product strategy and management

There is a risk that our product or service offering is not suitably diversified or 
viable or does not provide access to strategies that will help investors to meet 
their objectives. There is also the risk that products are not accurately described, 
do not perform in alignment with their investment objectives for a sustained 
period, or that product liquidity is not consistent with the product description or 
the redemption requirements of investors.

12

Reputational risk

This may arise from poor conduct, judgement or risk events due to weaknesses 
in systems and controls and may lead to loss of assets or inability to win new 
business. In recent years we have extended our business through a number of 
acquisitions. Reputational issues in joint ventures and associates where we have 
limited control of the outcome could adversely impact the Group. 

Issues relating to senior management and directors have been experienced 
in a variety of organisations including financial services, corporations and 
industry bodies, which have damaged the reputation of these organisations. 
This is therefore a heightened risk for all firms. Failing to meet stakeholders’ 
expectations (for example, clients, regulators or the wider community) could 
also give rise to reputational risk.

The rise of AI provides opportunities for efficiency but also gives rise to potential 
reputational risk. Social media exacerbates reputational risk due to the pace at 
which information or disinformation can be spread, and how the information 
may be perceived by different stakeholders. As a result of these points, and the 
reputational issues observed in other organisations, this risk is heightened.

13

Sustainability risk including climate change

Failure to understand, accurately assess and manage investment risk associated 
with sustainability factors within assets and portfolios, and to appropriately 
articulate the risks, and our commitments in relation to them, to clients and 
stakeholders. This may lead to poor investment decisions, and a failure to offer 
appropriate sustainable products or to meet our clients’ expectations, impacting 
our performance, brand and reputation. A failure to meet corporate climate 
change targets may have a similar impact. The risk associated with regulators 
implementing different approaches to sustainability, and their heightened 
scrutiny on the topic, is captured within Conduct and regulatory risk above. The 
impact of climate on each of our principal risks is set out on page 51 of TCFD.

Risks are managed within our Product Frameworks, 
which include the Product Strategy Committee, Product 
Development Committee, Product Governance Committee 
and Capacity Committee.

We have a liquidity risk management framework and 
monitor the liquidity of our products on an ongoing basis. 
We have a process to raise awareness of funds identified 
as having more challenging liquidity profiles so that any 
changes to client sentiment (or potential redemptions) 
would be notified to relevant teams rapidly, to reduce 
potential liquidity risk issues.

We consider reputational risk when initiating changes to 
our strategy or operating model and focus on maintaining 
high standards of conduct. We have a number of controls 
and frameworks to address other risks that could affect 
our reputation, including: financial crime, investment risk, 
client take-on, client communications, conduct risk, 
whistleblowing and product development. Our Schroders 
appointed board members oversee the activities of joint 
ventures and associates, supported where necessary by 
oversight committees.

In 2023, we undertook an analysis of the potential causes 
of reputational risk. This led to a deeper awareness of 
reputational risk across the Group, and at the GMC, 
enabling us to be better equipped to respond to 
reputational risk issues as and when they occur.

Potential reputational risk arising from our use of AI is 
being managed through our AI framework (see page 39 
for more details). 

We have developed a range of proprietary tools to better 
understand the potential effects of sustainability risks 
including climate change on the portfolios we manage. 
We use ESG risk toolkits to support day-to-day risk 
oversight and formal review and challenge of investment 
risk at Asset Class Risk and Performance Committees. We 
have an Integration Accreditation Framework which we use 
to assess the integration of ESG factors into our investment 
desks’ processes and re-accredit them on an annual basis. 
Regarding climate specifically, we have developed a Net 
Zero Dashboard which enables our investment teams and 
central risk function to monitor the temperature alignment 
of portfolios and track our progress against our business-
wide net zero commitment.

Stakeholder engagement

Our stakeholders

An overview of our stakeholder engagement approach and 
notable achievements throughout the year.

Clients

Shareholders

Our people

Actively helping our clients achieve 
their long-term financial goals
We pride ourselves on our commitment to 
clients. Our purpose is to provide excellent 
investment performance to clients through 
active management. Our success is built on 
understanding and anticipating their 
evolving needs.

Rewarding our shareholders through  
the sustained success of our business
The engagement and support of our 
shareholders is vital to achieving our strategic 
objectives and driving business growth. Our 
shareholder base plays a crucial role in 
endorsing our long-term approach to 
business management.

How do we engage with them  
and consider their interests?
Our client service teams, adept at 
anticipating client needs, foster lasting 
relationships, gaining insights into client 
objectives and future expectations. In 2023, 
we created the Client Group, bringing 
together key client-facing functions across 
the firm globally, including sales, client 
servicing, product and marketing, to help 
us further enhance our client relationships, 
and build closer, longer-lasting relationships. 
Specialists across our businesses work with 
regional country heads and client-facing 
teams who have deep knowledge of client 
needs in each market. Our Client Insights 
Unit uses internal and external data to 
enhance our understanding of clients’ 
needs. Globally, we conduct independent 
and bespoke client surveys to gather direct 
feedback. These include surveys for strategic 
clients, key senior individual client contacts 
and a new Client Service Survey which was 
piloted this year targeting more than 500 
clients. These activities are designed with 
the purpose of enhancing the client 
experience and to inform our product, 
solutions and advice offerings.

Outcomes
Engagement with clients drives our strategy. 
Our Global Trusted Adviser Survey results 
show that over 85% of our clients are 
satisfied or very satisfied with Schroders 
compared to other asset managers1. This 
year, we established the Client Group based 
on our deep understanding of our clients 
and their needs. This has influenced the 
expansion of our product range and our 
offerings in public and private markets. 

How do we engage with them  
and consider their interests?
The Board actively engages with shareholders 
throughout the year, using various channels 
to facilitate communication. Our AGM serves 
as a key platform for engagement, offering 
both in-person and virtual participation.

For our Schroders in Focus event in 2023, 
we hosted a deep dive on our wealth 
management business. It provided investors 
with updates on our growth plans and was 
an opportunity to engage directly with the 
Wealth Management leadership team. 
Further, on a bi-annual basis we engage our 
shareholders via roadshows that follow our 
results announcements. We updated 
shareholders on progress throughout the 
year and engaged them about their views 
on the business strategy and outlook. 
We had ad-hoc meetings with shareholders, 
hosted by either the investor relations team 
or senior management.

Outcomes
By allocating capital to higher-growth areas 
we are able to generate stable returns for our 
shareholders. During 2023, we delivered basic 
operating earnings per share of 32.5 pence 
and the Board recommended a final dividend 
of 15.0 pence. This brings the total dividend 
to 21.5 pence per share. Our Climate Report 
2023 aims to give shareholders, clients and 
stakeholders a better understanding of our 
climate transition plan, including managing 
climate-related risks and opportunities.

1.  The Global Trusted Adviser Survey was completed in  

December 2022 and was issued to our top 100 clients by revenue generation.

44

Fostering a purpose-led, inclusive 
and high-performing culture 
Our people are crucial in delivering our 
purpose of providing excellent investment 
performance and driving positive change in 
the world. We attract and develop individuals 
who have the skills and passion to help us 
achieve our goals. By focusing on what 
matters and preserving our unique culture, 
we create an inclusive, purpose-led, high-
performing environment that celebrates 
diversity of thought and offers growth 
opportunities and support to our employees.

How do we engage with them  
and consider their interests?
We engage our people through various 
channels, including briefings, videos, an 
internal magazine, updates from the Group 
Chief Executive, and a global broadcast 
series called the “sofa series” with GMC 
members. At the start of each year, employees 
join strategy sessions and can ask questions to 
senior management. 

To understand our employees’ needs, we 
conduct pulse surveys and have Ian King, 
our Senior Independent Director, gather 
feedback. Ian chairs the Global Employee 
Forum, providing a platform for employee 
concerns, with regular reporting to the Board. 

Town Halls serve as a vital communication 
platform, conducted regionally by senior 
management and locally by business units, 
fostering dialogue on key information, 
business progress, and providing a 
valuable connection to employees’ needs 
and perspectives. 

Outcomes
In our pulse survey, 87% of our employees 
expressed pride in working for Schroders, 
outperforming external benchmarks and 
indicating strong employee engagement. 
Our commitment to being transparent to 
our stakeholders, including our employees, 
encompasses publishing our inaugural 
ethnicity pay gap report and consulting with 
our employee-led networks when setting 
our ambitious 2030 Inclusion and Diversity 
aspirations, including metrics on inclusion, 
transparency and diversity.

Society and environment

External suppliers

Regulators

Supporting the wider  
society and environment 
Schroders is a values-led business,  
and as a responsible steward of assets  
we actively target investments that  
make a measurable positive contribution  
to society and/or the environment  
and are expected to deliver positive  
financial returns to investors. Further  
we believe that demanding high levels  
of corporate responsibility is not only  
the right thing to do but supports our 
corporate purpose.

How do we engage with them  
and consider their interests? 
Our Sustainable Investment team actively 
supports investee companies in transitioning 
to more sustainable business practices. 
Our Engagement Blueprint outlines our 
principles for engaging with these 
companies. This includes setting targets, 
focusing on material sustainable risks and 
opportunities, monitoring progress, voting 
in line with our active ownership principles, 
and escalating issues when necessary.

We are dedicated to supporting 
communities worldwide through fundraising 
and volunteering. Our Schroders Giving 
partnerships enhance our impact on society, 
and our employees actively participate in 
selecting causes to support.

Respecting human rights and preventing 
human rights violations, including modern 
slavery, is a top priority. We raise awareness 
and educate our staff about the scale 
and complexity of these issues. Additionally, 
the Board reviews and approves the 
annual Modern Slavery Statement and 
Climate Report.

Outcomes
In 2023, we engaged with 4,443 investee 
companies. Our 2023 CDP climate change 
questionnaire responses achieved a 
leadership level score of A for the second 
consecutive year. We committed £5.4 million 
to charitable causes around the world, and 
implemented a Global Volunteer Recognition 
Scheme. We also provided modern slavery 
training, including a session for our UK 
Procurement team.

Working with trusted partners
Our global network of external service 
partners is essential to delivering our 
corporate strategy. They supplement 
our infrastructure, provide expertise 
and specialised skills, giving us a 
competitive advantage.

Building respectful relationships
As a global business, we are committed to 
collaborating and engaging with key regulatory 
stakeholders, including local and regional 
regulators, exchanges, non-governmental 
organisations, and trade associations. Through 
our participation, we share insights, support 
policy development, share best practices, and 
advocate for better functioning markets.

How do we engage with them  
and consider their interests?
Our third-party risk management framework 
governs sourcing, selection, onboarding, 
management, oversight, and reporting of 
suppliers. It outlines roles and responsibilities 
in supplier stakeholder relationships. We 
encourage strong relationships with key 
suppliers to monitor performance, manage 
risks, and foster mutual benefits. We 
prioritise critical providers, allocate resources 
effectively, and actively develop and monitor 
important partnerships.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets high 
standards for ourselves and our suppliers 
regarding human rights, ethical sourcing, 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption, diversity and 
inclusion, health and safety, and the 
environment. We look to enhance the code 
each year, which includes our whistleblowing 
hotline, as best practice evolves. In 2023, we 
reviewed the modern slavery risk in our 
supply chain with external support.

How do we engage with them  
and consider their interests?
In addition to our compliance and risk teams 
who directly liaise with regulators, we have a 
dedicated public policy presence in the UK and 
Brussels for the EU. This team works closely 
with colleagues globally, leveraging their 
knowledge and market expertise.

Our Public Policy team engages regularly with 
officials, covering topics such as sustainability, 
digitisation, retail investment, and primary 
market reform. Senior management maintains 
regular meetings with regulators, fostering 
strong relationships. The Audit and Risk 
Committee receives reports on regulatory 
engagement and the potential impact of 
regulatory changes on our business.

Through our engagements, we aim to comply 
with current requirements, shape future ones, 
and ultimately provide better service to our 
clients, while contributing to a competitive and 
resilient financial system.

Outcomes
Schroders is dedicated to ensuring fair 
treatment of suppliers, recognising them as 
essential stakeholders. We establish and 
maintain a sustainable supply chain aligned 
with our values and objectives. We work 
exclusively with aligned suppliers, who 
reciprocate our expectations within their 
supply chain, fostering a virtuous cycle of 
improvement. The Board approved our 
Modern Slavery Statement, detailing risk 
assessment and due diligence processes for 
suppliers regarding modern slavery.

Outcomes
We engaged with the Financial Conduct 
Authority to align the implementation of 
Consumer Duty with our business and clients’ 
needs. Our input on UK Sustainable Disclosure 
Requirements influenced the policy framework. 
Ongoing engagement with supervisory teams 
covered various topics including operational 
resilience, sustainability, liquidity risk, and 
cyber security. We actively participate in the 
Bank of England’s System-wide Exploratory 
Scenario (SWES) to enhance understanding 
of firm behaviour in stressed financial 
market conditions.

Description of policies and policy outcomes1

We have made a number of climate and nature-related commitments to support achieving net zero by 2050, or sooner. Our 
Group Climate Change Position Statement and Group Nature and Biodiversity Position Statement outline our position 
in relation to environmental management, and on nature and biodiversity, for the investments we manage and our operations. 

We seek to cultivate a purpose-led, high-performing culture that is inclusive, celebrates diversity and empowers all to have 
the opportunities to grow. Our Guiding principles and values, and policy on Board Diversity serve to achieve this outcome.

Our Directors’ Remuneration policy outlines our approach for setting Directors’ remuneration. 

Our Group Personal Data policy summarises the obligations imposed upon the Schroders Group and employees by data 
protection laws and covers the rights of individual employees with respect to their personal data.

Furthermore, our Group Whistleblowing policy outlines the process for staff and third parties to report any concerns 
in confidence. 

We have a number of internal policies and standards that are not published externally. These policies cover our commitment  
to providing equal opportunities in employment and to prevent all forms of discrimination as well as to encourage appropriate 
conduct and regulatory compliance. 

Community investment is a core part of our culture. We have an internal policy that provides a framework for volunteering  
at Schroders. 

Schroders is committed to upholding human rights. Our Group Human Rights Position Statement outlines our stance  
on respecting human rights. 

Our Modern Slavery Statement includes details of the policies, processes and measures we have in place to assess and 
manage modern slavery risks across our business. 

We maintain a strict policy of zero tolerance towards acts of bribery and corruption. Our utmost priority is to safeguard  
the interests of our clients, shareholders, employees, third-party vendors and the wider community from any form of  
financial crime.

To reinforce this commitment, we have implemented a comprehensive set of internal policies, covering aspects such as 
financial crime (including bribery and corruption, money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, proliferation financing, 
fraud and sanctions), inducements, gifts and entertainment, and conflicts of interest, all of which unequivocally prohibit any 
individual associated with our organisation from engaging in activities that promote, endorse or facilitate financial crime.

Group tax strategy: We aim to comply with both the spirit and letter of the law and are committed to conducting our tax 
affairs in an open and transparent way. Our tax strategy, available at www.schroders.com/tax-strategy, sets out our approach  
to tax matters across the Group more generally. This strategy is reviewed and approved annually by the Audit and Risk 
Committee. We disclose our total tax contribution, which shows the total amount of tax we pay and collect each year at

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Viability and going concern statement

In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have carried out a robust assessment of the key 
risks facing the Group and expect that Schroders plc will 
continue to be viable for at least the next five years.

Assessment of prospects
The five-year period to December 2028 is consistent with the 
Group’s strategic business planning and forecasting period. The 
Group’s strategic and financial planning process includes a detailed 
review of the business model and key assumptions. It is led by the 
Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer in conjunction with 
management teams. The outlook was most recently updated in 
February 2024. The business planning process considers the risks 
that may materially impact the Group, and assesses the need for 
business model changes. The business plan reflects the Group’s 
strategy and diversified business model, which is summarised on 
pages 14 to 17 and 20 to 21 respectively.

Key assumptions underpinning the financial planning process 
include AUM growth from both markets and net new business; 
changes to net operating revenue margins owing to changes in 
business mix, planned business activity and industry-wide margin 
pressures; and additional costs including those arising from 
continued investment in the development of the business.

Progress against financial budgets and key objectives are 
reviewed throughout the year by both the Board and the GMC, 
along with periodic reviews of the capital and dividend policies.

Assessment of viability
The assessment of the Group’s viability requires the Directors to 
consider the principal risks that could affect the Group, which are 
outlined on pages 40 to 43. The Directors review the key risks 
regularly and consider the options available to the Group to mitigate 
these risks so as to ensure the ongoing viability of the Group. 

Stress testing is performed on the Group’s business plan and 
considers the impact of a number of the Group’s key risks 
crystallising over the assessment period. This includes consideration 
of new and emerging risks, identified through the business planning 
process, that could have a material impact over the five-year 
planning period.

The severe but plausible stress scenarios applied to the business 
plan include consideration of the following factors:

•  A deterioration in the value of our AUM, for example as a result 
of a severe period of market stress, the return of significant 
inflationary pressures combined with a marked slowdown in 
global growth, or the early crystallisation of certain climate 
change risks.

Having reviewed the results of the stress tests, including a scenario 
that combines a number of the factors set out above, the Directors 
have concluded that the Group would have sufficient capital and 
liquid resources and that the Group’s ongoing viability would be 
sustained. In drawing this conclusion, the Directors assessed the 
management actions that are available to the Group and were 
comfortable that they are sufficient in order to maintain adequate 
capital and liquidity surpluses. The Directors also have regard to 
business model changes that may be required given the new 
environment in which the Group would be operating. 

It is possible that a stress event could be more severe and have 
a greater impact than we have determined plausible. In this 
context, we conduct reverse stress tests, which demonstrate the 
unlikely and very extreme conditions required to make our business 
model non-viable.

The Directors’ current, reasonable expectation is that Schroders plc  
will be able to continue in operation, meeting its liabilities as they  
fall due, over a viability horizon of at least five years. The Board’s 
five-year viability and longer-term assessment is based on 
information known today.

Going concern

The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position, are set out in this Strategic report. In addition, the 
financial statements include information on the Group’s 
approach to managing its capital and financial risk; details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its 
exposures to credit and liquidity risk.

The Group has considerable financial resources, a broad 
range of products and a geographically diversified 
business. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business risks in the 
context of the current economic outlook.

Accordingly, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 12 months from 
the date the Annual Report and Accounts is approved. 
They therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.

•  A significant decline in net operating revenue margins 

reducing projected revenues.

Pages 1 to 47 constitute the Strategic report, which was approved 
by the Board on 28 February 2024 and signed on its behalf by:

•  The impact of a material operational risk event or poor 

performance which could lead to reputational damage and 
significant outflows of our AUM.

•  An increase in the ratio of total operating expenses to net 

operating income.

The Group also assesses the impact of regulatory stress 
scenarios published by the Prudential Regulation Authority. 
The stress scenarios are consistent with those used in the Group’s 
consolidated Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process and 
Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process.

Developing 
strategy for  
the long term

Dame Elizabeth Corley
Chair

I am pleased to present our governance report for 2023, 
my first full year as Chair. The following pages discuss our 
governance arrangements, the operation of the Board and its 
Committees and how we discharged our responsibilities during 
the year.

In my last report I said the Board was focusing on strategy, talent 
and culture. This continued during 2023. As I mentioned in my 
statement earlier, the Company has been implementing a successful 
diversification strategy for our business for several years. This 
positioned us in areas of higher growth, with improved longevity of 
client relationships, whilst continuing to focus on delivering good 
investment performance. This strategy has helped the Group to 
withstand forces of long term change in our sector, which have grown 
steadily more powerful.

Nevertheless, as the Board has a long term orientation, we continued 
to place strategy – both execution and evolution – at the heart of our 
discussions in 2023, reflecting on trends in the asset management 
industry. The Board has dedicated additional time to analysing industry 
developments, in order to remain well informed in a period of 
increased pace of change, alongside our oversight of business 
performance, our people strategy, and maintaining a healthy culture. 
Building on prior strategic diversification, both organic and inorganic, 
we have dedicated time, with management, to a rigorous assessment 
of our performance and delivery, with the aim of making the Company 
the best that it can be. 

In most years the Board will undertake a formal strategic review each 
November at our strategy offsite. This is in addition to regular business 
area-specific reviews through the year. Given the deterioration in the 
external environment in 2023, heightened by increased geopolitical 
tensions and the economic consequences of inflation and higher 
interest rates, we increased our focus on strategy in the second half of 
the year. We also supplemented formal Board meetings with periodic 

Board calls so that the whole Board could be kept up to date on our 
agreed actions. This approach has worked well according to feedback 
from our end-of-year Board performance evaluation, and has enabled 
management to keep the Board informed in a more dynamic and 
volatile environment. Additional time with the Board has demanded 
more from the management team and I am grateful to them for 
consistently delivering what the Board has required, while at the same 
time maintaining an intense focus on running the business in more 
demanding circumstances. Strategy will rightly remain one of our major 
priorities for 2024.

Ensuring we attract, develop and retain high quality talent is central 
to our ability to deliver for our clients and shareholders. In 2023, in 
addition to reviewing our people and diversity and inclusion strategy, 
the Board focused attention on the continuous development of our 
current and next generation senior leaders. Members of the Group 
Strategy Committee (GSC) now regularly attend sections of our Board 
meetings. We have all benefitted from this, with richer discussions as a 
result of their attendance. For example, the Board obtained valuable 
insights from the GSC members on all aspects of our strategy. With the 
establishment of the Client Group in 2023, having the heads of our 
client-facing functions at our meetings has enabled the Board to 
deepen our understanding of client needs and market developments. 

In 2022, the Board re-started visits to overseas offices following the 
Covid pandemic. Unfortunately, we had to defer the planned visit to 
our Paris office due to industrial action just as we were about to depart. 
We are looking forward to being there in May 2024. We see these visits 
as important opportunities to understand better how well the culture 
we see clearly in London has travelled in our global business. 

We have had further change on the Board this year at both executive 
and non-executive level. The details of, and background to, these 
changes are set out in the Nominations Committee report. My 
intention now is for relationships within the Board to have the 
opportunity to develop and settle into a new equilibrium. I am 
confident we have a Board that can continue to evolve our strategy 
to deliver for the long-term benefit of clients, shareholders and all 
our stakeholders.

It is clear to the Board that the industry is facing unusually high levels of 
change. No matter how resilient our strategy, or good our company, 
we know we must remain alert to opportunities and the unexpected. 
Continuing to be relevant and close to clients during volatile times is 
vital, so the performance of our Client Group will be on our agenda 
alongside reviews of growth business areas: Wealth Management, 
Solutions and Private Markets. In addition, our commitment to active 
management and sustainability means that the Board is always keen to 
understand how we are delivering investment performance and service 
to our clients. These will be priorities in 2024, as will the continued 
development of our talent, which we see as the bedrock on which the 
business is built.

I would like to finish with a comment on governance in the UK. There 
has been much comment on whether the UK has become too rigid in 
applying the letter of the governance code, with suggestions that our 
regulatory approach has stifled entrepreneurship and discouraged 
companies from listing in London. We have seen steps of late to allow 
companies more freedom in which to operate. Schroders broadly 
welcomes these initiatives, both as a listed company and as a major 
investor in UK companies. Comply or explain has been a foundation 
of UK corporate governance and, taken seriously, with transparency, 
should provide a framework for strong governance. For this to work, 
companies must have the right culture. I have no doubt that we have 
the right culture and our robust governance framework will enable us 
to continue to focus on doing what is right for all our stakeholders over 
the long term.

These meetings are for informal discussions and do not have 
fixed agendas. At least once a year the Chair also meets with just 
the independent non-executive Directors.

to supplement the formal Board meeting programme; these are 
held between the scheduled meetings. At each call, the Group 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer provide updates on key 
business issues.

The Board and its Committees
The Board has collective responsibility for the management, 
direction and performance of the Company. It is accountable to 
shareholders for the creation and delivery of strong, sustainable 
financial performance and long-term shareholder value. In 
discharging its responsibilities, the Board takes appropriate account 
of the interests of our wider stakeholders, including clients, 
employees, external service providers, regulators and wider society. 
Certain decisions can only be taken by the Board, including on the 
Group’s overall strategy, significant new business activities, and the 
strategy for management of the Group’s investment capital. These 
are contained in the Schedule of Matters Reserved to the Board, 
which can be found on the Company’s website1 and are summarised 
on page 56.

The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to Board 
Committees, notably the Nominations Committee, the Audit and 
Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The papers for 
and minutes of Committee meetings are made available to all 
Directors. At each Board meeting, the Chair of each Committee 
provides the Board with an update of the work currently being 
carried out by the Committee they chair. Membership of the 
Committees is detailed in each Committee’s report. The Committees’ 
terms of reference can be found on the Company’s website2.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Independence
The Board remains committed to its stated policy regarding the 
benefits of an absolute majority of independent Directors. All the 
non-executive Directors are independent in terms of character 
and judgement.

Claire Fitzalan Howard and Leonie Schroder are not considered 
independent as they are both members of the Principal Shareholder 
Group. The Nominations Committee believes the judgement 
and experience of Claire Fitzalan Howard and Leonie Schroder 
continues to add value to the Board and the Group. The Board will 
therefore recommend their re-election at the 2024 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM).

Director appointments and time commitment
The rules providing for the appointment, election, re-election 
and removal of Directors are contained in the Company’s Articles 
of Association. The Company may only amend its Articles of 
Association by special resolution of the shareholders.

In accordance with the Articles of Association, Iain Mackay, Richard 
Oldfield, Annette Thomas and Frederic Wakeman will resign and 
offer themselves for election at the AGM on 25 April 2024. All other 
Directors are required to seek re-election on an annual basis unless 
they are retiring from the Board. Rhian Davies will not be seeking 
re-election as a Director and will stand down at the conclusion of 
the 2024 AGM. Details of the Directors’ length of tenure are set out 
on page 53.

Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment stipulate that they 
are expected to commit sufficient time to discharge their duties. 
The Board has adopted a policy that allows executive Directors 
to take up one external non-executive directorship. Non-executive 
Directors are required to consult the Chair before taking on any 
additional appointments. The Board is satisfied that all Directors 
continue to be effective and demonstrate commitment to their 
respective roles.

For details of executive Directors’ service contracts, termination 
arrangements and non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment, 
please refer to the Remuneration report from page 74.

Board training
The Board believes that the ongoing development and briefing 
of Directors is an important part of the Board’s agenda. The Board 
receives regular briefings throughout the year to provide them 
with a deeper understanding of the Group. The Chair and Group 
Company Secretary discuss briefing topics annually and agree what 
these should cover.

During 2023, a briefing was provided by our Chief Economist on 
the challenging macroeconomic environment and how it affects 
Schroders. Our Global Head of Sustainable Investment and Global 
Head of Corporate Sustainability provided a briefing session which 
covered how sustainability trends are shaping our industry, as well 
as our progress on key issues including climate change, biodiversity, 
human rights and community investment. The Board also received 
briefings on our private markets strategy, on our strategy in Asia 
and on the benefits, risks and use of artificial intelligence (AI) 
at Schroders. 

Members of the Board Committees also receive regular updates on 
technical developments at scheduled committee meetings. Other 
training includes external professional events and industry updates.

Board induction
The Group Company Secretary supports the Chair and Group 
Chief Executive in providing a personalised induction programme 
for all new Directors. This helps to familiarise newly appointed 
Directors with their duties and the Group’s culture and values, 
strategy, business model, businesses, operations, risks and 
governance arrangements.

The induction process is reviewed regularly and is updated and 
tailored to ensure that it remains appropriate. Induction and 
briefing meetings are generally open to any Director to attend if 
they wish to.

Committee-specific inductions are also arranged when committee 
membership changes, and these induction processes are tailored 
to the skills and knowledge of the individual and the forthcoming 
committee agenda items. 

Following the appointments of Annette Thomas in September 2023, 
Richard Oldfield in October 2023 and Iain Mackay and Frederic 
Wakeman in January 2024, comprehensive and tailored induction 
programmes were provided and are ongoing. The induction 
processes involve:

•  meeting all members of the GMC and their teams to gain an 
insight into, and an understanding of, the opportunities and 
challenges facing their area of responsibility; and

•  one-to-one meetings with other senior management across 
the Group, including first, second and third lines of defence, 
to understand the Group’s internal control and risk 
management framework.

Chief Financial Officer induction

During 2023, I had the privilege of being appointed to the 
Schroders Board. A comprehensive and tailored induction 
programme was provided to me, which began even before my 
formal appointment, reflecting the organisation’s commitment 
to ensuring a smooth transition for new Board members. 

The induction process was immersive and included 
meeting all members of the GSC, the GMC and members of 
their teams. This provided me with valuable insight into the 
opportunities and challenges within their respective areas of 
responsibility. Additionally, one-to-one meetings with other 
senior management across the Group, including those in the 
first, second, and third lines of defence, including Risk and 
Compliance, Legal, Governance and Internal Audit, helped me 
understand Schroders’ internal control and risk management 
framework. I also had the opportunity to meet with external 
advisers, auditors and regulators, as appropriate. 

I am grateful to my colleagues on the Board for their 
unwavering support. I have had the pleasure of meeting 
people from various areas of the business, both before and 
after my appointment, and have been impressed by the 
depth of Schroders’ culture that runs throughout the 
organisation. These interactions have accelerated my 
understanding of the business and its operations. 

Overall, the induction has been a comprehensive and 
enriching experience, equipping me for my role at Schroders.

Key areas of focus during the year

At each scheduled Board meeting, the Board discusses reports from: the Group Chief Executive on the performance of the business;  
the Chief Financial Officer on financial performance; the Group Company Secretary on governance developments; and, where relevant,  
a report from each of the Board Committees.

Set out below are the key topics considered by the Board during 2023, taking into account the views of key stakeholders while continuing 
to promote the Group’s long-term success. Throughout the year, the Board has considered workforce welfare, external markets, our clients, 
the Group’s capital position, business operations, and the need to keep the market updated on key developments.

Strategy
•  The Board continued to focus on the development and delivery 
of our overall strategy. Throughout the year, the Board reviewed 
the Group’s strategy, progress against our strategic initiatives, 
and received an update on the Group’s five-year forecast. 

•  An ad hoc meeting was held in October to supplement the 

discussions on strategy. The Board’s November 2023 meeting 
was held over two days and was primarily devoted to discussing 
the strategy for 2024 and beyond.

•  At each scheduled meeting, the Board received a strategic update 
from the business. During 2023, these included Fixed Income, 
Multi-Asset, Product, Equities, Technology, the Client Group, 
Asia Pacific and the Group’s operating platform.

Financial performance and risk management
•  The Board reviews the Group’s financial performance at each 

scheduled Board meeting. In February, the Board reviewed the 
2022 Annual Report and Accounts and final dividend proposal. 
In July, the Board reviewed the 2023 half-year results and 
approved an interim dividend of 6.5 pence per share.

•  The five-year forecast was discussed by the Board in September 

and November to support the Board’s strategy review. 

•  During the year, the Board approved the Group’s operational 

resilience self-assessment, ICAAP, ILAAP, recovery plan, resolution 
process and wind-down plan following their review by the Audit 
and Risk Committee.

•  The Board also approved the Group’s Climate Report 2022 to 

provide our shareholders, clients and other stakeholders with a 
better understanding of our exposure to climate-related risks.

People and culture
•  The Board considers our people to be central to delivering the 
Group’s strategic priorities and considers our culture to be one 
of our assets. In July, the Board received an update on our people 
strategy, including our approach to succession and how we are 
strengthening our long-term talent development processes.

•  Attracting diverse talent and having an inclusive environment 
brings diversity of thought which allows for richer discussions, 
better decision-making, more innovation and better risk 
management for our clients. In June, the Board received an 
update on our inclusion and diversity strategy, including progress 
made to date, focus areas for 2023 and our long-term aspirations. 
The Board approved our 2030 inclusion and diversity goals.

•  Ian King, our designated non-executive Director responsible for 
gathering workforce feedback and chair of the Global Employee 
Forum (GEF), provided updates to the Board from GEF meetings. 
The Board welcomes the additional feedback from employees 
through the GEF, and will continue to engage with the forum 
during 2024.

Shareholder engagement
•  The Board engaged with shareholders throughout the year. 
The primary means of communicating with shareholders 
is through the AGM, the Annual Report and Accounts, 
full year and half year results and related presentations.

•  The Investor Relations programme has continued our 

engagement with our major shareholders.

•  We organised a Schroders in Focus event specifically tailored 
for our wealth management business. The event provided 
investors with updates on our growth plans in the sector and 
insights into our Cazenove Capital, Benchmark Capital and 
Schroders Wealth Management brands, as well as Schroders 
Personal Wealth, our joint venture with Lloyds Banking Group. 
It also offered an opportunity for investors to engage directly 
with and pose questions to our executive Directors and the 
Wealth Management leadership team. A recording of the event 
is available on our website1.

Stakeholder interests and engagement 

In discharging their section 172 duties, the Directors have regard to the factors set out on page 45 and any other factors considered relevant 
to the decision being made, such as the interests of employees and the views of regulators. The Directors acknowledge that every decision 
made will not necessarily result in a positive outcome for all stakeholders. By considering the Company’s purpose, vision and values together 
with its strategic priorities, and having a process for decision-making, the Board does, however, aim to make sure that its approach to decision-
making and consideration of stakeholder interests is consistent.

The examples provided below show how the Board considered the matters set out in section 172 in respect of some of the key decisions made 
during 2023.

Our people 
Our people are central to the ongoing success of the 
business, and the interests of employees have formed an 
important part of many Board discussions and engagements 
throughout the year.

Inclusion and Diversity
Attracting diverse talent and having an inclusive 
environment where all can thrive brings diversity of thought 
which allows for richer discussions, better decision-making, 
more innovation and enhanced risk management for our 
clients. In June, the Board reviewed our Inclusion and 
Diversity strategy and approved our 2030 goals, including 
representation targets for gender, ethnicity, socio-economic 
background, disability and LGBTQ+, as well as inclusion and 
data disclosure targets. The Chair and Group Chief Executive 
launched these goals internally via a global webcast, giving 
employees worldwide the opportunity to ask their questions 
and provide valuable feedback. During the year, we also 
gained industry recognition for our work in this area: we 
won an award for ‘Best overall Board and Exco’ at the 
INSEAD Alumni Balance in Business Awards 2023, celebrating 
our work to close the gender diversity gap at senior levels 
of the business, including achieving a 50/50 gender split 
on our Board. We also won Gold for ‘Best Diversity and 
Inclusion Reporting’ at Communicate magazine’s Corporate 
& Financial Awards.

Talent and succession
In line with the Board’s objectives, in July the Board discussed 
how we are strengthening our long-term talent development 
processes and our approach to succession. This included 
identifying succession plans for critical roles that are key to 
the delivery of our strategy, as well as reviewing and providing 
feedback on our talent development offering.

Employee engagement
The Board engaged with employees throughout the year 
through regular pulse surveys. In addition, Ian King, our 
Senior Independent Director, chairs the GEF to hear directly 
from employees on issues that concern them. Ian met with 
the GEF twice in 2023 and provided feedback to the Board on 
the key issues raised at forum meetings. The Group Chief 
Executive also met with the GEF, where an update on the 
Group’s strategy was provided. 

A key theme arising out of the GEF discussions was 
the importance the Company places on allowing our 
employee resource groups to have a voice and feel heard 
as part of building an inclusive culture. In June, the Board 
held a breakfast with key representatives of these employee-
led networks, allowing them the opportunity to raise 
awareness of the challenges that are faced by under-
represented groups.

The Board welcomes opportunities to engage with our 
people and will continue to do so in 2024 and beyond.

Client Group 
In line with our strategic objective of building closer 
relationships with clients, the Board discussed and agreed 
a shift in our business approach to a ‘client care’ model via 
our newly restructured Client Group. The aim is to enhance 
our client-centric focus, working collaboratively across 
departments to deliver a seamless experience for our clients, 
whilst deepening our relationships. To facilitate this transition, 
our plan is to invest in our platforms, technology and global 
operating model; grow our investment capabilities so that we 
have the services our clients want and need and focus on 
wider engagement with clients across the whole organisation.

In July, we announced a series of internal promotions aimed 
at enhancing our client-first culture and commitment to our 
people. This included the appointment of two Co-Heads of 
Client Group, responsible for leading the Client Group and 
collaborating across the business so that we can bring the 
whole firm to our clients. In addition, a number of internal 
promotions were made to the senior leadership of the Client 
Group, increasing our specialist expertise in key focus areas 
for our clients.

The Board received regular updates on the transition 
throughout the year and considered the interests of all 
stakeholders when agreeing the new model. This included 
considering the benefits to our clients of a more client-
focused approach, as well as the new opportunities it would 
present for our people, allowing them to continue to develop.

2023 Board objectives

The 2022 evaluation of the Board, its principal Committees and individual Directors was undertaken externally by Independent Board 
Evaluation (IBE). IBE has undertaken previous evaluations but has no other connection with the Company. In light of the findings of that 
evaluation and the conclusions of the Chair’s Committee, the Board set the following high-level objectives for 2023.

Objective

Progress made during 2023

Strategy
•  Develop strategic scenarios and options 

for five years plus

•  Review strategy implementation and 

value creation

Talent
•  Continue to encourage diversity, equality 

and inclusion across the business

•  Complete succession reviews

•  Increase Board exposure to talent

Board effectiveness
•  Explore new ways of Board and  

Committee working; embracing a  
hybrid working environment

•  In a continuing period of rapid change, 

ensure that the Board maintains 
knowledge and currency

•  Appoint new non-executive Directors 

with focus on priority skills areas

Strategy was a key focus for the Board during 2023. Given the deterioration in the external 
environment, we increased our focus on strategy in the second half of the year. In September, 
the Board reviewed the Group’s strategy and progress against our strategic initiatives and 
received an update on the Group’s five-year forecast. The Board’s November meeting was 
a two-day meeting dedicated to discussing the Group’s strategy for 2024 and beyond, 
allowing for a deep dive into different strategic options for the longer term. Recognising the 
importance of developing these strategic scenarios, an additional ad hoc Board meeting was 
held to supplement the strategic review. Value creation and the implementation of strategy 
formed an important part of the Board’s discussions throughout the year.

The Board placed considerable focus on the areas of inclusion and diversity, talent, and 
succession during the year. The June meeting included an in-depth review of our Inclusion 
and Diversity strategy and the Board approved new goals for 2030. These goals were 
launched via a company-wide webcast hosted by the Chair and Group Chief Executive, 
and progress against these targets will be reviewed annually by the Board.

In July, the Board focused on people, talent, and succession planning, recognising the 
significance of developing and retaining talent within the business. This included the 
consideration of a new concept of Group critical roles to increase Board focus on those 
positions that are key to the delivery of our strategy. Succession plans for each of these 
Group critical roles were reviewed by the Board.

To increase Board exposure to talent, members of the GSC attended Board meetings held 
during 2023. In addition, the Board had lunches with the GMC, providing an opportunity for 
open dialogue and greater collaboration with members of the senior management team. 

The Board recognises the importance of regularly reviewing its ways of working and 
has focused on embracing a hybrid working environment throughout the year. Various 
methods have been utilised to facilitate board discussions, including in-person meetings, 
board calls, briefings, the use of pre-recorded videos and remote attendance. This diverse 
approach has allowed for effective communication and collaboration at board and committee 
meetings, irrespective of geographical location, which is of great benefit to us given our 
international footprint. 

To enhance the knowledge and expertise of our Board, we carried out a thorough briefing 
programme during 2023. This programme included briefings on a range of topics, such as 
generative AI, sustainability, the macroeconomic environment, our private markets strategy 
and our strategy in Asia. These briefings have provided our Board with valuable insights into 
emerging technologies, industry trends, and strategic considerations, enabling them to make 
informed decisions.

A key priority for 2023 was to appoint new non-executive Directors with a focus on priority 
skills areas. We have announced three new non-executive Director appointments during 
the year, each with experience in different areas, including: sustainability, private equity and 
private markets; digital, data and analytics; and finance, audit and international markets. 
Each new appointment is expected to bring diversity of skills, experience and background to 
the Board. Comprehensive and tailored induction programmes were provided to each new 
Director, further details of which can be found on page 57.

Governance
•  Maintain current high standards of 

governance and oversight

•  Maintain/enhance our brand and 
reputation with all stakeholders

•  Explore options for Board oversight 

of reputation

Throughout the year, the Group has maintained good standards of governance and oversight 
and has continued to focus on enhancing our brand and reputation with all stakeholders. 

The Board has actively explored options for Board oversight of reputation, recognising 
the importance of proactive reputation management. As a result of this review, we have 
designated an individual within the business to head up reputational risk, dedicating a portion 
of their role to this critical area. This appointment will allow for reputation to be given the 
necessary attention and oversight, helping us to identify, assess, and mitigate reputational 
risks effectively.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 20232023 Board evaluation

The 2023 Board evaluation was undertaken internally by the Chair. As part of this process, the Chair interviewed each  
Director, together with the Group Company Secretary, and the discussions focused on:

•  the extent to which the Board has delivered on its priorities in 2023;

•  how the Board and the management team performed over the year;

•  whether the Committees have discharged their responsibilities effectively, and the quality of the reporting to the Board; 

•  the process for selecting the new Chief Financial Officer and new non-executive Directors; 

•  the induction process for the new Chief Financial Officer and new non-executive Directors; and

•  the business areas that the Board should focus on in 2024.

The overall conclusion was that the Board had broadly delivered on its 2023 objectives, although the objectives had shifted more 
towards strategy through the course of the year in light of the deteriorating external environment. Wealth was one area the Board 
felt we could have spent more time on, although this was discussed at our meeting in January 2024. 

The focus on strategy was felt to be comprehensive and thorough. This focus was tilted towards the second half of the year and we 
may look to spread that out in future. Directors were keen to continue with our more informal channels of communications, such as 
Board dinners and Board calls between meetings. These are seen as helpful in building the relationship between the executive and 
non-executive teams. The attendance at the Board meetings of members of the Group Strategy Committee is seen as a very positive 
step and the Board has seen their contribution increase over the year.

The feedback on our key Committees was positive. The Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee have both 
performed their duties with rigour and reporting from those Committees to the Board is effective. The Nominations Committee has 
performed well in a busy year with the appointment of three new non-executives and a new Chief Financial Officer. We may look to 
increase the Nomination Committee’s remit to include more on talent development and succession below Board level.

2024 Board objectives

Using the findings of the internal evaluation process as context, the Board agreed a number of objectives under three major 
themes, strategy, people and Board effectiveness, while continuing to focus on operational priorities.

Strategy
•  Strategic alliances and partnerships.

People
•  Senior leadership development  

•  Client relationships and competitive 

and succession plans.

Board effectiveness
•  Integrate new Directors and

In my report last year, I set out the priorities for the 
Committee in 2024, which were to focus on executive 
succession and to continue to evolve the Board to ensure 
it has the right skills to support the delivery of our strategy. 
I also commented that succession planning was something 
we intended to think about constantly to ensure we were 
well placed for both foreseen and unforeseen changes to 
the Board and its Committees. 

This point was well illustrated in 2023 when Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson 
had to step down from the Board to focus on his new executive role. 
We were sorry to see Paul go, but fully understood his reasons and 
he left with our best wishes. 

We had anticipated that Paul would succeed Rhian Davies as 
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee as she was nearing the end 
of her term on the Board. We were able to overcome this as we had 
been having ongoing discussions with Iain Mackay, someone we 
had identified as having key skills we were looking for, in particular 
knowledge of complex global organisations operating in many 
of the international markets in which we operate. His experience 
as Chief Financial Officer of two major FTSE 100 companies, also 
addressed one of our identified skills needs. In April we announced 
that Iain would join the Board in January 2024, once he had 
retired from GSK. Iain has joined the Audit and Risk Committee 
and will become Chair of the Committee when Rhian steps down 
at the AGM.

We made two other non-executive appointments in the year. Both of 
these were as a result of our analysis of the skills we need to ensure 
the Board can support the delivery of our strategy. As we went into 
2023, we had already identified one gap: that we needed to have 
more private markets experience on the Board. We continued to 
use the services of Russell Reynolds for our non-executive searches. 
We have benefitted from this continuity as they fully understand our 
needs on an holistic basis. Other than for advice on Board positions, 
they do not have any other relationship with the Company. 

The search for someone with the right private markets experience 
who would fit our culture and add wider value to the Board was a 
challenging brief. We considered many highly credible candidates. 
As is usual with us, all Directors meet with all short-listed candidates 
to ensure we have full support from the Board for any appointment. 
Frederic Wakeman emerged as our preferred candidate. His 
experience in private equity spans over 20 years in both the US 
and UK and will be invaluable as we continue to grow our private 
markets business. 

Given the specific nature of this search, we also involved the head of 
our private markets business in the process. We were delighted to 
announce Fred’s appointment to the Board from 1 January this year.

Our other non-executive search followed the same process. Our 
focus was on another key skill, digital disruption. Annette Thomas 
was identified early in the process as an outstanding candidate. Her 
data driven mindset and her experience will contribute significantly 
in a number of areas including sustainability, data, diversity, family 
or foundation owned companies and disrupted industries. She also 
had recent experience of being a Chief Executive. Given all the 
attributes Annette would bring, the Committee was clear we had 
found an ideal candidate and unanimously recommended the 
appointment of Annette to the Board. Annette joined us in 
September 2023.

Extensive references on all three non-executives were excellent.

The Committee’s focus has not just been on non-executive 
succession. Richard Keers let us know in 2022 that he would like 
us to plan for his retirement once a successor had been identified. 
To ensure a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation of potential 
candidates, both internal and external, we collaborated with 
Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm. In addition to this 
assignment, Spencer Stuart provide executive search and 
assessment services to us, including coaching services. 

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023 
Policy on Board Diversity

The Board recognises the importance of diversity and 
that it is a wider issue than gender and ethnicity.

We look for diversity of skills, thought, experience and 
background, which is important for the effectiveness of 
our Board, its Committees and the management team. 
This will continue to be the primary criterion by which 
we select candidates. Diversity across our whole 
workforce is discussed by the full Board. The specific 
diversity targets for the Group are set by the Board, on 
recommendation from management, as part of our 
annual review of people strategy.

The Board understands the importance of increasing 
gender and ethnic diversity and is committed to have 
a minimum of 40% of Board positions held by women and 
to meet the Parker Review’s recommendations of at least 
one director from an ethnic minority on the Board. 
Currently we meet both these gender and ethnicity 
recommendations as, following the AGM, women will 
comprise 50% of the Board and we have two ethnic 
minority Directors. We intend only to use the services 
of executive search firms which have signed up to the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct on Gender Diversity.

There is a full description of our approach to diversity and 
inclusion on pages 18 to 19 and 96. Our gender diversity 
statistics for both the Board and senior management can 
be found on page 96. 

Priorities for 2024
We have seen considerable change on the Board in the recent past. 
Four of the Board have been appointed in the last year and only 
three Directors have served more than five years. Our focus will be 
on integrating the new members of the Board and establishing an 
effective dynamic across the whole Group. 

We will also continue to focus on executive succession, building on 
the work undertaken in 2022 and 2023. The key members of the 
executive team now attend Board meetings so that the Board can 
benefit from their input but also to help develop the team by involving 
them in the Board’s discussions. 

Dame Elizabeth Corley
Chair of the Nominations Committee 

28 February 2024

Responsibilities of the 
Nominations Committee

The Committee is responsible for keeping under review the 
composition of the Board and its Committees and for ensuring 
appropriate executive and non-executive Director succession 
plans are in place.

The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website at www.schroders.com/board-committees.

Biographical details and experience of the Committee 
members are set out on pages 50 to 53. 

The detailed candidate specification was centred on our overall 
strategic objectives and the integral role the Chief Financial Officer 
would play in achieving these. This was pivotal in defining the 
required competencies and experiences for the prospective Chief 
Financial Officer.

Spencer Stuart employed their proprietary executive intelligence 
evaluation tool to assess the competencies of both internal and 
external candidates, in order to assess all candidates on an equal 
footing and to ensure that the selection process was objective 
and fair. 

Following a rigorous assessment and selection process in which 
we interviewed five short listed candidates, we were delighted to 
announce the appointment of Richard Oldfield as our new Chief 
Financial Officer. Richard’s extensive experience, including his tenure 
as a partner at PwC, combined with his alignment with Schroders’ 
strategic direction and values, made him the standout candidate for 
this critical role. Richard joined us on 2 October 2023.

Directors standing for election and re-election
Rhian Davies will stand down at the conclusion of the AGM in April 
and is therefore not offering herself for re-election. At our February 
2024 meeting the Committee reviewed all Directors standing for 
election or re-election and concluded that each makes a valuable 
contribution to the Board’s deliberations and recommends their 
election and re-election. This recommendation includes Ian King 
and Rakhi Goss-Custard, both of whom have served on the Board 
for more than six years. In making this recommendation, the 
Committee took into account feedback from the evaluation 
interviews undertaken by me and our Company Secretary. 

As required by the UK Listing Rules, the appointment of independent 
Directors must be approved by a simple majority of all shareholders 
and by a simple majority of the independent shareholders. Further 
details are set out in the 2024 Notice of AGM.

Evaluating the performance of the Committee
The internal evaluation process for 2023 is set out in detail on page 
63. The overall conclusions for the Committee were that we had 
delivered well on our core succession challenges. The process we 
follow is thorough and can be quite lengthy given our policy of having 
all Directors meet shortlisted candidates. Committee members are 
aware that this process can lead to delays in reaching conclusions, 
but felt that we benefit from having everyone involved and not 
delegating to a smaller group to make these important decisions. 
We will therefore continue with this approach for future appointments.

I am pleased to present the Committee’s report for the 
year ended 31 December 2023. The Committee plays a key 
role in overseeing the integrity of the Company’s financial 
statements and the robustness of the Group’s system of 
internal control and financial and risk management.

We are grateful for the support of management and the assurance 
and challenge provided by Group Internal Audit and Ernst & Young 
(EY) as external auditor. During the year, the Committee considered 
the proposed legislative and regulatory changes following the 
UK Government’s review of corporate reporting and corporate 
governance and remains actively engaged with assessing the 
implications. The Committee also continued to focus on its 
responsibility for monitoring and oversight of the Group’s control 
environment and system of internal control and the Group’s 
management of risk and compliance-related activities. 

Operational resilience remains a key focus for the Committee, and 
in line with the Financial Conduct Authority’s and the Prudential 
Regulation Authority’s operational resilience regulations, the 
Group’s operational resilience self-assessment was considered by 
the Committee and recommended to the Board for approval. The 
self-assessment identifies our important business services, provides 
information on oversight of critical third parties, sets out impact 
tolerances to avoid intolerable harm to our clients, and identifies 
areas where we should enhance our operational resilience. The 
Committee also considered various operational stress scenarios 
to support the Board’s conclusions on the viability statement and 
going concern set out on page 47. 

The Committee continues to play an important role in reviewing 
conduct and culture risk in the Group and in overseeing the 
evolution of Schroders’ conduct risk framework, which is designed to 
identify emerging trends and heightened areas of risk. Conduct and 
culture risk is informed by a number of elements, including conduct 
risk appetite statements, employee opinion surveys and oversight 
by the second and third line of defence functions. We believe that 
Schroders’ conduct risk framework aligns with regulatory standards.

A large part of our agenda during the year was devoted to 
considering regulatory change. We received a briefing in May and 
a report in November that covered topics such as sustainability 
regulations, Consumer Duty, prudential regulatory change and 
corporate reporting. We also received briefings on business and 
thematic topics during the year, including on the private markets 
business and global standards for client-facing materials.

In the face of escalating cyber attack threats, the Committee 
continues to prioritise cyber security and data privacy whilst 
considering metrics, challenging progress and evaluating the 
necessary technology and operational models to assess the 
Group’s readiness for evolving threats. Additionally, the Committee 
considered the impact of AI, understanding how it can strengthen 
the Group’s defences whilst also recognising its potential risks 
when exploited by adversaries. 

Climate-related risks remain an important topic for the Committee 
and are considered in our quarterly reports. In addition, the 
Board received a briefing which covered how sustainability 
trends are shaping our industry, as well as our progress on key 
issues, including climate change, biodiversity, human rights and 
community investment.

I would like to welcome Richard Oldfield as our new Chief 
Financial Officer, alongside Iain Mackay and Frederic Wakeman, 
who joined the Committee on 1 January 2024. I would like to thank 
Richard Keers for his contribution over ten years and also thank 
Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson for his time on the Committee.

I am grateful to all members of the Committee for their support 
in 2023.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023 
Role of the Audit and Risk Committee

The principal role of the Committee is to assist the Board in 
fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to financial 
reporting, financial controls and audit, risk and internal controls. 
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive 
Directors. Biographical details and the experience of Committee 
members are set out on pages 50 to 53. 

The Board has determined that, by virtue of their previous 
experience gained in other organisations, members collectively 
have the competence relevant to the sector in which the Group 
operates. In addition, the Board considers that Rhian Davies, 
a chartered accountant, has the recent and relevant financial 
experience required to chair the Committee. Invitations to attend 
all Committee meetings are extended to the Chair, Group Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer and Directors who are not 
members attend on an ad hoc basis. Other regular attendees who 

advised the Committee were the Global Head of Finance, the 
Chief Risk Officer, the Head of Group Internal Audit and the 
Group General Counsel. Other members of senior management 
were also invited to attend as appropriate. The Chair of the Wealth 
Management Audit and Risk Committee (WMARC), who is an 
independent non-executive Director of Schroder & Co. Limited, 
attended one meeting of the Committee and provided an update 
to each meeting on matters related to the wealth management 
business. Representatives from EY, including James Beszant, 
Lead Audit Partner for the 2023 financial year, attended all of 
the Committee’s scheduled meetings. 

Private meetings are held with the external auditor without 
management present. Private meetings were also held with the 
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and Head of Group 
Internal Audit. These meetings provide an opportunity for any 
matters to be raised confidentially. 

The Committee’s primary responsibilities are the oversight of:

Financial reporting, financial controls and audit

•  The content and integrity of financial and Pillar 3 reporting.

•  The appropriateness of accounting estimates and judgements.

•  The effectiveness of the financial control framework.

•  The effectiveness and independence of the external auditor.

•  The recommendation to the Board of the appointment of the external auditor.

Risk and internal controls

•  The Group’s risk and control framework, whistleblowing procedures and the financial crime framework.

•  The Group’s ICAAP, ILAAP, wind-down plan, risk appetite, recovery plan and resolution process and operational resilience self-assessment. 

•  The Group’s regulatory compliance and conduct processes and procedures, and its relationships with regulators and compliance monitoring.

•  The Group’s Internal Audit function.

•  The Group’s legal risk profile and disputes.

•  Emerging and thematic risks that may have a material impact on the Group’s operations. 

•  Information and cyber security, technology risk and resilience, and the emerging risk of AI.

Audit and Risk Committee report continued

Key areas of focus during 2023

The key areas that the Committee considered are set out below. In addition, at each quarterly meeting, the Committee received updates from 
Internal Audit, Compliance, Risk, Legal and external audit, covering ongoing projects and the key issues that had arisen since the last meeting, 
and reviewed a dashboard of metrics to monitor key risks. The dashboard also includes metrics covering Internal Audit and the status of 
relevant change projects and sustainability targets. 

Financial reporting and financial controls
•  As part of the Group’s annual reporting cycle, the Committee 
considered the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts and 2023 
half-year results, including financial estimates and judgements 
and governance considerations. Ahead of preparing the 2023 
Annual Report and Accounts, updates were provided on the 
effectiveness of our internal controls, and on the Group 
accounting policies. The going concern and viability statements, 
Pillar 3 regulatory disclosures and climate-related disclosures 
were also considered.

•  The Group Head of Tax updated the Committee on the Group’s 
tax strategy, our approach to tax risk, the key tax risks facing 
the Group and how the Group’s effective tax rate is expected 
to evolve in the coming years.

External audit
•  When considering the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts, 
the Committee assessed the oversight and independence 
of the external auditor and audit effectiveness.

•  In relation to audit quality and effectiveness, the Committee 

discussed the results of the external auditor feedback 
questionnaire and noted the areas of improvement that had 
been identified. EY presented plans to respond to the feedback, 
and these were discussed by the Committee. The Committee 
reviewed EY’s audit plan for 2023, including key audit matters 
and focus areas. Fees for non-audit services were reviewed 
and approved by the Committee. 

•  Policies for safeguarding the independence of the external 

auditor were considered and re-approved. 

Internal Audit
•  As part of the governance considerations for the 2022 Annual 
Report and Accounts, the Committee considered the annual 
assessment of the Group’s governance and risk and control 
framework, conducted by Group Internal Audit.

•  The Committee approved the appointment of a new Head of 

Group Internal Audit.

•  The Internal Audit Charter was reviewed and re-approved 

with minor amendments. 

•  Looking ahead to 2024, the Committee considered and 

approved the 2024 Internal Audit and Compliance Testing plan, 
which is based on an assessment of the risks the business faces.

Risk and internal controls
•  When reviewing the 2022 Annual Report and Pillar 3 disclosures 

and 2023 half-year results, the Committee considered the Group’s 
key risks and risk management framework. The Chair of the 
WMARC provided an update on the activities of the WMARC and 
its oversight of the financial reporting, risk management and 
internal controls of the entities within Wealth Management.

•  The Committee considered the ICAAP, ILAAP, Group wind-down 

plan, Group recovery plan and operational resilience self-
assessment for recommendation to the Board. The approach 
taken for the Group’s resolution process was also considered. 
The Committee approved the stress scenarios for use in the 
Internal Capital and Risk Assessment required for Schroder 
Investment Management Limited under the Investment Firms 
Prudential Regime.

•  The Group Head of Financial Crime Compliance provided a 

review of financial crime risk, including updates on the regulatory 
landscape and effectiveness of the Group Financial Crime 
framework, and on the Group’s Financial Crime control systems. 

•  Thematic issues were considered throughout the year, including 

operational resilience, whistleblowing, and our conduct and 
culture risk oversight. 

•  The findings of the auditor’s assessment of our cyber security 
capabilities in light of the cyber risks posed to the Group were 
presented to the Committee. 

•  The Committee reviewed climate-related disclosures in line with 
the TCFD framework and recommended the Group’s Climate 
Report 2022 to the Board for approval. Sustainability risks were 
also considered as part of the Committee’s review of key risks. 
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) performed a limited scope 
review of our TCFD disclosures of metrics and targets in our 
2022 Annual Report and Accounts as part of a thematic review 
and raised no issues.

•  The Global Head of Finance provided an update on the proposed 
legislative and regulatory changes following the UK Government’s 
review of corporate reporting and corporate governance.

68

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Significant accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of the financial statements requires the application of certain estimates and judgements. The material areas of either 
estimation or judgement are set out in the note on the presentation of the financial statements on pages 152 and 153. Each of these areas 
is considered by the Committee based on reports prepared by management. EY presents to the Committee the audit procedures performed, 
challenges raised to management, and conclusions reached on areas of judgement and estimation. Further information on how EY challenged 
management is included within the independent auditor’s report on pages 175 to 181. The significant estimates and judgements considered in 
respect of the 2023 financial statements and the Committee’s agreed actions are summarised below.

Significant estimates and judgements

Action and conclusion 

Pension schemes

The Group’s principal defined benefit pension scheme (Scheme) 
is in respect of certain UK employees and former employees. 
The Scheme was closed to future accrual on 30 April 2011 and, as at 
31 December 2023, had a funding surplus. The pension obligation, 
which was valued as £575.1 million at the year end, is estimated 
based on a number of assumptions, including mortality rates, future 
investment returns, interest rates and inflation. The Scheme’s assets 
are invested in a portfolio designed to generate returns that closely 
align with known cash flow requirements and to hedge the interest 
rate and inflation risks.

Group Finance provided the Committee with a report that included 
the key financial assumptions, which had been applied by the 
independent qualified actuaries, Aon Solutions UK Limited, to 
determine the Scheme surplus. EY’s report to the Committee set 
out its audit procedures and conclusions on the pension assets and 
liabilities, including those procedures completed by EY’s specialists. 
The Committee considered and challenged the proposed 
assumptions and was satisfied that the estimates were appropriate.

  Please refer to note 23 for more information on the estimates and judgements made in respect of the Scheme. 

Carried interest

The Group recognises carried interest from its private markets 
business. This revenue stream is dependent on the future value 
of certain investments that may not crystallise until an uncertain 
date in the future. The Group is contractually committed to make 
payments based on a relevant proportion of carried interest 
received to various parties, including as part of deferred 
consideration arrangements.

For financial reporting purposes, the Group is required to estimate 
the value of carried interest receivable, in accordance with the 
requirements of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers; 
and the fair value of related amounts payable based on the 
requirements of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.

The key inputs used in determining carried interest comprised 
the fair value of the relevant assets on which carried interest may 
be earned, future growth rates, the expected realisation dates 
and the discount rates.

The Committee received a report from Group Finance, which 
reviewed the assumptions and inputs for estimating the amounts 
receivable and payable in respect of carried interest. The Committee 
also received a presentation from the Schroders Capital senior 
management team on the framework for the valuation of relevant 
assets, which is an important input into the calculation of carried 
interest. The Committee challenged management and considered 
the judgement applied in determining the principal assumptions, 
and the sensitivity of the relevant balances to those assumptions.

The Committee discussed the accounting for carried 
interest with EY and considered the findings from its audit 
work. Once the Committee was satisfied with the estimates and 
judgements applied, the estimated carrying values were approved.

The Committee considered the disclosures presented in respect 
of 2023 and concluded that they were appropriate.

  Please refer to note 2 for the estimates and judgements made in respect of carried interest receivable and amounts payable in respect of carried interest. 

Restructuring costs 

The consolidated income statement separately presents items that 
are restructuring in nature. This presentation is permitted by 
accounting rules for specific items of income or expense that are 
considered material. The presentation involves judgement by the 
Group to identify the items that warrant specific disclosure in 
accordance with accounting standards.

  Please refer to note 3 for more information.  

The Committee considered, and was satisfied with, the  
presentation of restructuring costs within a separate line item  
on the consolidated income statement. Restructuring costs are 
one-off in nature and have been incurred in reorganising parts 
of the Group to drive cost efficiencies and allow reinvestment in 
building the skills needed to support the future growth of the 
business. They principally comprise compensation-related costs 
and project expenditure. 

This presentation is considered appropriate as it provides a 
transparent view of the restructuring activity undertaken. In forming 
their conclusions, the Committee considered the audit work 
completed by EY and their conclusions.

Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportShareholder informationFinancial statementsGovernance 
Audit and Risk Committee report continued

Financial reporting and financial controls
The Committee reviews whether suitable accounting policies have 
been adopted and whether management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgements, including those summarised on 
page 69. The Committee is also required to report to shareholders 
on the process it followed in its review of significant estimates 
and judgements that it considered during the year, as set out 
on page 153. 

Financial reporting is reliant on there being an appropriate financial 
control environment. The Committee receives reports on the 
existing control environment as well as plans to enhance controls 
in the future, along with progress made against previous planned 
changes. These reports provide a detailed summary of the controls 
that exist across the Finance function globally and support the 
Group’s risk and control assessments. For more details, see pages 
38 to 43. In 2023, the reports focused on the risks involved in 
integrating acquired businesses with our finance operating 
platforms and key operational changes, including the transfer 
of our transfer agency platform to HSBC and migration of our 
principal banking relationship from Citibank to HSBC.

The Committee considers other controls that might have an impact 
on financial reporting. During 2023, the Committee considered EY’s 
assessment of the cyber risks posed to the Group. The Committee 
also reviews the Group’s tax strategy annually, which is discussed 
with the external auditors.

The financial control environment, including our information 
technology environment, is also subject to audit procedures by 
the Group’s internal and external auditors. After considering 
reports from Group Finance, Internal Audit and EY, the Committee 
considered that an effective system of internal control had been 
in place during the course of 2023.

The Committee conducted an in-depth review of the Group’s 
financial projections and the application of appropriate stress 
scenarios. The Committee took into account the impact of risks, 
including climate change and prevailing macroeconomic factors, 
so that it can recommend that the Board can make the viability 
statement, as set out on page 47, and to support the going concern 
basis of preparation of the financial statements.

Legal
Legal reports provide the Committee with information about 
emerging legal risks and notable developments in new law and 
regulation. The reports also provide detail on any material ongoing 
disputes and litigation in which the Group is interested or may have 
exposure. During the year, notable topics on which the Committee 
was briefed included global developments on sustainable finance 
regulation, UK regulatory reform proposals and data privacy.

Risk and internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the Company’s system of 
internal control, the ongoing monitoring of risk and internal control 
systems and for reporting on any significant failings or weaknesses. 
The system of controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives and can 
only provide reasonable assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for 
monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the risk and internal 
control framework.

The Committee carried out the annual assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal controls during 2023, including those 
related to the financial reporting process. The Committee also 
considered the adequacy of the Group’s risk management 
arrangements in the context of the Group’s business and strategy. 
In carrying out this assessment, the Committee reviews the results 
of the annual risk and control assessments, any significant risk 
events, and actions taken to remediate these. The Committee also 
considered reports from the Global Head of Finance, Group General 
Counsel, Chief Risk Officer, Head of Group Internal Audit and EY. 
This enabled an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal control framework. As part of the internal controls process, 
each member of the GMC has attested to the appropriateness 
and adequacy of risk management arrangements in their area, 
and has confirmed that appropriate controls are in place. The 
Group continually works to enhance systems to support and 
improve the control environment.

Fair, balanced and understandable

A key focus for the Committee is its work in assisting the Board 
in confirming that the Annual Report and Accounts, when taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and assessing 
whether it provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy. In assessing this, the Committee considered the 

key messages communicated in the 2023 Annual Report and 
Accounts, as well as the information provided to the Committee 
and the Board as a whole during the year.

The Committee, having completed its review, recommended to 
the Board that, when taken as a whole, the 2023 Annual Report 
and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.

70

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Risk and Compliance
Risk and Compliance reports set out changes in the level or nature 
of the key risks faced by the Group. They also cover developments 
in the approach to managing these risks, and provide information 
on operational risk events.

The reports outlined the Group’s management of key regulatory 
engagements and change programmes throughout the year 
and the planning and execution of the compliance assurance 
programme covering testing, monitoring and automated 
surveillance. Additional specific reports allowed the Committee 
to consider a range of factors when determining the key emerging 
and thematic risks and uncertainties faced by the Group. These 
included assessments of risk tolerance and stress testing of the 
Group’s capital position, as well as the production of the Group’s 
operational resilience self-assessment, recovery plan, resolution 
process and wind-down plan.

The Committee reviewed the Group’s arrangements in relation 
to conflicts of interest, financial crime, operational resilience, 
information and technology risk, and conduct and culture risk. 
The Committee also considered regulatory change and the 
supervisory horizon, engagement with regulators, cyber resilience, 
office physical security, oversight of third-party suppliers, and the 
Group’s whistleblowing arrangements. The programme of work for 
2024 will include assessing the UK’s Economic Crime and Corporate 
Transparency Act 2023.

Further information can be found in the Risk management section 
of the Strategic report set out on pages 38 to 43. 

Internal Audit
The Committee has authority to appoint or remove the Head of 
Group Internal Audit, who reports directly to the Chair of the 
Committee. During 2023, the Committee approved the appointment 
of a new Head of Group Internal Audit, the Internal Audit Charter 
and the Internal Audit strategy.

The Committee also has responsibility for approving the Internal 
Audit budget and being satisfied that the function has appropriate 
resources and skills and continues to be an effective and valued 
assurance function within the Group. The function monitors 
developments in internal audit practices and undertakes quality 
and assurance activities. In satisfying itself as to the quality and 
expertise of the function, the Committee reviews reports on 
progress against a rolling plan of audits approved annually by 
the Committee. These reports include any significant findings 
from audits performed, including any observations on culture 
and recommendations to improve the control environment, and 
their subsequent remediation. In addition, the Committee had 
regular interaction with the Head of Group Internal Audit, both 
at Committee meetings and also through other regular meetings 
outside the formal schedule.

The Committee also reviewed progress against the 2022 
independent external audit quality assessment of the Internal Audit 
function and was pleased to note the introduction of internal audit 
KPIs to enhance transparency. The function also made good 
progress in its development of a data analytics capability to deliver 
additional insights and efficiencies, and these will continue in 2024. 

During 2023, a broad range of audits were conducted across the 
business, both in the UK and overseas. The 2023 Internal Audit plan 
was continually reassessed by the Committee and Internal Audit to 
allow for the appropriate allocation of resources and to remain in 
line with the risk profile of the business. The annual compliance 
testing and Internal Audit plans are developed using a risk-based 
approach to provide proportionate assurance over the Group’s 
controls for the key risks set out on pages 38 to 43. For example, 
as in previous years, in 2024 a range of audits will be undertaken 
by IT auditors to test the adequacy of aspects of the Group’s cyber 
security and other technology risks. Planned audits also include: 
investment teams across business segments; sustainability-related 
processes; Schroders Capital; key back-office activities; a broad 
range of business activities in Asia Pacific; infrastructure functions 
and Wealth Management. As well as undertaking internal audit 
projects, senior Group Internal Audit staff attend relevant oversight 
and management committees and regulated entity board meetings 
to provide input and challenge on the topics discussed.

Oversight of the external auditor
Auditor oversight conclusion
The Committee is satisfied with EY’s work and that it is objective 
and independent. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended 
to the Board that a resolution be put to the 2024 AGM for the 
reappointment of EY as external auditor, and the Board has 
accepted this recommendation.

The Committee places great importance on the quality, 
effectiveness and independence of the external audit process. 
The Committee oversees the relationship with EY, including 
safeguarding independence, approving non-audit fees, 
recommending the auditor’s appointment at the AGM and 
determining the auditor’s remuneration. 

The external audit was last put out to tender in 2016, with 
EY replacing PwC as the Group’s auditor for the financial year 
commencing 1 January 2018. The next external audit tender will 
take place within ten years of EY’s appointment, and by 2027 at 
the latest. We periodically perform an assessment to maintain the 
highest possible audit quality and will conduct a competitive tender 
process in advance of this date if it is considered to be in the best 
interests of the Company. In line with requirements, the lead audit 
partner has been rotated after five years and James Beszant has 
taken over as Lead Audit Partner for the 2023 audit. The Committee 
confirms that the Company has complied with, throughout the year 
under review and as at the date of this report, the provisions of the 
Competition and Markets Authority (Penalties) Order 2014 relating 
to the UK audit market for large companies.

Audit and Risk Committee report continued

During the 2023 financial year, the Committee commissioned EY 
to perform “agreed upon procedures” over climate and financial 
metrics included within the executive Directors’ scorecard. There 
were no other changes requested, as the Committee considered 
the scope of the audit and concluded that it was sufficient. 

Assessment of audit quality and effectiveness
The Committee is responsible for evaluating the performance of 
the external auditor. In February 2023, ahead of the consideration 
of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts, the Committee received 
initial feedback on the conduct of the 2022 audit, which identified no 
significant areas of concern. A full assessment of the external auditor 
was carried out by way of a questionnaire prepared in accordance 
with the FRC’s guidance and completed by key stakeholders. 
Interviews with senior managers and Group Finance were also held. 
The findings of the questionnaire were presented to the Committee 
in May 2023. EY generally scored highly in the auditor effectiveness 
questionnaire and was assessed to have further improved in the 
fifth year of its audit. Areas of improvement were identified and 
discussed with EY to allow for enhancements to be made ahead 
of the 2023 audit.

The Committee reviewed the 2023 external audit plan presented 
to the Committee in May 2023, and the amendments required to that 
plan as a result of the findings of the FRC Audit Quality Review (AQR) 
of the 2022 audit, and additional work undertaken. The plan included 
considering the impact of continued market volatility as a result of 
global macroeconomic and political factors. Updates were received 
from the external auditor throughout the year, demonstrating that 
professional scepticism had been applied through challenge of 
judgements, estimates and disclosures. Matters arising from the 
audit were communicated to the Committee on an ongoing basis. 

The Committee reviewed EY’s transparency report and discussed 
the findings from the EY audit quality inspection report published 
by the FRC. The Committee discussed the impact on the Schroders 
audit plan, how EY maintains and monitors a high-quality 
audit generally through its UK Sustainable Audit Quality Programme. 
EY undertakes a range of processes that are designed to promote, 
embed and monitor audit quality. The structure of the audit team has 
been designed by the Lead Audit Partner to deliver and maintain a 
high-quality audit. EY continues to assess the structure, experience 
and knowledge of the team, with a view to maintaining and enhancing 
audit quality. In making this assessment, the Committee and EY have 
discussed and considered several Audit Quality Indicators (AQIs). 
These include: audit planning milestones; hours spent; internal and 
external reviews and results; training undertaken and experience 
of the team; senior team members’ responsibilities and their time 
commitments; and the extent to which specialists are involved in 
the audit.

The FRC AQR team, responsible for monitoring the quality of UK 
audits, reviewed the EY audit file for the Group’s 31 December 
2022 year end as part of its regular cycle of audit inspections. 
The Committee have reviewed the FRC’s report on the audit and the 
AQR’s areas for improvement with respect to revenue and general 

ledger journal entry testing. In the February meeting, the Committee 
discussed with EY the amendments made to their approach in the 
2023 audit, including additional testing, and were satisfied with the 
changes made.

In February 2024, ahead of the consideration of the 2023 Annual 
Report and Accounts, the Committee received initial feedback on 
the conduct of EY’s 2023 audit, including how the AQR findings 
were addressed. The detailed assessment of EY’s 2023 audit will 
be considered by the Committee at its May 2024 meeting and 
any findings will be implemented for the 2024 audit.

Independence and non-audit services
The Committee has responsibility for monitoring the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor. Since its appointment, EY has 
continued to confirm its independence and this remained the case 
during 2023 and prior to issuing its opinion on the Annual Report 
and Accounts. In addition to the annual review of effectiveness, 
the Committee considered EY’s independence and objectivity 
throughout the year. No Committee member has a connection 
with the external auditor.

A key factor in ensuring auditor independence is the Committee’s 
consideration of the provision of certain non-audit services by EY. 
The Committee maintains a policy on the engagement of the 
auditor for the provision of non-audit services to safeguard its 
independence and objectivity. This policy is reviewed annually and 
takes account of relevant regulatory restrictions and guidance in 
the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, including those in the 
UK. The policy prohibits the provision of certain non-audit services 
and contains rules regarding the Committee approving permitted 
non-audit services.

Details of the total fees paid to EY are set out in note 3c to the 
accounts. The policy on non-audit services restricts the appointment 
of EY to the provision of services that are closely related to the 
audit. Other services, where they are not prohibited, may also 
be considered, but these will not normally be approved by the 
Committee. Certain services that are provided to the Group are 
closely related to the audit but are not required by regulation. 
The Committee considers that these services are most appropriately 
performed by the Group’s external auditor as they support the 
statutory audit and provide the external auditor with relevant insights 
on aspects of the business, although they are not necessarily directly 
related to the financial statements.

Non-audit fees, excluding audit-related assurance services required 
under regulation, equated to 19% of audit fees (2022:15%).

During 2023, non-audit services mainly comprised assurance services 
in respect of controls reports and regulatory reporting normally 
conducted by the Group’s external auditor. These services are 
assurance in nature and are not considered to present a risk 
to independence.

Minimum Standard
In May 2023, the FRC published the Audit Committees and the External 
Audit: Minimum Standard, which took effect immediately for FTSE 350 
companies on a comply or explain basis. This report describes how 
the Committee has complied with each relevant provision of the 
Minimum Standard during the year.

Evaluating the performance of the Committee 
The annual evaluation of the Committee’s effectiveness was 
undertaken as part of the overall Board evaluation process.

The findings relating to the Committee were discussed with 
the Committee Chair, who is considered diligent with an inclusive 
style. The Committee operates efficiently and management are 
well prepared and collaborative. 

Committee’s assessment of internal control 
and risk management arrangements
The Committee was content with the effectiveness of the 
Group’s processes governing financial and regulatory reporting 
and controls, its culture, its ethical standards and its relationships 
with regulators. The Committee was also satisfied with the 
appropriateness and adequacy of the Group’s risk management 
arrangements and supporting risk management systems, including: 
the risk monitoring processes, internal controls framework and 
the three lines of defence model.

Priorities for 2024
As well as considering the standing items of business, the Committee 
will also focus on the following areas in 2024:

•  Cyber and technology risk.

•  Thematic risks, including climate.

•  Operational resilience.

•  Regulatory change.

By order of the Board.

Changes made to the 
implementation of our policy… 
served to reinforce our 
commitments to sustainability.

74

On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased 
to provide an overview of both executive Director and 
wider workforce remuneration for the 2023 financial year. 

As a Committee, the year was focused on implementing the 
remuneration policy which was well received by shareholders 
at the 2023 AGM. Last year, we engaged in discussions with 
investors regarding the changes made to the implementation 
of our policy, which served to reinforce our commitments to 
sustainability within our executive reward framework. A summary 
of our shareholder-approved executive Director remuneration 
policy is shown on page 77. 

Appointing a new Chief Financial Officer
In April 2023, we announced that, after a long and distinguished 
career, Richard Keers had decided to retire. He stepped down as 
Chief Financial Officer on 2 October 2023 and continued as an 
employee of Schroders until 31 December 2023. Richard Keers was 
eligible for a bonus for the year worked, based on his performance 
and contribution during this period. After completing ten years with 
Schroders, he will retain the deferred portions of bonuses earned 
in previous years. His outstanding LTIP awards will be pro-rated to 
reflect the time elapsed through his departure date. He will not 
receive an LTIP grant in 2024 and shareholding requirements will 
continue to apply for two years after stepping down.

Richard Oldfield succeeded Richard Keers as Chief Financial Officer 
and executive Director on 2 October 2023. Given Richard Oldfield’s 
extensive experience, qualifications and appointment to the 
same role, the Committee decided to maintain the same salary 
and maximum total compensation levels for the role. Executive 
Director salary levels have remained unchanged since 2014; 
total compensation caps have remained unchanged since their 
introduction in 2020. No buyout or guaranteed bonus awards 
were offered to Richard Oldfield. He was eligible for and received 
a bonus for the portion of 2023 he worked. 

2024 remuneration approach
No changes are proposed to our remuneration policy, which 
received strong support from shareholders at the 2023 AGM. 
The implementation of that policy will also remain unchanged in 
2024. This means executive Director salaries will stay the same 
and the performance measures applying to the 2024 annual 
bonus and LTIP scorecards will be consistent with prior years.

By contrast, the overall increase in salary budget for 2024 for the 
wider workforce was 4.5%. Seeking to balance the cost implications 
with the inflationary pressures faced by our employees in different 
regions, our budget and allocation approach were designed to 
protect lower-paid staff based on their geographic location and 
larger increases were targeted towards individuals with significant 
increases in role or responsibilities.

2023 remuneration outcomes
In 2023, our financial performance remained resilient, showcasing 
the benefits of our client-led strategy in the face of what continue 
to be challenging market conditions. The investments made in our 
strategic growth areas of Wealth Management, Private Markets and 
Solutions in recent years, alongside our know-how in public markets, 
have positioned us with the complete platform to achieve growth.

Performance against predetermined financial targets makes up 
70% of the executive Director annual bonus scorecard. For 2023, 
the financial portion paid out at 55%, reflecting our financial results 
given industry headwinds, favourable investment performance 
for clients and progress against our sustainability objectives. 
A comprehensive review of performance against non-financial 
targets gave rise to an ‘on-target’ outcome for the Group Chief 
Executive and former Chief Financial Officer, and 80% of maximum 
for the new Chief Financial Officer.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Role of the Remuneration Committee

The principal role of the Committee is to 
assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight 
of executive and wider workforce 
remuneration. All members of the 
Committee are independent non-executive 
Directors. Biographical details and the 
experience of members are set out on 
pages 50 to 53. 

The Board has determined that, by virtue 
of their previous experience gained in 
other organisations, members collectively 
have the competence relevant to the 
sector in which the Group operates. 

The Committee’s primary responsibilities 
include: 

•  Reviewing the Group’s remuneration 
strategy and recommending the 
Directors’ remuneration policy to 
the Board

•  Determining the remuneration of 
the Group Chair and the executive 
Directors within the policy approved 
by shareholders

•  Determining the level and structure 
of remuneration for other senior 
executives and the Group Company 
Secretary; reviewing the remuneration 
of the Chief Risk Officer and Head of 
Group Internal Audit; monitoring the 
level and structure of remuneration 
for other Material Risk Takers; and 
overseeing remuneration more 
broadly across the Group

•  Recommending to the Board 

the annual spend on fixed and 
variable remuneration

•  Reviewing the design and operation 
of share-based remuneration, other 
deferred remuneration plans and 
employee carried interest-sharing 
arrangements

•  Overseeing any major change in 
the employee benefits structure 
throughout the Group

•  Reviewing remuneration disclosures 

and compliance with relevant 
requirements

•  Receiving and considering feedback 

from shareholders and representative 
shareholder bodies

The Committee’s terms of reference 
are available on our website at 
www.schroders.com/board-committees

Key areas considered by the Committee in 2023

•  Overall fixed and variable compensation spend for the year
•  Review of compensation outcomes, including control function input, sustainability of earnings, diversity and competitiveness
•  Review of Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gaps
•  Review of remuneration disclosures
•  Executive Director remuneration, including scorecard measure and target setting, review and approval of outcomes
•  Terms of the Chief Financial Officer appointment and departure
•  Regulatory matters, including Material Risk Takers framework, annual internal audit of remuneration and Group Risk Adjustment framework
•  Shareholder and voting agency feedback on remuneration
•  Annual reviews of terms of reference, advisers and GMC shareholding levels

Mindful of the challenging market conditions and wider stakeholder 
experience, the Group Chief Executive requested the Committee 
consider a downwards adjustment to his bonus. In considering 
whether to make an adjustment, the Committee noted the 
year-on-year outcome versus all employees looked favourable. 
However it also recognised that in 2022, the executive Directors 
experienced a decline in bonus of approximately (50)%, a significant 
disconnect versus the median employee experience of (17)%. 
While the Committee ultimately decided against utilising positive 
discretion to improve alignment last year, it makes the year-on-year 
comparison for 2023 misleading. The overall stakeholder experience 
over multiple years was therefore particularly relevant this year. 

The Committee determined that a £250,000 downwards 
discretionary adjustment to the Group Chief Executive’s bonus 
would be appropriate, resulting in a bonus outcome of 72% of 
maximum. This bonus outcome is (26)% on 2021, which is in line 
with the median employee bonus experience over the same period. 

Normally, the 2020 LTIP granted to executive Directors would also 
be vesting this year. However, in 2020, the Group Chief Executive 
and former Chief Financial Officer chose to waive voluntarily their 
LTIP awards in response to the societal challenges of the Covid-19 
pandemic. These LTIP awards with total grant date face value of 
£1 million have therefore already been forfeited in full. This further 
lowers the total compensation received by the executive Directors.

Comparing executive Director outcomes to the change in total 
compensation for employees shows a more favourable experience 
for employees. This reflects the executive Director LTIP waiver 
and the absence of salary increases since 2014. Over this time, 
employees have received regular increases, including significant 
increases where relevant for cost of living considerations. The 
resulting median change in UK employee total compensation since 
2020 is +13% versus the CEO single figure movement over the same 
period of (2)%.

2023 outcomes

Performance context
In 2023, we generated growth through positive net inflows of 
£9.7 billion (excluding joint ventures and associates). Our financial 
performance remained resilient, showcasing the benefits of our 
client-led strategy in the face of continued challenging market 
conditions. We reported an operating profit of £661.0 million  
(2022: £723.0 million) and profit before tax of £487.6 million 
(2022: £586.9 million). The Board has recommended a final dividend 
of 15.0 pence per share. This results in a total dividend for the year 
of 21.5 pence per share (2022: 21.5 pence per share). 

The investment we have made in our strategic growth areas of 
Wealth Management, Private Markets and Solutions in recent 
years, alongside our know-how in public markets, have positioned 
us with the complete platform to deliver growth. The value of this 
is highlighted by the positive net new business we generated 
across these strategic growth areas, and the net operating revenue 
generated by them now accounts for 48% of our total net operating 
revenue (2022: 46%). This year we made progress in increasing the 
scalability of our operating platform to enable us to focus more 
resources on adding value to our clients. For more information on 
our strategic and financial performance, please see the Group Chief 
Executive’s and Chief Financial Officer’s statements, beginning on 
page 10 and page 24, respectively.

Group-wide remuneration outcomes
The balance between strong cost management and the need 
to support our talent and continue to invest in strategic growth 
areas was front of mind as the Committee discussed remuneration 
outcomes for the year. Increased headcount from our continued 
investment in strategic priority areas was largely offset by our 
targeted streamlining of our operations. Our people are paramount 
to the successful delivery of our strategy and we are proud that 96% 
of our key talent was retained in 2023. 

The Committee considered both financial and non-financial 
performance when setting the bonus pool, as well as an assessment 
of overall market conditions and wider stakeholder experience. The 
Committee and Board concluded that a bonus pool of £293 million 
struck the right balance across relevant stakeholders, including 
shareholders, clients and employees. When combined with salary 
increases made earlier in 2023, the total compensation experience 
for employees was generally between (-1)% and +8%. 

Individual bonus and salary amounts were determined according 
to our Fair Pay for Performance framework, summarised to the 
right. In reviewing outcomes, the Committee evaluated analytics 
on differentiation, diversity and competitiveness and were satisfied 
that the year-end process was rigorous and that outcomes reflected 
financial and non-financial performance, including conduct.

The salary increase budget for 2024 was set mindful of the 
implications for our cost base as well as the cost pressures faced 
by our people in many parts of the world. Allocation of the resulting 
4.5% salary increase budget was designed to protect lower-paid 
employees and larger increases were targeted towards individuals 
with significant increases in role or responsibilities.

Fair pay for performance

Remuneration outcomes for our employees are  
governed by our Fair Pay for Performance framework.  
This framework, available to all employees on our intranet, 
describes the variety of factors considered in making pay 
decisions at Schroders, including: 

•  Annual performance – including individual 

performance/contribution, behaviours and conduct, 
business and sub-business line performance as well 
as Group-wide performance and affordability. 

•  Individual achievement – including an individual’s 
skills/experience, progression, succession and future 
potential as well as consideration of multi-year 
performance context.

•  Market context – consideration of market pay levels 
for a given role/geography and review of relevant 
competitor insights, local market conditions and general 
market outlook. 

•  Relativities and diversity – ensuring fairness of 

outcomes versus peers and market.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Executive Director remuneration outcomes
2023 annual bonus 
Executive Director bonuses are determined by the Committee 
through a balanced scorecard approach. At the start of 2023, the 
Committee established and disclosed metrics consisting of 70% 
financial factors and 30% non-financial factors. These were selected 
to align to the Group’s long-term strategy. At the end of the year, the 
Committee assessed the level of performance against the financial 
target ranges. Meeting the threshold leads to a 25% payout, 
achieving the target results in a 65% payout, and reaching the 
maximum leads to a 100% payout.

In 2022, executive bonuses were misaligned with the experiences of 
employees and shareholders, as explained in the box to the right. 
Although the Committee ultimately decided not to exercise positive 
discretion to improve alignment, the insights gained around the 
impact of evolving market conditions on bonus outcomes were 
considered in establishing a broader profit range for 2023. Similar 
to 2022, the profit target range was asymmetrical, requiring greater 
upside performance to attain the maximum payout. The table 
below provides details of the target ranges and the corresponding 
payouts. The overall financial scorecard outcome was 55% out of the 
maximum 70%.

The bonus scorecard includes non-financial performance, 
which the Committee evaluates based on the strategic objectives 
established at the beginning of the year. This is combined with 
an assessment of each individual’s personal performance. The 
Committee acknowledged the achievements detailed on the next 
page, which include: successful net new business growth in our 
wealth management business; the launch of an LTAF in Schroders 
Capital, which expanded investor access to private markets; 
improved operational efficiencies and risk management through 
integrating the acquired River and Mercantile solutions business 
into our front office service platform; and external recognition 
for our sustainability integration and inclusion and diversity efforts 
in 2023. 

Based on the non-financial performance achieved in the Group 
scorecard and individual personal performance, the Committee 
confirmed non-financial scorecard outcomes of 20% for Peter 
Harrison, 24% for Richard Oldfield and 20% for Richard Keers, 
out of the maximum 30%.

2020 LTIP
In addition to annual bonuses, executive Directors are also eligible 
to receive long-term incentive plan (LTIP) awards. These awards are 
granted on an annual basis and are based on performance in the 
previous year and subject to stretching performance conditions 
over a four-year performance period. In 2020, in response to the 
societal challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the executive 
Directors voluntarily waived their LTIP awards, which had a total 
grant date face value of £1 million. Consequently, these awards, 
which would have vested based on performance to 31 December 
2023, have already been forfeited. Therefore, no LTIP payments 
will be released to the executive Directors for the year to 2023. 

Target setting: learning from 2022

Target ranges are set with reference to the Board 
approved budget, market expectations, prior year 
outcomes, strategic priorities and the wider market 
outlook. When setting target ranges, the Committee is 
mindful of the potential significant impact that evolving 
market conditions could have on bonus outcomes. In 
2022, additional stretch was introduced to the upside 
profit and net new business targets to help manage this 
potential impact.

Unfortunately, the story of 2022 was not one of recovery. 
Unfavourable market conditions that emerged after 
setting the scorecard targets led to a misalignment 
between the outcomes of executive Directors and the 
broader employee population, as well as the shareholder 
experience. The executive Directors experienced a decline 
of approximately 50% compared with the previous year, 
while the median employee experience reflected a 
decrease of 17%. While the Committee ultimately decided 
against utilising positive discretion to improve alignment, 
the insights gained were considered in establishing a 
broader profit target range for 2023.

1.  Proportion of Article 8 and 9 funds is assessed as the proportion of the Company’s funds which are in scope of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Under 

SFDR, asset managers have to disclose how sustainability risks are considered in their investment processes and which of their products meet the disclosure requirements of 
‘Article 6’, ‘Article 8’ and ‘Article 9’. ‘Article 8’ products promote environmental or social characteristics amongst others, but do not necessarily have them as their overarching 
objective. ‘Article 9’ products must have sustainable investment as their objective. ‘Article 6’ products are those products that are in-scope of SFDR, but do not meet the 
requirements for Article 8 or Article 9.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Personal performance assessment  
for the Group Chief Executive
Peter Harrison’s high energy and relentless work ethic have been in 
evidence throughout what has been a challenging year faced with 
strong industry headwinds. His leadership in reshaping our client 
proposition and driving growth in strategic areas is testament to 
his impact. 

Peter Harrison continues to be very highly regarded by a complex 
set of stakeholders, having great impact across all areas of our 
business. His work with the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce, HM 
Treasury and the Investment Association this year are all examples 
of the positive and important influence and impact he has, not only 
within Schroders but also the UK investment management industry 
more widely. 

People and culture remains an area of strength. Described in his 
feedback as “inspiring, engaging; a genuine role model for DE&I”, 
his contribution to upholding the Schroders culture is key.

As a result of the non-financial performance achieved in the 
Group scorecard and Peter Harrison’s personal performance, 
the Committee confirmed a non-financial bonus scorecard payout 
of 20% of the maximum 30%. 

Personal performance assessment 
for the Chief Financial Officer
Richard Oldfield’s tenure with the Group has been marked by a 
strong start since joining the Company and Board on 2 October 
2023. He has developed positive relationships with senior 
management and the Board, demonstrating open communication 
and collaboration. His active contributions towards year-end 
reporting and in investor relations discussions have been highly 
valuable, as have his steps towards enhancing our internal financial 
transparency. The Board has provided highly positive feedback, 
acknowledging his meaningful contribution towards key strategic 
initiatives notwithstanding his short tenure. 

As a result of the performance against the non-financial 
performance measures in the scorecard as well as Richard Oldfield’s 
personal performance since joining, the Committee confirmed a 
non-financial bonus scorecard payout of 24% of the maximum 30%, 
prorated for his tenure. 

Personal performance assessment 
for the former Chief Financial Officer
Richard Keers continued to support the Group’s strategy and 
outcomes until his stepping down as executive Director from 
2 October 2023. Through this period, he:

•  engaged effectively with investors and analysts to 

communicate our strategic direction and key objectives

•  delivered successful Capital Markets Day for our wealth 

management business, conveying our vision and opportunities 
to investors, analysts and key industry stakeholders

•  demonstrated strong leadership in driving efficiency measures

•  facilitated a successful handover to the current Chief 

Financial Officer, ensuring a smooth transition of financial 
leadership, knowledge transfer and continuity in financial 
management practices

As a result of the performance against the non-financial 
performance measures in the scorecard as well as Richard Keers’ 
personal performance, the Committee confirmed a non-financial 
bonus scorecard payout of 20% of the maximum 30% for the period 
as Chief Financial Officer. 

As confirmed in the Company’s announcement on 27 April 2023, 
Richard Keers remained eligible to be considered for a bonus for 
the period between stepping down as an executive Director and 
his departure date of 31 December 2023. This eligibility was based 
on his continued role in advancing the firm’s strategic priorities 
and a successful handover of responsibilities. The Committee 
conducted an assessment of Richard Keers’ performance during 
this period, taking into account his role in supporting the design 
and implementation of the 2024 Board strategy, the delivery 
of high-priority projects and his overall contribution to the 
Group’s financial and non-financial performance. Recognising his 
performance, the Committee determined to award Richard Keers 
a discretionary bonus of £367,000.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 20232024 implementation

Following strong support received by shareholders at the 2023 AGM, no changes are proposed to the policy in 2024. The implementation of 
the policy will also remain unchanged, allowing time for the changes made in 2023 to embed, most notably the new sustainability-aligned 
performance measures “proportion of Article 8 and 9 funds” in the bonus scorecard and “portfolio temperature score” in the LTIP. 

In 2024, the Committee will be monitoring the effectiveness of remuneration arrangements in supporting our long-term strategy amidst 
the challenges posed by the current market environment. We value ongoing dialogue with our shareholders and welcome their input 
and feedback.

achievement, strategic priorities and 
the wider economic landscape.

Additional detail on 2023 executive Director pay outcomes

Single total remuneration figure for each executive Director (audited)
The total remuneration of each executive Director for the years ended 31 December 2021 through 31 December 2023 is set out in the table 
below. As noted earlier in this report, the Group Chief Executive requested the Committee consider a downwards adjustment to his bonus this 
year. Reflecting on the overall stakeholder experience over multiple years, the Committee determined that a £250,000 downwards discretionary 
adjustment to the Group Chief Executive’s bonus would be appropriate, as shown in the table below.

For Richard Oldfield and Richard Keers, the 2023 amounts shown represent amounts paid in respect of their roles as executive Directors, 
being circa three months and nine months respectively. Richard Keers also received remuneration for the circa three-month period he was 
an employee before stepping down, as detailed in the next section. Normally, the 2020 LTIP granted to executive Directors would also be 
vesting this year. However, in 2020, the Group Chief Executive and former Chief Financial Officer chose to waive voluntarily their LTIP awards 
in response to the societal challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. These LTIP awards with total grant date face value of £1 million have 
therefore already been forfeited in full. This further lowers the total compensation received by the executive Directors.

1.  Represents the value of salary earned and paid during the financial year.
2.  Includes one or more of: private healthcare, life assurance, permanent total disability insurance, Share Incentive Plan matching shares and private use of a company car 

and driver.

3.  Represents the aggregate of contributions to defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements and cash in lieu of pension for Peter Harrison, and cash in lieu of pension 

for Richard Oldfield and Richard Keers. The table below shows how the retirement benefits figures above are comprised for each Director.

4.  Pages 79 to 81 set out the basis on which annual bonus awards for 2023 were determined. The table below breaks down the annual bonus awards for 2023 into cash paid 

through the payroll in February 2024 and the upfront fund awards, deferred fund awards and deferred share awards that will be granted in March 2024.

5.  As noted on page 79, the executive Directors waived entitlement to the 2020 LTIP whose performance period would have concluded on 31 December 2023. No amount will 

therefore vest in respect of this award for 2023. The comparative value for 2022 represents the actual value that vested on 6 March 2023 from LTIP awards granted on 11 March 
2019. The LTIP vested values disclosed last year were estimates, as the Annual Report and Accounts was finalised prior to the vesting date. Page 88 sets out information on 
LTIP awards granted to the executive Directors during 2023. Page 83 sets out information on LTIP awards to be granted to the executive Directors in March 2024.

Retirement arrangements for the former Chief Financial Officer (audited)
Richard Keers stepped down as Chief Financial Officer and executive Director on 2 October 2023, and continued to be employed by Schroders 
to facilitate an effective transition to Richard Oldfield through 31 December 2023, when he retired from the Company. 

For the period of 2 October to 31 December 2023, Richard Keers continued to receive his salary, which amounted to £93,750, retirement 
benefits as cash in lieu of pension of £11,242 and £2,368 in other benefits per the provisions outlined in footnote 2 in the table above. In 
accordance with the Directors’ remuneration policy, certain benefits (such as medical or life insurance) will continue until the end of the normal 
cover period. Any payments related to such will be disclosed in the report for the financial year to which they pertain, subject to relevant 
minimum disclosure requirements.

Mr Keers was eligible to receive an annual incentive award for the period after he stepped down as an executive Director, the value of which is 
not included in the table above. The Committee determined to award Richard Keers a bonus of £367,000 as detailed on page 81. His award will 
be deferred in line with the treatment for his executive Director period, as detailed on the following page. Richard Keers is not eligible to receive 
a bonus in respect of 2024. 

Following 10 years of service with the Company, the Committee agreed that Richard Keers’ deferred bonus awards previously granted to him will 
continue to vest based on the terms and conditions under which they were granted. Richard Keers will not be eligible for the grant of the 2024 
long-term incentive award, and his 2022 and 2023 LTIP awards will be pro-rated for the time elapsed with the Company during the performance 
period. Final vesting of the LTIP awards will be determined by the Committee at the conclusion of the performance period upon assessment of the 
achievement of the conditions set out in each award’s scorecard. Richard Keers waived his entitlement to his 2021 LTIP award, the performance 
period for which would have concluded on 31 December 2024. On stepping down as an executive Director, Richard Keers remains subject to the 
shareholding requirement which requires that he maintain for a period of two years a holding of shares or interests in shares equal in number to 
that which applied under the personal shareholding policy while he was an executive Director. Richard Keers has signed a commitment to adhere 
to this requirement as part of stepping down.

No other payments for loss of office or to former Directors were made during 2023.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Key takeaways from section 

•  At the request of the Group Chief Executive, the Committee determined a downwards discretionary adjustment of £250,000  

to his bonus in the context of the overall stakeholder experience over multiple years.

•  The LTIP awards that would otherwise be vesting this year were waived by the executive Directors in 2020 in response to the 

societal challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.

•  Resulting total compensation for the Group Chief Executive was 69% of the policy maximum and 72% of maximum for the  
Chief Financial Officers (being the total delivered to the two individuals who served as Chief Financial Officer in the year).

Retirement benefits – additional detail (audited)
The following table shows details of retirement benefits provided to executive Directors for the years ended 31 December 2023 and 
31 December 2022. For the executive Directors, the sum of employer contributions and cash in lieu each year is reflected in the single total 
remuneration figures above. Employer contributions represent contributions paid into DC pension arrangements during the year and exclude 
any contributions made by the Directors. There has been no defined benefit (DB) pension accrual since 30 April 2011.

1.  Peter Harrison received a combination of employer contributions to the Group’s DC pension arrangement and cash in lieu of pension contributions, and Richard Oldfield and 

Richard Keers received cash in lieu of pension contributions.

2.  Normal retirement age is the earliest age at which a Director can elect to draw their pension under the rules of the Schroders Retirement Benefits Scheme without the need 

to seek the consent of the Company or the pension scheme trustee.

Variable pay awards – additional detail (audited)

Upfront fund awards normally cannot be exercised for six months from grant, but are not at risk of forfeiture if the holder resigns and leaves 
the Group. Deferred share awards are conditional rights to receive Schroders shares, granted as nil-cost options. They normally require the 
holder to remain in employment for three years following grant to vest in full and are available to exercise in three equal instalments 1, 2 and 3 
years from grant. Deferred fund awards are conditional rights to receive a cash sum with an initial value equal to the value of bonus being 
deferred, granted as nil-cost options. That value is notionally invested in a range of Schroders funds and so the actual amount paid when the 
award is exercised is the initial amount plus or minus returns on those notional investments. They normally require the holder to remain in 
employment for 3.5 years following grant to vest in full and are available to exercise in three equal instalments 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 years from grant. 

Key takeaways from section 

•  In 2023, 60% of executive Director variable pay was deferred, providing long-term alignment and retention. 

•  Delivering a significant portion of the bonus in share and fund awards creates alignment with investors and clients.

The fees shown in each Director’s case reflect the portion of 2023 and 2022 that they each served in their respective roles.

•  Sir Damon Buffini stepped down from the Board at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM on 27 April 2023.

•  Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson stepped down from the Board from 31 August 2023.

•  Annette Thomas was appointed to the Board and Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 September 2023, with fees set at the same 

level as for other non-executive Directors.

•  Iain Mackay and Frederic Wakeman were appointed on 1 January 2024, and therefore do not feature in the table.

Benefits listed comprised travel expenses.

Key takeaways from section 

•  Non-executive Director remuneration comprised fixed pay only. 

•  There have been no changes to the structure or levels of non-executive Director fees in 2023.

•  Year-on-year changes in total remuneration paid to non-executive Directors reflect changes in Committee responsibilities and/or 

the timing of their appointments.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Workforce and Director pay outcomes
The statutory disclosures presented in this section offer insights into the relationship between employee and executive pay 
outcomes. The higher proportion of total compensation that is variable for executives can sometimes make year-on-year 
comparisons challenging. Looking at multiple years of data can help identify overarching trends. 

UK pay ratios
The table below compares the Group Chief Executive’s single total remuneration figure for 2023 to the remuneration of the Group’s UK workforce 
as at 31 December 2023, along with the comparative figures for the previous year. As noted on page 79, the 2022 bonus scorecard outcome for 
the Group Chief Executive was misaligned with the employee bonus experience and the Committee determined not to exercise positive discretion 
to improve alignment. As a result, the CEO pay ratio has increased this year. This also reflects a difference in the structure of the Group Chief 
Executive’s overall pay versus typical employees, with a larger proportion variable based on business performance each year. The Group is 
committed to ensuring pay fairness throughout its workforce, and the principle of providing greater certainty in remuneration through 
proportionally higher fixed pay for junior and lower-paid employees aligns with the Group’s pay and reward policies for the global workforce.

The rules that require this disclosure set out three methodologies that companies can adopt, termed Options A, B and C. The Group has 
adopted Option A as this is the most robust methodology, requiring the Group to calculate the pay and benefits of all its UK employees in order 
to identify the total remuneration at the upper quartile, median and lower quartile. We have based the calculation of these total remuneration 
quartiles on salaries as at 31 December 2023 plus any annual bonus award in respect of 2023 and any other incentive awards granted during 
2023. In calculating these ratios, salary and any annual bonus award or other incentive awards for employees who work part-time have been 
pro-rated up to a full-time equivalent. We have not included taxable travel benefits such as the reimbursement of occasional travel home from 
work that was covered by the Group’s travel and expenses policy. No other assumptions or statistical modelling was required.

Comparing Director and wider workforce pay
The Committee considers executive Director pay structures and outcomes in the context of wider workforce pay. The table below compares 
percentage change in base salary/fees, benefits and annual bonus awards for the Directors with the average change across employees of the 
Group as a whole for the past three performance years. The outcome for employees of Schroders plc is also included to satisfy the statutory 
requirement but is shown as not applicable given the legal entity does not itself have any employees. The values shown for the executive 
Directors are based on those shown in the single total remuneration figure table on page 84 and those for non-executive Directors are based 
on the table on page 86. The employee mean and median figures in this table represent the change experienced for individual employees who 
were employed by Schroders in both years.

1.  The fee increases shown reflect the timing of appointment to the Board and/or roles on Board Committees as set out on page 86. Increases in benefits reflect travel 

expenses which vary in each year based on actual usage, with amounts listed on page 86.

2.  For base salary, employees of the Group are those who were in employment between 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2023 and represents the salary increase over 

this period. Salary adjustments agreed as part of the 2023 compensation review will be effective in 2024.

3.  For benefits, the mean percentage change for employees of the Group is a per capita figure for those who were in employment for all of the two years under review and 
represents the average change in benefits value during the year, while the median is the median percentage change of individual employees within the same population.
4.  For bonus, the mean and median percentage change for employees of the Group is the mean and the median respectively of the individual year-on-year percentage change 
in bonus for employees who were in employment and bonus-eligible for all of 2022 and 2023. More commentary on the annual bonus award for each executive Director 
can be found on pages 79 to 81.

5.  Excluding Share in Success Award, an award granted in December 2021 to c.4,600 employees valued at the equivalent of 5% of annual salary.
6.  Including Share in Success Award.

Key takeaways from section 

•  The annual bonus change for executive Directors differs from employees due to their pay structure, which includes a higher 

proportion in bonus based on business performance. This contrasts with a desire to provide greater certainty through higher 
fixed pay for junior and lower-paid employees.

•  Looking over multiple years, total compensation outcomes for employees have generally been more favourable than outcomes 
for executive Directors. This is reflected in the decrease in pay ratio from 72:1 in 2019 when UK pay ratios were first reported, to 
59:1 this year.

•  The fees for the non-executive Directors were not changed in 2023 and any changes in fees are reflective of their change in role. 

Non-executive Directors are not eligible to receive a bonus, which reinforces their independence.

Alignment with shareholders and clients

By delivering a substantial portion of variable pay in shares and funds, we foster meaningful alignment among our executive 
Directors, shareholders and clients. The tables below provide details of awards granted, movements in share and fund awards 
held by the executive Directors in the year and the total share interests for all our Directors.

Directors’ rights under fund and share awards
DAP and LTIP granted during 2023 (audited)
The following awards were granted under the DAP on 6 March 2023 in respect of deferred bonuses for performance during 2022. No further 
performance conditions need to be met for awards to vest. The terms of the awards are the same as those that apply to the 2024 deferred 
bonus awards, as described on page 83. These awards were included in the 2022 single total remuneration figures disclosed last year and form 
part of the prior year value shown in this year’s single total remuneration figures on page 84. They are also shown in the tables of rights under 
fund and share awards on page 89.

Executive 
Director alignment to shareholders (audited)
To align the interests of senior management with those of shareholders, the executive Directors and the other members of the GMC are 
required, over time, to acquire and retain a holding of Schroders shares or rights to shares. The required shareholdings are 500% of base 
salary for the Group Chief Executive and 300% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer. Shares that count towards this policy include the 
estimated after-tax value of unvested deferred bonus share awards under the DAP (shown as “Other unvested share awards” on page 89) and 
vested DAP or LTIP awards (shown as “Vested but unexercised share awards” on page 89). Unvested LTIP awards are not included as these 
rights to shares are subject to performance conditions. Peter Harrison’s shareholdings are well in excess of the level required under our 
personal shareholding policy. Richard Oldfield, who was appointed as an executive Director on 2 October 2023, is unable to exercise any vested 
deferred awards until he has met the policy. Richard Keers remains subject to the shareholding policy for two years post his stepping down as 
an executive Director on 2 October 2023.

Between 31 December 2023 and 28 February 2024, the only movements in the Directors’ share interests were the acquisition under the 
Share Incentive Plan of 120 ordinary shares by Peter Harrison and 123 ordinary shares by Richard Oldfield.

1.  The interests of Richard Keers refer to the position as at 2 October 2023, the date he stepped down as a Director of the Company.
2.  The interests of Sir Damon Buffini refer to the position as at 27 April 2023, the date he stepped down as a Director of the Company.
3.  The interests of Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson refer to the position as at 31 August 2023, the date he stepped down as a Director of the Company.
4.  The interests of Claire Fitzalan Howard and Leonie Schroder include their personal holdings and the beneficial interests held by them and their  

connected persons in their capacity as members of a class of potential beneficiaries under certain settlements made by members of the Schroder family.

Key takeaways from section 
•  Alignment to shareholders is a key pillar of our remuneration approach, with senior leadership required to hold a meaningful 

number of shares.

•  Peter Harrison’s shareholdings are well in excess of the required level. Richard Oldfield, who was appointed as an executive 

Director on 2 October 2023, will not be able to exercise any share awards until he meets the required level.

•  Richard Keers remains subject to the shareholding policy for two years post his stepping down as an executive Director on 

2 October 2023.

1.  From performance year 2020, this represents the Group Chief Executive’s actual annual bonus award as a percentage of the maximum annual bonus award for the year. 
For performance years prior to 2020, each annual bonus award is shown as a percentage of the highest bonus award over the past ten years, as no maximum annual 
bonus opportunity was in place.

2.  The 2016 remuneration for Michael Dobson reflects the actual remuneration that he received for the portion of 2016 that he served as Chief Executive.
3.  Peter Harrison was appointed Group Chief Executive on 3 April 2016. The 2016 remuneration value above reflects his full-year single total remuneration figure.
4.  The first LTIP award vested on 5 March 2014 based on the four-year performance period ended on 31 December 2013 and so is shown under 2013 in the table.  

2017 shows as ‘n/a’ as Peter Harrison did not receive an LTIP award in 2014 and so had no LTIP due to vest based on performance to the end of 2017.

Key takeaways from section 

•  The relative spend on pay has remained largely consistent from prior years, demonstrating the close linkage between pay and 

financial performance.

•  Schroders plc total shareholder return is c.+40% over the past ten years. The single total figure of remuneration paid to the 

Schroders Group Chief Executive has decreased over this same period.

Other statutory disclosures
Committee advisers
After a competitive bidding process, the Committee appointed Deloitte as advisers from September 2023 after receiving advice from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) from January until Deloitte’s appointment. In its annual review of advisers, the Committee elected to retain 
McLagan (Aon) Limited (McLagan) to provide advice on executive Director pay during the year. The Committee assesses the performance of 
its advisers, the associated fees and the quality of advice provided annually to ensure that the advice is independent of any support provided 
to management.

PwC attended three meetings as independent Remuneration Committee advisers, with Deloitte attending two. A fixed fee structure operated 
for both advisers upon appointment to cover standard services, with any additional items charged on a time/cost basis. The total fees paid for 
advice to the Committee during 2023 on executive Director pay totalled £42,000 for PwC and £47,417 for Deloitte.

PwC and Deloitte also provide professional services in the ordinary course of business, including HR consulting services and advice to 
management on remuneration design and its regulatory implications, tax, social security, governance, operational and technical issues, as well 
as other professional services to the Group, including tax, consulting, regulatory and fund audit and support for corporate acquisitions. The 
Committee monitors its adviser independence, noting advice received is predominantly based on objective data trends/facts. Where relevant, 
advisers were asked to leave discussions when sensitive strategic context was being discussed, in recognition of the advisory roles they may 
have for competitors.

The Committee utilised McLagan data on market conditions and competitive rates of pay, as McLagan provides remuneration benchmarking 
data covering a wide cross section of the Group’s competitors, including firms that are not publicly listed and so are not required to publish the 
remuneration of their directors. The total fees paid for advice to the Committee during 2023 on executive Director pay totalled £3,410. The 
Committee is satisfied that the advice received from McLagan was independent and objective, as it was factual and not judgemental. McLagan 
is part of Aon plc, which also provides advice and services to the Group in relation to pension benefit valuations and pension actuarial advice. 
McLagan’s fees were charged on the basis of a fixed fee for the preparation of reports setting out the information requested. Neither Deloitte, 
PwC nor McLagan has a connection to the Company or any individual Director, save as outlined above.

At the invitation of the Committee Chair, the Group Chair and Group Chief Executive attended six meetings, the former Chief Financial Officer 
attended four meetings and the current Chief Financial Officer attended two meetings. The executive Directors left the meetings where/when 
relevant to avoid any conflicts of interest. The Chief Risk Officer, Group General Counsel and Head of Group Internal Audit advised the 
Committee on matters that could influence remuneration decisions and were available to attend meetings if required. The Global Head of 
Human Resources and Head of Reward, Wellbeing and Inclusion attended meetings to provide advice and support to the Committee and the 
Head of Executive Compensation and Regulatory Reward acted as secretary to the Committee. The Global Head of Sustainable Investment also 
attended meetings to provide expert input on the topic of sustainability measurement. The Committee also received regular updates from the 
Conduct Assessment Group, which comprised the Control Function Heads to ensure the Group is taking account of compliance and conduct 
risk considerations as part of the firm’s compensation processes. To avoid conflicts of interest, no Director or employee participates in decisions 
determining their own remuneration.

92

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”)

Code requirements

How the Committee has addressed the requirement

Clarity – remuneration arrangements 
should be transparent and promote 
effective engagement with shareholders 
and the workforce

•  Prospective disclosure of bonus and LTIP metrics (page 83)

•  Full retrospective disclosure of financial targets and non-financial factors (pages 79 to 81)

•  Review of shareholder feedback and guidance and engagement with shareholders 

(pages 74, 83)

Simplicity – remuneration structures should 
avoid complexity and their rationale and 
operation should be easy to understand

Risk – remuneration arrangements should 
ensure reputational and other risks from 
excessive rewards, and behavioural risks that 
can arise from target-based incentive plans, 
are identified and mitigated

Predictability – the range of possible values 
of rewards to individual Directors and any other 
limits or discretions should be identified and 
explained at the time of approving the policy

Proportionality – the link between individual 
awards, the delivery of strategy and the 
long-term performance of the Company 
should be clear. Outcomes should not reward 
poor performance

Alignment to culture – incentive schemes 
should drive behaviours consistent with 
Company purpose, values and strategy

•  Executive Directors incentivised via annual bonus with deferral and LTIP (page 77)

•  Clear disclosure of rationale and operation of each element (see pages 77, 83)

•  Defined maximum limit for annual total remuneration (page 77)

•  Significant deferral, providing alignment to clients and shareholders (page 77)

•  Committee discretion to adjust formulaic bonus or LTIP outcomes (page 83)

•  Extensive malus and clawback provisions (page 77)

•  Regular Committee review of likely bonus scorecard outcomes (page 75)

•  Annual bonus and LTIP performance measures reviewed annually against strategic 

priorities (page 75)

•  Significant deferral, providing alignment to clients and shareholders (page 77)

•  Extensive malus and clawback provisions (page 77)

•  Remuneration principles aligned with our key stakeholders (page 76)

•  Executive Director remuneration considered in the context of employee outcomes 

(page 82)

•  Commitment to fair pay for performance across the workforce (page 78)

•  Inclusion of non-financial metrics in both executive Director annual bonus and LTIP 

scorecards (pages 80 to 81, 83)

Fees from external appointments
The executive Directors are permitted to retain for their own benefit fees they receive from any external non-executive directorships, provided 
the directorships do not relate to any interest held by the Group. Peter Harrison, Richard Oldfield and Richard Keers did not receive any fees in 
respect of external non-executive roles during the course of their appointment to the Company in 2023.

Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment
Each of the executive Directors has a rolling service contract with a mutual notice period of six months. Each of the non-executive Directors has 
a letter of appointment with a mutual notice period of six months. Shareholders may review letters of appointment and service contracts at the 
Company’s registered office from the date of dispatch of the Notice of AGM on business days between 9am and 5pm. Additionally, these 
documents are available for viewing at each AGM.

Further remuneration disclosures
The remuneration disclosures required under the Capital Requirements Directive are incorporated into the Group’s Pillar 3 disclosures and are 
available at www.schroders.com/pillar3. Other regulatory remuneration disclosures can be found at www.schroders.com/rem-disclosures/

Evaluating the performance of the Committee
The annual evaluation of the Committee’s effectiveness was undertaken as part of the overall Board evaluation process which is described in 
the Governance Report on page 63. The findings relating to the Committee were discussed with the Committee Chair. The overall conclusion of 
the evaluation was that the Remuneration Committee was functioning effectively and had performed its duties diligently. The reporting to the 
Board on the Committee’s discussions by the Chair of the Committee was felt to be comprehensive.

Principal Shareholder Group
The history of Schroders began in 1804 when JH Schröder became 
a partner in J.F. Schröder & Co, a London-based firm founded by 
his brother JF Schröder. It has evolved since then into the company 
today known as Schroders plc. Throughout that time, the Schroder 
family have maintained a significant interest in the business, which 
the Company believes has been a significant benefit to it. Today, 
the interests of some members of the Schroder family (being certain 
descendants of the late Helmut Schroder and, in some cases, their 
spouse or former spouse) are spread across a number of parties, 
who are collectively known as the Principal Shareholder Group.

The Principal Shareholder Group is comprised of a number of 
private trustee companies (and investment companies controlled 
by those trustee companies), a number of Schroder family 
individuals, and a Schroder family charity which, directly or indirectly, 
are shareholders in the Company.

The Principal Shareholder Group currently holds 711,068,586 
ordinary shares (44.11% of the issued ordinary shares) in the 
Company. This is comprised as follows:

A.  662,474,955 of the ordinary shares (41.09%) are owned directly 
or indirectly by four private trustee companies which act as 
the trustees of various trusts settled by the Schroder family 
and investment companies wholly owned by the private trust 
companies. The trustee companies are Vincitas Limited, 
Veritas Limited, Alster Limited and Treva Limited. Flavida Limited 
and Fervida Limited are protector companies which act as 
protectors of certain of those trusts, and therefore also form 
part of the Principal Shareholder Group.

B.  29,364,559 of the ordinary shares (1.82%) are owned directly 
or indirectly by certain trustee and investment companies 
following the execution of the estate of Bruno Lionel Schroder 
(deceased). The trustee companies are Lionel Trustees I Limited 
and Lionel Trustees II Limited. The investment companies 
are MEB Investments Limited, CRH Investments Limited 
and JMF Investments Limited, which are controlled by those 
trustee companies.

C.  16,877,633 of the ordinary shares (1.05%) are personally held, 

directly or indirectly, by certain Schroder family individuals (who 
are direct descendants of the late Helmut Schroder or, in some 
cases, a former spouse of such direct descendants).

D.  2,351,439 of the ordinary shares (0.15%) are owned by the 

Schroder Charity Trust, a family charity.

Relationship Agreement
As the Principal Shareholder Group is presumed to be acting in 
concert, it is required to enter into a binding agreement with the 
Company to comply with certain independence provisions as set out 
under the Listing Rules. On 14 November 2014, the Company 
entered into such an agreement (Relationship Agreement) with 
members of the Principal Shareholder Group holding ordinary 
shares at that time. Additional persons who have since become 
members of the Principal Shareholder Group holding ordinary 
shares have adhered to the Relationship Agreement.

The Company’s Group provides private banking and wealth 
management services to certain members of the Principal 
Shareholder Group. These arrangements are conducted at arm’s 
length and on normal commercial terms. 

In accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.4(14), the Board confirms that, 
for the year ended 31 December 2023:

•  the Company has complied with the independence provisions 

included in the Relationship Agreement

•  so far as the Company is aware, the independence provisions 
included in the Relationship Agreement have been complied 
with by the other parties to the Relationship Agreement and 
their associates.

Dividends
It is our policy to provide shareholders with a progressive and 
sustainable dividend, targeting a payout ratio of around 50%.

The payout ratio is determined as the total dividend per share in 
respect of the year, divided by the Group’s basic operating earnings 
per share. In line with this policy, the Board recommends a final 
dividend of 15.0 pence per share (2022: 15.0 pence per share) 
which, if approved by shareholders at the AGM, will be paid on 
2 May 2024 to shareholders on the register of members at close of 
business on 22 March 2024. It means a total dividend for the year of 
21.5 pence per share (2022: 21.5 pence per share), representing a 
payout ratio of 66% (2022: 57%).

* Subject to approval by shareholders at the 2024 AGM.

In setting the dividend, the Board has regard to overall Group 
strategy, capital requirements, liquidity and profitability. This 
approach enables the Group to maintain sufficient surplus capital to 
take advantage of future investment opportunities, while providing 
financial security to withstand possible risk scenarios and periods of 
economic downturn.

The distributable profits of Schroders plc are £2.8 billion (2022: 
£2.7 billion). The Group’s ability to pay dividends is, however, 
restricted by the need to hold regulatory capital and to maintain 
sufficient operating capital to support its ongoing business activities. 
Operating capital requirements include co-investments with clients 
and seed capital investments in our funds to support new 
investment strategies.

Certain circumstances could adversely impact the Group’s ability to 
pay dividends in line with the policy. This includes a significant 
increase in the ratio of total costs to net income. After deducting the 
regulatory capital requirement and the regulatory capital buffer, 
there continues to be sufficient capital to maintain our current 
dividend level for at least three years before taking account of any 
future profits.

The Schroders Employee Benefit Trust and the Schroder US 
Holdings Inc. Grantor Trust have waived their rights to dividends 
paid on the ordinary shares in respect of 2023 and future periods. 
See notes 6 and 20 to the financial statements.

2024 Annual General Meeting
The 2024 AGM will be held on Thursday 25 April 2024 at 11.30am.

All resolutions are voted on separately and the final voting 
results will be published as soon as practicable after the meeting. 
Together with the rest of the Board, the Chairs of the Nominations, 
Audit and Risk, and Remuneration Committees will be present to 
answer questions.

Rule 9 Waiver and authority to purchase own shares
The Company simplified its dual share class structure on 
20 September 2022. As a result, the aggregate holding of the 
Principal Shareholder Group decreased from 47.93% to 43.11% 
of ordinary shares. Prior to 20 September 2023, the Principal 
Shareholder Group was permitted to acquire up to 1% of ordinary 
shares without being required to make a mandatory cash offer 
for the whole Company under the Takeover Code. The Principal 
Shareholder Group used this permission during 2023 and increased 
their holding to 44.11% of the Company’s ordinary shares. 

At the 2023 AGM, the Company was authorised by shareholders to 
purchase up to 161,207,153 ordinary shares. At the 2024 AGM, the 
Board will seek authority to purchase up to 128,515,118 ordinary 
shares so that, if such repurchases were exclusively from persons 
other than the Principal Shareholder Group, this would not result in 
the Principal Shareholder Group holding more than 47.93% of the 
Company’s voting ordinary shares, which is the level it held prior to 
the simplification of the Company’s dual share class structure in 
September 2022. Exercise of this authority would be subject to prior 
consent of the Prudential Regulation Authority.

If the Company were to buy back shares, it is likely that the Principal 
Shareholder Group’s overall ownership in the Company would 
passively increase from the current level of 44.11%. If this were to 
happen, under the Takeover Code, the Principal Shareholder Group 
would be required to make a mandatory cash offer for the whole 
Company. However, the Company has obtained a waiver from the 
Takeover Panel that exempts the Principal Shareholder Group from 
this obligation as a result of any buyback of shares. This waiver is 
conditional on the independent shareholders approving the Waiver 
Resolution at the 2024 AGM. 

Importantly, the waiver will not permit the Principal Shareholder 
Group’s holding of ordinary shares to increase above the 47.93% 
holding of voting ordinary shares held prior to the simplification of 
the Company’s dual share class structure without triggering a 
mandatory cash offer for the whole Company.

Members of the Principal Shareholder Group are supportive 
long-term shareholders and intend to retain a substantial 
shareholding in the Company over the long term. The Board 
expects to seek renewal of the Buyback Authority (and the 
associated Waiver Resolution) annually until such time as the 
Principal Shareholder Group’s holding of ordinary shares has 
returned to the level of 47.93%.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Indemnities and insurance
Shareholders have authorised the Company to provide indemnities 
to, and to fund defence costs for, Directors in certain circumstances. 
On appointment, all Directors are granted an indemnity as defined 
in the Companies Act 2006 in respect of any third-party liabilities 
that they may incur as a result of their service on the Board. 
All Directors’ indemnities were in place during the financial year 
and remain in force.

Change of control
The Company does not consider that it has any significant 
agreements to which the Company is a party that take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid that are required to be disclosed pursuant 
to paragraph 13(2) (j) of Schedule 7 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(as amended), other than as disclosed below.

Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance is maintained by the 
Company for all Directors.

Under the Trust Deed and Rules of the Schroders Retirement 
Benefit Scheme (Scheme), the Company provides a qualifying 
pension scheme indemnity in line with the Companies Act 2006. 
The indemnity covers each director of the trustee company that acts 
as trustee of the Scheme. The provisions have been in force during 
the financial year.

As part of the integration of Cazenove Capital, the Cazenove 
Capital Management Limited Pension Scheme was merged with 
the Schroders Retirement Benefits Scheme, with effect from 
31 December 2014. Pursuant to that merger, a qualifying pension 
scheme indemnity in line with the Companies Act 2006 is provided 
by Schroders plc for the benefit of the directors of Cazenove 
Capital Management Pension Trustee Limited, a subsidiary of the 
Company at that time, was put in place at that time and remains in 
force. This indemnity covers, to the extent permitted by law, certain 
losses or liabilities incurred by the directors of Cazenove Capital 
Management Pension Trustee Limited in connection with that 
company’s activities as trustee of the Cazenove Capital Management 
Limited Pension Scheme.

Directors’ Conflicts of Interest and Recusal Policy
The Company has procedures to identify, authorise and manage 
conflicts of interest, including of Directors of the Company. 
They have operated effectively during the year. In circumstances 
where a potential conflict arises, the Board (excluding the Director 
concerned) will consider the situation and either authorise the 
arrangement in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the 
Company’s Articles of Association, or take other appropriate action.

All potential conflicts authorised by the Board are recorded in 
a conflicts register, which is maintained by the Group Company 
Secretary and reviewed by the Board annually. Directors have a 
continuing duty to update the Board with any changes to their 
conflicts of interest.

Under the Group’s Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, if a change 
of control of the Company occurs, the lenders are not obliged to 
provide further funding under the facility. The Company and lenders 
have up to 30 days to agree the continued use of the facility. If there 
is no agreement, repayment of the facility and accrued interest may 
be requested by the lenders with not less than ten days’ notice.

Under the Amended and Restated Framework Agreement 
(Framework Agreement) with Lloyds Banking Group plc (LBG), 
signed on 3 October 2019 in relation to the strategic partnership 
announced on 23 October 2018, on a change of control of the 
Company to: (1) either a material competitor of an LBG business; 
or (2) an entity or person on, or controlled by an entity or person 
on, a recognised sanctions list, or located in a specified jurisdiction, 
LBG may terminate the Framework Agreement. Such termination 
provisions provide for LBG and the Company to return to the status 
quo prior to establishing the strategic partnership in relation to 
shareholdings in subsidiary entities, with any implementing 
transactions conducted at specified valuations.

The Company entered into an amended Shareholders Agreement 
with Greencoat management shareholders on 10 April 2022, 
with respect to their respective shareholdings in Greencoat Capital 
Holdings Limited. On a change of control of the Company to a 
person who does not form part of the Principal Shareholder Group, 
the management shareholders have the right to sell their shares 
to Schroder International Holdings Limited, a subsidiary of 
the Company.

Directors’ and employees’ employment contracts do not normally 
provide for compensation for loss of office or employment as 
a result of a change of control. However, the provisions of the 
Company’s employee share schemes may cause awards granted 
to employees under such schemes to vest on a change of control.

Political donations
No political donations or contributions were made or expenditure 
incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries during the year 
(2022: nil) and there is no intention to make or incur any in the 
current year.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Statement of Directors’ responsibilities

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.

The Companies Act 2006, being the applicable law in the UK, 
requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. The Directors have prepared the financial statements 
in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards 
and in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Under the Companies Act 2006, the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that the statements 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and 
the Group, and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.

In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:

•  select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 

Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
and then apply them consistently; 

•  make estimates and judgements that are reasonable and prudent;

•  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;

•  provide additional disclosure where compliance with the specific 
requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards 
is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of a 
particular transaction, other events or conditions on the Company 
or Group’s financial position or financial performance;

•  state whether the financial statements comply with UK-adopted 

international accounting standards, subject to any material 
departure disclosed, and explained in the financial statements; 
and

•  prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company or Group will 
continue in business, in which case there should be supporting 
assumptions or qualifications as necessary.

The Directors are also required by the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to include a 
management report containing a fair review of the business and 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Company and the Group.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper books of 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time, the Company’s and the Group’s financial position, 
and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the Company’s and the Group’s 
assets, and for taking reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.

Directors’ statement
Each of the Directors, whose name and functions are listed in the 
Board of Directors and Company Secretary section of this Annual 
Report and Accounts, confirms that, to the best of each person’s 
knowledge and belief:

•  The consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance 

with UK-adopted international accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Company and the Group.

•  The Directors’ report contained in this Annual Report and 

Accounts, which comprises the sections described on page 94, 
includes a fair review of the business development and 
performance and the Company’s and Group’s position, and a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

•  So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information which the Company’s auditors are unaware of.

•  The Directors have taken all the steps that ought to have been 
taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information, and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

In addition, each of the Directors considers that this Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the audited financial information on the website at 
www.schroders.com.

Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

Forward-looking statements
This Annual Report and Accounts and the Schroders website may 
contain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial 
condition, performance and position, strategy, results of operations 
and businesses of the Company and the Group. Such statements 
and forecasts involve risk and uncertainty because they are based 
on current expectations and assumptions but relate to events and 
depend on circumstances in the future, and you should not place 
reliance on them. Without limitation, any statements preceded or 
followed by, or that include the words ‘foresee’, ‘targets’, ‘plans’, 
‘believes’, ‘expects’, ‘confident’, ‘aims’, ‘will have’, ‘will be’, ‘will ensure’, 
‘estimates’ or ‘anticipates’, or the negative of these terms or other 
similar terms, are intended to identify such forward-looking 
statements. There are a number of factors that could cause actual 
results or developments to differ materially from those expressed 
or implied by forward-looking statements and forecasts. Forward-
looking statements and forecasts are based on the Directors’ 
current view and information known to them at the date of this 
Annual Report and Accounts. The Directors do not make any 
undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements, 
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
Nothing in this Annual Report and Accounts should be construed 
as a forecast, estimate or projection of future financial performance.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Notes to the accounts

1. Segmental reporting
(a) Operating segments

The Group has two operating segments: Asset Management and Wealth Management. The Asset Management segment principally 
comprises investment management including advisory services in respect of equity, fixed income, multi-asset and private assets and 
alternatives products. The Wealth Management segment principally comprises investment management, wealth planning and financial 
advice, platform services and banking services.

Segmental information is presented on the same basis as that provided for internal reporting purposes to the Group’s chief operating 
decision maker, the Group Chief Executive.

Operating expenses represent the costs incurred in running the Asset Management and Wealth Management segments and include 
an allocation of costs between the individual business segments on a basis that aligns the charge with the resources employed by the 
Group in respect of particular business functions. This allocation provides management with the relevant information as to the business 
performance to effectively manage and control expenditure. Operating expenses exclude items related to acquisitions, central management 
activities and certain restructuring costs (see note 3). The reconciliation of operating profit to profit before tax is included on the 
income statement.

2. Net operating revenue

Revenue
The Group’s primary source of revenue is fee income from investment management activities performed within both the Asset Management 
and Wealth Management segments. Fee income includes management fees, performance fees, carried interest and other fees. Revenue 
also includes interest income earned within the Wealth Management segment.

Management fees are generated through investment management agreements and are generally based on an agreed percentage 
of the valuation of AUM. Management fees are recognised as the service is provided and it is probable that the fee will be collected.

Performance fees and carried interest are earned from certain arrangements when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded 
within specified performance measurement periods. They are only recognised where it is highly probable that a significant reversal will 
not occur in future periods. Performance fees are typically earned over one year and are recognised at the end of the performance period. 
Carried interest is earned over a longer time frame and is recognised over the period for which the service is provided and when certain 
performance hurdles are expected to be met. This may result in the recognition of revenue before the contractual crystallisation date.

Other fees principally comprise revenues for other services, which typically vary according to the volume of transactions. Other fees 
are recognised as the relevant service is provided and it is probable that the fee will be collected.

Within Wealth Management, earning a net interest margin is a core activity and interest is therefore recognised within revenue. Interest 
income is earned as a result of placing loans and deposits with other financial institutions, advancing loans and overdrafts to clients, and 
holding debt and other fixed income securities. Interest income is recognised as it is earned using the effective interest method, which 
allocates interest at a constant rate of return over the expected life of the financial instrument based on the estimated future cash flows.

Cost of sales
Fee expenses incurred by the Group that relate directly to revenue are presented as cost of sales. These expenses include commissions, 
external fund manager fees and distribution fees payable to financial institutions, investment platform providers and financial advisers 
that distribute the Group’s products. 

Fee expense is generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of AUM and is recognised in the income statement as the 
service is received.

Cost of sales also includes the cost of financial obligations arising from carried interest. Amounts payable in respect of carried interest 
are determined based on the proportion of carried interest income that is payable to third parties.

Wealth Management pays interest to clients on deposits taken. Within Wealth Management, earning a net interest margin is a core activity. 
Interest payable in respect of these activities is therefore recorded separately from finance costs arising elsewhere in the business and is 
reported as part of cost of sales. Interest is recognised using the effective interest method (see above).

Estimates and judgements – revenue
The principle estimates and judgements for revenue relate to carried interest. Carried interest represents the Group’s contractual right to a 
share of the profits of 133 private asset investment vehicles (2022: 122 vehicles), if certain performance hurdles are met. It is recognised as 
the services are provided and it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

The amount of carried interest that will ultimately be received by the Group is dependent on the cash flows realised by the respective 
investment vehicles when the underlying investments are successfully disposed of. The resultant cash flows are assessed against the 
applicable performance hurdle, which is dependent on the capital invested and the timing and quantum of distributions. For accounting 
purposes, the outcome is discounted to determine the present value of the carried interest to be recognised. The actual amount receivable 
at maturity will depend on the realised value and may differ from the projected value.

The Group estimates the cash flows that will be received by the investment vehicles with reference to the current fair value of the underlying 
investments. Judgement is applied to determine certain assumptions used in the estimate. Those assumptions principally relate to the 
future growth and the timing of distributions. No future growth is assumed, reflecting the uncertainty of future investment returns. The 
timing of distributions to clients is based on individual investment managers’ expectations as to the realisation of cash flows from the 
successful disposal of the underlying securities.

The Group assesses the nature and maturity of the respective investment vehicles. This helps the Group to understand whether a 
significant risk of reversal exists and to determine whether the revenue should be recognised or further constrained in accordance with the 
accounting standards.

Estimates and judgements – cost of sales
The principle estimates and judgements for cost of sales relate to carried interest. The crystallisation of associated financial obligations 
in respect of carried interest (carried interest payable, see note 8) is contingent on the Group receiving the related revenue. The areas of 
estimates and judgements are the same as those used to determine the present value of the carried interest receivable, adjusted to reflect 
the portion that is payable to third parties. The actual amount payable at maturity will depend on the realised value of the carried interest 
receivable and may differ from the projected value. An increase in the growth rate of 3% would increase cost of sales by £3.9 million 
(2022: £3.1 million), although this would be smaller than the corresponding increase in revenue. An average acceleration/delay in 
crystallisation dates of one year would increase/reduce cost of sales by £3.3 million/£3.2 million (2022: £2.1 million/£2.0 million) and 
this amount would be lower than the corresponding increase/reduction in revenue. 

3. Total expenses

Total expenses represent the Group’s administrative expenses including compensation costs. They are generally recognised as the services 
are received. Certain costs, such as depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation of intangible assets, are expensed 
evenly over the useful life of the asset or relevant contract. 

Expenses comprise operating expenses, central costs, acquisition costs and related items and restructuring costs. Operating expenses 
are those costs incurred through the operating activities of the Group’s operating segments: Asset Management and Wealth Management. 
Central costs are those arising from capital and treasury management activities, corporate development and strategy activities and the costs 
associated with the governance and corporate management of the Group. Acquisition costs and related items include deal costs associated 
with corporate transactions and costs associated with the integration of acquired businesses and amortisation of acquired intangible assets. 
The restructuring costs are one-off in nature and have been incurred in reorganising parts of the group to drive cost efficiencies and allow 
reinvestment in building the skills needed to support the future growth of the business. They principally comprise compensation-related 
costs and project expenditure.

The biggest component of the Group’s total expenses is the cost of employee benefits, as shown below. Other costs primarily consist 
of accommodation, information technology, marketing and outsourcing costs. Compensation costs are managed to a target operating 
compensation ratio of between 45% and 49%. Targeting a compensation ratio range provides some flexibility to manage the overall 
cost base in response to market conditions. 

Employee benefits expense includes salaries and wages, together with the cost of other benefits provided to employees such as pension 
and bonuses. The Group makes some performance awards to employees that are deferred over a specified vesting period. Such awards 
are expensed to the income statement over the performance and vesting periods. The Group holds investments that are linked to these 
performance awards in order to hedge the related exposure. Gains and losses on these investments are netted against the relevant costs 
in the income statement but are presented separately below.

Further detail on other employee benefits can be found elsewhere within these financial statements. See note 23 for pension costs and note 
24 for compensation that is awarded in Schroders plc shares.

The Group is headquartered in the UK and pays taxes according to the rates applicable in the countries and states in which it operates. 
Most taxes are recorded in the income statement (see part (a)) and relate to taxes payable for the reporting period (current tax). 
The charge also includes benefits and charges relating to when income or expenses are recognised in a different period for tax and 
accounting purposes or when there are specific treatments applicable relating to items such as acquisitions (deferred tax – see note 13). 
Some current and deferred taxes are recorded through other comprehensive income (see part (b)) or directly to equity where the tax arises 
from changes in the value of remuneration settled as shares (see part (c)).

(d) Factors affecting tax charge for the year
The UK rate of corporation tax applicable for 2023 is a blended rate of 23.5% (2022: standard rate of 19%). The tax charge for the year is lower 
(2022: higher) than a charge based on the UK blended rate. The differences are explained below:

Year ended 31 December

Estimates and judgements
The calculation of the Group’s tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement. Liabilities relating to open and judgemental 
matters, including those in relation to deferred taxes, are based on the Group’s assessment of the most likely outcome based on the 
information available. As a result, certain tax amounts are based on estimates using factors that are relevant to the specific judgement. 
The Group engages constructively and transparently with tax authorities with a view to early resolution of any uncertain tax matters. Where 
the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts provided, such differences will impact the tax charge in a future period. 
Such estimates are based on assumptions made on the probability of potential challenge within certain jurisdictions and the possible 
outcome based on relevant facts and circumstances, including local tax laws. There was no individual judgemental component of the 
tax expense that was material to the Group results when taking into account the likely range of potential outcomes (2022: none).

5. Earnings per share

This key performance indicator shows the portion of the Group’s profit after tax that is attributable to each share issued by the Company, 
excluding own shares held by the Group. The calculation is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. 
The diluted figure recalculates that number as if all share options that would be expected to be exercised, as they have value to the option 
holder, had been exercised in the year. Shares that may be issued are not taken into account if the impact does not reduce earnings 
per share.

Reconciliation of the figures used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share:

Earnings per share calculations are based on profit after tax of £402.6 million (2022: £486.2 million) less non-controlling interest earnings of 
£14.4 million (2022: £6.5 million). 

Operating earnings per share calculations are based on operating profit after tax of £533.0 million (2022: £599.4 million) less non-controlling 
interest operating earnings of £21.3 million (2022: £10.4 million).

6. Dividends

Dividends are distributions of profit to holders of the Group’s share capital, usually announced with the Group’s half-year and annual results. 
Dividends are recognised only when they are paid to or approved by shareholders. The reduction in equity in the year therefore comprises 
the prior year final dividend and the current year interim dividend.

1.  Dividends per share have been restated following the simplification of the Company’s dual share class structure (see note 19).

Dividends of £13.6 million (2022: £12.6 million) on shares held by employee benefit trusts have been waived. The Board has recommended a 
2023 final dividend of 15.0 pence per share (2022: 15.0 pence), amounting to £233.1 million (2022 final dividend: £232.2 million). The dividend 
will be paid on 2 May 2024 to shareholders on the register at 22 March 2024 and will be accounted for in 2024.

The Group paid £15.5 million of dividends to holders of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries of the Group during 2023 (2022: £9.3 million), 
resulting in total dividends paid of £348.5 million (2022: £341.4 million).

7. Trade and other receivables

Trade and other receivables include prepayments and deposits with banks in the form of bullion as well as amounts the Group is due 
to receive from third parties in the normal course of business. Trade and other receivables, other than deposits with banks in the form of 
bullion, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost (see note 8). Prepayments arise where the Group pays cash 
in advance for services. As the service is provided, the prepayment is reduced and the operating expense is recognised in the income 
statement. Accrued income, other than amounts relating to carried interest, represents unbilled revenue and is not dependent on future 
performance. Amounts due from third parties also include settlement accounts for transactions undertaken on behalf of funds and 
investors. Deposits with banks in the form of bullion are recorded at fair value.

Estimates and judgements – carried interest receivable
Accrued income includes £140.2 million of receivables in respect of carried interest (2022: £110.9 million). This income is due over a number 
of years and only when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded. The income received may vary as a result of the actual 
experience, including future investment returns, differing from that assumed. Further information regarding the estimates and judgements 
applied is set out in note 2.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 20238. Financial assets and liabilities

Financial assets
The Group holds financial assets including loans and advances to clients and banks, equities, debt securities, pooled investment vehicles 
and derivatives to support its Group capital strategies, activities within the Wealth Management banking book and client facilitation 
(see note 17).

The Group initially recognises all financial assets at fair value. The Group subsequently measures each financial asset at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL), fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or amortised cost. Fair value is the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants. Amortised cost is the amount determined based on 
moving the initial fair value to the maturity value on a systematic basis using the effective interest rate, taking account of repayment dates 
and initial expected premiums or discounts.

Financial assets at amortised cost
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost when their contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest and 
they are held within a business model designed to collect cash flows. This classification typically applies to the Group’s loans and advances, 
trade receivables and some debt securities held by the Group’s Wealth Management entities. The carrying value of amortised cost financial 
assets is adjusted for impairment under the expected credit loss (ECL) model. Movements in the ECL provision are recognised in other 
operating income in the income statement (see note 18).

Financial assets at FVOCI
Financial assets are measured at FVOCI when their contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest and they are 
held within a business model designed to collect cash flows and to sell assets. This classification applies to certain debt securities, principally 
within the Group’s Wealth Management entities. Impairment is recognised for debt securities classified as FVOCI under the ECL model. 
Movements in the ECL provision are recognised in other operating income in the income statement (see note 18). Unrealised gains and 
losses on debt securities classified as financial assets at FVOCI are recorded in other comprehensive income. Cumulative gains and losses 
are transferred to the income statement if the asset is sold or otherwise realised. Interest earned on FVOCI assets is recognised using the 
effective interest method and recorded as interest in the income statement. 

Financial assets at FVTPL
All other financial assets are measured at FVTPL. Net gains and losses are presented in the income statement based on the substance of 
the transaction. Net gains and losses on co-investments are presented within other operating income; net gains and losses on the Group’s 
investment and seed capital are presented within net gain/(loss) on financial instruments and other income; and net gains and losses on 
investments that are held to hedge deferred employee cash awards are presented within operating expenses (see note 3). This separate 
presentation provides more relevant information about the applicable components of the Group’s income statement. 

Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities principally comprise deposits by Wealth Management clients and banking counterparties. They also include 
derivatives to support its Group capital strategies, activities within the Wealth Management banking book and client facilitation (see note 
17). Financial liabilities also arise from obligations in respect of carried interest, contingent consideration and other liabilities arising from 
acquisitions completed by the Group, and third party interests in consolidated funds. 

The Group initially recognises all financial liabilities at fair value. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value.

Financial liabilities at amortised cost
The majority of the Group’s financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost and this typically applies to the Group’s Wealth Management 
client accounts, banking deposits and trade payables.

Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are measured at FVTPL when this reduces an accounting mismatch or when otherwise required by the accounting 
standards. This classification typically applies to financial obligations in respect of carried interest, third party interests in consolidated funds 
(see Basis of preparation on page 152) and contingent consideration. 

Net gains and losses are presented in the income statement based on the substance of the instrument. Net gains and losses on 
financial obligations in respect of carried interest are presented within cost of sales; and net gains and losses on contingent consideration 
are presented within acquisition costs and related items. This separate presentation provides more relevant information about the 
applicable components of the Group’s income statement. 

Liabilities to purchase subsidiary shares
Financial liabilities in relation to equity transactions arise on certain acquisitions where the Group has a liability to purchase the remaining 
interest in a subsidiary that is not wholly owned by the Group (see Basis of preparation on page 152).

The Group has recognised a net gain on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss of £19.9 million (2022: loss of £10.9 million). A 
net loss on financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income of £0.1 million (2022: loss of £0.1 million) has been 
transferred to the income statement.

For the maturity profiles of client accounts, deposits by banks and derivative contracts, see notes 17 and 18. 

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost approximates their carrying value. No financial assets or liabilities 
were transferred between levels during 2023 (2022: none).

Estimates and judgements
The Group holds financial instruments that are measured at fair value. The fair value of financial instruments may be derived from readily 
available sources or may require some estimation. The degree of estimation involved depends on the individual financial instrument and is 
reflected in the fair value hierarchy below. Judgements may include determining which valuation approach to apply as well as determining 
appropriate assumptions. For level 2 and 3 financial instruments, the judgement applied by the Group gives rise to an estimate of fair value. 
The approach to determining the fair value estimate of level 2 and 3 financial instruments is set out below. The fair value levels are based on 
the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows:

•  Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and 
principally comprise investments in pooled investment vehicles, quoted equities, government debt and exchange-traded derivatives.

•  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from prices that are not traded in an active market but are determined using valuation 
techniques, which make maximum use of observable market data. The Group’s level 2 financial instruments principally comprise foreign 
exchange contracts, certain debt securities and asset and mortgage backed securities. Valuation techniques may include using a broker 
quote in an inactive market or an evaluated price based on a compilation of primarily observable market information utilising information 
readily available via external sources. For funds not priced on a daily basis, the net asset value that is issued monthly or quarterly is used.

•  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include significant inputs that are not based on 

observable market data. The Group’s level 3 financial assets principally comprise holdings in pooled investment vehicles, including private 
equity funds, and holdings in property investment vehicles that operate hotel businesses. The pooled investment vehicles are measured 
in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines 2022 using the valuation technique that is most 
suitable to the applicable investment. The property investment vehicles are valued based on the expected future cash flows that could be 
generated from the underlying hotel businesses. Given the application of different valuation techniques, and as the investments are not 
homogenous in nature, there are no significant assumptions or reasonably possible alternatives that would lead to a material change in 
fair value. 

The Group’s financial liabilities categorised as level 3 principally consist of third-party liabilities related to carried interest arrangements, 
obligations arising from contingent consideration and other liabilities to purchase the remaining interest in acquired subsidiaries. 
Information about the estimates and judgements made in determining the fair value of carried interest payable is set out in note 2. 
Liabilities in respect of options to purchase the remaining interest in certain subsidiaries require judgement in determining the appropriate 
assumptions to be applied in the estimation of the fair value. The amount that will ultimately be paid in relation to an option is dependent 
on the future earnings of the subsidiary and may be subject to a cap over the enterprise value. In estimating the liability, the assumptions 
principally relate to the future earnings of the business, the market multiple applied to the earnings and the rate applied to discount the 
liability back to present value. The future earnings of the applicable subsidiaries are estimated based on cash flow forecasts specific to the 
individual business and consequently there is no one assumption that is individually material to the valuation. Market multiples are applied 
to the forecast earnings to estimate the fair value of the business. Market multiples reflect the nature of the business and take into account 
observable market transactions where appropriate. Market multiples range from 10 to 15 times earnings. An increase/decrease in market 
multiples of one would increase/decrease the financial liability by £10 million/£10 million (2022: £12 million/£12 million). Discount rates 
between 12% and 14% have been used to discount these liabilities. An increase/decrease in the discount rate of 1% would decrease/
increase the financial liability by £5 million/£5 million (2022: £9 million/£9 million). The remaining level 3 liabilities are measured using 
different valuation methodologies and assumptions, and there are no significant assumptions or reasonably possible alternatives that 
would lead to a material change in fair value.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 20239. Associates and joint ventures

Associates are entities in which the Group has an investment and over which it has significant influence, but not control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions. Joint ventures are entities in which the Group has an investment where it, along 
with one or more other shareholders, has contractually agreed to share control of the business and where the major decisions require 
the unanimous consent of the joint partners. In both cases, the Group initially records the investment at the fair value of the purchase 
consideration, including purchase-related costs. The Group’s income statement reflects its share of the entity’s profit or loss after tax and 
amortisation of intangible assets. The Group’s statement of other comprehensive income records the Group’s share of gains and losses 
arising from the entity’s financial assets at FVOCI (see note 8). The statement of financial position subsequently records the Group’s share of 
the net assets of the entity plus any goodwill and intangible assets that arose on purchase, less subsequent amortisation. The statement of 
changes in equity records the Group’s share of other equity movements of the entity. At each reporting date, the Group applies judgement 
to determine whether there is any indication that the carrying value of associates and joint ventures may be impaired.

The associates and joint ventures reserve in the statement of changes in equity represents the Group’s share of profits in its investments yet 
to be received (for example, in the form of dividends or distributions), less any amortisation of intangible assets. Certain associates are held 
within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss where permitted by the accounting standards (see note 8). Information about the 
Group’s principal associates measured at fair value is disclosed within this note.

10. Property, plant and equipment

The Group’s property, plant and equipment provides the infrastructure to enable the Group to operate and principally comprise leasehold 
improvements, freehold land and buildings, fixtures and fittings and computer equipment. Right-of-use assets in the form of leases are 
also included within property, plant and equipment (further detail is found in note 11). Assets are initially stated at cost, which includes 
expenditure associated with the acquisition. The cost of the asset is recognised in the income statement as a depreciation charge on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, with the exception of land which is assumed to have an indefinite useful life.

11. Leases

The Group’s lease arrangements primarily consist of operating leases relating to office space.

The Group initially records a lease liability in the statement of financial position reflecting the present value of the future contractual cash 
flows to be made over the lease term, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. This is the rate that the Group would have 
to pay for a loan of a similar term and with similar security to obtain an asset of similar value. A right-of-use (ROU) asset is recorded at the 
value of the lease liability plus any directly related costs and estimated future dilapidation expense and is presented within property, plant 
and equipment (see note 10) on the balance sheet. Interest is accrued on the lease liability using the effective interest method to give a 
constant rate of return over the life of the lease while the balance is reduced as lease payments are made. The ROU asset is depreciated 
from commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the ROU asset or the end of the lease term as the benefit of the 
asset is consumed. Increases or decreases that occur at contractually agreed market rent review dates are included in the lease liability 
once revised market rents have been agreed.

The Group considers whether the lease term should reflect options to extend or reduce the life of the lease. Relevant factors that could 
create an economic incentive to exercise the option are considered and the extension/termination is included if it is reasonably certain to be 
exercised. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that 
is within its control and affects the likelihood that it will exercise (or not exercise) the option. Should this occur, the Group modifies the lease 
liability and associated ROU asset to reflect the revised remaining expected cash flows.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 202312. Goodwill and intangible assets

Intangible assets (other than software) arise when the Group acquires a business and the fair value paid exceeds the fair value of the net 
tangible assets acquired. This premium reflects additional value that the Group determines to be attached to the business. Identifiable 
acquired intangible assets relating to business combinations include technology and contractual agreements to manage client assets and 
gain additional access to new or existing clients and geographies. Where such assets can be identified, they are classified as acquired 
intangible assets and amortised to the income statement within acquisition costs and related items on a straight-line basis, primarily over 
seven years.

Consideration paid to acquire a business in excess of the acquisition date fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
is known as goodwill. Goodwill is not charged to the income statement unless its value has diminished. The assessment of whether goodwill 
has become impaired is based on the expected future returns of the relevant cash-generating unit (CGU) as a whole.

Software purchased and developed for use in the business is also classified as an intangible asset. The cost of purchasing and developing 
software is taken to the income statement over time as an amortisation charge within operating expenses. The treatment is similar to that 
for property, plant and equipment, and the asset is normally amortised on a straight-line basis over three to five years, but can have an 
estimated useful life of up to ten years.

The Group completed three business combinations during the year ended 31 December 2023 for a total consideration of £18.5 million, 
resulting in £10.7 million of identifiable intangible assets and £13.2 million of Wealth Management goodwill. The Group acquired £9.3 million of 
customer contracts through Benchmark Capital that were not considered to be business combinations. £7.0 million of Wealth Management 
goodwill relates to the acquisition of Unique Financial Planning Limited. Due to the timing of this acquisition, the determination of the final 
amounts is ongoing and subject to review.

Estimates and judgements
The Group estimates the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired at the acquisition date based on forecast profits, taking account 
of synergies, derived from existing contractual arrangements. This assessment involves judgement in determining assumptions relating 
to potential future revenues, profit margins, appropriate discount rates and the expected duration of client relationships. The difference 
between the fair value of the consideration and the value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, 
is accounted for as goodwill.

At each reporting date, the Group applies judgement to determine whether there is any indication that an acquired intangible asset 
may be impaired. If any indication exists, a full assessment is undertaken. Goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis. 
If the assessment of goodwill or an acquired intangible asset determines that the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable 
amount at that time, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined using a discounted cash flow model. Any impairment is recognised in the income 
statement and cannot be reversed. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from 
that business combination. For all relevant acquisitions, the Group has determined that the lowest level CGU for Asset Management 
acquisitions is the segment. The Benchmark Capital business within Wealth Management is assessed separately from the rest of Wealth 
Management. Of the total goodwill, £1,012.3 million (2022: £1,009.6 million) is allocated to Asset Management and £242.7 million (2022: 
£230.1 million) is allocated to Wealth Management, of which £81.4 million (2022: £68.2 million) relates to Benchmark Capital.

12. Goodwill and intangible assets continued

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations applying a discounted cash flow model using the 
Group’s five-year strategic business plan cash flows. The key assumptions on which the Group’s cash flow projections are based include 
long-term market growth rates of 2% per annum (2022: 2%), a pre-tax discount rate of 13% (2022: 12%), expected flows and expected 
changes to revenue margins. The results of the calculations indicate that goodwill is not impaired.

Movements in the growth rate and/or the discount rate of 1% would not lead to any impairment. This is due to the amount of goodwill 
allocated to the relevant CGU relative to the size of the relevant future profitability estimate. A comparison of actual results to the projected 
results used to assess goodwill impairment in prior years shows that the Group would have recognised no changes (2022: nil) to its goodwill 
asset in the year as a result of inaccurate projections.

The recoverable amount of acquired intangible assets is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and the updated discounted valuation 
of the remaining net residual income stream. Any impairment is recognised in the income statement but may be reversed if relevant 
conditions improve.

13. Deferred tax

Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent amounts of tax that will become recoverable and payable in future accounting periods. 
They arise as a result of temporary differences, where the time at which profits and losses are recognised for tax purposes differs from the 
time at which the relevant transaction is recorded. A deferred tax asset represents a tax reduction that is expected to arise in a future period 
based on past transactions. A deferred tax liability represents taxes that will become payable in a future period as a result of current or 
prior year transactions.

Deferred tax liabilities also arise on certain acquisitions where the amortisation of the acquired intangible asset does not result in a tax 
deduction. The deferred tax liability is established on acquisition and is released to the income statement to match the intangible asset 
amortisation. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the year-end date.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 202313. Deferred tax continued
Following the 2021 Budget, the UK tax rate increased to 25% from April 2023. This results in a blended tax rate applicable to the UK Group 
for 2023 of 23.5%.

Included in the deferred tax asset is an asset relating to UK tax deductions for share-based remuneration which is dependent on the prices 
of the Company’s ordinary shares at the time the awards are exercised.

A deferred tax asset of £9.9 million (2022: £9.7 million) relating to £39.9 million of realised capital losses has not been recognised as there 
is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable gains in the future against which the deferred tax asset could be utilised.

A deferred tax asset of £28.0 million (2022: £26.5 million) relating to £117.2 million of losses, including unrealised capital losses, and other 
temporary differences has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which these 
losses and temporary differences can be utilised.

The mandatory IAS 12 temporary exception from the recognition and disclosure of deferred taxes arising from implementation of the OECD’s 
Pillar Two model rules has been applied. The OECD’s Pillar Two model rules, which establish a global minimum tax regime, will apply from 2024. 
This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s tax expense.

After offsetting deferred tax assets and liabilities where appropriate within territories, the net deferred tax asset comprises:

14. Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities

The Group operates a unit-linked life assurance business through the wholly owned subsidiary Schroder Pension Management Limited 
(the Life Company). The Life Company provides unit-linked investment products through a life assurance wrapper. The investment products 
do not provide cover for insurance risk and are therefore recognised and accounted for as financial instruments and presented as financial 
liabilities due to Life Company investors (policyholders) within unit-linked liabilities. The financial risks of these products are largely borne by 
the third-party investors, consistent with other investment products managed by the Group. However, since the Life Company, which is a 
subsidiary, issues the investment instrument and holds the relevant financial assets, both the investments and the third-party obligations 
are recorded in the statement of financial position.

The investment product is almost identical to a unit trust. As it is a life assurance product, the contractual rights and obligations of the 
investments remain with the Group and the AUM is therefore included on the statement of financial position, together with the liability 
to investors. The Group earns fee income from managing the investment, which is included in revenue.

Financial assets held by the Life Company are measured at FVTPL. Other balances include cash and receivables, which are measured at 
amortised cost (see note 8). The unit-linked liabilities are measured at FVTPL to avoid an accounting mismatch. The Life Company’s assets 
are regarded as current assets as they represent the amount available to Life Company investors (or third party investors in consolidated 
funds) who are able to withdraw their funds on call, subject to certain restrictions in the case of illiquidity. Gains and losses from assets held 
to cover investor obligations are attributable to investors in the Life Company or to third party investors in the funds. As a result, any gain or 
loss is offset by a change in the obligation to investors.

1.  In accordance with the accounting standards, the Group is deemed to hold a controlling interest in certain funds as a result of the investments held by the Life Company. 
This results in all of the assets and liabilities of those funds being consolidated within the statement of financial position and the third party interest in the fund being 
recorded as a financial liability due to third party investors. 

The Group has no primary exposure to market risk, credit risk or liquidity risk in relation to the investments due to Life Company investors. The 
risks and rewards associated with its investments are borne by the investors in the Life Company’s investment products or third party investors 
in the funds and not by the Life Company itself. Consequently, no further financial instrument risk disclosures are included.

Estimates and judgements – fair value measurements
Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy (see note 8). Level 1 investments principally 
comprise quoted equities, investments in pooled investment vehicles, government debt and exchange-traded derivatives. Level 2 
investments principally comprise debt securities such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments principally 
comprise investments in private equity funds. There are no assumptions that are individually significant or reasonably possible alternatives 
that would lead to a material change in the fair value of these assets.

Trade and other payables include amounts the Group is due to pay in the normal course of business, accruals and deferred income 
(being fees received in advance of services provided as well as deferred cash awards), and bullion deposits by customers. Trade and other 
payables, other than deferred cash awards and bullion deposits, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost (see 
note 8). Amounts due to be paid by the Group in the normal course of business are made up of creditors and accruals. Accruals represent 
costs, including remuneration, that are not yet billed or due for payment, but for which the goods or services have been received. Deferred 
cash awards (being deferred employee remuneration payable in cash) and bullion deposits by customers are recorded at fair value.

1.  Settlement accounts are generally settled within four working days (2022: four working days) and trade creditors have an average settlement period of 18 working days 

(2022: 24 working days).

16. Provisions and contingent liabilities

Provisions are liabilities where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount of settlement and therefore they usually require the use of 
estimates. They are recognised when three conditions are fulfilled: when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as 
a result of a past event; when it is probable that the Group will incur a loss in order to settle the obligation; and when a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation. They are recorded at the Group’s best estimate of the cost of settling the obligation. Any 
differences between those estimates and the amounts for which the Group actually becomes liable are taken to the income statement 
as additional charges where the Group has underestimated and credits where the Group has overestimated. Where the estimated timing 
and settlement are longer term, the amount is discounted using a rate reflecting specific risks associated with the provision.

Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities, which could include a dependency on events not within the Group’s control, but where there is a 
possible obligation. Contingent liabilities are disclosed only where significant and are not included within the statement of financial position.

Dilapidation provisions associated with the Group’s office leases have a weighted average maturity of 12 years (2022: 13 years).

Legal and regulatory obligations associated with the Group’s business arise from past events that are estimated to crystallise mainly within 
two years (2022: two years). These matters are ongoing.

Estimates and judgements
The timing and amount of settlement of each legal claim or potential claim, regulatory matter and constructive obligation are uncertain. 
The Group applies judgement to determine whether a provision is required. The Group performs an assessment of the timing and 
amount of each event and reviews this assessment periodically. For some provisions there is greater certainty as the cash flows have largely 
been determined. Potential legal claims, regulatory related costs and other obligations to third parties arise as a consequence of normal 
business activity. They can arise from actual or alleged breaches of obligations and may be covered by the Group’s insurance arrangements, 
but subject to insurance excess. In certain circumstances, legal and regulatory claims can arise despite there being no error or breach. The 
Group’s risk management and compliance procedures are designed to mitigate, but are not able to eliminate, the risk of losses occurring. 
Where such claims and costs arise there is often uncertainty over whether a payment will be required and estimation is required in 
determining the quantum and timing of that payment. As a result, there is also uncertainty over the timing and amount of any insurance 
recovery, although this does not change the likelihood of insurance cover being available, where applicable. The Group makes periodic 
assessments of all cash flows, including taking external advice where appropriate, to determine an appropriate provision. Some matters 
may be settled through commercial negotiation as well as being covered in whole or in part by the Group’s insurance arrangements. The 
Group has made provisions based on the reasonable expectation of likely outflows. The inherent uncertainty in such matters and the results 
of negotiations and insurance cover may result in different outcomes.

There are no key judgements or estimates that would result in any additional material provisions being recognised or any material 
contingent liabilities being disclosed in the financial statements (2022: none). The provisions included in the financial statements at 
31 December 2023 are based on estimates of reasonable ranges of likely outcomes, applying assumptions regarding the probability 
of payments being due and the settlement value. The aggregate reasonable ranges have been assessed as not materially different 
to the carrying values.

The Group holds derivatives for risk management, client facilitation and within its consolidated structured entities to provide exposure to 
market returns. The Group most commonly uses forward foreign exchange contracts, where it agrees to buy or sell specified amounts of 
a named currency at a future date, allowing the Group to effectively fix exchange rates so that it can avoid unpredictable gains and losses 
on financial instruments in foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Group uses futures, total return swaps and credit default swaps to 
hedge market-related gains and losses on its seed capital investments where the purpose of investing is to help establish a new product 
rather than gain additional market exposure. Interest rate contracts are used to hedge exposures to fixed or floating rates of interest.

The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. In these scenarios, and where relevant 
conditions are met, hedge accounting is applied and the Group formally documents the relationship between the derivative and any 
hedged item, its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the various hedging transactions. It also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are 
highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items. In respect of hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, 
the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income. The Group’s net investment hedges are generally fully effective, but any ineffective portion that may arise 
is recognised in the income statement. On disposal of the foreign operation, together with the hedged gain or loss, the cumulative 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument is transferred to the income statement.

(a) The Group’s use of derivatives continued
Risk management: The Group actively seeks to limit and manage its exposures to risk where those exposures are not desired by the Group. 
This may take the form of unwanted exposures to a particular currency, type of interest rate or other price risk. By entering into derivative 
contracts, the Group is able to mitigate or eliminate such exposures. The principal risks that the Group faces through such use of derivative 
contracts are credit risk and liquidity risk.

Client facilitation: The Group’s Wealth Management entities are involved in providing portfolio management, banking and investment 
advisory services, primarily to private clients. In carrying out this business, they transact as agent or as principal in financial assets and liabilities 
(including derivatives) in order to facilitate client portfolio requirements. Wealth Management’s policy is to hedge, as appropriate, market risk 
on its client facilitation positions. This does not eliminate credit risk.

For details of how the Group manages its exposure to credit risk, see below and note 18.

(b) Derivatives used by the Group
Forwards are contractual obligations to buy or sell foreign currency on a future date at a specified exchange rate. The maximum exposure 
to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.

Currency, interest rate, total return and credit default swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another. Swaps result 
in an economic exchange of currencies, interest rates or total returns (for example, fixed rate for floating rate) or a combination of these 
(i.e. cross-currency interest rate swaps). No exchange of principal takes place, except in the case of certain currency swaps. The Group’s credit 
risk represents the potential cost of replacing the swap contracts if counterparties fail to perform their obligations. This risk is monitored on an 
ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, the proportion of the notional amount of the contracts, and the liquidity of the market. 
To control the level of credit risk taken, the Group assesses counterparties in accordance with its internal policies and procedures.

Futures contracts are standardised contracts to buy or sell specified assets for an agreed price at a specified future date. Contracts are 
negotiated at a futures exchange, which acts as an intermediary between the two parties. For futures contracts, the maximum exposure 
to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.

The fair value of derivative instruments becomes favourable (assets) or unfavourable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market interest 
rates, indices, foreign exchange rates and other relevant variables relative to their terms. The aggregate contractual amount of derivative 
financial instruments held, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable, and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative 
financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time. The fair values and contractual maturities are set out below:

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 202318. Financial instrument risk management

The Group Capital Committee is responsible for the management of the Group’s capital and sets objectives for how it is deployed. This note 
explains how the Group manages its capital, setting out the nature of the risks the Group faces as a result of its operations, and how these 
risks are quantified and managed.

The Group is exposed to different forms of financial instrument risk including: (i) the risk that money owed to the Group will not be received 
(credit risk); (ii) the risk that the Group may not have sufficient cash available to pay its creditors as they fall due (liquidity risk); and (iii) the risk 
that the value of assets will fluctuate as a result of movements in factors such as market prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
(market risk). The management of such risks is embedded in managerial responsibilities fundamental to the wellbeing of the Group.

The Group’s primary exposure to financial instrument risk is derived from the financial instruments that it holds as principal. In addition, 
due to the nature of the business, the Group’s exposure extends to the impact on investment management and other fees that are 
determined on the basis of a percentage of AUM and are therefore impacted by the financial instrument risk exposure of our clients – the 
secondary exposure. This note deals only with the direct or primary exposure of the risks from the Group’s holding of financial instruments.

Disclosures relating to unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities are included in note 14.

(a) Capital
The Group’s approach to capital management is to maintain a strong capital position to enable it to invest in the future of the Group, in line 
with its strategy, and to support the risks inherent in conducting its business. Capital management is an important part of the Group’s risk 
management framework and is underpinned by the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). The ICAAP considers the relevant 
current and future risks to the business and the capital considered necessary to support these risks. The Group actively monitors its capital 
base to ensure that it maintains sufficient and appropriate capital resources to cover the relevant risks to the business and to meet 
consolidated and local regulatory and working capital requirements.

The Group’s lead regulator is the Prudential Regulation Authority as the Group includes an entity with a UK banking licence. The Group is 
required to maintain adequate capital resources to meet its Total Capital Requirement (TCR) of £1,059 million (2022: £1,022 million). The TCR 
incorporates the Group’s Pillar 1 regulatory capital requirement of £893 million (2022: £862 million). In addition to the TCR of the banking 
group, the Group is required to hold additional capital of £384 million (2022: £323 million) in respect of its insurance companies and 
regulatory buffers. The Group’s overall regulatory capital requirement was £1,443 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: £1,346 million).

In managing the Group’s capital position, the Group considers the composition of the capital base, which consists of: working capital deployed 
to support the Group’s general operating activities and regulatory requirements; investment capital held in excess of these operating 
requirements; and other items that are not investable or otherwise available to meet the Group’s operating or regulatory requirements.

The table below shows the components of our capital position:

(i) Working capital
The Group’s policy is for subsidiaries to hold sufficient working capital to meet their regulatory and other operating requirements. Operating 
capital principally comprises cash and cash equivalents and other low-risk financial instruments, as well as financial instruments held to hedge 
fair value movements on certain deferred fund awards. Local regulators oversee the activities of, and impose minimum capital and liquidity 
requirements on, certain Group operating entities. The Group complied with all externally imposed regulatory capital requirements during 
the year.

Working capital is also deployed through certain subsidiaries to support new investment strategies and growth opportunities and to co-invest 
alongside the Group’s clients.

(a) Capital continued

(ii) Investment capital
Available capital held in excess of working capital requirements is transferred to investment capital. Investment capital is managed with the aim 
of achieving a low-volatility return. Liquid investments are available to support the organic development of existing and new business strategies 
and to respond to other investment and growth opportunities, such as acquisitions, as they arise. Investment capital also includes certain 
commercial private equity investments and illiquid legacy investments.

(iii) Other items
Other items comprise assets that are not investable or available to meet the Group’s general operating or regulatory requirements. It includes 
assets that are actually or potentially inadmissible for regulatory capital purposes, principally goodwill, intangible assets, non-controlling 
interest in certain subsidiaries and pension scheme surplus.

(b) Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk
The Group is exposed to credit, liquidity and market risk as a result of the financial instruments it holds. Settlement of financial instruments 
(on both a principal and agency basis) also gives rise to operational risk. The Group’s risk management framework is critical to effective 
management of these risks and considerable resources are dedicated to this area. Risk management is the direct responsibility of the 
Board, with responsibility for oversight delegated to the Audit and Risk Committee. The Group applies the three lines of defence model to 
risk management, which includes financial instrument risk. More details on the risk management framework and approach are set out in the 
Risk Management report and the Audit and Risk Committee report on pages 38 and 66 respectively.

(i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument, loan or commitment will cause the Group financial loss by failing to discharge 
its obligations. For this purpose, the impact on fair value of a credit loss arising from credit spread price changes in a portfolio of investments is 
excluded. This risk is addressed within pricing risk.

18. Financial instrument risk management continued
(b) Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk continued

(i) Credit risk continued
The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where it is exposed to the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay 
amounts when due. The Group carefully manages its exposure to credit risk by monitoring exposures to individual counterparties and sectors, 
monitoring counterparties’ creditworthiness, taking collateral and reducing settlement risk where possible and approving lending policies that 
specify the type of acceptable collateral and lending margins. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the gross 
carrying value of its financial assets.

Externally published credit ratings are indicators of the level of credit risk associated with a counterparty. A breakdown of the Group’s relevant 
financial assets held with rated and unrated counterparties is set out below:

Expected credit losses are calculated on all of the Group’s financial assets that are measured at amortised cost and all debt instruments that 
are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Factors considered in determining whether a default has taken place include 
how many days past the due date a payment is, deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty, and knowledge of specific events that could 
influence a counterparty’s ability to pay.

A three stage model is used for calculating expected credit losses, which requires financial assets to be assessed as:

•  Performing (stage 1) – financial assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since original recognition; 

•  Under-performing (stage 2) – financial assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition,  

but no default; or,

•  Non-performing (stage 3) – financial assets that are in default.

For financial assets in stage 1, expected credit losses are calculated based on the credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the 
following 12-month period. For financial assets in stages 2 and 3, expected credit losses are calculated based on credit losses expected to 
be incurred over the life of the instrument. The Group applies the simplified approach to calculate expected credit losses for trade and other 
receivables. Under this approach, instruments are not categorised into three stages and expected credit losses are calculated based on the life 
of the instrument.

Wealth Management activities
All client credit requests are presented to the relevant Wealth Management approval authorities and counterparty exposures are monitored 
daily against limits. Loans, overdrafts and advances to clients, as well as certain derivative positions, are secured on a range of assets including 
real estate (both residential and commercial), cash, client portfolios and investment bonds.

The Group does not usually provide loans, overdrafts or advances to clients on an unsecured basis. Where disposal of non-cash collateral is 
required, in the event of default, the terms and conditions relevant to the specific contract and country will apply. Portfolios held as collateral 
are marked to market daily and positions compared to clients’ exposures. Credit limits are set following an assessment of the market value and 
lending value of each type of collateral, depending on the perceived risk associated with the collateral. Clients are contacted if these limits are 
expected to be or are breached, or if collateral is not sufficient to cover the outstanding exposure.

The collateral accepted by the Group includes certain investment-grade securities that can be sold or repledged without default of the provider. 
At 31 December 2023, the fair value of collateral that could be sold or repledged but had not been, relating solely to these arrangements, was 
£1,107.6 million (2022: £813.4 million).

Policies covering various counterparty and market risk limits are set and monitored by the relevant Wealth Management asset and liability 
management committees. All instruments held within the Wealth Management treasury book have an investment-grade credit rating.

(b) Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk continued

(i) Credit risk continued
Wealth Management takes a conservative approach to its treasury investments, placing them with, or purchasing debt securities issued by, 
UK and overseas banks and corporates, central banks, supranational banks and sovereigns.

Expected credit losses on financial assets at amortised cost within the Wealth Management entities at 31 December 2023 were £1.0 million 
(2022: £0.3 million). There were no (2022: none) under-performing (stage 2) loans and advances to clients. There was one (2022: none)
non-performing (stage 3) loan of £6.2 million giving rise to £0.5 million expected credit losses (2022: nil). All other financial assets at amortised 
cost (excluding trade and other receivables to which the three stage model is not applied) were performing (stage 1) (2022: same).

Expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income within the Wealth Management entities 
at 31 December 2023 were £0.2 million (2022: £0.1 million). All financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income were 
performing (stage 1) (2022: same).

Other activities
Fee debtors and other receivables arise as a result of the Group’s asset management activities and amounts are monitored regularly. 
Historically, default levels have been insignificant and, unless a client has withdrawn its funds, there is an ongoing relationship between 
the Group and the client.

Fee debtors past due but not in default as at 31 December 2023 were £50.8 million (2022: £70.0 million), the majority of which were less than 
90 days past due (2022: less than 90 days).

The Group seeks to manage its exposure to credit risk arising from debt securities and derivatives within the investment portfolio by adopting 
a conservative approach and through ongoing credit analysis, and it may hedge some of the credit risk with credit default swaps. Corporate 
bond portfolios, when in place, have an investment-grade mandate, and exposure to sub-investment-grade debt is low.

Most derivative positions, other than forward foreign exchange contracts and total return swaps, are taken in exchange-traded securities where 
there is minimal credit risk. Forward foreign exchange positions generally have a maturity between one and three months.

The Group’s cash and cash equivalents in the non-Wealth Management entities are held primarily in current accounts, on deposit with 
well-rated banks, or invested in money market or similar funds.

Expected credit losses on financial assets at amortised cost within non-Wealth Management entities at 31 December 2023 were £0.6 million 
(2022: £0.8 million). All financial assets at amortised cost (excluding trade and other receivables to which the three stage model is not applied) 
were performing (stage 1) (2022: same).

(ii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost. The Group has a clearly defined 
liquidity risk management framework in place in the form of a Consolidated Group Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). 
The Group policy is that its subsidiaries should trade solvently, comply with regulatory liquidity requirements and have access to adequate 
liquidity for all activities undertaken in the normal course of business. As part of its ILAAP, the Group performs stress testing to confirm that 
sufficient liquidity is available to cover severe but plausible stress events. 

Wealth Management activities
The principal liquidity risk in the Group’s Wealth Management business arises as a result of its banking activities, where the timing of cash flows 
from liabilities relating to client accounts can be impacted by client action. The objective of the Group’s liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient 
liquidity within the relevant entities to meet regulatory and prudential requirements, and to cover cash flow imbalances and fluctuations in 
funding and the timely repayment of funds to depositors.

Liquidity positions are actively monitored against both regulatory and internal limits and cash flows are managed so that sufficient liquidity 
is available to cover potential liquidity risks.

Other activities
The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk outside its Wealth Management activities is low. Excluding the Life Company and consolidated funds, the 
Asset Management segment along with the Group’s investment capital and treasury management activities together hold cash and 
cash equivalents of £832.9 million (2022: £897.6 million). Financial liabilities relating to other operating entities are £373.2 million (2022: 
£536.6 million).

The Group has a committed revolving credit facility of £850.0 million (2022: £850.0 million), which expires on 7 November 2028. The maximum 
amount drawn down under the facility was £180.0 million (2022: £225.0 million). The facility was undrawn at 31 December 2023 (2022: undrawn).

(iii) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the value of assets will fluctuate as a result of movements in factors such as market prices, interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates.

Pricing risk
Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other 
than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk. 

In respect of financial instrument risk, the Group’s exposure to pricing risk is principally through investments held in investment capital, seed 
and co-investment capital and deferred employee compensation in the form of fund awards.

18. Financial instrument risk management continued
(b) Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk continued

(iii) Market risk continued

Pricing risk continued
The Group does not hedge exposures to pricing risk except in relation to seed capital, where it is practical to do so, and in respect of deferred 
employee compensation awards, where these can be matched by interests in funds managed by the Group. Where financial instruments are 
held to hedge deferred compensation awards, movements in the fair value of the asset are normally offset by changes in the amounts payable 
to employees (see note 3).

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates.

Wealth Management activities
In Wealth Management, interest rate risk is monitored on a daily basis against policies and limits set by the relevant risk committee. 
Interest rate risk is managed within set limits by matching asset and liability positions and through the use of interest rate swaps.

Sensitivity-based and stress-based models are used for monitoring interest rate risk. These models assess the impact of a prescribed shift 
in interest rates and the potential impact of severe but plausible stress scenarios.

Other activities
Cash held by the other operating companies is not normally expected to be placed on deposit for longer than three months and is not exposed 
to significant interest rate risk.

The Group’s capital can include investments in corporate investment-grade bonds managed by the Group’s fixed income fund managers. 
The market risk (including interest rate risk) exposure of these investments is actively monitored against limits set by the Board.

Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates.

Wealth Management activities
In Wealth Management, foreign exchange risk is monitored each day against policies and limits set by the relevant risk committees. 
Foreign exchange risk is managed within set limits by the treasury departments using spot, forward and foreign exchange swap contracts. 

Other activities
The Group’s policy in relation to foreign exchange risks arising from revenue, expenditure and capital currency exposure from its Asset 
Management activities is generally not to hedge. The Group’s revenue is earned and expenditure incurred in many currencies and the resulting 
exposure is considered to be a normal part of the Group’s business activities. 

The Group also has exposure to foreign currency on financial instruments not held in the functional currency of entities which resulted in a 
£19.0 million gain in the income statement (2022: £37.7 million loss) and exposure arising from net investments in foreign operations which 
resulted in a £58.3 million loss in other comprehensive income (2022: £148.6 million gain). The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts 
with third parties to mitigate some of these exposures. The gain or loss on these contracts is included in the income statement or statement of 
other comprehensive income, as appropriate. The use of such instruments is subject to approval by the Group Capital Committee.

19. Share capital and share premium

Share capital primarily comprises the number of issued ordinary shares in Schroders plc multiplied by their nominal value of 20 pence each 
(2022: 20 pence each). Where the proceeds received on issue of the shares is greater than the nominal value the difference is recorded in 
share premium. The Company has authority to buyback ordinary shares, restricted by minimum and maximum price caps and a maximum 
number of shares. Any ordinary shares bought back may be cancelled or held in treasury. Unless renewed, authority will expire at the 
Company’s next annual general meeting, or on 30 June 2024 if earlier.

On 20 September 2022, the Company completed the simplification of its dual share class structure. All non-voting ordinary shares were 
re-designated as ordinary shares with full voting rights (Enfranchisement); holders of existing ordinary shares received a bonus issue of three 
additional ordinary shares for every seventeen held (Compensatory Bonus Issue). Following the Enfranchisement and Compensatory Bonus 
Issue, each ordinary share of £1 was sub-divided into five ordinary shares of 20 pence (Sub-Division). 

The Compensatory Bonus Issue resulted in the Company’s share capital increasing by £39.9 million. All 39.9 million bonus shares were fully 
paid at their nominal value of £1 from the Company’s share premium account.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 202320. Own shares

Own shares are recorded by the Group when ordinary shares are acquired by the Company or acquired through employee benefit trusts. 
This enables the Group to hold some of its shares to settle option exercises or for other permitted purposes. Own shares are held at cost 
and their purchase reduces the Group’s net assets by the amount spent. When shares vest unconditionally or are cancelled, they are 
transferred from own shares to the profit and loss reserve at their weighted average cost.

23. Retirement benefit obligations

The Group has two principal types of pension benefit for employees: defined benefit (DB), where the Group has an obligation to provide 
participating employees with pension payments that represent a specified percentage of their final salary for each year of service, and 
defined contribution (DC), where the Group’s contribution to an employee’s pension is measured as, and limited to, a specified percentage 
of salary.

Accounting for DB schemes requires an assessment of the likely quantum of future pension payments to be made. If ring-fenced assets are 
held specifically to meet this cost, the scheme is funded, and if not, it is unfunded. The Group periodically reviews its funded DB schemes 
using actuarial specialists to assess whether it is on course to meet the expected pension payments that current and former employees are, 
or will be, entitled to. In the case of a projected shortfall, a plan must be formulated to reverse the deficit.

The income statement charge or credit represents the sum of pension entitlements earned by employees in the period, plus a notional 
net interest charge (if the scheme is in deficit) or income (if it is in surplus) based on the market yields on high quality corporate bonds. 
Experience differences, principally the difference between actual investment returns and the notional interest amount, as well as actuarial 
changes in estimating the present value of future liabilities, are recorded in other comprehensive income.

Assets or liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position represent the differences between the fair value of plan assets (if any) 
and the actuarially determined estimates of the present value of future liabilities. The Group closed its largest DB scheme to future accrual 
on 30 April 2011, although it still operates some small unfunded schemes overseas. This means that no future service will contribute to the 
closed scheme member benefits but those members continue to have the benefits determined by the Scheme rules as at 30 April 2011.

The Group’s exposure to funding DC pension schemes is limited to the contributions it has agreed to make. These contributions generally 
stop when employment ceases. The income statement charge represents the contributions the Group has agreed to make into employees’ 
pension schemes in that year.

The disclosures within this note are provided mainly in respect of the principal DB scheme, which is the DB section of the funded Schroders 
Retirement Benefits Scheme (the Scheme).

The income statement charge for retirement benefit costs is as follows:

(a) Profile of the Scheme
The Scheme is administered by a trustee company, Schroder Pension Trustee Limited (the Trustee). The board of the Trustee comprises 
an independent chairman, three directors appointed by the employer and two directors elected by the Scheme members. The Trustee is 
required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and is responsible for setting the investment strategy and for the day-to-day 
administration of the benefits. The Trustee’s investment committee comprises five of the Trustee directors and two representatives of the 
Group. This committee, which reports to the Trustee board, is responsible for making investment strategy recommendations to the board 
of the Trustee and for monitoring the performance of the investment manager.

Under the Scheme, employees are entitled to annual pensions on retirement based on a specified percentage of their final pensionable salary 
or, in the case of active members at 30 April 2011 (the date the DB section of the Scheme closed for future accrual), actual pensionable salaries 
at that date, for each year of service. These benefits are adjusted for the effects of inflation, subject to a cap of 2.5% for pensions accrued after 
12 August 2007 and 5.0% for pensions accrued before that date.

As at 31 December 2023, there were no active members in the DB section (2022: nil) and 2,605 active members in the DC section (2022: 2,572). 
The weighted average duration of the Scheme’s DB obligation is 13 years (2022: 13 years). The Group expects that the plan liabilities will settle 
gradually over time until all members have left the plan. On termination of the Scheme, any assets that remain after the Trustee has settled the 
Scheme’s liabilities will be returned to the Group.

(b) Funding requirements
The last completed triennial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2020. The funding level at that date was 107% on the 
technical provisions basis and no contribution to the Scheme was required. The next triennial valuation is due as at 31 December 2023 and will 
be performed in 2024.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 202323. Retirement benefit obligations continued
(c) Risks of the Scheme
The Company and the Trustee have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate. This includes an asset-
liability matching policy that aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the Scheme by investing in assets that perform in line with the 
liabilities of the Scheme.

The most significant risks to which the Scheme exposes the Group are:

Asset volatility
The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If assets underperform this yield, this will reduce 
the surplus or may create a deficit. The Group manages this risk by holding 67% (2022: 51%) of Scheme assets in a liability matching portfolio 
and the remainder in growth assets such as the Schroder Life Diversified Growth Fund. This asset mix is designed to provide returns that match 
or exceed the unwinding of the discount rate in the long term, but that can create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth 
assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Scheme’s long-term objectives.

Credit risk
The assets of the Scheme include liability driven investments (LDI) and other fixed income instruments that expose the Group to credit risk. 
A significant amount of this exposure is to the UK Government as a result of holding gilts and bonds guaranteed by the UK Government. 
Other instruments held include derivatives, which are collateralised daily to cover unrealised gains or losses. The minimum rating for any 
derivatives counterparty is BBB.

Interest rate risk
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Scheme’s liabilities for accounting purposes, although this should be 
partially offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme’s liability matching portfolio, which comprises gilts, corporate bonds and other LDI 
instruments. The liability matching investments have been designed to mitigate interest rate exposures measured on a funding rather than 
an accounting basis. One of the principal differences between these bases is that the liability under the funding basis is calculated using a 
discount rate set with reference to gilt yields; the latter uses corporate bond yields. As a result, the liability matching portfolio hedges against 
interest rate risk by purchasing instruments that seek to replicate movements in gilt yields rather than corporate bond yields. Movements in the 
different types of instrument are not exactly correlated, and it is therefore likely that a tracking error can arise when assessing whether the 
liability matching portfolio has provided an effective hedge against interest rate risk on an accounting basis. At 31 December 2023, the liability 
matching portfolio was designed to mitigate 95% (2022: 90%) of the Scheme’s exposure to changes in gilt yields.

Inflation risk
A significant proportion of the Scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. However, 
in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place. The majority of the growth assets are either unaffected by or not closely 
correlated with inflation, which means that an increase in inflation will also decrease any Scheme surplus. The liability matching portfolio 
includes instruments such as index-linked gilts to provide protection against inflation risk. At 31 December 2023, the liability matching portfolio 
was designed to mitigate 95% (2022: 90%) of the Scheme’s exposure to inflation risk.

Life expectancy
The majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the liability.

(d) Reporting at 31 December
The principal financial assumptions used for the Scheme are:

Discount rate

Net interest income is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening net surplus in the Scheme. The Group determines the 
appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of estimated future cash 
outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the 
interest rates of high quality, long dated corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid.

Estimates and judgements
The Group estimates the carrying value of the Scheme by applying judgement to determine the assumptions as set out on page 145, 
used to calculate the valuation of the pension obligation using member data and applying the Scheme rules. The Scheme assets are 
mainly quoted in an active market. The sensitivity to those assumptions is set out below. The most significant judgemental assumption 
relates to mortality rates, which are inherently uncertain. The Group’s mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables with 
Continuous Mortality Investigation core projection factors and a long-term rate of mortality improvement of 1.0% (2022: 1.0%) per annum. 
An additional adjustment, an “A parameter” set to 0.25% (2022: 0.25%) per annum, allows for the typically higher rate of mortality 
improvement among members of the Scheme compared with general population statistics. The latest base mortality tables have been 
adopted with no scaling (2022: nil) following a Scheme specific review of the membership data. 

The Group reviews its assumptions annually in conjunction with its independent actuaries and considers this adjustment appropriate given 
the geographic and demographic profile of Scheme members. Other assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current 
market conditions.

The financial impact of the Scheme on the Group has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, Aon Solutions UK Limited, and is 
based on an assessment of the Scheme as at 31 December 2023.

The amounts recognised in the income statement are:

Interest income on Scheme assets

Interest cost on Scheme liabilities
Net interest income recognised in the income statement in respect of the Scheme

Income statement charge in respect of other defined benefit schemes
Total defined benefit schemes income statement credit

The amounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are:

(Gains)/losses on Scheme assets in excess of that recognised in interest income

Actuarial gains due to change in demographic assumptions

Actuarial losses/(gains) due to change in financial assumptions

Actuarial losses due to experience
Total other comprehensive loss in respect of the Scheme

Other comprehensive loss in respect of other defined benefit schemes

1.  Following the last completed triennial valuation it was agreed that certain administrative expenses of the scheme would be paid out of the scheme surplus.  

The approach will be reviewed as part of the next triennial valuation. 

On 16 June 2023, the High Court issued a ruling in respect of Virgin Media v NTL Pension Trustees II Limited (and others), which has the 
potential to affect the Scheme’s liabilities. As the assessment of any potential impact is ongoing, no adjustment has been made to the Scheme’s 
liability as at 31 December 2023.

The Group has not materially changed the basis of any of the principal financial assumptions underlying the calculation of the Scheme’s 
net financial position during 2023, although such assumptions have been amended where applicable to reflect current market conditions 
and expectations.

24. Share-based payments

Share-based payments are remuneration payments to selected employees that take the form of an award of shares in Schroders plc. 
Employees are generally not able to exercise such awards in full until three years after the award has been made, although conditions vary 
between different types of award. The accounting for share-based awards settled by transferring shares to the employees (equity-settled) 
differs from the accounting for similar awards settled in cash (cash-settled). The charge for equity-settled share-based payments is 
determined based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. Such awards can include share awards that may or may not have 
performance criteria. The initial fair value of the award takes into account the current value of shares expected to be issued (i.e. estimates 
of the likely levels of forfeiture and achievement of performance criteria), and the contribution, if required, by the employee. This initial fair 
value is charged to the income statement reflecting benefits received from employment, where relevant, in the performance period and 
over the vesting period. The income statement charge is offset by a credit to the statement of changes in equity, where the award is 
expected to be settled through the issue of shares. Such awards constituted 5.9% (2022: 6.8%) of salaries, wages and other remuneration 
(see note 3).

The Group may make share-based payments to employees through awards over or linked to the value of ordinary shares and by the grant 
of market value share options over ordinary shares. These arrangements involve a maximum term of ten years.

It is the Group’s practice to hedge all awards to eliminate the impact of changes in the market value of shares between the grant date and 
the exercise date.

Awards that lapse or are forfeited during the vesting period result in a credit to the income statement (reversing the previous charge) in the 
year in which they lapse or are forfeited.

The Group recognised total expenses of £64.0 million (2022: £68.1 million) arising from share-based payment transactions during the year, 
of which £62.8 million (2022: £68.2 million) were equity-settled share-based payment transactions. In 2023, there was £0.7 million of equity-
settled share-based payments included within acquisition costs and related items (2022: £1.1 million) and £5.0 million included within 
restructuring costs (2022: nil).

The Group has the following share-based payment arrangements (further details of the current schemes may be found in the 
Remuneration report):

(a) Deferred Award Plan

Awards over ordinary shares made under the Group’s Deferred Award Plan are charged at fair value as operating expenses in the income 
statement. Fair value is determined at the date of grant and is equal to the market value of the shares at that time. The fair value charges, 
adjusted to reflect actual levels of vesting, are spread over the performance period and the vesting periods of the awards. Awards are 
structured as nil-cost options.

statement, over a five-year vesting period. Fair value is determined at the date of grant and is equal to the market value of the shares at that 
time. Awards are structured as nil-cost options.

Awards over ordinary shares made under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan are charged at fair value to the income statement over a 
four-year vesting period. Fair value is calculated using the market value of the shares at the grant date, discounted for dividends forgone 
over the vesting period of the award and adjusted based on an estimate at the year-end date of the extent to which the performance 
conditions are expected to be met. Awards are structured as nil-cost options.

The employee monthly share purchase plan is open to UK permanent employees and provides free shares from the Group to match 
the employee purchase of shares up to a maximum of £100 per month. The shares vest after one year.

Pursuant to this plan, the Group purchased 624,714 ordinary shares in 2023 (2022: 235,042). A charge of £2.5 million (2022: £2.4 million) 
was recognised during the year.

(f) Cash-settled share-based awards

Certain employees have been awarded cash-settled equivalents to these share-based awards. The fair value of these awards is determined 
using the same methods and models used to value the equivalent equity-settled awards. The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each 
balance sheet date and at settlement date.

At 31 December 2023, the carrying value of liabilities arising from cash-settled share-based awards was £5.8 million (2022: £4.8 million).  
The total intrinsic value at 31 December 2023 of liabilities for which the employee’s right to cash or other assets had vested by that date was  
£3.1 million (2022: £2.7 million).

A charge of £1.2 million (2022: credit of £0.1 million) was recognised during the year. The liability was remeasured at the balance sheet date at 
a share price of £4.30 (2022: £4.36).

25. Related party transactions

Transactions between the Group and parties related to the Group are required to be disclosed to the extent that they are necessary for an 
understanding of the potential effect of the relationship on the financial statements. Other disclosures, such as key management personnel 
compensation, are also required.

The Group is not deemed to be controlled or jointly controlled by a party directly or through intermediaries under the accounting standards. 
As a result, the related parties of the Group are members of the Group, including associates and joint ventures, key management personnel, 
close family members of key management personnel and any entity controlled by those parties.

Cash transactions with associates or joint ventures are reported in the cash flow statement and in note 9. 

£18.7 million (2022: £24.5 million) was held in customer accounts in respect of amounts payable to key management personnel or their 
related parties.

Included within loans and advances to clients are amounts due from related parties of £0.1 million (2022: £5.9 million). All related party loans 
and advances were at commercial rates.

Some of the plan assets of the Schroders Retirement Benefit Scheme are invested in products managed by the Life Company (see note 14).  
At 31 December 2023, the fair value of these assets was £50.2 million (2022: £94.4 million).

Transactions between the Group and its related parties were made at market rates. Any amounts outstanding are unsecured and will be settled 
in cash. No guarantees have been given or received. 

Key management personnel compensation
Key management personnel are defined as members of the Board or the Group Management Committee. The remuneration of key 
management personnel during the year was as follows:

26. Interests in structured entities

Structured entities are those entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who 
has control, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of 
contractual arrangements. The Group’s interests in consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities are described below.

The Group has interests in structured entities as a result of contractual arrangements arising from its principal activity, the management 
of assets on behalf of its clients. AUM, excluding deposits by Wealth Management clients and some segregated client portfolios held within 
the Group’s Asset Management business, is managed within structured entities. These structured entities typically consist of investment 
vehicles such as Open Ended Investment Companies, Authorised Unit Trusts, Limited Partnerships and Sociétés d’Investissement à Capital 
Variable, which entitle investors to a percentage of the vehicle’s net asset value. The vehicles are financed by the purchase of units or shares 
by investors. The Group also has interests in structured entities through proprietary investments. These are mainly into vehicles that help 
facilitate the Group’s stated aim of generating a return on investment capital and when it deploys seed and co-investment capital in 
developing new investment strategies or as it invests alongside its clients. Additionally, the Group holds interests in structured entities for 
liquidity management purposes, for example via investments in money market funds.

The Group does not guarantee returns on the investments it manages or commit to financially support its structured entities. A small 
proportion of the Group’s AUM, principally real estate funds, is permitted to raise finance through loans from banks and other financial 
institutions. Where external finance is raised, the Group does not provide a guarantee for the repayment of any borrowings.

The business activity of all structured entities in which the Group has an interest, is the management of assets in order to generate 
investment returns for investors from capital appreciation and/or investment income. The Group earns a management fee from its 
structured entities, normally based on a percentage of the entity’s net asset value, committed capital value or gross asset value and, 
where contractually agreed, a performance fee or carried interest, based on outperformance against predetermined benchmarks. 
In addition, where the Group owns a proportion of the structured entity it is entitled to receive investment returns.

(a) Interests arising from managing assets
The Group’s interests in structured entities arising as a result of contractual relationships from its principal activity, the management of assets 
on behalf of its clients, are reflected in the Group’s AUM excluding associates and joint ventures.

Certain AUM are managed outside of structured entities. Within Asset Management, this occurs either because it is formed of segregated 
investment portfolios for institutional clients comprising directly held investments in individual financial instruments, or because the voting 
structures of the vehicles themselves allow the investment manager to be removed without cause. Within Wealth Management, AUM is not 
generally considered to be within structured entities as the contractual relationships exist directly with the client rather than with structured 
entities, for example discretionary and advisory asset management and banking services. In addition, Wealth Management AUM in the form 
of loans and advances to customers is conducted outside of structured entities.

Certain structured entities are deemed to be controlled by the Group and are accounted for as subsidiaries and consolidated in accordance 
with the accounting standards. AUM within consolidated structured entities represents the net assets of the beneficial interest in the 
consolidated structured entity owned by third parties.

AUM within unconsolidated structured entities constitutes the remaining balance, represented principally by the net asset value of pooled 
vehicles managed for Intermediary clients, as well as some assets invested in pooled vehicles on behalf of Institutional and Wealth 
Management clients. The Group’s beneficial interest in structured entities is not included within AUM and is described separately overleaf.

The Group has no direct exposure to losses in relation to the AUM reported above, as the investment risk is borne by clients. The main risk 
the Group faces from its interest in AUM managed on behalf of clients is the loss of fee income as a result of the withdrawal of funds by clients. 
Outflows from funds are dependent on market sentiment, asset performance and investor considerations.

The Group’s proprietary investments include interests in unconsolidated structured entities in the form of cash and cash equivalents and 
financial assets. Cash and cash equivalents comprise investments in money market funds, none of which are managed by the Group (2022: nil). 
Financial assets include seed and co-investment capital, legacy private equity investments and hedges of deferred cash awards. Of the financial 
assets, £561.7 million (2022: £582.0 million) is invested in funds managed by the Group. The Group has no interest apart from its role as 
investor in those funds for which it does not act as manager. The main risk the Group faces from its interests in unconsolidated structured 
entities arising from proprietary investments is that the investments will decrease in value. Note 18 includes further information on the Group’s 
exposure to market risk arising from proprietary investments.

The Group has contractual commitments to co-invest alongside its clients and provide a minimum level of capital for certain private assets 
and alternative vehicles. The Group’s investment call commitments are set out in note 22.

The statement of financial position also includes the Life Company assets of £10,008.1 million (2022: £10,054.1 million), which are included in 
AUM. The exposure to the risks and rewards associated with these assets is borne by unit-linked policyholders, or, where Life Company funds 
are consolidated, third-party investors in those funds.

Financial support for consolidated structured entities where there is no contractual obligation to do so
The Group supports some of its funds through the injection of seed capital in order to enable the funds to establish a track record before they 
are more widely marketed. During the year, the Group purchased units at a cost of £72.3 million (2022: £95.1 million) to provide seed capital 
to investment funds managed by the Group, of which £28.4 million (2022: £41.8 million) resulted in the consolidation of those funds and 
£43.9 million (2022: £53.3 million) did not.

151

Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportGovernanceShareholder informationFinancial statements 
Where the Group controls a pooled investment vehicle, it is 
consolidated and the third party interest is recorded as a financial 
liability until the Group loses control. This consolidation has no net 
effect on the Group’s consolidated income statement.

The consolidated cash flow statement separately presents 
acquisitions and disposals of interests in consolidated pooled 
vehicles. Cash movements within the pooled vehicles are shown 
net within cash flows from operating activities as the cash held within 
the underlying pooled investment vehicles is restricted and is not 
available to the Group for corporate purposes. This presentation 
provides more relevant information about the impact of the Group’s 
investment in pooled vehicles on corporate cash resources than an 
analysis of the underlying cash flows of the vehicles.

The Group records any non-controlling interest at the proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable assets. Where an option exists to 
acquire a further interest in the shares of a subsidiary a financial 
liability is recognised. These liabilities are measured at the present 
value of the expected amount payable on exercise. As the option 
relates to a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, the 
non-controlling interest is adjusted and changes in value are 
recognised directly in equity. If these options expire unexercised, 
the financial liability is derecognised with the corresponding credit 
recognised directly in equity.

The most significant non-controlling interest relates to third party 
interests of 19.1% in Schroders Wealth Holdings Limited (SWHL). The 
consolidated profit after tax of SWHL was £57.9 million for the year 
(2022: £61.4 million). The net assets of SWHL were £312.1 million at 
31 December 2023 (2022: £324.2 million). Dividends of £12.4 million 
were paid to SWHL’s non-controlling interest during the year (2022: 
£6.7 million). 

No other non-controlling interest is considered to be individually 
material on the basis of the carrying value at 31 December 2023 
(2022: same).

(d) Net gains and losses on foreign exchange
Many subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than sterling. 
The results of these subsidiaries are translated at the average rate 
of exchange. At the year end, the assets and liabilities are translated 
at the closing rate of exchange. Gains or losses on translation are 
recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
and as a separate component of equity together with gains or losses 
on any hedges of overseas operations. Such gains or losses are 
transferred to the consolidated income statement on disposal or 
liquidation of the relevant subsidiary. Transactions undertaken in 
foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of 
the subsidiary at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of 
the transaction.

Foreign currency assets and liabilities, other than those measured at 
historical cost, are translated into the functional currency at the rates 
of exchange ruling at the year end date. Any exchange differences 
arising are included within the consolidated income statement.

(e) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, short-term 
deposits with contractual maturities of less than three months and 
money market funds that are readily convertible to cash.

Consolidated financial statements continued
Notes to the accounts continued

Presentation of the financial statements
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with UK-adopted international accounting standards and in 
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

The consolidated financial information presented within these 
financial statements has been prepared on the going concern basis 
under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at 
fair value of derivative financial instruments and financial assets and 
liabilities that are held at fair value through profit or loss or at fair 
value through other comprehensive income, liabilities to purchase 
subsidiary shares, liabilities in respect of deferred cash awards and 
deposits relating to bullion.

In making an assessment on going concern, the Directors have 
considered a wide range of information relating to present and future 
conditions, including future capital requirements, prediction of 
profitability and cash flows. These assessments showed the Group 
has sufficient capital and liquidity to support future business 
requirements and adequate resources to continue as a going concern 
for at least 12 months following approval of the financial statements.

The consolidated statement of financial position is shown in order 
of liquidity. The classification between current and non-current is 
set out in the notes. The Group’s Life Company business is reported 
separately. If the assets and liabilities of the Group’s Life Company 
business were to be included within existing captions on the 
consolidated statement of financial position, the effect would be to 
gross up a number of individual line items to a material extent. By not 
doing this, the Group can provide a more transparent presentation 
that shows the assets of the Life Company and the related unit-linked 
liabilities as separate and distinct from the remainder of the 
consolidated statement of financial position.

The Group’s principal accounting policies have been consistently 
applied. Further information is provided below and highlighted in the 
notes to the accounts.

(b) Future accounting developments
The Group did not implement the requirements of any standards or 
interpretations that were in issue but were not required to be 
adopted by the Group at the year end date. No standards or 
interpretations have been issued that are expected to have a material 
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

(c) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information includes the total 
comprehensive gains or losses, the financial position and the cash 
flows of the Company and its subsidiaries, associates and joint 
ventures. This includes share ownership trusts established for certain 
share-based awards.

In the case of associates and joint ventures, those entities are 
presented as single line items in the consolidated income statement 
and consolidated statement of financial position (see note 9). 

Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on 
consolidation. Consistent accounting policies have been applied 
across the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements. Details of the Company’s related undertakings are 
presented in note 35. 

The entities included in the consolidation may vary year on year 
due both to the restructuring of the Group (including acquisitions and 
disposals) and changes to the number of pooled investment vehicles 
controlled by the Group.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Impairment assessments relating to goodwill and other intangible 
assets depend on value in use and discounted cash flow models. 
These valuations include climate risks in the relevant assumptions 
where appropriate. 

The Group’s net operating revenues are typically earned as an 
agreed percentage of the value of AUM or based on the performance 
of the underlying AUM. The potential impact of climate change on 
the Group’s AUM and future net operating revenue generation is 
considered in the principal risks and uncertainties section of this 
Annual Report and Accounts.

These considerations did not have a material impact on the financial 
reporting judgements and estimates in the current year. This reflects 
the conclusion that climate change is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group’s short-term cash flows including 
those considered in the going concern and viability assessments.

Presentation of the financial statements 
continued

(f) Estimates and judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in 
conformity with UK-adopted international accounting standards 
requires the use of certain significant accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of 
applying the Group’s accounting policies and in determining whether 
certain assets and liabilities should be recorded or an impairment 
recognised. Any areas involving a higher degree of judgement or 
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant 
to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed within the 
notes and identified under the title estimates and judgements. 
Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements 
are periodically evaluated and are based on historical experience and 
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable. The resulting accounting estimates may not equal 
the related actual results. 

In applying IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group 
uses judgement to determine whether its interests in funds (and 
other similar entities), including those held by the Life Company, 
constitute controlling interests. The Group can have interests in funds 
in the form of proprietary investments or through its role as fund 
manager. The Group usually deems control to exist where the Group 
is the fund manager and its share of total variable returns exceeds 
40% (including from ownership interests and management and 
performance-based revenues). The Group usually deems that control 
does not exist where the Group’s share of total variable returns is 
below 30%. The Group reviews all facts and circumstances to establish 
whether the Group has control. This includes consideration of the 
purpose and design of the investee as well as the rights held by other 
parties to remove the Group as the fund manager.

The other estimates and judgements that could have a significant 
effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are set out in 
the following notes, including sensitivities where relevant or material:

Note 2 Net operating revenue
Tax expense 
Note 4
Trade and other receivables
Note 7
Note 8
Financial assets and liabilities
Note 12 Goodwill and intangible assets 
Note 14 Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities
Note 16 Provisions and contingent liabilities 
Note 23 Retirement benefit obligations 

Climate risks have been considered in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements, principally through the valuation 
of financial assets and impairment assessments. 

Financial assets measured at fair value are principally valued using 
traded prices or market observable inputs that incorporate potential 
climate risks where appropriate. The valuation of some financial 
instruments involves a greater level of judgement or estimation. 
In these scenarios climate risks are incorporated where relevant in 
the relevant assumptions, such as cash flow forecasts. For financial 
assets carried at amortised cost, credit risk assessments also include 
climate risk considerations.

The distributable profits of Schroders plc are £2.8 billion (2022: £2.7 billion) and comprise retained profits of £3.0 billion (2022: £2.8 billion), 
included within the ‘Profit and loss reserve’, less amounts held within the own shares reserve.

The Group’s ability to pay dividends is however restricted by the need to hold regulatory capital and to maintain sufficient other operating 
capital to support its ongoing business activities. In addition, the Group invests in its own funds as seed capital for the purposes of supporting 
new investment strategies. An analysis of the Group’s capital position is provided in note 18.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Schroders plc – Notes to the accounts

27. Significant accounting policies

The separate financial statements of Schroders plc (Company) have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with UK-
adopted international accounting standards and in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The Company has taken

A deferred asset of £3.6 million (2022: £3.4 million) relating to £14.3 million of realised capital losses has not been recognised as there is 
insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient capital gains in the future against which the deferred tax asset could be utilised. 

Net deferred tax at 31 December comprises a deferred tax asset of £38.2 million (2022: £37.5 million) and a deferred tax liability of 
£34.6 million (2022: £34.1 million).

32. Financial instrument risk management
The Company’s policy is to have adequate capital for all activities undertaken in the normal course of business. In particular, it should have 
adequate capital to maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements. Generally, surplus capital is loaned back to 
the Group’s investment capital management entities.

The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole. Details of the Group’s risk management 
processes are outlined in the ‘Risk management’ section within the Strategic report and the ‘Risk and internal controls’ section within 
the Audit and Risk Committee report as well as in note 18. The Company’s specific risk exposures are explained below.

Credit risk
The Company has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts 
when due. The Company’s counterparties are predominantly its subsidiaries and therefore there is minimal external credit risk exposure.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost. The Group’s liquidity policy is 
to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover any cash flow funding, meet all obligations as they fall due and maintain solvency. The Company holds 
sufficient liquid funds to cover its needs in the normal course of business. The Company can recall intercompany loans to subsidiaries or utilise 
the Group loan facility to maintain sufficient liquidity.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates.

At 31 December 2023, if interest rates had been 50 bps lower (2022: 150 bps higher) or 150 bps lower (2022: 50 bps lower) with all other 
variables held constant, the Company estimates that profit after tax for the year would have decreased by £5.2 million (2022: increased by 
£14.9 million) or decreased by £15.6 million (2022: decreased by £5.0 million) respectively. These changes are mainly as a result of net interest 
income on the Company’s interest-bearing intercompany receivables and payables and cash. Other components of equity are not directly 
affected by interest rate movements.

The model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits does not take into account the indirect effect of interest rates on the fair value 
of other assets and liabilities.

Foreign exchange and pricing risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. The Company is not directly exposed to foreign exchange or pricing risk. The Company’s investments in its directly held 
subsidiaries are in sterling and are held at historic cost. It has indirect exposure to foreign exchange and pricing risk in the Group, which could 
result in the impairment of these subsidiaries. There are currently sufficient resources in subsidiaries to absorb any normal market events.

35. Subsidiaries and other related undertakings

The Group operates globally, which results in the Company having a corporate structure consisting of a number of related undertakings, 
comprising subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other qualifying undertakings. A full list of these undertakings, the country of 
incorporation, registered office, classes of shares held and the effective percentage of equity owned at 31 December 2023 is disclosed below.

Additionally, related undertakings include entities where the Company has a significant holding of a share class or unit class of a pooled 
vehicle. These holdings can arise through the Group’s investment management activities on behalf of clients or as part of the stated aim 
of generating a return on investment capital. The seeding of structured entities in order to develop new investment strategies can give rise 
to these holdings. A listing of related undertakings arising from the Company’s interest in structured entities along with registered offices 
is included on pages 171 to 174.

(a) Related undertakings arising from the Company’s corporate structure

Principal subsidiaries

(b) Related undertakings arising from the Company’s interests in structured entities
The Company’s related undertakings also include funds in which it holds investments. These include fully and partially owned funds that are 
classified as subsidiaries. Due to the number of share classes or unit classes that can exist in these vehicles, a significant holding in a single 
share class or unit class is possible without that undertaking being classified as a subsidiary or associate.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Independent auditor’s report to the members of Schroders plc

Opinion
In our opinion:

•  Schroders plc’s Group financial statements and Parent company 

financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2023 and of the Group’s profit for the year then 
ended;

•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 

accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards;

•  the Parent company financial statements have been properly 

prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting 
standards as applied in accordance with section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006; and

•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 

the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements of Schroders plc (the ‘Parent 
company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 
31 December 2023 which comprise:

Notes to the accounts 1 to 26

Presentation of the financial 
statements

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and UK-adopted international 
accounting standards and, as regards the Parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ section 
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We are independent of the Group and Parent company in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (‘FRC’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest 
entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.

The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were 
not provided to the Group or the Parent company and we remain 
independent of the Group and the Parent company in conducting 
the audit.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. To evaluate 
the Directors’ assessment of the Group and Parent company’s ability 
to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting, we have:

•  assessed the assumptions used in management’s five-year forecast 
by comparing to internal management information and external 
market sources. We also determined that the model is appropriate 
to enable management to make an assessment of the going 
concern status of the Group for a period of twelve months from 
the date the financial statements are approved. We also performed 
back-testing on prior year forecasts by comparing them to the 
Group’s results over the same periods;

•  evaluated the capital and liquidity position of the Group by 

reviewing the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, 
the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process and the 
Recovery Plan; 

•  assessed the appropriateness of the stress and reverse stress 
test scenarios used by the Board in reaching their conclusions 
by considering the key risks identified by management, our 
understanding of the business and the external market 
environment. We evaluated the assumptions used in the scenarios 
by comparing them to internal management information and 
external market sources, tested the clerical accuracy and assessed 
the conclusions reached in the stress and reverse stress test 
scenarios;

•  assessed the plausibility of the available options identified 
by management to mitigate the impact of the key risks by 
comparing them to our understanding of the Group;

•  performed enquiries of management and those charged with 

governance to identify risks or events that may impact the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. We also reviewed the 
management paper approved by the Board and minutes of 
meetings of the Board and its committees; and

•  assessed the appropriateness of the going concern disclosures 

by comparing them to management’s assessment for consistency 
and for compliance with the relevant reporting requirements.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified 
any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group 
and Parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for 
twelve months from the date the Annual Report and Accounts 
are approved.

In relation to the Group and Parent company’s reporting on how they 
have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ 
statement in the financial statements about whether the directors 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with 
respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this 
report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group and 
Parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Overview of our audit approach

Audit scope

•  The Group is comprised of over 300 legal 

The charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work 
performed by our audit teams.

entities domiciled in 27 countries.

Profit before tax

•  We performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of six legal entities 
and audit procedures on specific balances 
for a further 27 legal entities.

•  The legal entities where we performed full 
or specific audit procedures accounted for 
92% of profit before tax, 93% of revenue 
and 97% of total assets.

•  Certain of the Group’s processes over 

financial reporting are centralised in the 
finance operations hubs of London, 
Luxembourg, Singapore, Zurich and 
Horsham. Where appropriate, our testing 
was performed in these locations.

Key audit matters

•  Improper recognition of revenue.

Materiality

•  Improper recognition of cost of sales.

•  Overall Group materiality of £33 million, 
which represents 5% of operating profit.

An overview of the scope of the Parent company 
and Group audits
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and 
our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 
for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to 
form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take 
into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and 
effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business 
environment and other factors, such as recent internal audit results, 
when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity. 

In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial 
statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements, we selected 33 legal 
entities within the following countries: United Kingdom, Luxembourg, 
Switzerland, Singapore, Australia, China, Guernsey, Indonesia, Japan 
and United States of America.

Of the 33 legal entities selected, we performed an audit of the 
complete financial information of six legal entities (full scope entities) 
which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the 
remaining 27 legal entities (specific scope entities), we performed 
audit procedures on specific accounts within that legal entity that 
we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the 
significant accounts in the Group financial statements, either 
because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.

For the remaining entities that together represent 8% of the 
Group’s profit before tax, we performed other procedures, including: 
analytical review; obtaining cash confirmations; and testing of 
consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations, centralised 
processes and controls, and foreign currency translation 
recalculations, to respond to potential risks of material misstatement 
of the Group financial statements.

Revenue

Assets

Changes from the prior year 
Schroders International Holdings Limited, Benchmark Financial 
Planning Limited, and Schroder Fund Management (China) Company 
Limited are considered to be specific scope entities for the current 
year audit. These entities were previously considered to be neither 
specific nor full scope.

Schroder BOCOM Wealth Management Company Limited is no longer 
considered a subsidiary and is now an equity accounted associate. 
As a result this has fallen out of scope.

Involvement with overseas teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of 
the legal entities by us, as the Group audit team, or by local auditors 
from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction.

Schroders has centralised processes and controls over financial 
reporting within the finance operations hubs of London, Luxembourg, 
Singapore, Zurich, and Horsham. Our teams in these locations 
performed centralised testing for certain accounts including revenue, 
cost of sales, administrative expenses, variable compensation, 
provisions and intercompany transactions.

For processes that are not centralised, the audit work was performed 
by legal entity auditors. The Group audit team was responsible for the 
scope and direction of the audit process in each entity, interacting 
regularly with the local EY teams during each stage of the audit and 
reviewing relevant working papers. This, together with the additional 
procedures performed at Group level, and the centralised testing, 
gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group 
financial statements.

176

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023The Group team has maintained oversight of component teams 
through use of remote collaboration platforms, in-person visits and 
virtual meetings, in particular with the Luxembourg, Zurich and 
Singapore audit teams. This allowed the Group team to gain a greater 
understanding of the business issues faced in each location, discuss 
the audit approach with the local team and any issues arising from 
their work, review relevant audit working papers, and attend meetings 
with local management.

Climate change
The Group has determined that the majority of its climate-related risk 
lies in the assets it manages on behalf of its clients. This is primarily 
explained on pages 30 to 37 in the Task Force for Climate related 
Financial Disclosures and on pages 40 to 43 in the Risk Management 
section of the Annual Report and Accounts. The Group has also 
explained their climate-related commitments on pages 28 to 30. All of 
these disclosures form part of the ‘Other information’. Our 
procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely 
of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of the 
audit, or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our 
responsibilities in relation to ‘Other information’. 

In planning and performing our audit, we assessed the potential 
impacts of climate change on the Group’s business and any 
consequential material impact on its financial statements.

As explained in the Estimates and Judgements section of the 
Presentation of the financial statements on page 153, climate risks 
have been considered in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements where management consider it appropriate. The principal 

areas of consideration by management include the measurement of 
financial assets and impairment assessments.

Our audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the 
financial statements was focused on assessing whether the effects of 
potential climate risks have been appropriately reflected by 
management in reaching their judgments in relation to the 
measurement of financial assets and their impairment assessments. 
As part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, to 
determine the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements from climate change, which needed to be considered in 
our audit.

We also challenged the Directors’ considerations of climate change 
risks in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated 
disclosures. 

Based on our work, we have not identified the impact of climate 
change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or as a 
factor that impacts a key audit matter.

Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
that we identified. These matters included those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Group only risk:

Our response to the risk

We have:

Improper recognition of revenue (£2,936.7 million, 2022: 
£2,891.7 million)

Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee report (page 66) and Note 2 of 
the Consolidated financial statements (pages 108 to 111)

Schroders manages funds in numerous domiciles, which consist of 
many share classes. Schroders also manages segregated portfolios 
for a range of institutions. In addition, Schroders provides wealth 
management services. The inputs and calculation methodologies that 
drive the fees vary significantly across this population. For example, 
performance fees, fees related to segregated accounts and fees 
generated from private assets, have a range of bespoke calculation 
methodologies. For certain revenue streams, management must 
apply judgment in accordance with IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts 
with customers (‘IFRS 15’) to determine whether it is highly probable 
that a significant reversal will not occur in the future.

The following are identified as the key risks or subjective areas of 
revenue recognition:

•  Not all agreements in place have been identified and accounted 

for;

•  Confirmed and updated our understanding of the procedures 
and controls in place throughout the revenue process, both at 
Schroders through walkthrough procedures, and at third party 
administrators, through review of independent controls assurance 
reports;

•  IT systems: tested the controls over access to, and changes to, 

the systems underpinning the revenue process, including testing 
controls over the flow of data between systems for completeness 
and accuracy;

•  Fee agreements: tested the controls over new and amended fee 
agreements. For a sample of fees, agreed the fee terms used in 
the calculation to investment management agreements (‘IMAs’), 
fee letters or fund prospectuses; 

•  Calculation: tested automated controls over the arithmetical 

accuracy of a sample of fee calculations within the relevant systems;

•  AUM: tested the controls in place for the calculation and existence 

of AUM used in the fee calculations. For a sample of fees, tested the 
completeness and accuracy of AUM included in the fee calculation 
systems to administrator reports or Schroders’ investment 
management systems;

•  Fee terms have not been correctly interpreted or entered into the 

•  Segregated and unitised account billing and cash collection: tested 

fee calculation and billing systems;

•  Assets under management (‘AUM’) has not been properly attributed 

to fee agreements;

•  Errors occur in manually calculated revenues, such as performance 

fees, certain private assets fees and carried interest; and

•  Inappropriate judgments are made by management in the 

calculation and recognition of carried interest.

There is also the risk that management may influence the timing or 
recognition of revenue in order to meet market expectations or net 
operating income-based targets. 

controls over the billing and cash management process. For a 
sample of fees, compared the amounts recorded to the invoice 
sent to the client and the cash received, checked whether the 
revenue had been recorded in the correct period, and assessed the 
recoverability of debtors through the testing of subsequent cash 
receipts and inspection of the aged debtors report;

•  Mutual fund billing: for a sample of gross fund fees billed directly by 
third party administrators (‘TPA’), we have compared the revenue 
recorded by Schroders to reports provided by the TPA;

Risk

Our response to the risk

•  Mutual fund cash collection: for a sample of gross fund fees billed 
directly by the TPA we have assessed the recoverability of year end 
debtors through testing to cash receipts and inspection of the 
aged debtors report;

•  Carried interest: challenged management over the judgments and 
estimates used in the valuation of the carried interest receivable, 
including the constraints applied under IFRS 15; 

•  For a sample of manually calculated revenues, such as performance 
fees, certain private assets fees and carried interest, agreed the 
inputs used in the relevant calculations to third party sources, 
where applicable, and legal agreements; recalculated the value of 
the relevant fee and compared the amount invoiced or carried 
interest receivable forecast to the revenue recorded;

•  Interest income: performed analytical procedures to assess 

whether interest income recorded reflects the interest rates seen in 
the year. For a sample of interest income transactions, traced the 
revenue recorded to customer statements and third party 
statements;

•  Review of other information: inspected the global operational 
incident log and complaints registers to identify any errors in 
revenue or control deficiencies; and

•  Management override: in order to address the residual risk of 

management override we performed enquiries of management, 
read minutes of board and committee meetings held throughout 
the year and performed journal entry testing.

We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk 
area in six locations, which covered 93% of the total revenue. Due to 
the centralised nature of the revenue process, the majority of our 
testing was performed in London for Asset Management revenue, 
and London and Zurich for Wealth Management revenue.

Key observations communicated to the Schroders Audit and Risk Committee
All transactions tested have been recognised in accordance with the underlying agreements or other supporting documentation. Revenue 
has been recorded materially in accordance with IFRS 15. 

Based on the procedures performed, we have no matters to report in respect of revenue recognition.

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023Risk

Group only risk:

Our response to the risk

We have:

Improper recognition of cost of sales (£602.3 million, 2022: 
£530.3 million)

Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee report (page 66) and Note 2 of 
the Consolidated financial statements (pages 108 to 111)

Schroders has fee expense agreements in place with many parties. 
These expenses include commissions, carried interest payable, 
external fund manager fees, expenses paid on behalf of UK-managed 
funds, and distribution fees payable to financial institutions, 
investment platform providers and financial advisers. The expenses 
are generally based on AUM. 

The following are identified as the key risks or subjective areas in 
correctly recognising fee expenses:

•  Not all agreements in place have been identified and accounted 

for;

•  Fee expense terms have not been correctly interpreted;

•  AUM has not been properly identified or attributed to clients or 

third parties with fee expense arrangements; and

•  Inappropriate judgments are made by management in the 

calculation of carried interest payable.

There is also the risk that management may influence the recognition 
of cost of sales in order to meet market expectations or net operating 
income-based targets. 

•  Confirmed and updated our understanding of the procedures and 
controls in place throughout the cost of sales process, both at 
Schroders through walkthrough procedures, and at third party 
administrators through review of independent controls assurance 
reports;

•  IT systems: tested the controls over access to, and changes to, the 
systems underpinning the fee expense process, including testing 
controls over the flow of data between systems to test 
completeness and accuracy;

•  Fee expense agreements: tested the controls over new agreements 

and amended fee expense agreements. For a sample of fee 
expenses calculated by Schroders and an additional sample 
calculated by third parties, agreed the fee expense terms used in 
the calculation to IMAs, fee letters or rebate agreements; 

•  Calculation: tested automated controls over the arithmetical 

accuracy of a sample of fee expense calculations within the relevant 
systems;

•  AUM: tested the controls in place over the calculation and existence 
of AUM used in the fee expense calculations. For a sample of fee 
expenses, tested the completeness and accuracy of the AUM 
included in the calculation to Schroders’ transfer agency or 
investment management systems;

•  Billing: tested controls over the cash management process. For a 
sample of fee expenses, compared the amount recorded to the 
rebate statement sent to the client and to the cash paid;

•  Carried interest: challenged management over the judgments and 
estimates used in the valuation of the carried interest liability. For a 
sample of funds with carried interest arrangements: agreed the 
inputs used in the carried interest calculations to accounting 
records, third party sources and legal agreements; recalculated the 
value of the carried interest liability; and compared the discounted 
carried interest expense to the cost of sales recorded;

•  Review of other information: inspected the global operational 

incident log and complaints registers to identify any errors in fee 
expenses or control deficiencies, and determined whether any fee 
expense errors, have been appropriately addressed; and

•  Management override: in order to address the residual risk of 

management override we performed enquiries of management, 
read minutes of board and committee meetings held throughout 
the year and performed journal entry testing.

We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk 
area in London, which covered 99% of total cost of sales.

Key observations communicated to the Schroders Audit and Risk Committee
All transactions tested have been recognised in accordance with the underlying agreements or other supporting documentation. Cost of 
sales has been recorded materially in accordance with IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements (‘IAS 1’). Based on the procedures 
performed, we have no matters to report in respect of cost of sales.

Prior year comparison
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to ‘Accounting for corporate activity’. In the current year, due to 
there being no material acquisitions, we do not consider this to be a key audit matter. There have been no other significant changes to our 
overall risk assessment from the 2022 audit.

Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the 
audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion.

Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in 
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a 
basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise 
to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement of the other information, we are required 
to report that fact.

We determined materiality for the Group to be £33 million (2022: 
£36 million), which is 5% of operating profit (2022: 5% of operating 
profit). We believe that operating profit is the most relevant 
performance measure to the stakeholders of the Group.

We determined materiality for the Parent company to be £47 million 
(2022: £45 million), which is 1% (2022: 1%) of net assets. The Parent 
company primarily holds investments in Group entities and, therefore, 
net assets is considered to be the key focus for users of the financial 
statements.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of 
the audit:

During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality based 
on 31 December 2023 financial statement amounts and adjusted our 
audit procedures accordingly.

•  the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 

Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance 
level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.

On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment 
of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgment was that 
performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of our planning 
materiality, namely £25 million (2022: £27 million). We have used a 
threshold consistent with 2022 due to our prior experience as to the 
low occurrence of material misstatements and our conclusions as to 
the effectiveness of the control environment and accounting 
processes.

Audit work at entity level, for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage 
over significant financial statement accounts, is undertaken based 
on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each entity is based on the relative scale and risk 
of the entity to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the 
risk of misstatement at that entity. In the current year, the range 
of performance materiality allocated to individual entities was 
£5.0 million to £13.6 million (2022: £5.4 million to £14.9 million).

Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered 
as being clearly trivial.

We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report 
to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £1.7 million 
(2022: £1.8 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 

We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the 
Annual Report set out on pages 1 to 99 and 183 to 189, including the 
Strategic report, Governance, and Shareholder information sections, 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The Directors are responsible for the other information in the 
Annual Report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

•  the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared 

in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the 
Parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic 
report or the Directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:

•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 

company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or

•  the Parent company financial statements and the part of the 

Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or

•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 

not made; or

•  we have not received all the information and explanations we 

require for our audit.

Corporate Governance Statement
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement in relation to going 
concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the Group and Parent company’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have 
concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 
Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:

•  Director’s statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meets 
its liabilities, as set out on page 47;

•  Directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of 

adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 
uncertainties identified, as set out on page 47;

•  Directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the Parent company’s 
prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is 
appropriate, as set out on page 47;

•  Directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable, as set 

out on page 99;

180

 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2023•  Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment 
of the emerging and principal risks, as set out on pages 40-43;

•  the section of the Annual Report that describes the review of 

effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems, 
as set out on page 40-43; and

•  the section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee, 

as set out on pages 66-73.

Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
set out on page 99, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group and Parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered 
capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance 
with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including 
fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud 
is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery 
or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent 
to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, 
including fraud, is detailed below.

However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection 
of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Parent 
company and management. 

•  We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 

frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined 
that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting 
framework (UK-adopted international accounting standards, the 
Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code) and 
relevant tax compliance regulations. In addition, we concluded that 
there are certain significant laws and regulations which may have 
an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements being the Listing Rules and relevant rules 
and regulations of the Prudential Regulation Authority (‘PRA’), 
Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) and those of other applicable 
regulators around the world.

•  We understood how Schroders plc is complying with those 

frameworks by making enquiries of senior management, including 
the Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Company Secretary, 
Chief Risk Officer, Head of Internal Audit and the Chairman of the 
Audit and Risk Committee. We corroborated our understanding 
through our review of board and committee meeting minutes, 
papers provided to the Audit and Risk Committee, and 
correspondence received from the PRA and FCA.

•  We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements 
to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by 
meeting with management to understand where they considered 
there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance 
targets and their potential influence on efforts made by 
management to manage or influence the perceptions of analysts. 
We considered the controls that the Group has established to 
address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect 
fraud; and how senior management monitors these controls. 
Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit 
procedures to address each identified fraud risk.

•  Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to 
identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified 
in the paragraphs above. Our procedures involved: journal entry 
testing, with a focus on manual journals and journals indicating 
large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the 
business; enquiries of senior management, including those at full 
and specific scope entities; and focused testing, as referred to in 
the key audit matters section above.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This 
description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Other matters we are required to address
•  Following the recommendation from the Audit and Risk Committee, 
we were appointed by the Parent company on 9 March 2018 to 
audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 
2018 and subsequent financial periods. Our appointment as 
auditor was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 26 April 2018. 

•  The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 

renewals and reappointments is six years, covering the years ended 
2018 to 2023.

•  The audit opinion is consistent with the Audit Results Report to the 

Audit and Risk Committee.

Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Parent company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Parent company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Parent company and the 
Parent company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Investor Centre
Computershare is the Company’s share registrar. Investor Centre 
is Computershare’s free, self-service website where shareholders 
can manage their interests online.

The website enables shareholders to:

•  view share balances

•  change address details

•  view payment and tax information

•  update payment instructions

•  update communication instructions.

Shareholders can register their email address at investorcentre.co.uk 
to be notified electronically of events such as AGMs and can receive 
shareholder communications such as the Annual Report and 
Accounts and the Notice of Meeting online.

Enquiries and notifications concerning dividends, share certificates 
or transfers and address changes should be sent to the Registrar.

Dividends
Paying dividends into a bank or building society account helps 
reduce the risk of fraud and will provide you with quicker access to 
your funds than payment by cheque. Applications for an electronic 
mandate can be made by contacting the Registrar.

If your dividend is paid directly into your bank or building society 
account, you will receive an annual consolidated dividend 
confirmation, which will be sent to you in September each year 
at the time the interim dividend is paid.

Dividend confirmations are available electronically at 
investorcentre.co.uk to those shareholders who have their payments 
mandated to their bank or building society accounts, and who have 
expressed a preference for electronic communications.

The Company operates a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP), which 
provides shareholders with a way of increasing their shareholding 
in the Company by reinvesting their dividends. A copy of the DRIP 
terms and conditions and application form can be obtained from 
the Registrar.

Details of dividend payments can be found in the Directors’ report 
on page 95.

Schroders offers a service to shareholders in participating countries 
that enables dividends to be received in local currencies. You can 
check your eligibility and/or request a mandate form by contacting 
the Registrar.

Warning to shareholders
Companies are aware that their shareholders have received 
unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment 
matters. These are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ who target 
UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to be 
worthless or high-risk shares or investments. These operations are 
commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’. These ‘brokers’ can be very 
persistent and extremely persuasive.

Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount, or offers of free company reports. 
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:

•  Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation

•  Check that they are properly authorised by the FCA before getting 

involved by visiting register.fca.org.uk

•  Report the matter to the FCA by calling 0800 111 6768 or visiting 

fca.org.uk/consumers/report-scam-unauthorised-firm

•  Do not deal with any firm that you are unsure about

If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to 
receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. 
The FCA provides a list of the unauthorised firms it is aware of, 
which can be accessed at fca.org.uk/consumers/warning-list-
unauthorised-firms.

More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found 
on the FCA website at fca.org.uk/consumers/protect-yourself-scams.

Glossary

About our business areas
Private markets
Gives investors access to opportunities in private markets, such as 
real estate, private equity and infrastructure, as well as alternatives.

Solutions
Provides complete solutions and partnerships, including liability 
offsets and risk mitigation.

Mutual Funds
Offers retail and institutional clients access to our investment 
capabilities through intermediary networks.

Institutional
Makes investment components available directly to institutions 
and includes sub-advisory mandates.

Wealth Management
Provides wealth management and financial planning for 
ultra-high-net-worth, high-net-worth and affluent individuals 
and charity clients as well as family offices and advisers.

Alternative Performance Measures
An Alternative Performance Measure (APM) is a financial measure 
of historical or future financial performance, financial position, 
or cashflows, other than a financial measure defined or specified 
in the applicable financial reporting framework. The Group’s 
APMs are defined below.

Operating compensation ratio
Operating compensation costs divided by net operating income. 
By targeting an operating compensation ratio, we align the 
interests of shareholders and employees.

Operating earnings per share
Operating profit after tax excluding non-controlling operating 
earnings divided by the relevant weighted average number 
of shares (see note 5). The presentation of operating earnings 
per share provides transparency as to our operational activities  
to aid understanding of the financial performance.

Payout ratio
The total dividend per share in respect of the year (see note 6) 
divided by the operating basic earnings per share.

Active management
The management of investments based on active decision-making rather 
than with the objective of replicating the return of an index.

Assets under management (AUM)
AUM represents the aggregate value of client assets managed, advised 
or otherwise contracted, from which the Group, including joint ventures 
and associates, earns operating revenue.

Asset Management AUM includes investment management, OCIO, 
fiduciary management and liability management services. For Schroders 
Capital Private Equity, the aggregate value of assets managed includes 
client commitments on which we earn fees. This is changed to the lower 
of committed funds and net asset value, typically after seven years from 
the initial investment, in line with the fee basis. 

Wealth Management AUM comprises the aggregate value of assets 
where Schroders provides advice or discretionary management (Advised 
AUM), platform services (Platform AUM) and investment management 
services (Managed AUM). Advised AUM comprises assets where 
Schroders provides discretionary or advisory management services 
including assets where the client independently makes investment 
decisions. Platform AUM represents the value of assets on the 
Benchmark Fusion platform. The Fusion platform enables financial 
advisors to administer and manage their clients’ accounts by providing 
dealing and settlement services, valuation statements and custody 
services through a third party. Managed AUM includes assets where the 
client invests in Schroders’ funds.

186

Basis point (bps)
One one-hundredth of a percentage point (0.01%).

Carried interest
Carried interest is similar to the performance fees we may earn 
in our public markets business, but is part of our private markets 
business fee structures.

CDP
CDP is a not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system 
for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their 
environmental impacts.

Client investment performance
Client investment performance is a measure of how investments 
are performing relative to a benchmark or other comparator. As an 
active asset manager, we prioritise consistently delivering positive 
investment outcomes for our clients which is why our three-year 
investment performance is a key performance indicator for the Group. 
It is calculated internally by Schroders to give shareholders and financial 
analysts general guidance on how our invested assets are performing. 
The data is aggregated and is intended to provide information for 
comparison to prior reporting periods only. It is not intended for 
clients or potential clients investing in our products. All calculations 
for investment performance are made gross of fees with the exception 
of those for which the stated comparator is a net of fees competitor 
ranking. When a product’s investment performance is disclosed in 
product or client documentation it is specific to the strategy or product. 
Performance will either be shown net of fees at the relevant fund 
share-class level or it will be shown gross of fees with a fee schedule 
for the strategy supplied.

The calculation includes applicable assets under management that have 
a complete track record over the one year, three year and five-year 
reporting periods, respectively. 

Applicable assets under management does not include our joint 
ventures and associates and excludes £85.5 billion of assets, principally 
comprising those managed by third parties or held on an execution-only 
basis, the majority of assets managed by Schroders Capital Real Estate 
Hotels, non-discretionary assets and assets held on a custody-only basis 
as well as Wealth Management platform assets on the Benchmark 
Fusion platform. 

Performance is calculated relative to the relevant comparator for 
each investment strategy as summarised below. These fall into one 
of four categories, the percentages for each of which refer to the 
three-year calculation: 

•  For 73% of assets included in the calculation, the comparator 

is the relevant benchmark. 

•  If the relevant comparator is to competitor rankings, the relative 

position of the fund to its peer group on a like-for-like basis is used to 
calculate performance. This applies to 9% of assets in the calculation. 

•  Assets for which the relevant comparator is an absolute return target 
are measured against that absolute target. This applies to 13% of 
assets in the calculation. 

•  Assets with no specific outperformance objective, including those with 
a buy and maintain objective, are measured against a cash alternative, 
if applicable. This applies to 5% of assets in the calculation.

Clients
Within Asset Management we work with institutional clients, including 
pensions funds, insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds, 
as well as intermediaries, including financial advisers, private wealth 
managers, distributors and online platforms. We also provide a range 
of wealth management services to private clients, family offices 
and charities.

At times, ‘client’ is used to refer to investors in our funds or strategies, 
i.e. the end client.

We are increasingly focused on building closer relationships with the 
end client, whose money is invested with us, often via an intermediary 
or institution.

Science-based target
A science-based target provides a clearly-defined pathway for companies 
to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The target is considered 
‘science-based’ if it is in line with what the latest climate science deems 
necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement – limiting global 
warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing 
efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.

owned or controlled by the company, such as emissions from gas, oil 
and company vehicles. Scope 2 is indirect greenhouse gas emissions 
from sources owned or controlled by the company, such as emissions 
from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam. Scope 3 
is indirect greenhouse gas emissions from sources not owned or 
controlled by the company, such as emissions from business travel 
or investments.

to allow it to develop a performance track record before it is marketed 
to potential clients. Co-investment comprises an investment made 
alongside our clients.

Senior management
Senior management includes members of the GMC, the direct 
reports of the GMC and the direct reports one level below that, 
in each case excluding administrative and other ancillary roles.

our investee companies sustainability risks and opportunities and how 
they are managed. We seek to influence our investee companies by 
engaging with management teams to encourage and support them on 
areas where improvement may be required to deliver long-term value.

SustainEx™
Schroders’ proprietary tool which estimates the notional net social 
and environmental ‘costs’ or ‘benefits that an issuer may create’. It uses 
certain metrics with respect to that issuer, and quantifies them positively 
(for example, by paying ‘fair wages’) and negatively (for example, the 
carbon an issuer emits) to produce an aggregate notional measure of 
the issuer’s social and environmental ‘externalities’. The aim of the model 
is to enable our investors to assess the investments they may make, 
having regard to such measures, and the risks those issuers potentially 
face if the social and environmental ‘costs’ they create were to be 
reflected in their own financial costs.

tCO2e
Tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. A unit of measurement that 
is used to standardise the climate effects of various greenhouse gases 
on the basis of their global warming potential.

Total capital requirement
The requirement to hold the sum of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A capital 
requirements. Pillar 2A capital requirements are supplementary 
requirements for those risk categories not captured by Pillar 1, 
depending on specific circumstances of a company, as set out 
by the Prudential Regulation Authority.

Total dividend per share
Unless otherwise stated, this is the total dividend in respect of the year, 
comprised of the interim dividend and the proposed final dividend. This 
differs from the IFRS dividend, which is comprised of the prior year final 
and current year interim dividends declared and paid during the year.

Transition risks
Reflect the risks stemming from changes in the economy that will be 
required to limit human-induced climate change, including changes in 
demand for goods and services, costs to companies, sectors or asset 
classes. These may result from new or enhanced corporate climate 
change laws and regulations, changes in demand for climate-focused 
products, and more volatility in financial markets as asset prices adjust 
to reflect the increasing regulation of carbon emissions.
