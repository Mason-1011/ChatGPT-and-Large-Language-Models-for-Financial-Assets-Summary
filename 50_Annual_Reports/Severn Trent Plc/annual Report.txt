WHAT DO WE MEAN BY 
PERFORMANCE DRIVEN, 
SUSTAINABILITY LED?

Our Strategy to be ‘performance driven, sustainability led’ 
acknowledges our relentless drive to deliver the operational 
and financial performance that our stakeholders expect, in a 
sustainable way, and we believe this is achieved when you 
balance the long‑term interests of all stakeholders.

We provide essential services to over 
4.8 million households and businesses 
in our region. We are two of the eleven 
regulated water and waste water 
businesses in England and Wales. Our 
regulated businesses serve a diverse 
region stretching across the heart of the 
UK, from the Bristol Channel to the 
Humber, and from North and mid‑Wales 
to the East Midlands. Our non‑regulated 
businesses operate across England, 
Scotland and Wales.

We serve a diverse range of customers 
with different cultures, interests and 
experiences. Our region includes some  
of the most affluent areas of the country 
as well as some of the most deprived.  
We have more urban conurbations than 
any other water company, yet we serve 
predominantly rural counties and 
communities. It’s a region which is 
characterised by, and benefits from, 
its diversity. 

In providing our water and waste water 
services, we always look to contribute 
social and environmental value for the 
long‑term benefit of our stakeholders. 

Through the investment and operational 
decisions that we have made over time, 
and those we are making today, we are 
ensuring that our business is 
performance driven and sustainability 
led, now and in the long term.

STRATEGIC REPORTOUR STRATEGY

INTRODUCTION TO OUR STRATEGY
We are guided by our Purpose – ‘taking care of one of life’s essentials’ – which forms the 
foundation on which we can build meaningful and long‑standing relationships with our 
stakeholders. Our Values – ‘Having Courage’, ‘Embracing Curiosity’, ‘Showing Care’ and 
‘Taking Pride’ – underpin our Purpose and reflect the deep connection that we have with 
the stakeholders we serve. And our Strategy – ‘performance driven, sustainability led’ 
drives us in everything we do. 

What makes Severn Trent unique is our ability to consistently deliver 
sector‑leading operational performance in a way that has a positive 
sustainable impact. Our Strategy to be ‘performance driven, sustainability 
led’ acknowledges our relentless drive to deliver the operational and 
financial performance that our stakeholders expect. We believe this is 
achieved when we strike the right long‑term balance between our 
customers and communities, the environment we depend on, our 
workforce and our investors. Success is not about putting any one outcome 
or stakeholder’s need at the heart of our business; success can be found 

through striking the right balance between the four strategic pillars 
outlined in our Strategy. Our Strategy is an ambitious evolution from an 
already successful business position, rather than a revolution. From 
Outcome Delivery Incentives (‘ODIs’) delivery to net zero programmes, 
catchment management approaches to Get River Positive river pledges 
and societal ambitions, our Strategy captures and pushes forward our 
ambitions to date.

Read more about how the Board considered stakeholders 
when developing our Strategy in our Section 172 Statement 
on pages 95 to 97.

OUR  
PURPOSE

Taking care of one of life’s essentials

DRIVEN BY  
OUR STRATEGY Performance driven, sustainability led

UNDERPINNED BY OUR VALUES
Our courage drives us to set bold ambitions, our curiosity inspires us to try new approaches, our caring culture promotes 
fairness and equality for our people, customers and communities, and our pride ensures that we succeed on this journey.

Having Courage
We always do the right thing and have 
courage to challenge the norm and speak up 
if things aren’t quite right. We are prepared 
to step out of our comfort zones and act with 
both today and the future in mind.

Embracing Curiosity
We search out safe, better and faster ways 
of doing things through innovation and are 
always curious and willing to learn.

Showing Care
We keep our promises to customers and 
show care by treating everyone fairly and 
equally. We try to enhance the environment 
around us and spend  
every pound wisely.

Taking Pride
We make a difference for our customers every 
day, owning problems and working with others 
until they are solved. We take pride in what  
we do and champion our work in the 
communities we work and live in.

POSITIVE CHANGE

OUR SOCIETAL STRATEGY
In November 2022, we announced our 
ten‑year vision to help change the 
lives of 100,000 people through 
tackling the underlying causes of 
poverty and improving the lives of 
people in our communities. 

 You can read more about our Societal 
Strategy and progress on page 32.

GREEN RECOVERY
In July 2021, Ofwat approved our 
proposal to invest £566 million 
(2017/18 prices) in our ambitious 
Green Recovery Programme, 
providing a great opportunity to 
deliver positive outcomes for our 
customers, and long‑term growth 
for the Company through these 
new investments.

care about;

 – running a business that goes

 – caring for people in our region, and;

Delivering on these strategic pillars makes us a 
stronger business for the long term. It unlocks 
significant additional value creation, whether 
that be internally through greater cost efficiency, 
asset growth, risk reduction, talent 
management, brand reputation and innovation, 
or externally through increased prosperity, job 
creation, enriched natural environment and 
community wellbeing. 

Our strategic pillars are designed to reflect all 
parts of the Severn Trent Group. They resonate 
with people from all teams across our business 
and at all levels of seniority. They guide our 
direction and support us in our decision making. 

WHAT SETS US APART

We set bold ambitions backed by a track record of sector-leading performance with 
a clear roadmap for the future. This builds trust, creates opportunities for innovation 
and inspires our people and partners to strive to be the best they can be.

WHY WE DO IT

At Severn Trent, we are driven by our 
Purpose – taking care of one of life’s 
essentials

When we are united by our clear 
social Purpose, we can drive positive

the society we live in and the 
environment we depend on.

Now, more than ever, we know that 
taking care of one of life’s essentials 
means that what we do really matters 
to the families, businesses and 

communities we serve. This is 
why our Values of Having Courage, 
Embracing Curiosity, Showing Care 
and Taking Pride are so important to 
us. Being a company that can be 
trusted, taking care of the 
environment, helping people to thrive

means we all need to be  
focused on living our Values,  
by doing the right thing, every

STRATEGIC REPORT 
 
THE WATER SECTOR

There are 17 regional businesses supplying water services in 
England and Wales. These businesses serve over 50 million 
household and non-household customers. Of these, eleven 
also provide waste water services, including Severn Trent 
Water Limited and Hafren Dyfrdwy Cyfyngedig.

Working with our regulators and stakeholders 
We are subject to regulation of our price and performance by economic, quality and 
environmental regulators, as outlined below. You can read more about how we engaged 
with our regulators and other stakeholders this year on pages 84 to 94.

Policy

The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (‘Defra’) 
in England, and the Welsh Government, provide strategic and policy 
direction for the industry and our regulators.

Regulation and representation

The Consumer Council for Water (‘CCW’) speaks on behalf of water 
consumers in England and Wales.

OUR PRICE REVIEW 
REGULATORY CYCLE
Every five years, our 
economic regulator, Ofwat, 
reviews water and waste 
water companies’ business 
plans. These business plans 
cover the following five-year 
period and include the 
impacts on customer bills. 
As part of each price review, companies are 
asked to submit their business plans, which 
set out their investment proposals, 
performance improvement commitments 
and the potential impacts on customer bills 
for the coming Asset Management Plan 
(‘AMP’). Later this year, we will submit 
business plans for Severn Trent Water 
Limited and Hafren Dyfrdwy Cyfyngedig 
for the latest price review (‘PR24’), covering 
the period 2025‑30 (‘AMP8’).

Ofwat’s Final Determinations for PR24 will 
be issued by the regulator next year. The 
final methodology provided us with the 
regulator’s guidance on expectations for 
our business plans.

The Drinking Water Inspectorate (‘DWI’) independently checks that 
water supplies in England and Wales are safe and that drinking water 
quality is acceptable to consumers.

The Environment Agency (‘EA’) allows us to collect water from 
reservoirs, rivers and aquifers and return it to the environment  
after it has been used by our customers and treated by us.

Natural England advises the Government on the natural environment in 
England and helps to protect nature and the landscape, especially for 
plant and animal life in both fresh water and the sea.

Natural Resources Wales (‘NRW’) is the environmental regulator in 
Wales. It oversees how the country’s natural resources are maintained, 
improved and used, both now and in the future.

Ofwat is the economic regulator for the water and waste water industry 
in England and Wales. Ofwat principally exercises its duty to protect the 
interests of customers through periodic reviews of charges (price 
reviews) every five years.

We also work with a range of other regulators, including: 
 – Health and Safety Executive to ensure that the health and safety of our employees, 

customers and visitors is preserved;

 – Ofgem, the economic regulator of gas and electricity markets, whose remit extends 

to renewable energy generation; and

 – Ofsted, the regulator for education, children’s services and skills, since our Academy 

became accredited.

SEVERN TRENT PLC  

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

While our PR24 business plans are currently still being developed,  
they will lay out our ambitions in the following key areas:

RESILIENCE
Reliable supplies and services depend on a 
reliable infrastructure. But to us 
‘resilience’ is a broader issue than just 
having good‑quality pipes, reservoirs and 
treatment works, which we are committed 
to investing in already. 

It means being operationally resilient, so 
our people are sufficiently well trained to 
carry out the tasks we need them to do, 
both in a steady state and in an emergency. 
And it means being financially resilient, 
with a stress‑tested capital structure to 
maintain an investment‑grade rating for 
our regulated business and the appropriate 
equity strength to effectively manage risks. 
It also means having corporate resilience, 
with the right governance processes to 
ensure that we are fair and transparent at 
all times and recognised as a responsible 
and trusted business by society. 

We are rightly regarded as a public service 
company, and we’ll do everything in our 
power to deliver a service that the public 
and our people can be proud of. 

Responding to customer  
needs today
We are not just waiting for the submission  
of our business plans to make the tangible 
changes our customers and stakeholders 
expect. Last year, we announced our Get River 
Positive river pledges, Societal Strategy and 
Affordability Strategy, and have already 
started to make progress on delivering on 
our aims. Their continuing delivery will also 
be a key part of our overall PR24 and 
longer‑term plans.

Through engaging with our stakeholders 
through the PR24 process, we are ensuring 
that our plans reflect the needs of today’s 
customers, and generations of customers 
to come.

CUSTOMERS
In developing our business plans for PR24, 
we have embarked on our most in‑depth 
customer engagement activity and 
research programmes to date. As a 
provider of one of life’s essentials, we gain 
insights from our everyday interactions, 
which help give us a rich understanding of 
the issues that are most important to our 
customers.

For the first time, we have undertaken 
open challenge ‘Your water, your say’ 
sessions on our proposed business plans, 
which deepened our understanding of the 
issues most pertinent to our customers 
and enabled open discussion on our future 
ambitions.

We know our customers want us to go 
beyond providing a resilient water supply, 
balancing supply and demand, providing 
clean drinking water and taking waste 
water away. Our customers want us to 
make a positive impact on their everyday 
lives and their communities.

AFFORDABILITY
Households are facing the most acute cost 
of living pressures for decades. This is why 
ensuring our bills are affordable for all our 
customers – including the most vulnerable 
– is central to our plans, as well as ensuring 
we retain fairness across future generations 
for some of our longer‑term plans.

Struggling to pay a water bill can be an 
indication of other issues in a customer’s 
life, so we are working with partners in local 
communities to identify those who may need 
some extra help. 

In November 2022, we launched our Societal 
Strategy – with the aim of helping change the 
lives of 100,000 people in our region over the 
next ten years. This is part of our 
commitment to help tackle the underlying 
causes of poverty and improve life chances 
for people within our region. We also 
announced in May 2022, as part of our 
Affordability Strategy, a £30 million package 
of additional financial support in response to 
the cost of living challenges. 

As part of PR24, Ofwat has asked each 
company to submit a Long‑Term Delivery 
Strategy (‘LTDS’) – out to 2050. The LTDSs for 
Severn Trent and Hafren Dyfrdwy will form 
part of our overall PR24 proposal and will 
outline the path we plan to take in delivering 
our long‑term strategic aims, while also 
recognising that we will need to adapt our path 
to reflect the impact of broader ‘macro’ 
challenges on reaching our end destination.

Our plans for AMP8 are a key stepping stone 
to delivering our longer‑term strategic goals 
and ambitions. 

Planning for the long term
Long‑term, adaptive planning is an integral 
part of how our organisation works. We are 
first and foremost driven by our Purpose – 
‘taking care of one of life’s essentials’ – and 
to continue to deliver outcomes for the benefit 
of all our customers, wider society and our 
investors, we need to be able to adapt to a 
broad range of future trends and challenges. 

Demographic, climate, environmental, 
societal and economic change can be difficult 
to predict, but understanding the potential 
impacts of such changes is vital to ensuring 
we can continue to deliver resilient, affordable 
water and waste water services for 
generations to come. We have already issued 
a consultation on our draft Water Resource 
Management Plan (‘WRMP’) and our final 
Drainage and Wastewater Management 
Plan (‘DWMP’) was published in March 2023. 
These plans set out how we will respond to 
these trends and challenges.

OPTIMISM 
THROUGH A 
CHALLENGING  
YEAR

Our Strategy, Purpose and Culture 
As outlined in my report last year, our Purpose 
– taking care of one of life’s essentials – forms 
the foundation on which we can build 
meaningful and long-standing relationships 
with our stakeholders, to enable us to play our 
part in society positively and proactively. Our 
Values – Having Courage, Embracing Curiosity, 
Showing Care and Taking Pride – underpin our 
Purpose and reflect the deep connection that 
we have with the stakeholders we serve.

At the heart of our Strategy is a desire to be 
performance driven and sustainability led, 
reflecting Severn Trent’s ability to deliver 
consistently sector-leading performance in a 
way that has a positive sustainable impact. Our 
Strategy acknowledges our relentless drive to 
continue to deliver the financial and operational 
performance that our stakeholders expect and 
we believe is achieved through balancing the 
long-term interests of all stakeholders. Read 
more about our Strategy on pages 2 to 3.

The last 18 months have been some 
of the most challenging in our history 
and many of those challenges are 
continuing – with high inflation 
driving increases in energy costs for 
customers and companies alike, and 
the continued impact of geopolitical 
events. Our customers and the 
communities we serve are not 
immune from this and, as such, this 
year’s Annual Report will shine a 
light on the focus we have applied 
to supporting those affected by 
affordability pressures both now 
and in the long term.

During the last year, the Board spent time 
considering the Group’s Strategy, to reflect 
where the business is today while clearly 
outlining the ambitions we have for the future. 
We considered long-term value generation for 
our stakeholders – including our customers 
and communities, the environment we depend 
on, our workforce and our investors – with  
a focus on the long term.

Our Strategy to be ‘performance driven, 
sustainability led’ drives us to deliver strong 
performance in balance with the long-term 
needs of our environment. This isn’t only a 
focus for us because we are a good company, 
but because we see it as a fundamental 
opportunity for innovation, growth and 
long-term value creation. And in doing so, 
we deliver for our customers, inspire our 
people, attract and reward investors, and 
generate a positive impact for our customers, 
communities and the environment.

Listening to our  
stakeholders

Listening to our stakeholders this year, it is clear 
that two main issues remain front of their minds 
– affordability and river health. We continue to 
listen carefully to understand their concerns on 
these two important topics in order to review and 
refine our approach and deliver maximum 
benefits to our stakeholders.

We know that an increasing number of households 
in our region are experiencing affordability 
pressures, pushing a higher proportion of 
households into water poverty (customers who 
spend more than 5% of their income, after housing 
costs, on water). In last year’s report, I wrote 
about our Affordability Strategy, launched in May 
2022, and I have been moved and encouraged by 
the meaningful support that we have provided to 
our customers and communities throughout the 
year. You can read about our progress in Liv’s 
report and on pages 29 to 30. 

We know that we need to do more to address the 
long-term drivers that perpetuate poverty in our 
society. That’s why we launched our ten-year 
Societal Strategy in November 2022, aimed at 
helping to change the life chances of 100,000 
people in our region. This sector-first initiative 
will realise a number of important benefits for all 
stakeholders – and particularly our customers. 

Our Societal Strategy was developed with an 
emphasis on shaping and improving the lives of 
people in our communities, by focusing on the 
underlying causes of water poverty. Our 
ambitious ten-year vision will help tackle poverty 
throughout our region, working with hundreds of 
schools to offer 300 annual work experience 
placements for children, 10,000 hours of free 
skills and employability training in communities, 
and ‘pop-up’ academies that will reach 
thousands of individuals – all supported by a 
network of local partnerships. You can read 
more on page 32. 

River health also remains a critical priority for 
our stakeholders. In last year’s report, I wrote 
about the way in which we responded to the 
heightened focus on this important issue. Both 
the Board and Executive Committee remain 
committed to making a positive impact on the 
environment and the communities we serve, and 
recognise that, as a sector, there is more we 
need to do to help the region’s rivers be the 
healthiest they can be. In March 2022, we 
announced our commitment to ‘Get River 
Positive’; establishing five river pledges and we 
continue to oversee progress against each 
of these pledges at every Board meeting. 
This year we have delivered significant 
improvements in river quality – reducing our 
Reasons for Not Achieving Good Status 
(‘RNAGS’) from 24% to 16% and average storm 
overflow activations to 18 in 2022, ahead of the 
regulator’s 2025 target of 20 activations. 

We published our first Get River Positive 
Annual Report in March 2023 which outlines 
the good progress we have made since the 
launch of our five river pledges. You can read 
more about our progress on pages 20 to 21.

The last year has also seen increased scrutiny 
of the environmental performance of the sector 
as a whole, and resultant focus on Executive 
Director remuneration. We are committed to 
making a positive impact on the environment 
and the communities we serve, and recognise 
that, as a sector leader, we need to take a 
proactive role in protecting and enhancing our 
environment. Whilst we have consistently 
focused on connecting remuneration to 
environmental outcomes, we recognise the 
strength of external opinion on the performance 
of the sector and made further changes to our 
Annual Bonus Scheme during the year to 
strengthen the focus on environmental 
performance – increasing the weighting of 
environmental measures within our annual 
bonus plan to 20%. For 2023/24 we are going 
even further and increasing the weighting to 
30%. Three-quarters of our potential Executive 
pay is variable in nature, based on stretching 
targets that are reviewed annually by the 
Remuneration Committee, ensuring that our 
Executives are only rewarded for strong 
performance. You can read more in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 141.

Looking after  
our people

When meeting our people throughout the 
year, it is clear that they take the responsibility 
that comes with providing our essential service 
seriously. Their passion and commitment is 
evident, especially when responding to 
extreme weather events to limit the impacts on 
our customers and adapting to unforseeable 
incidents. I would like to convey my thanks 
to our people for the passion and dedication 
they apply to all they do; their commitment 
is inspiring. 

The vast majority of our colleagues, their 
friends and families, are also our customers 
and live in the communities we serve. As such, 
some of the challenges experienced by our 
customers (such as the effect of increased cost 
of living from food, fuel and energy bill rises) 
are also felt by our people. We continue to do 
everything we can to help support them – and 
our range of employee benefits has been 
enhanced during the year – including launching 
two new benefits to help with childcare costs 
and advice and support for those taking care of 
an older dependant. We also offer meaningful 
contributions to employee healthcare, through 
financial support for elective treatments, 
access to a 24/7 GP service and our Employee 
Assistance Programme. We continue to take 
pride in being a real Living Wage Employer, 
as well as welcoming 263 graduates and 
apprentices during the year. I attended our 
annual leadership event at Tittesworth Reservoir 
in September 2022, where the range of 
benefits available to all employees was 
discussed with our leaders and team managers 
to ensure these are being used to the greatest 
extent possible by our people. 

Running a business that goes 
hand-in-hand with nature
In addition to the significant progress made on 
our Get River Positive river pledges, we have 
also made excellent progress on our Great Big 
Nature Boost programme during the year. In 
May 2023, we announced that we are extending 
and accelerating our commitment to improve 
biodiversity from 5,000 hectares by 2027 to 
10,000 hectares by 2025, at which point our 
work will account for 2% of the nation’s 2042 
Nature Recovery Network target. You can read 
more about this exciting work on page 19.

We were proud to be the Official Nature and 
Carbon Neutral partner of the Birmingham 
2022 Commonwealth Games held over the 
summer – through offering drinking water to 
spectators, supplying critical infrastructure to 
the Games, providing 40 water bars, saving 
almost 500,000 plastic bottles from going to 
landfill, and continuing to plant our 2,022 acre 
legacy forest. Our people made a meaningful 
contribution to the Games and I was humbled 
to observe their significant contribution during 
my own shifts at a water bar. Our contribution 
to the Games is a wonderful example of our 
community-focused approach to sustainability. 

We were also delighted to be placed 58th by 
Corporate Knights as one of the world’s most 
sustainable companies and in August 2022 we 
received ‘Advancing’ tier status from the 
Carbon Trust. We recognise that we are only 
partway on our journey. We continue to develop 
new ways of delivering our essential services 
and identify innovations that support the 
delivery of our sustainability ambitions. Read 
more about our sustainability highlights on 
pages 137 to 140 and in our Sustainability 
Report online and the work of the Corporate 
Sustainability Committee during the year is set 
out on pages 137 to 140.

Maintaining a strong, diverse and value adding 
team, with a varied range of professional 
backgrounds, skills and perspectives, is 
always an area of focus for me. Succession 
planning is vital to ensure the Board has the 
necessary plans in place for orderly 
succession to both the Board and senior 
management positions, and can oversee the 
development of a diverse pipeline for 
succession. The Nominations Committee and 
Board have applied particular focus to this 
important area over the last 18 months and 
the recent internal Executive Committee 
appointments announced in February 2023 
demonstrate the breadth and depth of the 
Executive talent pipeline that has been 
developed within the Group, including the 
development of senior leaders with potential 
to be future Executive Committee members. 
You can read more about the evolution of the 
Board and Executive Team in my Chair’s 
Introduction to Governance on pages 100 to 
101 and the Nominations Committee Report 
on page 124. 

The diversity of our workforce is so 
important and I am proud of our progress on 
increasing gender and ethnic diversity on the 
Board and at senior leadership levels. Above 
all, we aim to have an inclusive culture – 
where everyone can be themselves at work, 
feel valued and contribute their best to make 
us more successful in all that we do. 

In February 2022, the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review announced two new 
recommendations for FTSE350 companies to 
increase representation of women in senior 
leadership positions by 31 December 2025. 
We already exceed both of those goals, with a 
female Chair, Chief Executive and, Chief 
Finance Officer, following Helen’s 
appointment as Chief Financial Officer 
Designate, and have at least 40% women at 
Board and Executive Committee level. The 
Board also updated its Diversity Policy during 
the year in consideration of the progress 
made to date and recommendations of the 
FTSE Women Leaders Review and Parker 
Review on Ethnic Diversity. Read more in the 
Nominations Committee report on page 125.

Resilient performance and 
sharing the rewards

Against the background of a changing 
environment, it is more important than ever for us 
to maintain our sector-leading performance and 
continue delivering strong service to our 
customers. In December 2022, Ofwat named 
Severn Trent in the leading category for both 
financial resilience and performance and 
expenditure for the second year running. We have 
been awarded EPA 4* for three consecutive years 
by the EA and are highly confident of achieving it 
for the fourth consecutive year for 2022. This 
would be a unique accolade in the sector and 
something we are incredibly proud of. 

Our aim is to deliver exceptional and consistent 
services to our customers at all times as well as 
being sector-leading in measures. I am pleased 
that we have delivered robust operational and 
resilient financial performance, and this year has 
been no exception, with around 80% of ODI 
measures green, including leakage, pollutions 
and water quality complaints, resulting in a net 
reward1 of £53 million and Group PBIT for the 
year of £509 million. Liv and James provide 
further detail within their respective reviews.

The Board applied particular focus to the 
proposed dividend during the year, in 
consideration of our regulated company 

1  Our FY23 ODI outturn and percentage meeting or ahead 
of regulatory target (or within penalty deadband for 
compliance measures) include in year (including C’MeX and 
D-MeX) reward earnings of £35.5 million and £17.5 million, 
for work and milestones already delivered in relation to end 
of AMP ODIs (excluding PCC). ODI values for Customer 
Measure of Experience (‘C-MeX’) and Developer Measures 
of Experience (‘D-MeX’) are calculated based on published 
industry data. A definitive value will be published by Ofwat 
later in the year. Value of £53 million is quoted pre-tax and in 
2017/18 prices unless otherwise stated.

performance in the round and over time, service 
delivery for customers and the environment, the 
Company’s long-term investment needs and 
financial resilience. In line with our formal 
dividend policy, the Board determined that the 
proposed dividend would not impact the financial 
health of the regulated company, nor its credit 
ratings. The Board also considered that the 
proposed dividend was supported by the 
regulated company performance in the round 
and over time. The Board is therefore proposing 
a final dividend of 64.09 pence per share, to be 
paid on 14 July 2023, taking the total dividend for 
the year to 106.82 pence per share.

Given that many small retail shareholders and 
Severn Trent pensioners rely on our dividend 
payments, we are pleased to be able to sustain 
our dividend commitments against a backdrop 
of increased costs, which has resulted in a 
challenging year for so many shareholders. 
I had the pleasure of meeting many shareholders 
again this year to discuss our performance. Our 
consistent results emphasise that we are well 
placed to uphold our high standards of service 
delivery for customers and provide a 
sustainable platform for investment and growth 
in areas that are important to our stakeholders.

Focus on the  
long term

We continue to deliver a strong operational 
performance for our customers and the Board 
is focused on the long-term challenges facing 
the sector, ensuring robust risk management, 
prioritisation and decision making around the 
investment needed to make a positive 
sustainable impact. 

are inextricably linked to the environment 
during the year, such as our Drainage and 
Wastewater Management Plan, Water 
Resources Management Plan, the Water 
Industry National Environment Programme, 
and our PR24 submission – including our 
Long-Term Delivery Strategy. The Board has 
placed particular emphasis on ensuring that 
we have resilient long-term plans in place that 
consider the impacts of population growth, 
drought, our environmental obligations and 
climate change uncertainty so we can continue 
to deliver our essential services for customers 
now and in the long term whilst also 
transitioning to a net zero world. 

A key area of focus for the period ahead is 
positioning the business for success during 
the next regulatory period. Our draft business 
plans are well advanced, following widespread 
customer engagement, rigorous independent 
challenge and rich discussion in the 
boardroom. Our PR24 plan will be submitted to 
Ofwat in October 2023. We are positioned well 
to implement our plans over AMP8 and beyond, 
safe in the knowledge that our teams have the 
talent, skills and, above all, commitment to 
enable us to deliver for our customers. 

Against a backdrop of rising expectations on 
companies both within and outside the water 
sector, we are working even harder to drive 
further performance improvements through 
the rest of this AMP and into the next and, in 
doing so, create long-term value for the mutual 
benefits of our customers and communities, 
shareholders, the environment and our people.

The Board spent a significant amount of time 
considering key long-term programmes that

SUSTAINABILITY 
IN ALL THAT  
WE DO

I’m pleased to present my 
Chief Executive’s Review for 
2022/23, sharing my personal 
highlights for the year and 
providing you with an update 
on our performance over the 
last twelve months.
Whether it’s the growing impact of climate 
change, unparalleled energy costs, or broader 
macroeconomic uncertainty, this year has been 
a true test of our resilience as a company. I’m 
incredibly proud of our proven ability to continue 
delivering on our promises for our customers 
and the environment, alongside a robust 
financial performance, in the face of such a 
challenging year.

Our resilience and performance provide a 
strong foundation from which we can do 
even more for the communities we serve 
and the environment on which we depend. 
I’m pleased to report strong progress against 
our commitments in these areas, as well as 
setting out a new Societal Strategy, which 
I wholeheartedly believe has the ability to 

change the life chances of some of the most 
vulnerable people in our region. 

Our Purpose of ‘taking care of one of life’s 
essentials’ forms the foundation of our 
relationships with our stakeholders and is 
critical to our long-term success. Our people 
connect with our Purpose, and our outstanding 
engagement scores demonstrate the strength 
and depth of this connection. As outlined in 
Christine’s report, a key focus for the Board 
this year has been reviewing our Strategy and 
considering the long-term value generation for 
our stakeholders – including our customers 
and communities, the environment, our 
workforce and our investors – each of whom 
want consistency in delivery of our Strategy, 
with a focus on the long term. 

Our Strategy is to be performance driven, 
sustainability led. Consistently executing this 
Strategy will deliver outstanding performance 
in a way that has a positive, sustainable impact. 
You can read more about the development of 
our Strategy on pages 2 to 3.

Creating job opportunities, 
continuing significant regional 
investment, and financially 
supporting more customers 
than ever before is made 
possible by the strong results 
we have delivered this year.

STRATEGIC REPORTCHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED

Delivering for customers  
in a changing climate

Our teams work around the clock delivering a 
brilliant service for our customers to keep 
clean water flowing into homes and 
businesses, and take away and recycle waste 
water. Quite rightly, our customers expect this 
service to continue 24/7, and I’m proud of the 
work we’ve achieved to minimise the impact of 
climate change experienced by our customers 
this year. 

We’ve hit or exceeded our targets on c.80% of 
our performance commitments, earning an 
outperformance reward of £53 million, despite 
the weather challenges faced this year which 
have impacted a number of measures. As we 
look ahead to AMP8, when our comparative 
position will be even more important, our whole 
business is focused on pushing our 
performance even further.

Keeping clean water flowing 
We have invested a significant amount of time 
and resource into strengthening the resilience 
of our water networks over the past few years. 
We’ve brought more assets online to 
strengthen our network, improved flexibility to 
enable us to get water to the right places at the 
right time, and created an in-house Network 
Response Team – 135 people and 42 tankers 
dedicated to getting our customers back on 
supply as quickly as possible. All of which 
really paid off this year.

The summer of 2022 was one of the hottest and 
driest since records began. At its peak, we 
were producing an extra 450 million litres of 
clean water a day. The resilience of our 
network, combined with the incredible support 
from our customers in response to our 
extensive demand management campaigns, 
meant we were able to keep the water flowing, 
navigating the summer conditions with no 
enforced Temporary Usage Bans (‘TUBs’, also 
known as hosepipe bans). 

In common with many other companies, we’re 
also feeling the effects of climate change in 
winter. In December 2022, our region 
experienced a sharp cold snap followed by a 
rapid thaw. These temperature swings can 
have a severe impact on our pipes, causing a 
higher number of bursts. The last time we 
experienced such an event was the Beast from 
the East in 2018 and I’m really pleased that the 
work we’ve done since then meant that the 
interruption to our customers’ supply was 
reduced by 93%. 

Never has it been clearer that water is a 
precious resource and one that we all need to 
take care of, and I’m delighted with the 
sustained progress on our leakage journey, 
hitting our target for the eleventh year out of 
the last twelve, despite the significantly higher 
number of bursts we’ve faced following a 
challenging winter. We’re fixing over 3,000 
leaks a month and we’ve reduced the time it 
takes for us to reach a leak by 30% since 2020. 

We’ve also accelerated our meter roll-out, 
installing over 100,000 meters this year alone, 

taking our metering coverage on household 
customers to 61%. Alongside reducing bills for 
many of our customers, this also gives us 
much greater visibility and insight into our 
network. This is especially the case for smart 
meters, which we’re rolling out in Coventry and 
Warwickshire and through which we have 
already been able to collect valuable data on 
consumption and other trends. Given the 
success of our smart meter campaign, I was 
particularly pleased to receive approval from 
Ofwat to accelerate the roll-out of an additional 
250,000 meters ahead of AMP8.

Our leakage rate is better than the average for 
Europe, but we know that we can, and must, go 
further. We have committed to reducing 
leakage by 50% by 2045 (from a three-year 
rolling average baseline set in 2019/20) and the 
work we’re doing now places us firmly on track 
to achieve that goal.

Focused on waste to create 
a better environment
We have once again met 100% of our environmental 
measures and are highly confident that we  
will achieve the highest-possible 4* rating  
in our annual Environmental Performance 
Assessment (‘EPA’) for 2022 by the EA, making 
it four consecutive years – something no other 
company has ever achieved.

We are proud of our total pollutions 
performance, which has seen a year-on-year 
improvement of 5.4%, resulting in our best ever 
year on serious pollutions. While we’re proud of 
our continued improvements in this space, we 
recognise that any pollution is unacceptable and 
we are striving to halve our total pollutions by 
2025. As part of this ambition, we are focused 
on reducing asset failure through a rigorous 
maintenance programme and improved event 
response times, supported by the ongoing 
installation of 40,000 sewer sensors and the 
establishment of our new in-house Waste 
Network Response Team, inspired by learnings 
in our water business.

One cause of pollutions is blockages in our 
network, and we’ve been successful in driving 
these down by 20% compared with the end of 
AMP6 through a relentless focus on data, 
sewer cleansing and customer education on 
the causes and impact of sewer misuse.

While we have met a number of our key waste 
measures, we have incurred a penalty this year 
on external sewer flooding, where we missed 
a stretching target that reflects our historical 
sector-leading performance. The extreme 
fluctuations in rainfall we’ve experienced this 
year have been a key driver of our 
performance, with our region experiencing 
only 14% less rainfall than average despite the 
prolonged dry summer. We have also 
experienced a deterioration in some of our key 
performance drivers and are reviewing our 
delivery model on our waste infrastructure, 
including the insourcing of critical teams, such 
as planning and scheduling. We expect to 
continue to be a strong performer on this 
measure compared with the sector, but our 

customers rightly expect more of us and we 
are working hard to drive the required 
improvements to meet our target. 

There for our customers when they 
need us most
We have delivered c.90% of our customer 
performance commitments, and I am 
particularly pleased to see a 16% reduction in 
customer complaints compared with last year 
as we continue to improve our service offering. 
We continue to take steps forward in our 
Customer Measure of Experience (‘C-MeX’) 
and Developer Measure of Experience 
(‘D-MeX’) journeys to ensure we can answer 
our customers’ queries at point of contact, and 
keep customers informed. 

This year we launched a new ‘Intelligent 
Kickouts’ process, which uses customers’ 
historical consumption data to track 
and identify changes in their water usage and 
proactively engage with them, before their bill 
is issued. We have designed 30 different 
communication journeys to ensure customers 
receive the right information, at the right time, 
in the right way. In the six months since we 
launched our new process, we have proactively 
engaged with almost 10,000 customers, 
helping them to manage their consumption, 
reducing contacts from customers and 
identifying an additional 14,000 litres of 
private-side leakage a day, with zero 
complaints from customers.

Of course, alongside delivering the best 
service possible, we want to be there for our 
customers when they need us most, and right 
now many are struggling with overwhelming 
pressures associated with the increased cost 
of living. Last year, we announced a package of 
financial support worth £30 million to allow us 
to support 315,000 customers – the biggest 
support scheme any company in our sector 
has ever offered.

We’re proud to continue to offer one of the 
lowest bills in the country, at an average of 
£1.15 per day, and we’ve committed to growing 
our bill by less than inflation for 2023/24, as we 
don’t want anybody to fear their water bill. 
Through our affordability schemes, we can 
offer any customer who needs it up to 90% 
discount off their bill, taking the water bill off 
their worry list. We are financially supporting 
over 237,000 customers and are on track to 
help 315,000 customers by 2025. While we 
don’t wish to see anybody in a situation where 
they need our help, we take comfort in knowing 
that we still have the capacity to support many 
more should they need it.

But financial support is a short-term solution, 
and we want to go much further, to make a 
genuine difference in the communities we live 
and work in. That’s why we announced our 
Societal Strategy in November 2022 our 
commitment to help support 100,000 people 
out of poverty by 2032. This is a huge 
commitment and one we don’t take lightly, and 
we have robust plans in place to deliver this 
support. You can read more about our plans

Get River Positive –  
one year on

Although we have long been a sector leader in 
environmental performance, as measured by 
both Ofwat and the EA, when listening to our 
stakeholders it is clear that river quality 
remains high on their list of priorities. We fully 
recognise that there is more we can do when 
it comes to the health of rivers in our region 
and I’m delighted to report that, one year on 
from the launch of our Get River Positive 
river pledges, we’ve made a huge amount 
of progress. 

We’ve already significantly reduced the impact 
of our operations on the rivers in our region, 
having reduced our share of the RNAGS in our 
region by a third, now down to under 16%. We’ve 
committed to reducing that number to zero by 
2030, and we still have plenty of work to do, but I 
am pleased to see such a strong start.

The permitted operation of Combined Sewer 
Overflows (‘CSOs’) is an essential part of 
managing our network, and while they 
contribute only a small proportion of RNAGS 
(around 3%), we nonetheless recognise the 
need to reduce the frequency at which they 
activate. I’m really pleased to see the average 
annual number of activations has reduced from 
25 in 2021 to 18 in 2022.

We’ve accelerated the rollout of Event Duration 
Monitors (‘EDMs’) across our c.2,400 CSOs 
providing us with 300 million data points a year 
through which we can better understand our 
network and drive the right interventions. 
This includes work to improve weir levels, 
investment in screens and dedicated teams on 
specific assets. In addition, our dedicated team 
of River Rangers has carried out thousands of 
riverside inspections to provide additional 
sampling and monitoring data to better inform 
our plans. Read more about our progress on 
pages 20 to 21.

Our longer-term projects are also progressing 
well. Through our £566 million (2017/18 prices) 
Green Recovery Programme, we are improving 
50 km of river to move two stretches of river 
towards bathing quality by 2025. We have 
installed 76 monitors, providing data on river 
health. We have carried out climate change 
simulations and ground investigations ahead of 
us installing infrastructure solutions, and we are 
trialling ozone disinfection technology to treat 
our waste water to the highest possible 
standards.

We know that the quality of the land across our 
catchment can make a real difference to river 
health, so I am delighted that we have exceeded 
our target of improving the biodiversity of 5,000 
hectares of land four years early, having already 
delivered over 7,700 hectares. We know we can 
maintain momentum on this important work, so 
we have doubled our target, and now expect to 
deliver improvements to the biodiversity of 10,000 
hectares of land over the course of AMP7.

Each and every person in our organisation is 
playing their part in transforming the rivers in 
our region, and we’re passionate about the work 
we’re doing. Our Get River Positive river pledges 
are now built into our Annual Bonus Scheme, 
meaning everybody in the Company is incentivised 
on achieving these vitally important targets.

Taking care  
of our people

I truly believe that the things that make Severn 
Trent special are our culture and our people 
– they go above and beyond every day, pushing 
our performance further and doing more for 
our customers and communities wherever 
they can. 

The strength of our culture is reflected in our 
engagement scores, which are once again in 
the top 5% of global utilities, with our overall 
score of 8.4 out of 10 in our latest survey in 
November 2022 – our best ever. 

Diversity and Inclusion also scored highly at 
8.9 out of 10, and we were delighted to be 
named a top 25 employer by Stonewall this 
year. Notwithstanding this fantastic progress, 
we know this is an area where we can do even 
more, to ensure we create a workplace where 
everyone can bring their whole selves to work, 
fulfil their potential and perform at their best. 
Read more about diversity and inclusion on 
pages 25 to 27. 

Our commitment to internal development and 
progression was evidenced recently when we 
announced the planned retirement of James 
Bowling, our Chief Financial Officer of eight 
years. While really sad to be losing James, 
I was incredibly pleased to see that the 
strength of our succession planning and talent 
management processes resulted in two of my 
direct team taking up exciting new roles, plus 
an internal promotion to the Severn Trent 
Executive Committee – you can read more 
on page 124. 

Of course, while we’re focused on ensuring 
that Severn Trent is a truly brilliant place to 
work, with opportunities to develop and 
succeed, our people also need to feel 
financially secure and taken care of, 
particularly in the face of the current economic 
climate. Our people benefit from a broad and 
thoughtful package of benefits – from help with 
childcare costs and advice and support on 
taking care of an older dependant, to 
meaningful contributions to elective 
treatments, and access to a 24/7 GP service 
and Employee Assistance Programme.

Our people go above and beyond for Severn 
Trent, and we are absolutely committed to 
doing the same for them.

Thanks and outlook
I am, as ever, enormously grateful to my 
c.7,600 wonderful colleagues who work 
tirelessly to take care of one of life’s 
essentials, living and breathing our Values – 
Having Courage, Embracing Curiosity, Showing 
Care and Taking Pride in everything that they 
do.

My thanks go to my exceptional management 
team for their continued passion, dedication 
and leadership, which is absolutely essential to 
our continued success. And I am grateful, too, 
for the stewardship, support and challenge 
from Christine and the Board.

I would like to thank James for everything he’s 
done for Severn Trent and all the support he 
has given to me personally. His fantastic work 
ethic, wise counsel and intellect have been 
invaluable. James has been instrumental in 
driving the success of Severn Trent since his 
appointment in 2015 and he leaves us well 
positioned for the future. I am also delighted 
that Helen Miles will be his successor. She is 
a highly experienced and commercial CFO with 
a detailed understanding of the water sector 
and a proven track record of exceptional 
delivery. I look forward to continuing to 
work with her on the opportunities ahead 
in her new role.

The past year has once again shown just how 
resilient we are as a business, whether 
operationally, financially, or indeed culturally. 
Through the most challenging times, this 
stable platform has provided the foundation 
from which we can identify opportunities to 
step forward and contribute even more to our 
society. But we know we can always do more 
and we will continue to listen to our wide range 
of stakeholders to understand where we can 
push further.

In the year ahead, we’ll be driving forward the 
first stage of our ten-year Societal Strategy, 
making further sizeable steps towards our 
goal of causing no harm to rivers by 2030 and 
delivering key milestones towards our net zero 
by 2030 commitments. You can read more 
about our exciting plans at Strongford on 
page 19. We’ll be doing all of this while forming 
our plan for the five years to 2030, ensuring 
that it enables us to continue to deliver the 
right outcomes for all of our stakeholders for 
many years to come.

DELIVERING 
OUTCOMES OUR 
CUSTOMERS  
CARE ABOUT

Our services are an essential  
part of everyone’s lives. We  
take this responsibility seriously 
and strive to keep water flowing 
and take waste water away, 
whilst working with customers 
to manage demand. This 
commitment is reflected in the 
continued positive momentum 
in our performance. 

The significant investment in  
our network has bolstered 
our resilience, which is 
demonstrated by our ability 
to maintain service delivery 
for our customers, throughout 
the challenging conditions 
observed during the year.

WATER ALWAYS 
THERE
We’ve nearly halved drinking water 
quality complaints in six years
Our significant investment over the last few 
years has driven sustained improvements in 
our water quality complaints performance. 
This year marks our sixth year-on-year 
improvement – a reduction of 8% on the prior 
year and a 48% reduction in complaints since 
2016/17. Looking ahead, further investment is 
planned for AMP8, including installation of 
additional water quality monitors, to provide 
greater insight on our network and, where 
required, implementation of targeted 
interventions to drive further performance 
improvements for customers. 

Notwithstanding this excellent progress, our 
performance on the Compliance Risk Index 
(‘CRI’, the DWI’s measure of risk to water 
quality) has deteriorated this year. Our 
indicative CRI score for 2022 was 5.65 
(2021/22: 2.43). Our work to understand 
bacteria within our processes, using online 
flow cytometry, which provides live data on 
water safety, has enabled us to deliver 
improvements at our distribution service 
reservoirs. We have implemented a dedicated 
improvement plan, CRISP (‘Compliance Risk 
Index Sustainability Plan’), with the objective of 
eradicating high-impacting events in our water 
network and addressing bacteriological risk at 
water treatment works. We are confident that 
we have the right plans in place to improve 
performance and have already made a positive 
start to the financial year.

Working hard to reduce supply 
interruption events
Reducing supply interruptions remains 
a priority given the direct impact on our 
customers. We are pleased that our 
significant investment over the past few 
years has helped us deliver our best in-AMP 
performance at 9 minutes and 10 seconds; 
however, we are disappointed to have missed 
our stretching target. 

The sector was impacted by a freeze thaw 
event in December 2022. Such events have 
potential to cause significant customer impact 
and it was pleasing that learnings from the 
2018 freeze thaw event enabled us to improve 
our performance by 93% this year. 

Similarly, the significant investment in our water 
network and culture of continuous improvement 
enabled us to navigate the prolonged hot, dry 
weather conditions in 2022 with no enforced 
TUBs and improved service delivery for 
customers compared with similar events of this 
nature. 

The growth of our Network Response Team 
has been a key driver of our positive performance, 
with more teams out in the field, minimising 
the time our customers go without supply. Our 
Academy facilitates the continual training and 
upskilling of our colleagues, improving our 
effectiveness and helping us to learn from 
each event we resolve. You can read more 
about our Academy on page 23.

On track to deliver a 15%  
leakage reduction 
Alongside our supply interruptions activity,  
we have also been working hard on our supply 
capacity. We are particularly proud of our 
leakage performance, having achieved our 
target for eleven out of the last twelve years, 
putting us on track to reduce leakage by 15% 
by 2025 and 50% by 2045 (from a three-year 
rolling average baseline set in 2019/20). We 
are pleased to have delivered a c.2% reduction 
this year, and a 9% reduction since 2019/20. 

To improve leakage performance, we’re fixing 
over 3,000 leaks a month and bolstering our 
teams to reduce the time taken to fix leaks by a 
third. This activity has seen us employ more 
gangs and distribution service technicians.

Our leakage activity is supported by our smart 
meter programme. Smart meters enable us to 
proactively identify potential leaks, mitigating 
risks to customers’ properties and crucially 
helping customers to save money on their 
water bills, all whilst reducing our overall level 
of leakage. We have accelerated our activity 
this year, with over 293,000 meters installed 
already this AMP. Our ongoing work with 
customers to reduce their demand also 
continues to yield positive results.

Working in partnership with our 
customers to reduce demand 
Good progress has been made to achieve our 
goal of adding 93 Ml/d of additional water 
supply at peak capacity (as part of our Green 
Recovery Programme), providing increased 
resilience to hotter, drier summers and winter 
freeze thaw events, and driving further 
performance improvements for customers. 

We maintain a positive, continuous dialogue 
with our customers – directly engaging with 
them on demand management through our 
water efficiency programme. With the help of 
our customers, our aim is to achieve per capita 
consumption of 122 litres per day by 2038 and 
110 litres per day by 2050 against our current 
performance of 138 litres per person, per day. 

Our water efficiency programme has delivered 
a number of customer benefits this year, 
including water efficiency advice through over 
18,800 home visits; installing 100,108 water 
meters and offering free and subsidised water-
saving devices to customers. Our teams 
engage with thousands of customers every 
year to make them aware of how they can save 
water and reduce their bills, educate them on 
the sewage treatment process and share the 
way in which we are reducing our carbon 
footprint to help protect the environment.

DELIVERING OUTCOMES OUR CUSTOMERS CARE ABOUT CONTINUED

Alongside this direct customer engagement, 
our dedicated schools programme helps 
educate children living in our region. Last year, 
we continued our programme of school visits, 
delivering assemblies, workshops and 
classroom sessions, and utilising our 
interactive Wonderful Water Tour vehicles. The 
‘digi-bus’ and ‘experi-bus’ introduce children 
to everything water and waste water related 
using virtual reality and hands-on water 
activities, such as fixing leaks, water quality 
sampling and sewer misuse exercises. At the 
end of our sessions, we ask children to pledge 
their commitments and we collected over 
122,000 behavioural commitments this year.

Customer experience 
We have significant focus on our customers’ 
experience when dealing with us. Our ambition 
is to ensure that all customer queries are dealt 
with in a timely manner and deliver an 
outstanding experience for all.

C-MeX, Ofwat’s measure of customer 
experience, places the same weighting on the 
perceptions of all of our customers as on those 
who contact us. This year, our C-MeX score 
ranked ninth in the sector. We recognise there 
is more to do ensuring we can answer our 
customers’ queries at point of contact, and 
keeping customers informed.

We continue to offer our customers a multi-
channel offering and have seen a growth year 
on year in customers visiting our website for 
information and paying their bills online. Our 
digital first strategy focuses on ease, efficiency 
and experience. This model helps make sure 
our teams are available for customers when 
their queries are more complex across other 
channels. Our 2023/24 priorities focus on 
continuing to make interactions easy for 
customers, increasing point of contact 
resolution and keeping customers informed 
when this is not possible. 

We continue to perform well in developer 
services, with our D-MeX score ranking third 
this year.

REDUCING DEMAND

During the 2022 hot weather period, we 
directly engaged with customers across a 
range of channels – including text 
message, email and social media 
channels. We focused on behavioural 
change initiatives to deliver and sustain 
demand reduction. The incredible support 
from our customers meant that we didn’t 
need to impose a TUB, otherwise known 
as a hosepipe ban, maintaining service 
delivery for our customers when they 
needed it most.

The number of sewer

Every day, we take almost 3 billion litres of our 
customers’ waste water away, ready to be 
made safe to return to the natural 
environment. We have invested significantly in 
our waste operations over the last 30 years to 
deliver the services that our customers rightly 
expect and minimise our impact on the 
environment. We recognise that there is more 
we can do and we have a critical role in driving 
the improvements our customers expect.

Our best ever year on serious 
pollutions performance 
We are proud of our total pollutions 
performance, which has seen a year-on-year 
improvement of 5.4%, along with an 8% increase 
in the proportion of pollutions self-reported this 
year. We are highly confident in achieving EPA 4* 
status by the EA for a fourth consecutive year. 

Reducing sewer flooding 
and blockages 
We recognise that not all our measures have 
performed to the level that both we and our 
customers expect. Sewer flooding remains a 
key focus, and despite our performance being 
one of the best in the sector, we have set 
ourselves some really stretching targets which 
unfortunately we have not delivered this year.

Early investment in the AMP coupled with our 
active approach to maintenance has driven 
year-on-year improvements in our hydraulic 
flooding performance. However, with the 
extremes in weather and some areas of 
performance requiring improvement, we 
still have room to improve. We are tackling 
this challenge head on and have increased 
proactive investment during the year, 
targeting ‘at risk’ areas. 

We have insourced key functions such as our 
‘blue light’ Network Response Team, giving 
us more resilience and flexibility in-house, 
while our work to optimise our planning and 
scheduling function has helped improve 
our response times, for example reducing 
the time taken to fix leaks by a third. 

We have also quadrupled the size of our 
Network Protection Team, which 
communicates directly with customers to 
educate on what can and cannot go into 
sewers, helping to prevent blockages. We are 
continuing to work in partnership with food 
service providers in our region to prevent oils, 
fats and greases from entering the network. 
We firmly believe that our performance led 
culture and desire to do the right thing set us 
up for success to tackle sewer floodings and 
bolster our sector-leading waste performance.

OUR ‘BIN THE  
WIPE’ CAMPAIGN

In April 2023, we announced our ‘Bin The 
Wipe’ initiative in support of a new campaign 
led by Water UK. 22% of people in the UK 
admit to flushing wet wipes down the toilet. 
This is the biggest cause of fatbergs that 
block sewage systems. 

By joining us on this campaign, our 
customers can help us protect the 
environment and prevent homes and 
businesses being flooded. This work 
complements our Get River Positive river 
pledge to support legislation to ban wet 
wipes that contain plastic and lobby for a 
ban on all wet wipes that are not ‘Fine to 
Flush’. You can read more on our website

RUNNING A BUSINESS  
THAT GOES HAND-IN-HAND  
WITH NATURE

Our natural environment 
catches, holds, carries, and 
helps purify our water. And the 
climate drives many of our 
critical functions; from the filling 
of our reservoirs to the ways in 
which our customers use water.

We are delighted that our biodiversity 
approach has been recognised 
externally, including at the Responsible 
Business Awards, where we were the 
winners of the Biodiversity Champion 
Award. We also won a partnership award 
at the Chartered Institute of Ecology and 
Environmental Management Awards.

Our environment cannot be taken for granted 
and, as such, our Strategy to be ‘performance 
driven, sustainability led’ pushes us to deliver 
strong performance in balance with the 
long-term needs of our environment – not only 
because it’s the right thing to do, but because 
we see it as a fundamental opportunity to 
innovate, grow and create long-term value 
for our stakeholders. 

This section of our report sets out how our 
positive actions will ensure a sustainable 
water cycle, enhance the environment, 
mitigate climate change and ensure we 
are resilient to its impact – in line with our 
strategic pillar to run a business that goes 
hand-in-hand with nature. 

Our Net Zero Transition Plan and Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(‘TCFD’) can be found on pages 39 to 56 and 58 
to 61 respectively – and are clearly labelled to 
aid readers of this report.

A YEAR ON FROM THE  
COMMONWEALTH GAMES 
We were proud to be the Official Nature and 
Carbon Neutral partner of the Birmingham 
2022 Commonwealth Games held in July and 
August 2022 – by providing critical 
infrastructure to the Games, with 40 water 
bar stations, saving almost 500,000 plastic 
bottles, and continuing to plant our 2,022 
acre legacy forest. This activity supported 
the Games’ ambition to be the most 
sustainable ever. 

Alongside these activities, our people, 
customers and communities worked 
together to create 72 Tiny Forests, one for 
each Commonwealth nation, in urban areas 
across our region, delivering a lasting 
legacy for the Commonwealth Games and 
creating inspiring outdoor classrooms for 
children to learn first hand about nature and 
the environment for many years to come.

Progress against our  
Great Big Nature Boost 
In 2020, we announced our Great Big Nature 
Boost, one of the biggest nature projects in the UK, 
to boost nature across 5,000 hectares of land in 
our region by 2027 and to plant 1.3 million trees. 
We are proud to have exceeded our biodiversity 
target four years early, and in May 2023, we 
announced that we will be extending and 
accelerating our commitment to improve 
biodiversity by doubling our target to 10,000 
hectares by 2025. This now means our work will 
account for 2% of the nation’s 2042 Nature 
Recovery Network target. 

Working with the Woodland Trust, we have 
planted almost 230,000 trees this year, taking 
us over halfway towards our 1.3 million target 
by 2030. This is a wonderful example of the 
associated benefits of our biodiversity 
ambitions, as these trees will also provide 
natural protection against the worst effects of 
climate change, as well as enriching the natural 
environment of the communities we serve.

Innovation Fund to deploy innovative new 
technologies developed in collaboration 
with our global partners. This innovative 
and collaborative project will integrate new 
technologies and innovations to trial at 
scale, providing a carbon neutral blueprint 
for all companies within the sector.

Being a net zero sector leader means 
we will be able to share our learnings 
globally to benefit our sector and our planet.

GET RIVER 
POSITIVE 

River quality remains a critical priority for our stakeholders. 
Our region’s river health is not just essential to the communities 
we serve, but also to the success of our business. We are 
committed to making a positive impact on the environment  
and recognise that, as a sector, there is more we need to do 
to help our region’s rivers be the healthiest they can be. 

Five industry-leading pledges to make  
our region’s rivers the healthiest they  
can be, as quickly as possible

We continue to invest £100 million a year 
to improve our waste water infrastructure

Severn Trent is currently responsible  
for 16% of RNAGS in our region and  
this continues to reduce

Storm overflow performance in 2022 
already at 2025 target

19 out of a possible 20 EPA stars from 
the EA over the last five years

Over £278,000 granted to four regional 
community projects benefiting rivers

Our ten full-time River Rangers have 
attended over 110 meetings, working with 
our partners, environment groups and 
the local communities

In March 2022, we announced our commitment 
to ‘Get River Positive’; establishing five river 
pledges. We provide an update on each of 
these pledges on the next page. 

Through our significant investment, this year 
has seen us deliver significant improvements 
in river quality, reducing our share of RNAGS 
(Reasons for Not Achieving Good Status) in our 
region to 16%. We have reduced the number of 
RNAGS that Severn Trent is responsible for 
from 960 to 870 this year and we are 
committed to driving this down to zero by 2030.

We want our stakeholders to hold us to account 
on issues of importance to them and we 
published our first Get River Positive Annual 
Report this year, which outlines the progress 
we have made since the launch of our river 
pledges – ensuring that all of our stakeholders 
have access to the facts so they can form a 
balanced opinion. 

Our monitoring is providing us with 
300 million data records each year on 
how our storm overflows are performing

ENSURE STORM OVERFLOWS

DO NOT HARM RIVERS

SUPPORT OTHERS TO IMPROVE  
AND CARE FOR RIVERS 

OPEN AND TRANSPARENT  
ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE  
AND OUR PLANS

Progress in 2022/23 

Progress in 2022/23 

Progress in 2022/23 

We have delivered significant progress on our 
storm overflow performance, reducing storm 
overflow activations from an average of 25 to 
18 per year. Our share of reasons for rivers in 
our region not achieving good ecological status 
has fallen from 24% to 16%. While this puts us 
well ahead of our plan, we are continuing to 
work hard to improve our region’s rivers, both 
through our own activity and supporting others 
to improve and care for rivers too. 

While some of last year’s improvement can be 
attributed to 2022’s dry summer, the majority 
reflect the significant capital and operational 
investments we have made. For example, by 
increasing our investment in waste water 
treatment screens, which remove debris from 
flows into our works, we have been able to 
expand storm tank capacity, increasing the 
flow through our network. This activity is also 
being supported by our new training river at 
our Academy. This new experimental asset will 
help train more of our teams to respond safely 
and effectively to potential pollution events. 

We are committed to taking the lead on many 
of the issues our region’s rivers face and to 
partner with others to make them the 
healthiest they can be. Over the last year, we 
have delivered a series of community 
roadshows, inviting customers to come along 
and hear about our Get River Positive plans, 
our Green Recovery scheme and the work 
we’re doing to create Bathing Rivers in 
Warwickshire and Shropshire. To date, we have 
delivered eight events, attended by hundreds 
of people, with more scheduled in 2023/24.

We have focused on improving the 
transparency of our reporting this year and 
continue to look at new ways, such as our Get 
River Positive Annual Report, to demonstrate 
our progress in a transparent way. We have 
Event Duration Monitors (‘EDMs’) on 100% of 
our storm overflows. These monitors record 
data at two or 15 minute intervals, providing us 
with over 300 million data records annually 
about how our storm overflows are 
performing, ensuring we are fulfilling the 
permit conditions as defined by the EA.

While we do not own our regions’ rivers, we 
recognise that we have an important role to 
play in improving river health. Our Community 
Fund has supported a number of community 
groups and charities that are as passionate as 
us about improving our regions’ rivers – 
awarding over £278,000 since 2022 to brilliant 
projects that will have a positive impact on our 
regions’ rivers.

We also launched our new package to promote 
regenerative farming practices in May 2022, 
with farmers in the Severn Trent region being 
offered matched funding of up to £30,000. To 
date, the package has supported 84 farmers 
across our region, encouraging environmentally 
friendly farming practices and protecting 
water quality.

In October 2022, we established our Get River 
Positive Independent Advisory Panel with the 
objective of helping to oversee our progress 
against each commitment and ensure we 
maximise the benefits our campaigns will 
deliver. The Panel meets on a quarterly basis 
to support activity around the pledges, 
providing advice and recommendations, and 
bringing new perspectives as well as feeding 
in relevant national plans, programmes and 
policies, especially in relation to the wider 
environmental agenda.

Our Green Recovery Team has launched an 
innovative floating wetland near our Church 
Wilne water treatment works in Derbyshire. This 
project will help pre-treat the water, whilst also 
improving the biodiversity of 46 hectares. Each 
floating wetland naturally improves the 
surrounding water quality of the site, encourages 
habitat regeneration and supports numerous 
birds, mammals, invertebrates and aquatic life. 
We have created three floating wetlands to date, 
with a further 27 set to be launched in 2023/24.

Progress in 2022/23 

We have made significant progress on our 
£78 million Bathing Rivers Green Recovery 
Programme over the past twelve months. In 
2022, we launched our extensive river 
monitoring and sampling programmes and 
installed 76 water quality monitors on the 
rivers Leam and Teme. These monitors are 
helping to build the best picture of current 
river health and provide the data we need to 
develop our forecasting tool for river users. We 
have invested in new and upgraded sewer 
infrastructure as well as trialling ozone 
disinfection technology to ensure that we 
continue to clean waste water to the highest 
possible standard.

Our dedicated River Ranger Team was 
established in January 2022 and since then has 
carried out over 3,500 riverside inspections. 
These additional sampling and monitoring 
activities provide us with further data so we 
can better understand the quality of rivers in 
our regions and inform any further action that 
may be required. Our River Rangers work 
closely with local stakeholders to build vital 
relationships as we all work towards the goal 
of making our region’s rivers the healthiest 
they can be. Since January 2022, the Team has 
attended over 110 meetings with partners and 
environment and community groups on the 
subject of river health.

We are also working in partnership with other 
stakeholders who impact river health, such as 
farmers, through our ‘Test, Protect and 
Improve’ programme, with the objective of 
educating stakeholders on the impact and 
prevention of faecal diseases.

As part of our Community Champions scheme, 
every Severn Trent employee can spend two 
working days a year doing voluntary work to 
further support our Get River Positive 
commitments.

CARING FOR PEOPLE  
IN OUR REGION

Showing care is one of our 
Values and we want that to 
shine through whenever we 
meet people in our region. We 
know that our sector-leading 
performance is made possible 
thanks to our dedicated people. 
The vast majority of our people, 
and their friends and families, 
are also our customers, who live 
in the communities we serve. 

This section of our report sets 
out how we are taking positive 
action to deliver our strategic 
pillar to care for people in 
our region. 

Helping our own people to thrive
Our people are fundamental to taking care of one 
of life’s essentials and we believe our culture is 
what makes us special. Our teams are 
passionate about the positive role they can play 
in helping customers and communities thrive 
and they want an environment where everyone 
can feel comfortable to bring their whole self to 
work. You can read more about how we have 
listened to and engaged with our colleagues 
on page 89 to 90.

Keeping our people safe and well
We believe passionately that no one should be 
hurt or made unwell by what we do, and our 
people have done a great job of keeping 
themselves, and those around them safe, with 
a total of 16 Lost Time Incidents (‘LTIs’) this 
year (2021/22: 19), our best ever performance. 

Though 16 of our colleagues getting hurt 
while working is still too many, since we 
refreshed our strategy in 2018/19, we have 
seen consecutive year-on-year improvements, 
giving us confidence that our strategy will 
continue to drive improvements in our 
future performance. 

Employee support 
We continue to raise awareness of the different 
types of support available to employees. Over 
the last few years, we have trained over 2,570 
of our employees in some form of Mental 
Health First Aid, and 36% of our current 
workforce have received mental health 
training. We now have over 390 active Mental 
Health First Aiders and Champions, who wear 
a yellow lanyard to be easily identifiable and 
available to provide in-the-moment support. 
Our series of mental health podcasts have also 
kept discussions going and encouraged us 
all to keep talking.

We recognise that in-house support may not 
be the right answer for everyone, and as such 
we continue to promote the support available 
via our Employee Assistance Programme 
(‘EAP’). This is a service provided by Vita 
Health, available 24 hours a day for emotional, 
legal or career support. It is also available to 
spouses or partners, and any dependants 
between the ages of 16 and 25.

We are mindful of the effect that the increasing 
cost of living is having on our employees, and 
we continue to do everything we can to help 
support our people. See our graphic on page 
24 for more information. At our annual 
leadership event held at Tittesworth Reservoir

SEVERN TRENT PLC  

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

in September, we reminded all of our leaders 
and team managers of the extensive range 
of free benefits that are available to all 
employees. We were delighted to offer two 
new all-employee benefits during 2022. The 
first, launched in October, was our partnership 
with Seniorcare by Lottie, which provides free 
support in sourcing care for elderly or disabled 
family members. 

The second, launched in November, provides 
employees with a discount on nursery fees 
with Busy Bees nurseries, the UK’s largest 
nursery company, where employees can 
receive a 10% discount on fees, equating to 
a saving of more than £1,000 a year based 
on a child in full-time nursery care.

HAWKSLEY PARK 
– NEW EXPERIENTIAL 
TRAINING ASSETS

In March 2023, the Academy introduced two 
new experiential training assets: Hawksley 
House and the River Bown. These are a 
‘training house’ and ‘training river’ which 
represent the assets, customers and 
environment we interact with and influence 
every day.

Hawksley House enables us to train our 
people in a ‘real-life’ environment. We want 
learners to increase their curiosity on 
detecting leaks, show courage and care 
when interacting with customers and take 
pride in knowing every potential aspect of 
leakage has been investigated and resolved 
for our customers. 

Training on the River Bown involves a range 
of scenarios across water treatment, waste 
water recycling and water networks. The 
scenarios are based on a range of real-life 
experiences with the intention of making 
sure learners understand the impact of 
their actions, the importance of following 
procedures and undertaking problem 
solving, all while under the pressure of an 
event. The River Bown facility also deepens 
employees’ personal connections with the 
rivers we protect.

Listening to our people
Providing opportunities for our employees to 
stay connected to the direction of the Company 
and be involved in business decisions is a key 
part of our culture, and we are always looking 
for new and different ways for the Board to 
engage with employees from across the 
business. You can read about how we have 
engaged with our employees throughout the 
year in our dedicated stakeholder engagement 
section entitled ‘Engagement in Action – Our 
colleagues’, on pages 89 to 90.

Developing our people 
Our Academy opened in February 2021, 
supporting our ambition to be a socially 
purposeful company in all that we do, giving back 
to the communities we live and work in, and 
providing opportunities for people to learn, 
develop and retrain with us in our industry. 
During the past year, over 22,700 learners have 
passed through its doors and we have hosted 765 
learning events generating over 56,000 learning 
hours at our Academy. We have delivered over 
71,000 hours against our 100,000 free 
employability training hours target by face-to-
face and virtual delivery and self serve online 
platforms. We have supported 17,900 people in 
our community and delivered 583 events.  

We recognise that everyone learns in different 
ways and that is why the Academy goes beyond 
classroom learning, using a combination of the 
latest technology, including virtual reality, 
simulation and online learning. 

As part of our Academy offering, we also 
facilitate mentoring and coaching, helping 
employees develop or giving them the chance 
to help develop others. We remain one of only 
three water companies who are fully 
accredited as an employer apprenticeship 
provider, meaning we can deliver our own 
in-house apprenticeship pathways for waste 
and water treatment and water networks. 

Future Leaders Programme 
Our six-month Future Leaders Programme is 
designed to help those who do not have line 
management experience develop their skills 
in a practical way so they can move into their 
first manager role within twelve months of 
completing the programme. Since its launch in 
July 2021, 112 colleagues have completed the 
programme, 80 of those having done so this 
year, with 38% having already been promoted 
to a line management position.

New Manager Induction Pathway
Throughout the year, our wonderful team at 
the Academy developed a digital pathway for 
new managers, helping to guide them through 
their first 100 days. It breaks down all they 
need to know into five headings: team; health 
safety and wellbeing; systems; performance; 
and process. The pathways link together 
learning content from across the business so 
that new managers have a single point of 
reference. The pathway is automatically 
assigned to new managers when they start and 
is available to all managers regardless of their 
tenure with the Company.

Senior Management Development 
Having assessed the collective strengths and 
development areas of our Senior Management 
Team (‘SMT’), we have been hosting a series of 
masterclasses as part of our SMT 
Development Pathway. These sessions focus 
on a range of areas including: regulation; 
sustainability; financial management; 
coaching; and personal growth and 
development. The masterclass approach, 
run by SMT members for their peers, has 
received positive feedback.

Elective Treatment Fund 
“I am currently recovering from an 
operation where my right hip and 
part of my femur were replaced. 
After years of hospital visits and 
osteopath treatment to address the 
rotation problems associated with the 
misalignment, I was advised that a hip 
replacement and realignment would 
be required due to a rapid deterioration 
of the joint. The route for treatment 
involved a four-year waiting list. I 
applied for the elective treatment 
fund for private treatment and was 
supported by Severn Trent through a 
50% contribution to my overall cost of 
treatment. Everyone involved was so 
supportive throughout, which was a 
huge help. I am now pain free and 
recovering, so to get this done so 
quickly is life changing and will 
improve my quality of life and that 
of my family no end.”

“I’ve really loved the meditation 
sessions on YuLife. It’s become part 
of my daily routine to the extent that 
I actually feel myself relaxing just 
opening the app”.

“The other brilliant part of the app 
is that I have managed to get three 
vouchers to spend on myself by 
earning YuCoins for completing daily 
challenges, which is a massive benefit 
with the current cost of living.”

“I’ve been using the app since it was 
launched. I love all the challenges and, 
as a keen runner training for the 
marathon I use the walking challenges 
a lot. I also try to meditate daily and 
love how easy it is to access meditation 
in the app. My kids often join me in the 
morning, and we do a short meditation 
which is a nice way to start the day.”

Wonderfully You – providing a diverse 
and inclusive place to work
At Severn Trent, we celebrate diversity and 
inclusion, and embrace individuals’ 
contributions, no matter what their age, gender, 
race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, 
social background, religion or belief. Having 
a culture that enables individuals to truly be 
themselves is a vital part of our future success. 

Our Diversity and Inclusion (‘D&I’) strategy is 
included within our Sustainability Framework 
under the ‘Helping people to thrive’ pillar. In 
September 2021, we launched ‘Wonderfully 
You’, our D&I ambition to ensure we continue 
to reflect the communities we serve. 

Success means we can feel comfortable that 
we are tapping into every available talent pool 
in our community, and that we can best serve 
our customers because we understand their 
needs. Our plans to achieve that include 
widening our outreach programmes so that 
we attract more applications from under-
represented groups, breaking down some of 
the historical stereotypes that might prevent 
people from considering certain career paths, 
and making sure that we have a level playing 
field at the selection stage. 

Our ambition for inclusion is to develop and 
maintain a fair working environment where 
everyone can succeed. We measure our 
progress through our annual engagement 
survey and monitor the parity or disparity 
between different ethnicities and genders. 
Reverse mentoring and our Employee Advisory 
Groups have also helped to give our employees 
a voice across the organisation so that we 
can educate each other about our differences 
and have a say in our company policies 
and procedures. 

Over the last year, we have continued to 
champion the voices of colleagues from 
diverse backgrounds, in part through our four 
Employee Advisory Groups for LGBTQ+, 
Ethnicity, Disability, and Women in STEM and 
Operations. You can read more about their 
achievements throughout the year on pages 
26 to 27. 

We are proud of our track record on gender 
diversity, and we were delighted that Severn 
Trent was recognised as a Top 3 FTSE100 
company for representation of women on the 
Board in the FTSE Women Leaders Review 
2023. Following our announcement that Helen 
Miles would succeed James Bowling as CFO 
effective 6 July 2023, Severn Trent will become 
the first company in the FTSE100 to have a 
female Chair, CEO and CFO. 

As at 31 March 2023, our Executive Team 
comprised three female and six male members 
(33% and 67% respectively). 19 members (39%) 
of our senior leaders were female and 30 were 
male (61%). Female representation in the Group 
was 29% (2,290 women), with male 
representation at 71% (5,649 men). Five 
members of our Board were female (56%) and 
four were male (44%). The table below sets out 
a gender breakdown of Directors, senior 
managers (as defined in the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code and Companies Act 2006) and 
employees of the Company as at 31 March 2023. 

Our November 2022 employee engagement 
survey results (8.4) showed that we are still 
well ahead of benchmark on both engagement 
(+1.0 on global benchmark – putting us in the 
top 5% of energy and utilities companies) and 
our equality score (9.0) (+1.0 on global 
benchmark – putting us in the top 10% of 
energy and utilities companies). Females now 
score higher than males, at 8.5 compared to 
8.4, but we have work to do on minority ethnic 
inclusion parity where there is still a gap.

(see case study on the right).

 – Neurodiversity Training Course.

 – Pan Disability Job Fair with Sense.

 – Introduced recruitment ‘super-users’ 

to ensure candidates who flag that they

a range of topics, including Neurodiversity, 
Workplace Adjustment Passports, Being 
a Carer and much more.

UK have a disability and 
many are unemployed. 
We’re looking to build a truly 
inclusive culture towards 
disability and other health 
conditions, removing barriers 
to allow every colleague to 
fulfil their potential and be 
their true, authentic self at 
Severn Trent. 

Shane Anderson  
Director of Strategy and Regulation

NEURODIVERSITY 
NETWORKING EVENT
As more and more people become aware 
of neurodivergent traits in themselves, 
their family, and friends, it’s increasingly 
important that we improve our 
understanding of neurodiversity, too. 
It’s thought that at least 15% of the UK’s 
population are neurodivergent.

In 2022, we hosted our first ever 
Neurodiversity Networking Event to help 
increase the visibility of neurodiversity in 
our business and promote a better 
understanding of different neurodiverse 
conditions. The event was open to all 
colleagues as we want everyone to feel 
positive, empowered and able to bring 
their whole selves to work. 

Following the huge success of the event, 
led by the Disability Advisory Group, a 
neurodiversity training programme was 
launched in March 2023, in partnership 
with our Academy, and so far over 350 
colleagues have attended these sessions.

WOMEN IN STEM AND OPERATIONS
2022/23 Highlights
 – Continued to improve our Personal

Applications opened in 2023 for our biggest 
ever intake of 210 apprentices, with roles 
available right across our region, ranging from 
level two (equivalent to GCSEs) to level seven 
(equivalent to a degree) apprenticeships 
available in Operations, Commercial, HR, 
Customer Service, Business Administration 
and Engineering. 

Once our apprentices have successfully 
passed the programme, they’re guaranteed 
a permanent role with us. Jade Pearson, our 
New Talent Lead, said: “We’re really proud of 
the continual growth of our apprenticeship 
programme, creating opportunities for people 
in our communities to gain the skills and 
knowledge that will lead them into a 
meaningful career and helping us deliver the 
best service and outcome for our customers 
and the environment”.

Since 2014, over 590 apprentices have joined 
us at Severn Trent and 82% of these individuals 
are still with us. 

Our #10000BlackInterns programme was a 
huge success last year, with 61 placements 
and 44% of those gaining employment 
following their placement with us. 

In 2021, we announced that we had embraced 
the Government Kickstart Scheme with our 
ambitious plans to support 500 unemployed 
16-to-24 year-olds into employment with paid 
work experience and skills development. We 
are delighted that over 340 individuals chose to 
join us, 106 of which went on to gain full time 
employment with us. Of those 106 individuals, 
69% are still with us at Severn Trent. 

CIPD AWARDS
We are proud to have been recognised for 
our work by winning last year’s CIPD 
People Management Awards for ‘Best 
Employee Experience’, which included 
entrants from a range of high-profile 
organisations in the UK. We are also 
pleased to benchmark highly in the Tortoise 
Responsibility100 Index across of range of 
employee-focused measures, ranking first 
in the ‘Good Business’ measures. 

Fairly rewarding our people
We have been working hard to create a 
consistent framework which includes 
transparent pay ranges to support us in 
measuring our fair pay processes. 

In November 2022, we published our Gender and 
Ethnicity Pay Gap Report, highlighting a slight 
increase in the median gender pay gap between 
women and men, the first increase since we 
began publishing our report. The report shows a 
median pay gap of 9.4%, up from 9.1% in 2021/22, 
as it continues to be positively impacted by a high 
proportion of women within our management 
and senior management roles. 

At the same time, there has been a decrease 
in the mean gender pay gap from 3.8% to 2.9%, 
mainly due to small changes within our 
executive population. Severn Trent is proud 
to have such strong female representation 
throughout our Senior Management Team. We 
believe we have created an environment where 
women can thrive, develop their careers and 
act as role models to others looking to join 
the industry.

Our total number of employees grew by 3.6%, 
with the number of women growing by 3.7%, and 
men by 3.5%. As the fastest growing quartiles 
were upper quartile for women, and the upper 
middle quartile for men; this also contributed to 
the lower mean gender pay gap this year.

After five years of publishing our gender pay gap 
data, we are delighted to have published our 
very first combined Gender and Ethnicity Pay 
Gap Report in November 2022. Our ethnicity pay 
gap information sets out that our median gap is 
4.1% and our mean gap is 5.7%. Around 94% of 
our employees have shared their ethnicity 
information and we continue to actively 
encourage all employees to share their data. 

The full Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gap Report 
can be found on the Severn Trent Plc website 
and further information regarding employee 
pay can be found in our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 141 to 163. 

All of our employees have the opportunity to 
become part-owners of the Company through 
our popular Sharesave Scheme and an 
amazing 73.4% (5,710 employees) participate 
across all schemes, with 26.1% of participants 
saving the maximum of £500 per month 
across all schemes.

Remuneration: The Company 
Remuneration section, in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, sets out the steps 
we take to make sure that our pay and 
reward framework, below Executive and 
senior management, is transparent in a way 
that is meaningful and useful for 
stakeholders. You can read more on pages 
141 to 163.

Attracting and retaining diverse 
talent
An inclusive environment is the foundation of a 
truly diverse organisation, with all of the 
rewards that brings. Our successful in-house 
recruitment model has proven beneficial, 
enabling us to continue to attract and retain 
quality talent. Our team of in-house recruiters 
is able to work directly with candidates, 
demonstrating our Purpose and culture first 
hand and attracting individuals who embody 
our Values. It has also ensured that our D&I 
ambitions remain a priority. 

Long term, one of our greatest opportunities to 
improve diversity is through our New Talent 
Programmes. While not all of our graduates 
and apprentices come straight from school, our 
work in schools and colleges is helping to 
improve the diversity of our intakes. 24.5% of 
our apprenticeship intake for 2022 were 
individuals from an ethnic minority background, 
almost double that of our last intake.

WELCOME TO OUR 
2022 EMPLOYABILITY 
INTERNS!
We are thrilled to have welcomed five new 
interns in September from Hereward 
College and Derwen College, to gain work 
experience and help develop their 
employability skills, whilst they complete 
their studies at college. These important 
partnerships enable us to support students 
with Special Educational Needs and 
Disabilities, and make a huge difference to 
students’ futures. Around 16% of the 
working age population have a disability 
and the proportion of adults with a learning 
disability in paid employment has 
decreased over time, from 6.0% in 2014/15 
to a low of 5.1% in 2020/21.

A FORCE  
FOR GOOD  
FOR CUSTOMERS
To be truly impactful in our 
communities, we need to help 
more of our customers who 
need support today. 
Our average combined bill for the year – 
around £1 a day – remains one of the lowest in 
the country, and we will continue to offer one of 
the lowest bills in AMP7. Even though our bills 
are low, some customers have difficulty paying 
and we make it clear to our customers that we 
don’t want anyone to struggle to pay. 

In May 2022, we announced a new £30 million 
affordability package allowing us to help a 
further 100,000 people to reduce their water 
bill by up to 90% through our social tariff. In 
August 2022 we simplifying the qualifying 
criteria and raised the household income 
threshold from £16,480 to £18,278. By 2025, 
our financial support schemes will be 
supporting about 315,000 or 6% of our 
customers, in line with the number of 
customers assessed as living in water poverty 
in our region. We are on track to support an 
additional 315,000 customers with 237,069 
customers benefiting from support on their 
bills already.

The graphic on page 30 brings to life the 
many support initiatives we have in place for 
our customers and wider communities.

SUPPORTING 
VULNERABLE 
CUSTOMERS
We now have more than 7.7% of our 
customers signed up to our Priority 
Services Register (‘PSR’), an increase of 
35% on the prior year. Our PSR ensures 
those who need additional support are 
prioritised during an incident so we can 
provide them with bespoke communication 
and a personalised service.

Engaging hard-to-reach,  
vulnerable customers 
We continue to use innovation to support our 
customers who are struggling. We have been 
working with the Consumer Council for Water 
and three other companies on the Ofwat 
Innovation Fund project ‘Supporting customers 
in vulnerable circumstances’. The pilot used 
behavioural science to improve engagement 
and, in December 2022, we launched the 
‘Engaging hard-to-reach, vulnerable 
customers’ playbook to the sector, setting 
out our learnings. This is aimed at those 
who might not have the language or capabilities 
to contact us in a time of crisis when they 
need support.

CREATING OPPORTUNITIES  
IN OUR COMMUNITIES 

Improving employability
We care deeply about our communities and 
as a large employer we have a key role to 
play in skills regeneration in our region. We 
are now just over a year into our two-year 
commitment of offering 100,000 hours of free 
employability support in our communities. 

Providing a variety of entry routes into our 
organisation is an important part of our 
employability strategy. For example, our New 
Talent Programmes provide an opportunity 
and structure for individuals at the start of 
their career or who wish to change career to 
gain skills for life that will lead them into a 
highly skilled, well-paid career. This year we 
have created our largest and most diverse 
range of programmes, including 210 
apprenticeships and 53 graduate roles. This is 
reflected in the range of individuals that apply 
for our programmes, including our highest 
number of under 18s, a broader range of 
mature apprentices, and internal colleagues 
who wish to pursue a different career. 

We recognise the importance of reflecting the 
communities we serve and we are really 
encouraged to see that 33% of our new talent 
has joined us from social mobility cold spots 
this year.

We know the main causes of water poverty are 
unemployment and low-paid work, both of 
which can be prevented through meaningful 
work experience. Equipping young people with 
work experience reduces the likelihood of a 
young person becoming NEET (‘Not in 
Education, Employment, or Training’) from 
26.1% to 4.3%. This is why it is important for 
us, as a large socially purposeful employer, to 
continue to create and broaden the types of 
work experience placements we offer. We have 
revamped our employability offer from school 
age through to university. Our overarching 
ambition is that as students get closer to the 
job market, we transition them through from 
inspiration to attraction onto one of our new 
talent programmes, building a pipeline of 
diverse talent now and for the future. 

To date we have delivered  
just over: 

of training and 

40,000 
hours
20,000 
hours

of employment experience.

A YEAR OF RIVER 
RANGERS
Our team of River Rangers celebrated their 
first anniversary in their role, dedicated to 
protecting rivers in Coventry and 
Warwickshire.

The team of ten rangers covers the Severn 
Trent region and works closely with 
partners to focus on improving river health 
and boosting biodiversity along stretches 
of the Midlands’ rivers. 

As well as educating customers to prevent 
wipes and sanitary products from reaching 
rivers, the team carries out vital operational, 
monitoring and sampling activities that 
inform our understanding of the contributors 
to river quality and what’s needed to protect 
and improve them. 

In addition to our River Ranger Team, we 
launched our Get River Positive river 
pledges in March 2022 to provide a clear 
and actionable response to calls for a 
revival of rivers in England. 

We have committed that, by 2030, our 
operations will not be the reason for any 
stretch of river in our region to be 
classified as unhealthy. Severn Trent is 
currently responsible for 16% of reasons 
for rivers in our region not achieving good 
ecological status. We are working in 
partnership with the other parties 
contributing to the 84% to address this 
important issue.

STRATEGIC REPORTCARING FOR PEOPLE IN OUR REGION CONTINUED

OUR SOCIETAL STRATEGY 

On 22 November 2022, we launched our Societal Strategy, with the 
objective of helping up to 100,000 people in our region, giving them 
improved chances in life and tackling the underlying causes of 
poverty. Our ten-year plan is a huge undertaking, and we are 
passionate about helping households across our region and will 
achieve this by working closely with communities and partner 
organisations. 

Our Societal Strategy will see us: working with 
schools to provide 300 work experience 
placements for children and delivering 10,000 
hours of free skills training and employability 
training in the first year in communities and 
schools to support individuals into their first 
job, or back in to work; and embedding 
ourselves directly within communities through 
pop-up learning and support hubs, which will 
take over unused retail spaces and community 
hubs. Our Societal Strategy is supported by a 
network of local partnerships in areas with 
high deprivation.

SOCIETAL STRATEGY AMBITION:

By 2032, we want to give 100,000 
people in, or at risk of, poverty the 
tools to improve their life chances, 
through access to high-quality 
employment-related training and 
career opportunities.

MEANINGFUL  
WORK EXPERIENCE
We increased the number of placements to 
300 and developed new work experience 
opportunities. Young people can choose 
between a traditional work experience 
week or to join a Discovery Day. Run at our 
Academy or Head Office, Discovery Days 
allow school groups to come and meet a 
range of departments and take part in 
workshops and group projects. Working 
with new partner schools in East 
Birmingham and Derby, meaningful work 
experience further consolidates and brings 
to life the employability skills training that 
the pupils receive in schools as part of our 
new schools offer. 

EMPLOYABILITY  
TRAINING IN 
SCHOOLS 
We developed a new bespoke schools offer 
and set up new partnerships with eight 
secondary schools in East Birmingham 
and three in Derby. 

We go into large, inner city schools and 
take over a year group for a day to deliver 
employability skills and training sessions 
to hundreds of young people. The multi-
year partnerships mean we will be able to 
interact with pupils at different stages of 
their school career. 

ACADEMY POP-UPS
We are working with community groups in 
East Birmingham and Derby to ‘pop-up’ 
with our free employability skills training. 

We run training sessions for people out of 
work or looking for a change; supporting 
people to grow their confidence and 
explore career opportunities. 

We link the training sessions with access 
to advice on available affordability support 
and, in Derby, current open roles at Severn 
Trent. 

MENTORING  
YOUNG PEOPLE  
IN PRISON
In parallel with our place-based approach 
in East Birmingham and Derby, we are 
working with a specific group of young 
people not in NEET. 

In partnership with charity Trailblazers, 
Severn Trent staff will mentor young 
people weekly for their last six months in 
prison and up to twelve months post-
release in the community. This work 
complements our existing work with 
NEETs, such as our apprentice and 
internship offer.

1. BATHING RIVERS

Our Goal

Install ozone effluent disinfection at three sewage 
treatment works, and build new storage and sewer 
capacity to reduce the environmental impact of around 
25 storm overflows in order to:

 – improve the water quality on stretches of the River 

Leam and River Teme; 

 – pass on what we learn to other organisations as part 
of our efforts to understand what it takes to achieve, 
and to ensure the UK’s rivers can achieve, ‘good 
ecological status’; and

 – create more leisure opportunities and improve 
wellbeing, and deliver environmental benefits, 
which includes enhanced biodiversity and healthier 
aquatic life.

We will also develop new ways of communicating with 
river users so that they understand river water quality 
in real time.

Our progress

We have installed 76 monitors along the River Leam 
and Teme, providing an accurate and detailed picture of 
wider river health. Alongside this activity, we have 
engaged with more than 180 community stakeholders, 
held four focus groups, delivered two roadshows and 
published two bathing rivers newsletters.

We’re working on establishing our UK-first ozone 
treatment processes at three of our waste water 
treatment works. Ozone is a proven technology in 
drinking water treatment, helping remove micro-
pollutants; pesticides, and breaking down heavy metals 
such as iron. 

To understand the best mix of solutions, we’ve also 
revived the drainage catchments. This helps us identify 
what combination of sewer separation, sustainable 
draining, network capacity and tank storage will give 
the best outcome in the round for river health. 

Bathing Rivers Virtual Room

We launched our Bathing Rivers Virtual Room. This is a 
page for the public to get project information and activity 
updates. Since launch, it has had over 1,200 views.

2. SECURING OUR WATER

3. OUR GREENER, CLEANER 
FUTURE FOR MANSFIELD

Our Goal

Our Goal

Increase water supplies by up to 93 Ml/d – enough to 
serve a city the size of Derby. We’ll do this with a 
reduced carbon impact, and let other companies 
know how we’re doing it, supporting the water 
sector’s aim to be net zero by 2030.

All this extra water supply will increase our 
resilience to hotter, drier summers and wetter 
winters, securing water resources for future 
generations. Plus, our work will increase the 
biodiversity of 46 hectares of habitat at our Witches 
Oak site. 

Our progress

We have made brilliant progress on several key 
elements linked to securing water supplies for our 
customers in a carbon efficient way. 

Floating wetlands
The floating wetlands are a series of structures that are 
pre-assembled on the shoreline and floated out onto 
specific positions within each lake. These are planted 
with specialised media and high root density plants, 
designed to capture and biologically remove key 
pollutants found within the river. They have strong yet 
dynamic anchoring systems, allowing them to have 
long life spans while withstanding the rigours of a high 
water table site.

The first three of our floating wetlands were installed 
and floated in December 2022. We have been using 
these as a trial before launching the remaining 27 
structures during 2023.

Pilot plant
During the year we have constructed our pilot plant 
using innovative ceramic membrane. One of the key 
purposes of the pilot plant is to optimise the 
operation of the works in real time, including 
chemical optimisation so that we can operate the 
new Witches Oak site in the most low-carbon way. 
This will also enable us to test the limits of the 
system prior to the mains works putting water into 
supply from the new treatment works.

Witches Oak water treatment works
Our construction of the new Witches Oak water 
treatment works is well underway. Planning 
permission has been granted, and the site has been set 
up. The piling and pouring of concrete for the ceramic 
membrane has started and is progressing well. 

Ceramic membranes have a smaller construction 
footprint than using multiple stages of conventional 
treatment. The pore size means that they are a crypto 
barrier and enable ultraviolet technology to be used for 
disinfection rather than conventional contact tanks. 
They are more robust and therefore have a longer asset 
life than conventional polymeric membranes, which 
reduces the long-term carbon impact.

Non-household audits
We are carrying out audits of 3,000 of our non-
household customers to help business users 
understand how and where they are using water 
and make changes to improve water efficiency. This 
should reduce the amount of additional water that 
needs to be put into the network. We have completed 
522 audits with an estimated saving of 0.137 Ml/d.

Create the UK’s first catchment-scale flood-resilient 
community, using an innovative nature-based 
approach to reduce surface flooding risk. The trial 
is centred around the Mansfield district of 
Nottinghamshire, where we aim to store the 
equivalent of 58,000m3 of surface water in 
‘blue-green’ infrastructure – a range of natural 
surface-flood defences, such as rain gardens, 
detention basins, grassed bioswales and permeable 
paving. This also reduces the broader harm flooding 
brings to communities and creates a more pleasant 
natural environment for local communities to enjoy. 
The project will provide the additional benefit of 
reducing the volume and frequency of activations 
from the storm overflows within the town’s 
sewerage network.

Our progress

SuDS are Sustainable Drainage Systems, and we’re 
putting thousands of them across Mansfield.  They 
work like giant sponges, providing additional storage 
capacity and slowing surface water down – helping 
our drains and sewers to cope. 

SuDS combine some of the latest water drainage 
technology with mother nature, helping to reduce 
flood risk, cutting pollution and bringing more plant 
and animal species into the places where we live.

Working with Mansfield District Council and 
Nottinghamshire County Council, this is the largest 
project of its kind ever to be attempted in the country.

Rain gardens
The first verge rain gardens have been completed at 
Court House and Patterson Place. These capture 
rainwater to support plant life and give an estimated 
34m3 of ‘storage’ which prevents rain water from 
entering the sewers.

Permeable paving
Permeable paving allows rainwater to soak through 
to the water table rather than running into sewers. 
The first sites have been installed in Ravensdale 
Avenue, Patterson Place and Sandy Lane, delivering 
an estimated 203m3 of ‘storage’. 

These interventions are the first of many. We’ve 
developed a digital site selection tool to ensure the 
areas we’ve identified are suitable for the solutions 
we’re proposing. We’ve already been through desktop 
concept work and have started the design of 
solutions for over 50% of the volume we’re aiming 
to deliver. 

Basins, planters and swales
We have identified locations of open public space that 
could be suitable for detention basins, to deliver an 
anticipated 20% of the required volumes on individual 
large sites. Detention basins are constructed planted 
depressions that can receive a large volume of surface 
water and store it in a natural way that complements 
the landscape. We are maximising the opportunity to 
use detention basins and bioswales, to provide the most 
cost-effective interventions and also transform existing 
underused green space to deliver community and 
biodiversity benefits.

Collaborative working

We are collaborating with the University of Sheffield 
to provide independent monitoring and evaluation of 
the programme. Our partnership will help monitor 
each scheme, and develop testing processes to 
assess future SuDS projects across the UK 
and globally.

4. PROTECTING CUSTOMER 
SUPPLY PIPES

5. A SMARTER WAY  
TO USE WATER 

6. IMPROVING OUR 
REGION’S RIVERS

Our Goal

Support environmental improvements to 500 km of rivers, 
by fulfilling our Water Framework Directive statutory 
obligations more quickly and accelerating improvements 
to storm overflows. We’ll do this by taking the rivers to 
improved quality status in collaboration with the EA by 
lowering the amount of phosphorus in the rivers. In 
particular, we’ll see aquatic wildlife thrive.

Undertake Storm Overflow Assessments (‘SOAFs’) 
to prioritise investment solutions in the future.

Our Goal

Our Goal

Our progress

Replace up to a maximum of 26,000 customer supply 
pipes that are made of lead or leaking in Coventry and 
Bomere Heath, reducing leaks by around a million litres 
a day, as around 25% of leaks come from customer-
owned pipes.

Customer-owned supply pipes are a hidden financial 
and health liability for many people. Over 40% of 
households don’t have the savings to fix a burst pipe, 
and up to half of all pipes could contain lead.

Bomere Heath is an area where removing the lead 
pipes also means that we can eliminate the need to 
chemically dose the water, reducing the carbon 
impact of mining and transporting those chemicals.

Our progress

We want to maximise coverage and at the same time 
bring wider economic benefits to local businesses 
through this programme, and are therefore working 
in partnership with other companies to help deliver 
installations. We are focused on finding companies 
with the right mix of skills to complete highways, 
external and internal plumbing work. To meet this 
challenge, we designed multiple delivery models so 
contractors could sign up in the way that suited their 
capabilities. This also gives customers the 
opportunity to choose between getting a grant for 
their own plumber to do the work or having us (or our 
contractors) complete the job for them.

This innovative approach to working with third 
parties, instead of a traditional framework contract, 
means we can be more flexible in getting more 
resource working on the scheme to deliver positive 
customer outcomes. 

Our programme has made good progress since last 
year and has delivered 1,522 supply pipe 
replacements to date.

Our Bomere Heath programme is now underway, and 
we have issued tenders for contractors to support us 
with this roll-out. We aim to begin phosphate 
disengagement trial works here in April 2023. We 
have had a fantastic response from the customers 
in the area, with more than 380 signed up by 
31 March 2023.

Technology
We have also been trialling and researching some 
fantastic new technology, including sounding 
technology which is allowing us to accurately identify 
the material and location of supply pipes without 
digging. We are very excited about the opportunities 
these bring for future asset programmes.

Roll out over 157,000 smart water meters to individual 
household properties and give customers instant access 
to their usage information to: 

 – raise awareness of water efficiency, making 

customers more conscious of the environmental 
impact of their usage and of unchecked leaks;

 – help customers save water and also save money on 

their water bills;

 – target high users during periods of high demand, 

reducing interruptions for all customers;

 – improve our data capture, giving us a better 
understanding of our water balance; and

 – reduce the need for future investment in water 

resources – a UK Government objective.

Our progress

We have accelerated our meter installation programme to 
contract early and obtain meters at a lower cost. We’re on 
track to complete our meter deployment ahead of 
schedule. Working with our Network partner Connex in 
phase one of the communication network roll-out focused 
on Coventry. During phase one we’ve installed 270 
gateways. The network now covers over 55% of household 
properties within our smart metering trial areas. So far, 
we’ve installed 71,089 smart meters in Coventry and have 
32% of meters online transmitting data every day. 

The data this metering is providing is proving hugely 
valuable. Being able to understand usage across the time 
of day can influence our resilience planning for extreme 
weather events, such as hot weather and potential freeze 
thaw events.

Leakage savings
Our leakage and per capita consumption (‘PCC’) savings 
have been in excess of what we predicted at the start of the 
programme. Savings are mainly gained by identifying the 
waste of water more than three times quicker than it 
would with a non-smart meter.

We have also had great success identifying  voids, with 
32% of properties with a meter brought back into charge. 
This is also supporting our leakage activity.

My Smart Tracker
In September, we launched our ‘My Smart Tracker’ online 
service. Since then, we’ve enrolled 20,540 customers onto 
the platform and this continues to grow as we bring more 
meters online. We’ve been pleased with the uptake and 
over 4,400 unique customers have interacted with this 
new journey online. As well as giving customers views 
of their hourly usage, it provides comparisons with 
neighbours’ usage, graphics to show average use of 
appliances and water saving tips.

We are progressing ahead of schedule and aim to have 
more sites completed this AMP than originally forecast, 
which means earlier delivery of the Water Framework 
Directive obligations. 

In order to remove phosphorus from the discharges, we 
are creating more chemical dosing systems and 
reedbeds, and installing mechanical filters to remove 
solids at the front end of the treatment process.

The first seven projects are in construction phase with the 
remainder of the programme on track. This will deliver 
the majority of our 2025 obligations and will have a 
significant benefit on the watercourse which those works 
discharge into.

We have also completed 130 Stage 1 SOAFs to inform our 
AMP8 investment planning. 

Improving CSOs
We’ve already assessed and identified opportunities for 
improvement at more than 100 CSOs. Our aim is to find 
those locations, where we can, through tactical asset 
improvements, rapidly lower the number of storm 
overflow activations. We already have 18 projects 
underway as a result and hope these will be in place as 
soon as summer 2023. Concurrently, we are developing a 
bespoke delivery model, utilising internal teams to give us 
a fast, nimble, flexible approach. 

We are building a storm event generator at our Spernal 
test facility so we can trial different CSO treatment 
technologies. These allow us to treat storm overflow 
activations to reduce the impact on rivers. So in an 
emergency, if we can’t stop the activation, we can treat it. 

Reactive reedbeds
The ARMphos reactive media reedbed we are installing 
at two sites in this programme is a chemical-free, 
nature-based solution. It passively removes phosphorous, 
by absorbing it on to its media with no need for coagulant 
dosing. As it is gravity-fed, there are very few moving 
parts, and it blends in with natural surroundings while 
providing a habitat for wild species. We have run 
small-scale benchtop trials in the lab and at our testbed in 
Spernal to inform full-scale build and installation. Our first 
full project is beginning construction later this year and 
will go into operation at Dalbury Lees. Our second project 
– at Hungerton – is already in design. 

Looking ahead, we are working with our core business 
programmes to find new sites for ARMphos across AMP7 
and AMP8 and it will form a key part of our rural waste 
water treatment strategy moving forwards.

BUSINESS SERVICES PERFORMANCE REVIEW

Business Services operates a UK-based portfolio that 
complements the Group’s core competencies and is well 
positioned to capitalise on market opportunities in three areas: 
Operating Services, Property Development and Green Power.

Operating Services 
Operating Services provides a variety of 
operational water and waste water services 
to private clients across the UK. The main 
customers are the Ministry of Defence (‘MoD’), 
The Coal Authority (‘TCA’), a variety of clients 
requiring legionella monitoring and internal 
water treatment services (including several 
large facilities-management companies, 
universities and government departments), 
regulated water companies and New 
Appointments and Variations (‘NAV’). We 
also have a reports-based service which 
produces water and drainage search 
reports for conveyancing solicitors with 
clients that are buying both domestic and 
commercial properties.

This year, Operating Services’ businesses 
generated £98.5 million revenue (12% year on 
year improvement) and £25.9 million PBIT 
(23% year-on-year improvement), despite the 
property search business being impacted by a 
slow down in the property market. 

In addition, all businesses produced  
year-on-year improvements in their key 
operational metrics. 

The MoD contract achieved its best ever Net 
Promoter Score (a top quartile score in the 
UK), the lowest ever number of blockages and 
floodings, leakage and its lowest ever number 
of water supply interruptions. 

Additionally, TCA achieved its best ever 
customer services scores, with KPIs scoring 
above 99% during the year.

We were delighted that Aqualytix, the 
Legionella monitoring and water treatment 
business within the Group, delivered £1 million 
PBIT per annum for the first time, reflecting its 
fourth successive year of growth.

The newly created Oren Environmental, our 
reedbed refurbishment and natural capital 
solution business, continues to win work and 
is on track to make a profit in 2023/24. 

Severn Trent Searches maintained its  
world-class Net Promoter Scores of +90, 
despite the challenging financial environment.

STRATEGIC REPORTBUSINESS SERVICES PERFORMANCE REVIEW CONTINUED

Property Development
Innovation has enabled us to reduce our 
operational footprint, freeing up land that we 
no longer need for new homes and businesses 
in our region. In 2017 we announced a ten-year, 
£100 million property PBIT target and, 
following our strong performance to date, in 
November 2022 we announced the increase 
of our property PBIT guidance by a further 
£50 million, with planned PBIT from sales of 
surplus land now £150 million between 2017 
and 2032. 

Currently, we are actively promoting over 
1,282 acres of land for redevelopment, having 
previously enabled the creation of 1,650 new 
homes and over 2,000 new jobs over the past 
six years. For example, our planning 
application submitted last year at Hayden 
seeks to deliver 1,100 new homes on a site to 
the west of Cheltenham, delivering a mix of 
high-quality, well-designed sustainable 
housing to meet local and regional needs. 
Alongside this, the application includes 
affordable housing as well as a flexible 
mixed-use area with a community hub, a 
primary school and green recreational space 
for community engagement. Our application 
at Longbridge in Warwick will deliver a further 
344,000 ft2 of sustainable industrial space 
that could generate up to 1,100 jobs for 
the community. 

Green Power
As the UK’s largest producer of renewable 
energy from food waste in the UK, we provide 
cost-effective and sustainable recycling 
solutions through our award winning network 
of facilities across the Midlands, South Wales, 
and London. We then turn that waste into 
renewable energy to power UK homes and 
businesses and produce a nutrient-rich liquid 
bio-fertiliser for farmland to help grow new 
crops. The green energy produced from food 
waste contributes to meeting our net zero 
targets and keeping our energy costs down. 

We operate a high-quality portfolio of assets 
including nine Anaerobic Digestion facilities 
and five composting sites that recycle over 
400,000 tonnes of food waste and more than 
120,000 tonnes of green waste every year. In 
addition, we operate a diverse portfolio of 
renewable energy production facilities, 
including 33 solar parks, six wind turbines, and 
three hydro-electric turbines. 

In 2022/23, we generated 272 GWh of green 
energy, a 0.5% year-on-year growth from the 
same operating assets. This has been achieved 
by delivering an average 96% plant efficiency 
across our portfolio, commissioning our plant 
expansion at Stoke Bardolph, recycling 
400,000 tonnes of food waste during the year 

(enough to power 80,000 homes) and winning 
more local authority contracts totalling 28,000 
tonnes of additional secured feedstock. 

Looking forward, our refurbished Anaerobic 
Digestion site in Derby will be re-commissioned 
during the autumn, bringing an additional 30 
GWh of energy generation. 

In February 2023, we also announced the 
acquisition of Andigestion, subject to approval 
by the Competition and Markets Authority, 
which will bring an additional 45 GWh of energy 
generation output every year and will give 
Green Power new reach into South West 
England, covering cities like Bristol, Gloucester 
and Exeter, helping more businesses to 
process and recycle their food waste into 
renewable energy. In addition, the acquisition 
will help bolster the energy resilience of 
Severn Trent and will play a key role in 
delivering its Triple Carbon Pledge by 2030.

OUR APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE

We are committed to the 
recommendations of the Task 
Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’), 
providing our stakeholders 
with transparent information 
on climate-related risks and 
opportunities that are relevant 
to our business. This is our 
fifth TCFD disclosure, and 
provides an update on what 
we have published previously.

This section of the report sets out our 
climate-related financial disclosures 
consistent with all of the TCFD 
recommendations, in compliance with the 
requirement of LR 9.8.6R. By this, we mean the 
four TCFD recommendations and the eleven 
recommended disclosures set out in Figure 4 
of Section C of the report entitled 
‘Recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures’ 
published in June 2017 by the TCFD and the 
supplementary guidance entitled 
‘Implementing the Recommendations of the 
TCFD’ published in October 2021. In preparing 
our TCFD disclosure, we also take into account 
the wider guidance issued by TCFD, and the 
work of the International Sustainability 
Standards Board (‘ISSB’). 

It continues to evolve, providing greater 
granularity where possible, supported by 

financial information to give greater insight into 
how we identify, assess and manage our 
climate-related risks and opportunities, and 
embed them into our strategy. This report also 
sets out the metrics and targets we have set 
ourselves over the next several years. A 
summary of progress and relevant information 
presented elsewhere in this Annual Report is 
cross referenced within each section, and we 
welcome feedback on our approach.

Our TCFD disclosure is supported by our 
separate Sustainability Report (to be published 
in June), which includes wider detail on the 
progress we are making on our journey. Our 
Sustainability Framework (see page 140) is 
fully embedded into our overall strategy and 
draws together our Environmental, Social 
and Governance (‘ESG’) ambitions which 
are delivered as part of our business plan 
and strategy.

STRATEGIC REPORTOUR APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUED

CLIMATE CHANGE  
GOVERNANCE
Governance 
Robust governance underpins everything we 
do. Climate change and its associated risks, 
opportunities and organisational implications 
are overseen by the Severn Trent Plc, Severn 
Trent Water Limited and Hafren Dyfrdwy 
Cyfyngedig Boards, Board Committees, 
Executive Committee, Senior Management 
Team and Group Subsidiary Company Boards.

Sustainability Governance Framework
Our governance processes are aligned with the 
Group’s Sustainability Governance Framework 
– ensuring that the Board is effective in its 
oversight of the Group’s Sustainability 
Framework, consideration of climate-related 
risks and opportunities, and scrutiny of 
management’s assessment and management 
of climate-related risks and opportunities. 

The Board delegates certain sustainability and 
climate-related risk oversight activity to its 
Committees to support the continued delivery 
of the Group’s Sustainability Framework. The 
Sustainability Governance Framework is also 
subject to periodic review to ensure that it 
remains appropriate. 

The Chief Executive and the Severn Trent 
Executive Committee (‘STEC’) have day-to-day 
responsibility for climate change and 

environmental matters and are responsible for 
the development of the Group’s Strategy, 
including in relation to sustainability-related 
matters, as demonstrated in the Sustainability 
Governance Framework on the next page. 

STEC delegates certain climate-related risk and 
opportunity oversight matters to its approach to 
Committees. To facilitate effective delegation, 
the Group Authorisation Arrangements (‘GAA’) 
are the mechanism by which the Severn Trent 
Plc Board delegates its financial authority, which 
authorises our people to be involved in the 
decision-making processes that commit the 
Company to financial obligations, rather than 
every decision having to be approved by the 
Board. The GAA are reviewed annually to ensure 
that limits remain appropriate.

Board composition
The operation of our Board is supported by the collective experience of the Directors and the diverse skills and 
experience they possess. Our succession planning complements the composition of the Board, with an emphasis 
on sustainability and climate-related topics to ensure that we continue to build upon the excellent progress we 
have made in this regard.

On 1 November 2022, the Board announced the appointment of Sarah Legg as an Independent Non-Executive 
Director both to the Board and as a member of the Corporate Sustainability Committee. She brings extensive 
corporate finance and significant audit and risk experience to the Company and offers financial expertise to 
enhance the Committee’s already effective oversight of ESG-related risks and opportunities. 

Board evaluation
Our annual Board evaluation provides the Board and its Committees with an opportunity to consider and reflect on 
the quality and effectiveness of its decision making, the range and level of discussion, and for each member to 
consider their own contribution and performance. As part of this evaluation, knowledge and experience with 
regard to sustainability and climate-related matters are considered, and in 2023 the evaluation process was 
revised to include sustainability-specific elements for discussion. 

Board meetings and effective reporting from management 
The Board has oversight of all ESG responsibilities and performance as well as approval of ESG strategies and 
investment decisions relating to climate change. Sustainability matters are included as a standing agenda item at 
regular Board meetings and during the year the Board held 17 sessions dedicated to climate-related risks and 
opportunities, monitoring of progress against goals and targets and sustainability-related topics.

The Board receives detailed management reports on ESG matters at each Board meeting, and senior leaders 
within the Group and external guest speakers are regularly invited to offer independent expertise and insight at 
Board and Committee meetings. 

Remuneration 
Our transparent remuneration framework aligns reward and incentive structures throughout our business from our 
frontline operatives through to our Executive Team, ensuring that every employee is incentivised and rewarded to 
deliver the same objectives. This is in addition to ESG measures which already form part of the Annual Bonus Scheme 
metrics. In 2021, the Remuneration Committee agreed the inclusion of a sustainability performance measure in the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) with a weighting of 20%. In March 2022, we announced our commitment to Get River 
Positive and directly linked our river pledges to our remuneration structures through including them as measures in 
our annual bonus plan for 2022/23. This year, the Board approved four new equally-weighted carbon measures for the 
2023-26 LTIP aligning more closely to internationally recognised mechanisms such as the Science-Based Targets 
initiative (‘SBTi’) for Scope 1, 2 and 3. The two new measures are ‘Direct Contributors to Carbon Reduction’ and 
‘Innovation and Engagement for Carbon Reduction’.

Strategy 
Our approach to sustainability is being increasingly integrated into our operational and commercial strategies, 
whilst ensuring best value for customers and wider socio-environmental benefits. In October 2022, the Board held 
its annual Board Strategy Day, with time spent exploring opportunities relating to ESG matters and the future 
resilience of the business in this regard. Our Strategic Direction Statement published in 2022 sets out a clear line 
of sight between the Severn Trent Water Limited and Hafren Dyfrdwy Cyfyngedig business plans and the 
longer-term priorities of the Company. 

Climate change commitments 
The Board put its long-term approach to climate change before shareholders at the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) on 8 July 2021 which received over 99% approval.

and opportunities specifically, extends below the Board to a number of Board and  
Committees, as outlined below.

THE BOARD

The Board’s role is to ensure the long-term sustainable success of 
Severn Trent by setting our Strategy through which value can be 
created and preserved for the mutual benefit of our shareholders, 
customers, employees and the communities we serve. 

Our Board, led by Chair Christine Hodgson, has ultimate responsibility for 
sustainability. Oversight of the Group’s sustainability strategy is a matter 
reserved for the Board. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for how market 
risks connected to our investments (including climate-related risks) are 
identified, considered and managed.

The Board’s responsibilities include:

 – overseeing the Group’s sustainability strategy; 
 – providing rigorous challenge to management on progress against goals 

and targets; 

 – ensuring the maintenance of an effective risk management and internal 

control system, review of six monthly Enterprise Risk Management (‘ERM’) 
updates and annual approval of the Principal Risks; 

 – approval of the Board’s risk appetite and Policy; 
 – inclusion of sustainability-related discussion at each Board meeting 

through a standing agenda item as tabled by the Chair of the Corporate 
Sustainability Committee; and

This year, we have made improvements linking our Principal Risks and ERM risks into our 
business model and our value chain by linking climate drivers with risk causes, enabling 
greater reporting options and better risk coverage. We have also linked the risks we have 
published in our Climate Change Adaptation Report to our ERM risks within our risk 
management system. We consider both existing and emerging regulatory requirements on 
climate change.

 – Climate Change Adaptation Report

The potential impact of different scenarios, 
such as 1.5°C, 2°C, and 4°C scenarios, are 
incorporated into businesses, strategy, and 
financial planning.

See pages 47 to 52

In May 2022, we published our Strategic Direction Statement (‘SDS’) which sets out our 
thinking around key trends and the resultant challenges that will shape the next 30 years and 
how we, as a leading water and waste water company, might look to respond. The SDS has 
informed our strategy and investment choices in the plans we have published this year.

We published the draft version of our next WRMP for consultation in November 2022 and the 
final version of our DWMP in March 2023. The impacts from climate change are a key part of 
the underlying analysis behind these documents, which are used to set and evidence our 
five-year regulatory business plans. 

We are developing our next price review plan (PR24) to consider all recommended 
warming scenarios, from 1.5ºC to 4ºC, to provide flexibility for later business cycle AMPs 
in line with requirements and circumstances at that time. To develop our plans, we have 
utilised the best available data to model the most optimal investment pathways, taking 
into account required outcomes, cost and delivery lead times.

Modelling is underway using eight future scenarios (as set out by Ofwat), which include 
assumptions for climate change to build evidence and inform our long-term evidence plans. 
The outputs will be used to develop our Long-Term Delivery Strategy and business plans for 
the regulatory period 2025-30, AMP8. The Met Office undertook a review of these methods to 
ensure they are robust and align with the Ofwat PR24 guidance.

The draft WRMP and final DWMP incorporated the latest climate projection datasets 
(UKCP18) into scenario modelling to build our view of climate-related risks and opportunities 
for these key documents. 

Vocal advocacy for action on climate change 
and collaboration with peers and other 
stakeholders to achieve change.

See our Sustainability Report online.

We continue to be involved with many sector and cross sector working groups, such as the 
Water UK Net Zero Carbon Technical Group. 

In September 2022, we announced our tri-party collaboration with Aarhus Vand and 
Melbourne Water to share knowledge and expertise and to develop solutions to reduce the 
carbon footprint of waste water treatment sites. 

In May 2023, we announced our intention to build the world’s first Net Zero hub at one of our 
waste water treatment works, supported by partial funding through Ofwat’s Innovation Fund. 
More information can be found in the case study on page 139. The results of the project will be 
shared across the industry.

OUR CLIMATE  
CHANGE STRATEGY

We do not reference our land and property 
strategy in this disclosure as it is not a public 
document, but it provides a forward-looking 
view of how we intend to use our land 
portfolio most effectively, be that for 
operational purposes, renewable energy 
deployment, biodiversity and habitat 
enhancement, carbon sequestration or 
supporting local housing or economic 
development. Our land and property strategy 
is not prescriptive, but provides a framework 
for assessing the best use of any individual 
piece of land. It also considers how we can 
work with partners to improve biodiversity 
across our region to both benefit nature and 
access carbon credits.

We have been investing significantly in both 
saving energy and generating our own 
renewable energy, which is more important 
than ever and bolsters our resilience to 
increasing energy prices. For example, we 

generate over half of the electricity we use 
from our renewables, with the remainder 
purchased from renewable backed sources, 
and this year we delivered record levels of 
generation — 548 GWh of renewable energy 
from nine anaerobic digestion sites as well 
as our wind, solar and hydro plants. Our 
Severn Trent Green Power business 
recycles over 500,000 tonnes of green and 
mixed food waste each year. The green 
energy produced from food waste helps to 
meet our net zero targets and keep our 
energy costs down. In addition, our 
non-regulated businesses, principally 
Severn Trent Green Power and Severn Trent 
Operating Services, contribute towards the 
Group’s net zero journey. You can read 
more about their performance over the year 
on pages 37 to 38.

Mitigating and adapting to climate change 
remains a critical priority for us and, as such, 
forms a common theme through all of our 
strategic documents and plans, from our 
Corporate Strategy downwards. This 
ensures that every part of our organisation 
is focused on reducing our environmental 
impact and improving the sustainability and 
underlying resilience of our business. 

Given the complexity of our business and the 
requirements of our regulators, there are 
multiple documents which describe the risks 
we face. These detail the outputs from the 
risks we have assessed, the potential 
responses to those risks, the investment 
options available, and the wider considerations 
that need to be taken into account when 
making decisions. These include affordability, 
nature and climate, and alignment to our 
strategic objectives, customer outcomes and 
statutory obligations. 

Ultimately, which investments are progressed 
is decided through the industry price review 
process. The water industry operates to 
five-year business planning cycles, as part of a 
framework for economic regulation overseen 
by Ofwat. As part of these five-year periodic (or 
price) reviews, Ofwat reviews company 
investment proposals and sets revenue 
allowances sufficient to finance them. This 
statutory process therefore has an important 
bearing on companies’ investment plans, with 
many elements contingent on a successful 
submission to Ofwat.

Throughout this disclosure, we signpost key 
documents that set out our plans on how we 
manage key areas that will be affected by 
climate change, and will affect our mitigation 
strategy. The following are of particular note:

 – Net Zero Transition Plan (‘NZTP’) – which 

considers and plans our approach to 
delivering against our reduction targets 
(from page 58). 

 – Our Water Resources Management Plan 
(‘WRMP’) and Drainage and Wastewater 
Management Plan (‘DWMP’) – which set out 
how we intend to provide supplies of water to 
our customers over the next 25 years and 
how we plan to deal with the associated 
waste water and surface drainage 
respectively. 

 – Our Strategic Direction Statement (‘SDS’) 

– which identifies the key future priorities for 
our business to 2050.

 – Our Climate Change Adaptation Report 
– which provides a summary overview of 
risks arising from climate change.

STRATEGIC REPORTOUR APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUED

HOW WE IDENTIFY AND UNDERSTAND  
RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE 

As a company that depends on 
supporting, and interacting with, the 
natural capital within our region, we 
have an important role to understand, 
prepare for and respond to a changing 
climate. We know that climate change, 
along with other factors such as 
population growth and urban creep, will 
increase the pressure on delivering our 
essential services. 

Our approach to managing climate-related 
risks is outlined in the table below, highlighting 
how we consider climate-related risks over 
different time horizons (i.e. the short, medium 
and long term). The method by which we 
assess, monitor and manage risks and 
opportunities differs depending on the size and 
type of risk. Alongside likelihood and impact, we 

use financial thresholds defined within our ERM 
policies and systems. These thresholds are 
used to measure the materiality of each risk to 
our business and the level to which the risks are 
reported within our organisation. For example, 
we operate levels of reporting for all risks 
valued at over £10 million, they are captured 
within our ERM system and rigorous 
management processes put in place. We have 
four further levels of risk above this, with the 
highest being valued at over £75 million, and the 
risks in this bracket are required to be reported 
at Board level. Risks valued at below £10 million 
are managed by the business. All climate-
related risks are assessed in the same way and 
have been concluded to be below this 
£10 million threshold this year. We have a 
dedicated risk network made up of risk 
coordinators and risk champions who are 
coached and supported by our central ERM 

Team, to support the ongoing risk assessment 
process throughout the year. Our ERM level 
risks are managed through our ‘Our Approach 
to Risk’ section on pages 73 to 74 for more 
information. We recognise the rising pressure 
that climate change will place on our existing 
risks, such as an increase in storm frequency 
and severity that will challenge our ability to 
deliver water and wastewater services to our 
customers. Climate risks are assessed through 
key documents like the DWMP, WRMP, and 
Drought Management Plan (see table below). 
We dynamically assess potential changes in the 
risk environment through our investment plans, 
which means we plan for and invest based on 
the climate we expect Severn Trent to be 
operating in over the next 25 years. These plans 
form the key basis for our five-year investment 
plans that we submit to Ofwat.

Risk Management via our ERM 
We operate a well-established ERM 
framework, underpinned by standardised 
tools, practices and risk management 
methodologies to ensure consistency across 
the Severn Trent Group. Our ERM framework 
is embedded throughout the business, with 
different groups exploring and examining risks 
through different lenses, as described 
throughout the section. 

Our risk management system incorporates 
important climate-related risks identified 
through business as usual processes. We 
have built additional capabilities within our 
corporate risk system enabling climate drivers 

to be linked with risk causes where the 
likelihood could be exacerbated by climate 
change drivers. We have also assigned TCFD 
typology to our ERM risks.

The Board has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that risk is managed effectively 
across the Group and that there is an effective 
risk management framework in place (see 
page 74 for more information). The Executive 
Committee has specific responsibilities and 
accountabilities for topics connected to climate 
considerations, including our strategy, 
operations and regulatory requirements. See 
the Internal Controls and Risk Management 
disclosure in the Audit and Risk Committee 
Report from page 127 for more information. 

The risks we have already recognised inform 
and help mitigate against the predicted 
impacts caused by 2°C of warming. Our risk 
response plans are based on a risk bow tie 
analysis whereby ‘risk causes’ are considered 
in relation to ‘climate drivers’ to help quantify 
the controls that we should consider and 
execute.

Our three-tiered system shown below helps 
ensure appropriate actions given the relative 
risk to the organisation and we provide an 
update on our modelled risks from page 46.

  Principal risk

Drivers and causes

TRANSITION RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

Impact on business  
(risk consequences)

Mitigations and opportunities

   Key Risk 1:  
Changing societal expectations, resulting in stricter legal and environmental obligations, commitments, and/or enforcements, increase the risk of non-compliance 

Short, medium and long term (focused)

 – Increased activism and media coverage 
around climate change and the level of 
environmental pollution may raise public 
awareness and strengthen calls for policy 
makers to act

 – More will be demanded of businesses: to be 
more sustainable in their operations, to pay 
for the damage they cause, and with greater 
scrutiny over environmental performance 

 – Our ODI penalty/reward position could 

 – Increased focus on environmental 

change

 – Operational costs associated with taxes on 

carbon emissions could increase

protection and achievement of mitigation 
targets could change Government policy 
and regulators’ target-setting approach

 – National regulatory changes may 

implement costs of carbon (our operations 
are energy intensive and the waste we deal 
with has a high greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) 
impact)

 – Increased regulatory scrutiny and 

accelerated regulatory change will drive 
behaviour from businesses to protect 
the environment

 – We have strong engagement with our supply chain to drive 

environmental leadership 

 – Regular engagement with the UK Government, the Welsh 

Government, regulators and other stakeholders helps us to shape 
the direction of the water sector and address the impacts of 
climate change

 – Opportunities exist to fast track positive changes, alongside 
regulatory change, for our communities and the environment
 – Our established governance framework, policies and training 
ensure our ongoing compliance with all applicable laws and 
regulations

 – We use external legal advisers to complete detailed reviews in 

respect of upcoming legislation that may affect the Group

Key Risk 2: The investment required will impact customer bills and affect affordability for some

Short, medium and long term (modelled)

 – High levels of investment will be required to 

meet more stringent environmental 
standards, improve our resilience, adapt to 
climate change, and meet long-term 
targets

 – Our regulatory model means that such 

investments are ultimately funded through 
customer bills

 – Higher levels of investment will result in 
higher bills for our customers and will 
affect affordability for those who are 
struggling financially

 – Analysis published in March 2021 by Water 
UK showed that water poverty in the Severn 
Trent Water region was 6.1% based on 
2019/20 data

 – We talk to our customers and take customer affordability into 
account as part of our planning and investment processes 
 – Targeted investment allows us to continue to deliver essential 

services for our customers, even under more challenging 
circumstances

 – Impacts to customer bills are modelled and tested with customers 

ahead of submission

 – To mitigate the impact for the most vulnerable, we also offer a 

range of affordability packages

  Key Risk 3:  
Severn Trent’s climate change strategy does not enable us to respond to the shifting natural climatic environment and maintain essential services

  Mitigating climate change will require rapid decarbonisation

Short, medium and long term (focused)

 – Through to 2050, we anticipate that 

Government will need to assume a larger 
role to overcome barriers that are 
hindering consumers, business, and wider 
societal change

 – Potential Government policy interventions 
are likely to be focused on speeding up 
decarbonisation efforts but currently are 
not always co-ordinated 

 – Existing technologies won’t be capable of 
delivering the improvements required

 – More stringent standards may be enforced 

alongside increased expectations for 
reporting requirements

 – As the water sector contributes 1% of UK 
emissions, we will be required to reduce 
emissions in line with the Government 
interim targets of 78% reduction (since 
1990) by 2035, reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 
then Scope 3 emissions 

 – The need for greater understanding, 

visibility and transparency increases the 
need for more granular data collection 
and reporting

 – We use scenario modelling to understand the impacts of climate 

change and identify opportunities for investment through 
resilience planning

 – Our Innovation Team actively seeks investment in new 

technologies to improve performance

 – We regularly analyse our performance to understand 

opportunities for improvements to operational effectiveness
 – New opportunities may emerge to participate in new markets, 

such as green hydrogen or ammonia

 – Better data will lead to improved understanding of performance
 – We target a reduction in water usage alongside a reduction in 

leakage to improve our ability to manage demand in a resource-
stretched world

PHYSICAL RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

  Key Risk 4:  
We do not provide a safe and secure supply of drinking water to our customers

  Demand for water will increase as a result of population growth and changing weather conditions 

Short, medium and long term (focused)

 – Hotter, drier summers will reduce water 

 – Hot weather causes an increase in 

 – We use strategic modelling to assess potential changes to supply 

availability and increase demand

 – Acute physical risks such as storms and 

floods may impact upon our infrastructure, 
or increase the risk of water contamination 

 – A reduction in the water available in the 

environment, caused by increasing 
temperatures, will restrict the amount we 
can abstract and supply

 – Performance of pipes is threatened by 

extreme weather

short-term peak demand and impacts our 
ability to supply enough water

 – Additional operational costs could be 

required to ensure delivery

 – Additional infrastructure investment could be 
required to adapt to a changing climate and to 
secure supply

and demand on our water network and to model the known 
impacts of climate change

 – Comprehensive resilience plans that consider climate change in 
scenario modelling, such as our WRMP and DWMP, feed into our 
capital investment programme and business plan

 – Investment in early leak detection technologies and effective 

response processes will reduce leakage levels

 – Increased investment to increase headroom will help us meet 

increased water demand

 – By increasing resilience and flexibility of our supply network and 

better preparing for incidents, we are constantly working to 
ensure continuous supply to our customers

 – Increased awareness of the value of water in an increasingly 
resource-stretched world may improve the effectiveness of 
customer engagement programmes to reduce water usage

  Key Risk 5:  
We do not transport and treat waste water effectively, impacting our ability to return clean water to the environment 

Short, medium and long term (modelled)

 – Extreme rainfall and wetter weather will 

increase the risk of flooding

 – Increased population and land cover will 

increase run-off 

 – Extended dry periods and extreme rainfall 
events affect the capacity of our sewers – 
for example, more intense bursts of heavy 
rainfall increase the volumes of water 
entering our waste water systems

 – Damage could be caused to infrastructure, 
increasing the risk of flooding to our waste 
water treatment works

 – Alternative reactive steps will be required 

to ensure the safety of waste water removal 
 – Additional infrastructure investment will be 
required to ensure adequate systems and 
resilience

 – Environmental penalties could increase 
 – Failure to safely treat waste water impacts 

our financial penalty/reward position

 – Comprehensive resilience plans, such as our DWMP, feed into our 

capital investment programme and business plan. Targeted 
investment will increase waste water network resilience 
 – We use strategic modelling to assess potential changes to 
population and climate change on our waste water network

 – We have a strong compliance culture and effective management 

systems

 – Increased awareness of the value of water in an increasingly 
resource-stretched world may improve the effectiveness of 
customer engagement programmes to promote the safe use of 
the waste water system, including reduced use of wet wipes and 
non-flushables

 – The implementation of new technologies and innovation to 

improve our waste water treatment processes and network 
operations will enable us to meet or exceed targets

 – Increasing the use of nature-based solutions to build resilience 

provides the advantage of additional co-benefits

 – Wider surface water management options such as SuDS have 

associated co-benefits and increase future flexibility for capacity

  Key Risk 6:  
We fail to positively influence natural capital in our region 

Medium and long term (focused)

 – Hotter, drier summers cause changes to 

 – Resilience to climate change and extreme 

 – We have made public commitments to protect our local 

habitat composition and distribution, along 
with biodiversity loss on land and in rivers
 – Increased urbanisation, which extends hard 

impermeable surfaces against the 
backdrop of increasing rainfall, increases 
the risk and speed of urban run-off and 
sewer overflows, leading to pollution of 
waterways 

 – A growing population and per capita 

consumption, and increased pressure on 
natural resources, negatively impact upon 
biodiversity and our ability to manage 
natural resources effectively

weather events decreases

 – Raw water quality deteriorates
 – Failure to manage pollutions impacts our 

financial penalty/reward position

 – Changes to the valuation of natural capital 

may have financial impacts in future 
 – Delaying the investment required for 

climate resilient or adaptation solutions 
may increase future costs

environment – for example, targeting 15% biodiversity net gain for 
our capital projects

 – We use modelling to estimate the impact of increasing pressures 
on nature, such as water abstraction and environmental pollution, 
as part of our WRMP and DWMP

 – We are investing in habitat restoration which can help reduce 

pressure on our assets and lower asset failure rates 

 – Management plans and controls mitigate damage to SSSIs and 

enhance them through our operations

 – Our Green Recovery Programme consists of six schemes that will 

deliver a host of benefits for customers, communities and the 
environment

 – Adopting a catchment management approach in partnership with 
landowners in our region will mitigate the effect of pesticides, 
fertilisers and organic nutrients, will be more inclusive, will 
reduce costs, and will reduce the need for additional investment
 – We have strong engagement from both our supply chain and our 

customers to promote biodiversity via our Commonwealth Games 
targets (72 Tiny Forests and Legacy Forest), our Great Big Nature 
Boost for Biodiversity (enhancing it on 5,000 ha of land) and by 
restoring 2,000 acres of peatland in England and Wales. This will 
enhance ecosystems, improving resilience through decreased 
flood risk and improving water quality

 – Our reputation will benefit from acting as a steward of natural 

capital and taking this responsibility seriously

CLIMATE-RELATED SCENARIO ANALYSIS 

The impact of climate variations is critical to the way Severn Trent operates. As such, we have an advanced and nuanced 
approach to the way we integrate climate into our business processes and risk management approach. As a business, we look 
at a wide range of temperature and climate forcing alignments, from a 1.5°C Paris-aligned scenario, to a 4°C ‘business as usual’ 
scenario to inform our strategy for investment in future resilience. The specific assumptions, parameters and scenarios 
applicable are set out below, and more information can be found in the corresponding reports. 

Our approach to scenario analysis
Scenario analysis is a key component of assessing both the likelihood and consequence of our major climate-related risks. Stress testing our 
ability to deliver customer outcomes against a range of variables highlights our resilience and informs our long-term strategy and investment 
plans. These are outlined through our PR24 plan, and also in our WRMP, DWMP and SDS.

Key documents that utilise the modelling work

STRATEGIC DIRECTION STATEMENT

Our WRMP and DWMP will focus on  
Ofwat’s base scenarios for AMP8, which 
include changes to demand forecasts 
arising from building regulations and  
water device labelling, varying the data 
inputs for abstraction regulations and 
population growth, and including changes 
to assumptions made around technology.

Our SDS provides context for our PR24 
submissions and shows how our AMP8 
plans fit into our longer-term goals.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION 
STATEMENT (‘SDS’)

LTDS 

As part of out submission to Ofwat later this 
year, we are documenting our Long Term 
Delivery Strategy which sets out the 
long-term risks, ambitions and investments 
beyond PR24 and into the future. It uses 
adaptive planning alongside the findings 
of the WRMP and DWMP to test demand and 
climate-change scenarios that may occur.

PR24 INVESTMENT PLANS 

For the upcoming price review process 
(‘PR24’), Ofwat has set out guidelines for how 
water companies should develop and present 
their long-term delivery strategies, including 
a requirement to use an adaptive planning 
approach. Following these guidelines, we are 
using a scenario-based methodology, 
considering climate change, technology, 
water demand, and environmental ambition. 
For each parameter, Ofwat have prescribed 
assumptions for low and high risk scenarios. 

The underlying analysis behind these 
documents is used to set and evidence our 
five-year regulatory business plans. PR24 
covers our financial investment needs from 
2025-30 and will be submitted to Ofwat in 
October 2023, with the Final Determination 
expected in December 2024. A key role of 
PR24 is for us to balance long-term financial 
investment needs for a resilient and 
sustainable business, with ensuring 
customers’ bills are affordable.

The Met Office undertook a review of the 
methods, datasets and scenarios used to 
ensure these are robust given the latest 
climate science, and that they align with the 
requirements stipulated in the Ofwat PR24 
guidance. We are using the findings and 
recommendations to inform the next phase 
of our investment plans for PR24.

analysis

Twelve Regional Climate Model (‘RCM’) scenarios and 20 
probabilistic datasets are included in our water resource 
systems climate change analysis

RCMs provide comparable outputs across regions due to their 
better representation of spatial coherence of climate change

Regulatory commitments and funding to reduce leakage  
and reduce demand from a 2019/20 baseline

We have made a commitment to reduce household demand by 15% by 2050 and to 
reduce leakage by 50% by 2045. In addition, we have a number of water use 
minimisation programmes which are incorporated into our future modelling, to 
ensure we understand how the benefits of these programmes may protect us 
against climate-related risks

Timeframe 
assessed

Current modelling is to the 2070s and then extrapolated to 
2085 to cover the WRMP24 planning period

Current modelling is to the 2070s and then extrapolated to 2100 

Key outputs from 
modelling work

Modelling indicates a reduction in the amount of water 
available for distribution (Deployable Output, ‘DO’). In 2050, 
the expected reduction of DO is: 
 – 4% in a RCP6.0 climate scenario; and
 – 9% in a RCP8.5 climate scenario

Our water demand mitigation proposals will help reduce the total amount of 
water we abstract. Our two key programmes (customer demand and leakage 
reduction) are expected, by 2050, to: 
 – Reduce demand by 6%; and
 – Reduce leakage by 50% by 2045

Key impacts

Key financial impacts include increased remediation and 
investment needs, and enhanced capital spend, which will be 
outlined in detail in our WRMP 

Key financial impacts include an increased overhead in the water available for 
distribution, reducing the amount of investment and capital required to ensure a 
consistent supply of water

Climate driver

Increased frequency and intensity of rainfall may 
increase risk of sewer flooding, impact the

Increased investment in our commitments to reduce public and 
external flooding and the activation of CSOs

Climate model

RCP2.6, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, including industry derived 
rainfall uplifts for 2050

The SDS used climate model assumptions from the WRMP and DWMP, where 
relevant. No specific quantitative modelling was carried out for the SDS

Within our DWMP we have modelled present day flood risk 
during a 1 in 50-year rainfall event (i.e. a rainfall event with a 2% 
probability of occurring in a year). We then use rainfall uplifts 
derived from climate change projections to understand how the 
future climate is likely to affect rainfall intensities

Timeframe 
assessed

Current modelling is to 2050. The below impact looks at a 
2050 snapshot

The SDS covers the period out to 2050

Key outputs from 
modelling work

Modelling indicates that, by 2050, increased frequency and 
intensity of rainfall events would result in 61% more flood 
water escaping from the sewer network in a 1 in 50-year 
rainfall event. This will result in 44,000 properties being 
affected by internal sewer flooding and a 14% increase in 
storm overflow activations by 2050 

Key impacts

Key financial impacts include increased remediation and 
investment needs, and enhanced capital spend, which are 
outlined in detail in our DWMP

Key inputs and 
assumptions (in

Low and high demand projections assume future growth 
remains in line with population projections indicated by the 
Office of National Statistics (low demand), with higher 
forecasts assuming all Local Plan development allocations

Across the Severn Trent region, our modelling indicates that around 
112,000 properties could currently be at risk of sewer flooding from a 1 
in 50-year storm. By 2050, assuming no upgrades were undertaken, 
this would increase by 39% to around 156,000 properties. At present, 
there are no governmental targets relating to what is an acceptable 
level of sewer flood risk. In our DWMP, our core best value plan is 
informed by customer choices in line with Ofwat requirements, but we 
have also set out investment scenarios to maintain current risk levels 
and to meet our long-term aspiration to get to zero flood risk. The level 
of investment set out in our DWMP (aligned to Ofwat best value 
principles) will not be sufficient to mitigate the future risk from 
internal flooding from the waste water network. The graph below 
summarises the different investment scenarios and the residual 
property risk associated with each.

Zero risk

Within our best value plan analysis, we have included optimisation of 
traditional ‘grey’ interventions compared with blue/green nature-
based solutions that can support delivery of wider benefits. 
Subsequently, our DWMP indicates that, based on our best value plan, 
the percentage of properties at risk would reduce from 2.58% to 2.52% 
by 2050 (under a 2°C and low-demand scenario). However, the 
underlying number of properties at risk is expected to increase from 
around 112,000 to around 136,000 properties, despite investment to 
alleviate risk to 20,000 properties over 25 years.

The challenge associated with managing sewer flood risk is balancing 
affordability of customers’ bills in light of other statutory obligations 
within the Government’s Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan 
(‘SODRP’) and ensuring permit compliance at our waste water 
treatment works (‘WwTWs’). In terms of overall investment levels set 

out in our final DWMP, the figures below summarise our best value 
2°C core pathway and 4°C alternative pathway scenarios, across the 
25-year planning horizon.

PR24 aims to balance the wide variety of other priorities, whilst 
ensuring sewer flooding investment plans are supported by 
customers. In light of this, whilst DWMP provides visibility of future 
pressures, the level of investment informed by the best value will not 
be sufficient to maintain current risk levels. 

Our Water Resources Management Plan
The scenario analysis that feeds into the WRMP looks at how 
population growth, drought, regulation and environmental ambition, 
and wider climate change pressures will impact upon the future 
demand for water over the next 25 years, taking into account scenarios 
to 2085 to understand and prepare for more extreme risk. Our WRMP 
then sets out how we propose to meet that demand. 

Since our last WRMP was published in 2019, we have seen significant 
differences in the way that water is consumed in domestic settings, 
whilst at the same time seeing new governmental ambition to reduce 
water consumption. There has also been an increase in environmental 
focus and changes to the classification of some areas as ‘water 
stressed’, which means that demand can outstrip supply in those 
areas. In addition, our customers are facing a cost of living crisis, 
meaning that more needs to be done to protect our customers. 
Overall, future pressures mean that our draft plan (to be released in 
full in 2023) describes a likely future supply/demand deficit of 244 Ml/d 
by plan year 2040/41 growing to 540 Ml/d by 2050/51. Our WRMP will 
set out how we anticipate to meet this increased level of demand.

CASE STUDY

DROUGHT IN SUMMER 2022

Conditions across the whole of the UK in 2022 were extreme, with 
the Severn Trent region being no exception. For large parts of our 
region, we experienced the driest seven-month period since 1891. 
At the same time, temperature records were set in England with 
the first ever Red Extreme Heat warning. These extremes 
combined to drive very high levels of customer demand and place 
our water resources under significant pressure.

To help tackle this problem, we increased our demand 
management activities, finding and fixing more leaks as well 
as proactively engaging our customers on how they can help 
reduce demand. 

We also delivered our largest ever programme of encouraging 
behavioural change by customers, providing advice and messaging 
throughout the summer to help minimise demand and then 
continuing into the winter with the first ever winter demand 
reduction programme to drive long-term sustained change, rather 
than short-term restrictions on use. This is key because climate 
change means we are likely to experience more extreme weather 
in the future. 

At the heart of our demand management approach is working with 
our customers as partners, giving them the motivation and means 
to make sustainable demand reductions, rather than shorter-term 
restrictions. Our extended customer engagement, promoting 
positive actions to help reduce demand, is in contrast to prohibitive 
restrictions and resulted in significant customer recognition and 
commitment to reduce water use, as illustrated below. The 
majority of our customers have said they are likely or very likely to 
change their water use as a result of behaviour campaigns. 

OUR APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUED

Hotter, drier summers
Hotter, drier summers will have a significant impact on future water 
availability when compared with 2021 (see below graph for an 
indication of how water availability (Deployable Output) will reduce in 
RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 to 2085).

Different regions may also have particular attributes that make them 
more or less sensitive to climate change, therefore we carry out 
sensitivity analysis (on central estimates of climate change) looking 
at the impacts of the wettest and driest weather on climate impacted 
Deployable Output. As you can see in the graph below, our region will 
become progressively more sensitive to the driest weather conditions 
over time.

Our regulatory commitments to reduce leakage and water 
consumption do, however, help to provide us with additional 
headroom to increase water available for supply.

In addition, we plan to deliver a range of schemes to ensure water 
supplies can cope with a 1 in 500-year return period drought by 2039, 
whilst keeping pace with climate change and the requirements set 
out by the Environment Agency by 2050. Plans incorporated in 
WRMP24 include increased capacity for reservoirs and treatment 
plants, new reservoirs and treatment plants, transfers to areas of 
need and changes to import/export arrangements. Details of the 
individual schemes are outlined in WRMP24.

METRICS  
AND TARGETS

We measure and manage a wide range of 
metrics, which help us assess how well we 
are doing to minimise our risks in a 
changing future. These include a range of 
metrics that measure our ability to provide 
and take away water, our influence and 
impact on natural capital, our adaptation 
measures and any changes in the 
regulatory environment. These are 
reported annually in our Annual 
Performance Report to Ofwat which 
provides a transparent assessment 
of our performance. 

This section of our TCFD disclosure sets out 
the industry and cross industry metrics and 
targets against which we have reported. We 
have incorporated metrics used by the Board 
and management to measure progress 
towards our targets, and the impact this has 
had in terms of financial investment. These 
meet the ISSB and FCA guidance and our 
metrics go above and beyond what the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(‘SASB’) recommends. The table on page 63 
shows how measures map across. More detail 
around how our reporting maps to the 
recommendations of SASB can be found within 
our Sustainability Report. 

METRICS AND TARGETS

TCFD recommendation 

Progress this year

Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and 
manage relevant climate-related risks and 
opportunities where such information is material.

We were awarded an A- for 2021/22 from the Carbon Disclosure Project (‘CDP’). The CDP requests 
information from companies about climate change and scores each company on the quality and 
completeness of responses. Our climate change information is publicly accessible. 

Severn Trent has reported against the Metrics and 
Targets TCFD recommendations in full within the 
2022/23 Annual Report.

This year we are expanding on this disclosure to incorporate financial information for the first time, 
as we recognise the importance of this in providing greater transparency over the impact climate 
change has on our investment decisions.

The organisation’s internal carbon pricing strategy

This table sets out the cross industry metrics 
and targets against which we have reported. 
We have also assessed our processes to 
understand where to focus on developing our 
reporting in future.

We implemented an internal carbon tax at the beginning of the financial year, at a rate of £18/tonne 
CO 2e, across all directorates. This raised funds of £5.2 million that are being invested in our Net 
Zero Transition Plan, including new research and development innovations, and £2 million to pay 
for the people needed to support the transition, both across the business and in a central team.

We achieved the Advancing Tier for the Carbon Trust Route to Net Zero Standard, this certification 
recognises the progress of an organisation on its route to net zero. 

Following the updates to our ERM system and the commitments we have made to net zero by 2030, 
we have adapted our financial planning – both this AMP and for PR24 – to incorporate carbon 
prices. These are now integrated into both our annual processes and our investment objectives for 
our ambitious transition plan over the next AMP.

MEASURING OUR PROGRESS

Key metrics and investment table
Outlined in the table below are the key metrics and targets that align with the transition (purple) and physical (green) risks and opportunities, as 
covered in the Risk Management section from page 46. These are outlined alongside the financial investment we have made this year to 
demonstrate the financial impact of climate change on our investment programme and planning processes. We have identified both climate risks 
and climate opportunities in our strategy and capital deployment approach, within both mitigation and adaptation objectives.

1

1a

Target

Investment update

REGULATION/POLICY:  
Changing societal expectations resulting in stricter legal and environmental obligations,  
commitments and/or enforcements, increase the risk of non-compliance

Carbon tax

To prepare ourselves for a future of potential carbon taxes, in 
2022/23 we applied our first internal carbon tax. 

This year, we allocated all of the £5.2 million of carbon tax funds 
raised to trials and new projects aimed solely at driving down our 
operational emissions. We utilised the resourcing fund that we 
set aside, of £2 million, to hire new people across internal teams 
focusing on carbon reduction, giving us opportunities to do more, 
faster.

1b

Carbon pricing

We set ourselves a goal to adapt our internal processes before 
the end of this AMP, in order to begin considering external 
carbon prices when appraising capital projects.

Starting this year, we incorporated a price of £248 per tonne from 
Government Green Book shadow prices for carbon into our 
process for capital investment appraisal. We have used these 
prices for project assessment in preparation for PR24.

2a

AFFORDABILITY:  
The investment required will impact customer bills and affect affordability for some

Financial support

Although we have one of the lowest bills in the country, we know 
that 6% households in our region are in water poverty. In May 
2022, we launched our Affordability Strategy, a £30 million 
package of additional financial support to additional 100,000 
customers. For more information, refer to our Sustainability 
Report.

This year, we have supported 132,296 customers through our Big 
Difference Scheme, and will continue to support customers who 
struggle to pay their bill.

2b

Community Fund

From 2020 to 2025, we will be giving away more than £10 million 
to support new projects run by local charities and community 
groups in the Severn Trent region.

We have invested £2 million this year in 116 projects approved 
through the Community Fund, facilitating investment in nature 
and the environment across our communities.  

3

CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGY:  
Severn Trent’s climate change strategy does not enable us to respond to the shifting natural climatic environment 
and maintain essential services
Mitigating climate change will require rapid decarbonisation

3a

Net Zero Transition Plan

In 2019, we made a commitment to be net zero by the end of 2030. 
We set out our targets within our Triple Carbon Pledge. We have 
since committed to SBTs for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, our supply 
chain, and sold products. These are outlined on page 57.

This year, we invested £2.3 million in our Net Zero Transition 
Plan and progression against our SBTs. We have also invested 
£1.1 million this year to begin transforming one of our sites into 
our first ever Net Zero hub.

3b

Executive remuneration

In 2021, we restructured our Executive remuneration to 
incorporate a sustainability element to the LTIP. Twenty 
percent of the bonus paid under this plan is based on 
sustainability performance measures and targets for both 
innovation and actual carbon reduction.

The sustainability element of the LTIP will vest in FY24, when we 
will report on the bonus amounts and criteria. More information 
on our current remuneration structure is on page 145.

A SAFE AND SECURE SUPPLY OF DRINKING WATER:  
Demand for water will increase as a result of population growth and changing weather conditions

Customer meters

We need our customers to help save water, and giving them more 
insight on usage helps them and us to focus in the right areas. 
We set a target to get 65% of customers onto a water meter by 
2025, which equates to 1.1 million new smart meters and 
1.4 million upgrades.

In 2022/23, we invested £8.6 million to install 72,000 new smart 
meters. We are on track to meet our AMP target for 2024/25. 

4b

Per Capita Consumption

We have committed to an ambitious target to reduce 
consumption by 4% by the end of 2024/25. This equates to a 
target of 122.7 litres per person per day, and 124.5 litres per 
person per day by 31 March 2023. 

This year we invested £1.4 million in reducing PCC through 
customer engagement projects. We are working with customers 
directly to change behaviours around water usage, and provide 
quick and easy ways to report leaks to us. Our PCC figure for this 
year is 137.6 litres per person per day.

4c

Interconnector

We are collaborating with others in the water industry to investigate 
and plan for an interconnector pipeline that will move water from 
areas of water surplus in the North to areas of water scarcity in the 
South. Our target by the end of 2024/25 is to have a plan approved by 
Ofwat to begin construction in AMP8 of relevant schemes.

We have invested £7.2 million this year on interconnector 
projects, including investigating the feasibility of using the Grand 
Union Canal as an alternative resilient water source, and 
expanding reservoir capacity in our region. Our first four options 
have been submitted to Ofwat for consideration ahead of AMP8.

4d

Leakage reduction

We need to stop water leaking from our network. This will help to 
engage customers to preserve water and avoids energy and 
chemicals waste. We have set an ambitious leakage reduction 
target of 15% by the end of AMP7 (averaged over 3 years at 
14.3%), and 50% by 2045 (since 2019/20).

This year, we deployed capital investment of £44.6 million in both 
proactive and reactive repairs to our pipes alongside proactive 
management of our network. We have so far delivered a 3.5% 
reduction since 2019/20. 

TRANSPORT AND TREATMENT OF WASTE WATER:  
We do not transport and treat waste water effectively, impacting our ability to return clean water to the environment

5

5a

Public sewer flooding

In 2020 we committed to 7.4% reduction in public sewer flooding 
– the only company in the industry to have such a measure for 
AMP7. 

5b

External sewer flooding

We set ourselves a highly ambitious target at the beginning of 
AMP7 to reduce external sewer flooding incidents by 8%. We 
know how important it is to our customers to see performance in 
this measure improve, and to our business to build resilience to 
the effects of climate change.

5c

Combined Sewer Overflows

This year we invested £80 million to prevent sewer flooding. We 
have outperformed on our public sewer flooding target by 34% 
and we are outperforming this measure by 40% on average 
across the AMP. Unfortunately we missed this year’s challenging 
target for external sewer flooding by 26%. Storm events over the 
winter had a significant impact on our network, and some areas 
experienced more than 200% of the average monthly rainfall. We 
are working to get back on track and improve performance 
significantly, as we have ambitions to demonstrate great 
outcomes here.

As part of our Get River Positive river pledges, we set a target to 
reduce spills from storm overflows to an average of 20 per year 
by 2025.

We have deployed capital investment of £13.7 million in 
improving the data we have on CSOs, creating new processes to 
manage and monitor triggers, and have reduced the number of 
storm overflow activations from an average of 25 to 18 this year.

6

6a

NATURAL CAPITAL:  
We fail to positively influence natural capital in our region

Green Recovery

In July 2021, Ofwat awarded us £566 million (2017/18 prices) to 
invest in our ambitious Green Recovery Programme. Projects 
include collaborative flood resilience, via which we set a target to 
store 58,000m3 of surface water to reduce flooding risk to homes. 
You can read more about this and our progress on page 35.

This year we invested £3.3 million in collaborative flood 
resilience as part of our project in Mansfield to store more 
surface water and prevent flooding. We also invested £7.6 million 
to support environmental improvements to rivers, through our 
Bathing Rivers programme.

6b

Biodiversity

In 2020, we launched our Great Big Nature Boost, committing to 
enhance the biodiversity of 5,000 hectares of land, plant 
1.3 million trees and restore 2,000 km of rivers by 2027. We also 
committed to improve rivers in 44 catchments covering 432,000 
hectares through our Farming for Water programme by working 
with two thirds of all farmers in our region. 381 hectares of our 
land will be managed using an approved biodiversity action plan.

This year we have invested £1.5 million to plant 227,999 trees, 
reaching a total of 694,144 to date. We have already exceeded our 
target of enhancing the biodiversity of 5,000 hectares, four years 
early. 923 STEPS grants have been awarded since 2020, with a total 
investment applied for of £5.6 million. You can read more about 
these initiatives on pages 18 to 19 and on our dedicated website

STRATEGIC REPORTOUR NET ZERO  
TRANSITION PLAN

Our approach 
Achieving our plan is requiring us to 
re-think every aspect of our business 
processes and adopt new ways of 
working. Our approach is to follow the 
carbon hierarchy to achieve our 2030 
targets:

  SCOPE ONE

Since introducing more advanced process 
emission measurement systems, we have 
been able to capture more accurate data, 
resulting in a significant perceived 
increase in Scope 1 emissions that 
reflects the change in reporting

REDUCE
Reduce our emissions

REPLACE
Replace fossil fuels such as 
natural gas with green energy

REMOVE
Remove carbon emissions such as 
through carbon sequestration

OFFSET
Only then we will offset where we 
can’t remove any residual 
emissions through high quality 
and accredited schemes

  SCOPE TWO

We have committed to purchase 
renewable-backed electricity for all our 
import supply, which reduced our 
market-based Scope 2 emissions to zero, 
effective from 2021

  SCOPE THREE

Scope 3 is a major source of emissions, 
which we are working on with our 
suppliers

What are we aiming for? 
Our Net Zero Transition Plan brings 
together our Triple Carbon Pledge 
(which we set in 2019) and our SBTs, 
approved in 2021. We need to achieve 
these targets whilst continuing to 
provide the high-quality service our 
customers expect, at a price they 
can afford. 

What do we mean by net zero? 
Net zero means achieving a balance between 
the amount of emissions produced and those 
removed from the atmosphere in order to limit 
the impact from climate change.

Our target is to achieve net zero operational 
emissions (our Scope 1 and 2, and some 
outsourced Scope 3) by 2030. We will prioritise 
our net zero investment to achieve this without 
purchased offsets, but if we do need them, we 
will only use high-quality offsets to meet our 
2030 target. 

Our glidepath and future strategy 
Our strategy considers the best operational, 
technological and economic route to meeting 
our climate goals. We constantly review this as 
part of our net zero programme to ensure 
decisions reflect latest advancements and 
best practice.

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

 
The chart on the previous page shows the 
significant progress we have already made on 
carbon reduction journey delivering 59% since 
2010/11 and 24% reduction against our SBT 
target of 46% by 2031 (against our baseline in 
2019/20). Based on internal projections, linked 
to our transition and investment plans, we 
believe it will be possible to significantly 
outperform our SBT reduction target for Scope 
1 and 2 operational emissions by 2030/31 and 
in turn set the roadmap for others to follow. 

Despite being confident in our plan to deliver the 
net zero programme, it will not be a linear 
journey. The step change in effort and investment 
required between now and 2030 to deliver the 
next phase of reduction will require innovation at 
scale in the next 18 months, followed by a strong 
delivery programme in the second half of the 
decade. The additional challenge we will face 
along the way is implementing the required 
reduction interventions that not only cope with 
today’s demand, but the incremental demand on 
our business that comes from population 
growth, increased water quality standards and 
resilience of water supply.

As such, we are currently focused on investing 
in research and development to trial and test 
new technologies and ways of working that will 
enable us to make reductions that address 
these competing demands. Not all of the 
technologies we’ve tested are suitable and our 
innovation portfolio enables us to quickly adapt 
our approach in view of learnings.

The emphasis on transparent and rigorous 
reporting remains a key priority to ensure that 
we invest in the right areas. As the science and 
requirements of reporting standards and 
frameworks evolve, it’s important to 
distinguish between method changes and 
actual changes such as our process emissions. 
We continue to improve the granularity and 
confidence of our data as we move from 
estimates to actual data as much as possible 
across all our scope emissions. 

This means our emissions are going up in the 
short term, before we can start to realise 
reductions again. 

Building our programme 
We are confident that the investment we are making now will ensure we meet our targets. Our 
current estimates to achieve our reduction targets are outlined below. This will be updated with 
more detailed and costed plans as part of our next business planning cycle, PR24, which is 
currently being developed. 
OUR SCOPE 1 AND 2 NET ZERO PROGRAMME

NET ZERO HUB — 
INNOVATING 
FOR THE FUTURE
In order to make significant headway with 
our reductions, we will need to implement 
new technologies on a wider scale across 
our waste water treatment sites. Work on 
our portfolio of innovations has 
progressed significantly over the last 
twelve months through a combination of 
testing and trialling individual 
technologies for feasibility and viability at 
our Resource and Recovery Centre, as 
well as drawing on the learnings of trials 
undertaken by other companies. We have 
brought these together and are designing 
a whole system of technologies that can 
be retrofitted onto an existing waste water 
treatment site, as outlined in the Net Zero 
hub case study, and is a pivotal part of the 
programme to reduce our Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions. See our Sustainability 
Report for the case study.

Avoided emissions
Our generation of energy from anaerobic digestion within our Severn Trent Water and Green Power businesses provide us with the opportunity to 
export renewable energy to the grid. This energy displaces natural gas and electricity that might have come from other sources. We estimate the 
benefit of these avoided emissions below versus average grid emissions factors for electricity and natural gas in the UK.

Also shown in our avoided emissions table, is 
the carbon benefit of the renewable electricity 
which we export and biomethane we export to 
the grid. We generate renewable energy in 
both our regulated and non-regulated 
businesses and continue to see growth in both 
these areas. We use the proceeds to invest in 
our research and development programme to 
reduce Scope 1 emissions.

We have seen an increase in our use of sold 
product and associated emissions, due to 
changing how we account for our propane 
usage to inject biomethane into the national 
gas grid. The propane is required to ensure our 
renewable gas meets energy standards within 
the grid for metering purposes and we are 
seeking ways to reduce/replace the propane 
and improve our performance.

Our total Scope 3 footprint has increased by 2% 
from 2021/22 driven mainly by increased 
expenditure on goods and services, and capital 
goods. See our Sustainability Report for wider 
reporting on our Scope 3 journey.

Greenhouse gas reporting method 
2022/23 is the tenth year Severn Trent has 
reported GHG emissions. For Severn Trent 
Water, which accounts for 98% of our total 
Group emissions, we have been publicly 
reporting our emissions since 2002. We also 
continue to report our energy use and 
generation data to provide more detail on how 
we manage energy use. Our GHG emissions 
are reported in tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (tCO2e), for the period 1 April 2022 
to 31 March 2023. We report our location-
based and market-based emissions separately 
and report on ten Scope 3 categories. We 
report using a financial control boundary and 
follow the practices set out by the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol.

Method for calculating process 
emissions
We used the UK Water Industry Research 
(‘UKWIR’) standardised methodology for 
estimating operational GHGs, Carbon 
Accounting Workbook (‘CAW’), to calculate our 
2019/20 baseline. However, deeper insights led 
us to enhance our measurement practices, and 
over the last three years we’ve been running 
an industry-leading monitoring programme 
that shows our process emissions are 
substantially higher than the previous CAW 
estimations. Our method for estimating 
process emissions reflects guidance from the 
International Panel for Climate Change (‘IPCC’) 
which highlights the need to improve on broad 
emission factors by taking measurements at 
the facility-specific level. We are targeting 
effective monitoring at sites responsible for 
40% of N2O and 40% of CH4 emissions and have 
met this target for N2O emissions. This data 
will give us an insight into long term seasonal 
and diurnal profiles as well as any variation 
caused by processes on site. This is the second 
year we are reporting our process emissions 
based on our own measured data, rather than 
a crude emission factor estimate.

The emissions factors across our process 
emissions have increased as a result of our 
wider monitoring (to just below IPCC factors), 
which continues to confirm that emissions 
factors are substantially higher than the 
previous UKWIR CAW calculations. This 
method has been applied to our historical 
emissions. In addition, our monitoring has 
allowed us to capture new sources which were 
previously unreported.

Assuring our data 
The GHG data we report is tracked internally 
during the year through the Corporate 
Sustainability Committee and shared with the 
Board. We have subjected our GHG data and 
processes to external assurance by Jacobs. 
They completed a full audit of our Scope 1, 2 
and 3 data in line with the principals of the IS0 
14064 International standard for GHG 
emissions and found our processes for 
reporting are consistent with reporting 
requirements the GHG Protocol.

In addition, we achieved the Advancing Tier for 
the Carbon Trust pilot Route to Net Zero 
Standard – this certification recognises the 
progress of an organisation on its journey to 
net zero. This included assurance to the 
principles of IS0 14064-3 International 
standard for GHG emissions for our Scope 1 
and 2 and a small portion of our Scope 3 data. 
We are in the process of verifying our 2022/23 
footprint with the Carbon Trust to maintain 
our accreditation.

Summary of performance
Our emissions have fallen by 24% against a 
2019/20 baseline for our SBT of 46% reduction 
by 2031 on a 2019/20 baseline, driven 
predominantly by moving to 100% renewable 
electricity from our suppliers.

Our Scope 1 emissions are broadly flat from 
last year. As we capture more data, you see 
this reflected in some areas such as our fleet, 
which now include emissions from HD that 
were not previously calculated. Our use of 
natural gas is higher due to the deployment of 
Thermal Hydrolysis sludge treatment process 
at an increasing number of sites, which 
produces better quality sludge digestate and 
more renewable energy, but requires high 
temperatures. This is balanced by a reduction 
in our process emissions, which continue to 
make up the majority of our Scope 1 emissions 
at 83%. Even though we are processing higher 
volumes of sludge, approximately 60% of our 
sludge is now being treated using advanced 
digestion (‘THP’, ‘APD’) which has 
approximately half the emission factor of 
traditional anaerobic digestion.

For Scope 2, whilst we have used more 
electricity, we have benefitted from reduced 
grid emissions factors for location based 
factors. We also report the benefit of our 100% 
renewable green tariff as reflected in the 
market based emissions.

STRATEGIC REPORTREPORT  
ON ENERGY 

Below is data on our energy consumption 
and generation for the last five years 
across the Severn Trent Group. This is 
source data for the carbon data reported 
above and is tracked internally on a 
monthly basis. All data is collected from 
metered data for electricity and gas 
imports and exports. Biogas combustion 
information is calculated using 
assumptions based on metered data. 
Fuel use is reported based on financial 
records of fuel purchased. We have 
applied assumptions on standard 
calorific values to convert all liquid 
and gas fuel types to a common energy 
metric (‘GWh’) and data is reported for 
the period 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023. 
All energy is used in the UK. 

Energy efficiency 
Energy became an even more important focus 
for us this year as prices rose to record levels.

Our energy management policy and dedicated 
team and investment programme have 
enabled us to manage these pressures 
effectively during the year. We also established 
new communication campaigns focused on 
energy use management and expanded our 
flexibility approach to participate in the world’s 
first National Grid Demand Flexibility Scheme 
to mitigate price rises. 

This year we invested an additional £4.3 million 
in energy efficiency schemes and we have 
invested a total of £36 million over the last 
eight years. This includes proactive 
maintenance of our energy-intensive assets, 
such as pumps and air blowers, and 
investment in improved controls and 
monitoring to reduce energy use. Our energy 
management policy and programme reflects 
best practice outlined in ISO 50001, the 
international energy management standard. 

To reduce our operational emissions further, 
we continue to focus on improving our energy 
efficiency to offset the additional demands of 
a growing population and greater treatment 
to improve water quality. Our long-term 
energy strategy is to increase the amount of 
renewable energy we generate and procure, 
to continue to focus on energy efficiency and 
to take advantage of incentives to use 
energy flexibly.

Our total use of electricity rose this year, driven 
primarily by the drought conditions during 
summer, which required more water into supply, 
abstraction restrictions on our cheapest gravity 
sources and intensive reservoir recovery pumping 
over the winter period to prepare for the year 
ahead. This rise was mitigated by our energy 
efficiency activity and our like-for-like year end 
position on total electricity use is 2% lower, when 
removing the impacts of drought conditions.

The figures below include the large quantity of 
renewable biogas from organic waste, which 
we generate from sludge and food waste and 
then either combust in combined heat and 
power engines or export to the national gas 
grid. Our import of gas has increased over the 
last three years, driven by the commissioning 
of new heat-intensive sludge treatment 
processes and our deployment of combined 
heat and power (‘CHP’) generation fed by 
imported gas to mitigate high electricity costs. 
We have also increased our export of 
biomethane into the gas grid and decreased 
the amount of biogas we combust in CHP.

We generated more renewable energy this 
year than ever before, a total of 548 GWh. Our 
aim is that, by 2030, all energy that we use will 
come from a renewable source. That means it 
is either directly renewable or covered by a 
renewable-backed source of gas or electricity 
such as a Renewable Energy Guarantee of 
Origin (‘REGO’) or green gas certificate. 
Achieving this target will require 
electrification, which will result in an increase 
in our use of electricity in order to phase out 
the use of fossil fuels in our business. It will 
also mean an increase in use of biofuels and 
green hydrogen to replace diesel.

STRATEGIC REPORTOUR EU 
TAXONOMY  
DISCLOSURE

As we look forward to the development of a 
UK green taxonomy, we have voluntarily 
disclosed now our eligible activities under 
EU Taxonomy guidance. We look forward to 
undertaking a full alignment review for the 
next iteration of our disclosure. This has 
enabled us to report ‘green’ revenues, 
operating costs and capital expenditure of 
over 95%, increasing visibility of the scale 
of our commitment to run a business that 
goes hand-in-hand with nature, and drives 
positive change.

Application of the EU Green 
Taxonomy to the economic activities 
of Severn Trent
Severn Trent is committed to protecting and 
enhancing the environment in a way that has a 
positive sustainable impact. Robust disclosure is 
crucial in evidencing our delivery of that 
commitment, and we welcome the regulatory 
progress being made by both the EU and UK in 
developing standardised corporate sustainability 
reporting frameworks for ESG activities. Whilst 
we look forward to the expected establishment 
of an interoperable UK Taxonomy, we have 
decided to accelerate the enhancement of our 
sustainability disclosures by making a voluntary 
disclosure under the EU Taxonomy framework. 
By reporting our activities against the EU 
Taxonomy, we hope to provide greater 
transparency for all stakeholders and decision-
useful information for both investors and 
lenders. More detail on our Principal Adverse 
Impact (‘PAI’) assessment can be found in our 
ESG data book on our website severntrent.com/
sustainability-strategy/.

Our approach
We have begun to adapt our processes to enable 
Severn Trent to prepare a preliminary analysis 
of eligible economic activities under the EU 
Taxonomy. Our approach for this disclosure is 
based on guidance and interpretation, and has 
been subject to external third-line assurance. 
However, this is not a full disclosure, and we will 
be developing our approach over the coming 
months to enable a full review of alignment to 
the EU Taxonomy.

We have established a ‘Taxonomy’ working 
group tasked with embedding a new process 
for taxonomy reporting within the ST Group, 
including an initial activity review using data 
available from existing financial systems and 
application of the EU Taxonomy to our 
economic activities. The working group 
consists of finance and sustainability 
professionals, co-ordinating with subject 
matter experts across the wider business to 
input into the activity review as required.

As part of this review, we have performed a 
detailed analysis of our economic activities, 
allowing us to make an initial assessment of 
their eligibility under the EU Taxonomy. 

The analysis was based on the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation, which includes its associated 
legislative acts (the ‘Delegated Acts’) described 
below and any additional guidance released, 
such as FAQs, up to the date of reporting:

 – The Climate Delegated Act – establishes  
the technical screening criteria (‘TSC’) for 
determining the conditions under which an 
economic activity qualifies as contributing 
substantially to climate change mitigation 
(Annex 1) or climate change adaptation (Annex 
2), and for determining whether that economic 
activity does no significant harm, in line with 
the Do No Significant Harm (‘DNSH’) principle, 
to any of the other environmental objectives.

 – The Disclosure Delegated Act – specifies the 
content and presentation of information to be 
disclosed, concerning environmentally 
sustainable economic activities, and 
specifying the methodology to perform that 
assessment.

We will expand on our initial analysis to include 
a full review of the significant contribution 
criteria, including the assessment of our 
economic activities against the Do No 
Significant Harm (‘DNSH’) principles and 
minimum safeguard requirements. Through 
this process, we will establish the evaluation 
methodology that will apply in future periods, 
with the aim of reporting against all alignment 
criteria in the next iteration of our disclosure. 

Initial disclosure – eligibility review
We have disclosed the eligibility of our 
business activities against the two objectives 
that have so far been published (climate 
change mitigation and climate change 
adaptation), alongside the proportion of 
revenue, operating costs and capital 
expenditure associated with each. The table 
below provides a summary of our taxonomy-
eligible activities, which are broadly the same 
for both objectives. When we review full 
alignment, we expect there to be more marked 
differences between the values against the two 
objectives, and to be able to disclose with more 
granularity the allocation within our existing 
activities. We also expect to be able to report 
against the remaining four objectives when the 
relevant legislation is published.

Methodology
Within the regulated entities of Severn Trent 
Water and Hafren Dyfrdwy we report to Ofwat 
under price controls (Water Resources, Water 
Network +, Waste Network +, Bioresources). 
To comply with regulatory accounting 
guidelines, we apply cost allocations and 
recharges between business areas across the 
Group. These include centralised costs such as 
HR, Finance, and other support functions, 
whilst our Retail price control incorporates 
costs associated with ensuring we provide a 
continued service for our customers, such as 
managing bills and running our customer 
contact centres. As these services are vital for 
the eligible activities to take place, we have 
allocated the associated costs to the eligible 
activities mapped out in this disclosure under 
the Water Resources, Water Network + and 
Waste Network + price controls on a pro-
rata basis. 

The figures taken to report our activities 
against the EU Taxonomy are based on the 
same cost allocation approach we use for both 
entity and regulatory reporting, as a 
percentage of the totals presented in the 
Balance Sheet and Income Statement here in 
our Annual Report and Accounts to 31 March 
2023. We have made an assumption that all 
costs allocated to our Bioresources price 
control are eligible, whilst further work is 
needed to establish eligibility of some of the 
separate activities within this area. Based on 
EU Taxonomy guidance published to date, we 
have excluded depreciation and amortisation 
costs from operating expenditure in 
calculating the level of eligible costs, as well 
as the charge for bad and doubtful debts.

Incorporated within the costs allocated to the 
above categories are costs associated with the 
activities listed here, also eligible within the EU 
Taxonomy. We may seek to extract and report on 
costs within these activities separately in a future 
iteration of our disclosure. 

It is expected that the UK Taxonomy, when 
established, will be interoperable with the EU 
Taxonomy, so that the UK model does not deviate 
significantly from that of the EU. We expect our 
assessment of our taxonomy-eligible activities 
disclosed here to be consistent with the future UK 
framework. We also note that the future 
introduction of the remaining four objectives of the 
EU Taxonomy (sustainable use and protection of 
water and marine resources, transition to a 
circular economy, pollution prevention and 
control, and protection and restoration of 
biodiversity and ecosystem) will include 
environmental objectives relevant to Severn Trent. 
Based on an initial review of the proposals, we 
believe there will be additional activities eligible 
under the criteria recently published for 
consultation.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
 
 
 
 
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW

We have delivered strong 
financial performance this year 
in the face of challenging 
external factors including:

 – unprecedented wholesale 

energy prices

 – cost pressures on chemicals, 
other materials and licence fees

 – additional operating costs 
during the exceptionally 
hot and dry summer and 
the freeze thaw event 
in December

The regulatory model set the inflationary uplift in this year’s tariffs from CPIH in November 
2021. This lag meant our regulated revenue for the year included an increase of only 4.6% while 
inflation on key operating costs was significantly higher than this.

Despite these challenges we have delivered Group PBIT of £508.8 million (2021/22 
£506.2 million). A summary of our financial performance for the year is set out below:

Turnover in Regulated Water and Waste Water 
increased year on year by £191 million, which 
was in the middle of our expected range. 
Business Services turnover increased by 
£34 million as a result of growth in our 
Operating Services business and the benefit 
of higher generation and energy prices in our 
Green Power business.

Net labour and hired and contracted costs 
increased by £21.4 million (4.9%). Gross costs 
increased due to hired staff providing leakage 
reduction support and other short-term labour 
requirements. Increased activity on our 
capital programme was offset by higher 
capitalised labour.

Higher energy prices reduced Group PBIT by 
around £43 million year-on-year as the higher 
costs of energy consumed exceeded the 
benefit from our energy revenues. The impact 
on totex in our regulated business was around 
£23 million higher as this does not include the 
benefit of revenue from energy generated in 
our Green Power business. We expect totex 
and RoRE to be impacted by higher energy 
costs for the remainder of the AMP but this 
impact will be offset to deliver a broadly 
neutral Group return on equity across the five- 
year period. Across the Group, we generate 
the equivalent of around 53% of our energy 
requirements. This provides an effective 
energy price hedge for our group return on 
equity because our power costs mainly arise 
in parts of our regulated business in which 

Severn Trent Water’s RoRE for the 
year was 12.2%, 830 bps above the 
base return of 3.9%. Outperformance 
came mainly from our customer ODI 
rewards of £53 million, with around 
80% of our measures in reward, and 
financing, reflecting our continued low 
cash interest cost and the impact of 
higher inflation in the year compared 
to Ofwat’s Final Determination 
assumption.

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

over or under spend is shared with customers, 
whereas revenues are earned in the non-
regulated business or areas where 
performance variances are not shared.

We also saw a sharp increase in the cost of 
energy intensive products. Chemical costs 
increased by £21.3 million, of which 
£20.5 million arose in our Regulated Water 
and Waste Water business.

Net finance costs rose as higher inflation in the 
period increased the cost of our index-linked 
debt. Our effective interest cost was 150 bps 
higher at 6.2% (2021/22: 4.7%); our effective 
cash cost of interest (which excludes the 
inflation uplift on index-linked debt) was 
unchanged at 3.0% (2021/22: 3.0%).

We continued to benefit from the super deduction, 
which gives a 130% tax allowance in the year for 
qualifying capital expenditure. This, together with 
the higher finance costs, resulted in an adjusted 
effective tax rate of nil% (unchanged from nil% in 
2021/22) and, as expected, no current tax payable 
relating to the year. 

In his 2023 Budget, the Chancellor introduced 
100% first year capital allowances for 
qualifying plant and machinery for a three-
year period from 1 April 2023. As a result, we 
expect our adjusted effective tax rate to remain 
around nil while the allowance is in place.

The tax charge of £35.7 million reflects our full 
effective tax rate this year of 21.3% 
(2021/22: 24.4% before exceptional deferred 
tax). In the previous year, the increase in the 
corporation tax rate to 25% from FY24 was 
reflected in our deferred tax provision and in 
an exceptional deferred tax charge to the 
income statement of £294.4 million.

Financial KPIs

Group profit after tax was £132.2 million (2021/22: 
a loss of £87.2 million as a result of the exceptional 
deferred tax charge) and our adjusted basic EPS 
was 58.2 pence (2021/22: 96.1 pence) reflecting 
higher net finance costs from the impact of 
inflation on the cost of our index-linked debt. Basic 
EPS was 52.7 pence (2021/22: loss of 35.2 pence 
due to the exceptional deferred tax from the 
change of corporation tax rate).

Our balance sheet remains strong. At 
31 March 2023 our net debt was £7,160.5 million 
(2022: £6,507.8 million) and our shadow RCV 
gearing, taking into account amounts that will be 
included in the RCV at the end of the AMP but 
which we have already incurred, is 60.0% 
(2022: 59.2%). Our regulatory gearing is 60.7% 
(2022: 59.5%), well below the sector average 
and close to Ofwat’s notional capital structure 
for AMP7.

Our net pension deficit on an IAS 19 basis is 
£279.4 million (2022: £128.0 million). Gross 
liabilities decreased as the discount rate, which 
is based on the yield observed on high-quality 
corporate bonds, increased and inflation 
expectations over the life of the liabilities 
decreased. Hedging assets moved broadly in line 
with the fall in liabilities, with other asset values 
affected by the higher yield environment in the 
second half of the year. The 2022 triennial 
actuarial valuation was agreed in November 2022, 
with an unchanged future funding plan.

Operational cash flow was £713.1 million, 
(2021/22: £848.9 million). EBITDA increased by 
£18.3 million but pension contributions increased 
by £38.6 million as we paid two years’ deficit 
reduction contributions in the year and changes 
in working capital increased cash outflows by 
£100 million more than the previous year. Cash 

capex was £686.6 million, up £92.3 million due 
to the increasing capital programme. Net 
cash outflow before changes in net debt was 
£440.4 million (2021/22: inflow of £76.7 million).

This year we have published in our Annual Report 
our first disclosure consistent with the EU 
Taxonomy. We are committed to protecting and 
enhancing the environment and transparent 
disclosures are an important part of 
demonstrating that commitment. We have 
accelerated the enhancement of our sustainability 
disclosures by making a voluntary disclosure 
under the EU Taxonomy framework. We have 
completed an initial eligibility-only review and are 
working towards a full alignment review. Our 
initial assessment is that eligible activities make 
up 95% of our revenues, 95% of our operating 
costs and 99% of our capital expenditure.

Severn Trent Water’s RoRE for the year was 
12.2%, 830 bps above the base return of 3.9%. 
Outperformance came mainly from our customer 
ODI rewards of £53 million, with around 80% of 
our measures in reward, and financing, reflecting 
our continued low cash interest cost and the 
impact of higher inflation in the year compared 
to Ofwat’s Final Determination assumption.

Although in the current year we have seen an 
adverse impact from higher inflation on our 
operating and finance costs, in the longer term we 
expect to see the benefits through indexation of 
our RCV, revenue growth and lower gearing, all 
of which underpin our inflation-linked AMP7 
dividend policy.

Our proposed final dividend of 64.09 pence 
(2021/22: 61.28 pence), is in line with our 
inflation-linked dividend policy and payable 
on 14 July 2023.

Group PBIT is a measure of the profit 
generated by the Group’s operations. 
Commentary on the performance in the 
year is set out in this CFO Review.

Shadow RCV gearing is calculated as set 
out in note 32 Ofwat’s regulatory model, 
for AMP7 is based on a notional gearing 
level of 60%. Low gearing would lead to a 
higher cost of capital as this would 
indicate a reliance on more expensive 
equity funding. High gearing indicates 
greater risk of default on debt finance.

EPS is a key financial metric that 
indicates the Group’s profitability after 
finance costs and tax. Adjusted EPS 
excludes distorting factors such as 
exceptional gains and losses and 
accounting adjustments for gains and 
losses on valuations of financial 
instruments and deferred tax. 
Commentary on the performance in the 
year is set out in this CFO’s Review and 
the calculation of adjusted EPS is set out 
in note 14 to the financial statements.

Commentary on the performance in the 
year compared to the previous year is set 
out in this CFO’s Review. 

RoRE outperformance is a key metric 
used by Ofwat and is the performance 
metric used in our Long Term Incentive 
Plans. It measures performance against 
an expected return set by Ofwat.

Performance is determined across three 
main areas:

–  total expenditure (‘Totex’) measured by 
efficiency in operational and capital 
expenditure;

–  operational performance is measured 
by the customer ODI reward earned or 
penalty incurred; and

–  financing performance is measured by 
performance against Ofwat’s expected 
cost of debt set in the AMP7 Final 
Determination.

Commentary on the performance in the 
year compared to the previous year is set 
out in this CFO Review.

Turnover increased by £191.0 million with the 
main movements being:

 – an increase of £78.0 million for the annual 
CPIH uplift in tariffs, partially offset by 
reductions of £15.1 million from the 
‘K’ factor for the year;

 – a £66.9 million increase representing the 

recovery, under the RFI mechanism, of lower 
than allowed revenue in 2020/21;

 – £35.0 million of in-year fast money 
allowance for the Green Recovery 
Programme;

 – £24.4 million additional energy generation 

revenue in our Bioresources business 
driven by higher wholesale energy prices;

 – an increase of £18.7 million in diversions 

income largely due to the increase in activity 
related to HS2 as guided. This represents a 
recovery of costs incurred and is offset by 
an increase in infrastructure renewals 
expenditure;

 – lower revenue from the Voids and Gaps 

Incentives Scheme (£4.7 million lower); and

 – lower revenues billed by other water 

companies on our behalf and other small 
differences (£12.2 million).

Net labour costs of £158.2 million were 4.3% 
lower year-on-year. Gross employee costs 
increased due to the annual pay award of 2.3% 
and an increase in FTE from the step up in the 
capital programme. This was offset by higher 
capitalisation of employee costs and an 
£8.3 million credit related to a change in 
defined benefit scheme options developed with 
the Trustee. The new bridging pension option 
allows members who retire early to bridge the 
gap between their retirement date and the date 
when the state pension becomes payable, by 
taking more of their occupational pension up 
front, which has a positive effect on expected 
pension liabilities.

Net hired and contracted costs increased by 
£27.2 million (14.3%). The increase is driven 
by higher tankering and jetting activity, more 
hired staff to support leakage reduction and 
improve operational performance, third party 
technology consultants and other contract 
management cost increases.

Our economic energy hedge effectively limits 
the impact of higher energy prices on the 
Group’s return on equity. Power costs were 
£90.5 million (79.3%) higher than the previous 
period although our weighted wholesale 
average price was about 30% less than the 
average market wholesale energy price. We 
benefited from self-generation and favourable 
energy export in Bioresources, as well as 
internal hedges between our regulated 
business (a net consumer of energy) and 
our non-regulated Green Power business 
(a net generator).

Bad debt charges decreased by £0.3 million 
and represented 1.7% of household revenue. 
Our cash collection in the year was lower as 
households felt the impact of cost of living 
increases. However, this impact was not as 
high as we provided for at the previous year 
end, leaving the overall charge broadly flat.

Other costs increased by £33.9 million, 
including £20.5 million higher chemical costs 
and higher Environment Agency abstraction 
and discharge consent fees of £3.7 million. 
The remaining increase was due to higher 
costs of materials and consumables, fuel 
and insurance costs.

Infrastructure renewals expenditure was 
£40.2 million higher in the period, reflecting 
the planned step up in the programme and 
activity related to HS2 referred to above.

Depreciation of £400.4 million was 
£15.4 million higher year-on-year due to new 
assets coming into service as part of our 
Water Framework Directive programme 
as well as a full year of depreciation on 
the advanced digestion and biogas-to-grid 
plants at Finham and Stoke Bardolph. 

Return on Regulated Equity (‘RoRE’)
RoRE is a key performance indicator for the 
regulated business and reflects our combined 
performance on totex, customer ODIs and 
financing compared to the base return allowed 
in the AMP7 Final Determination.

We have delivered RoRE of 12.2% in the year, 
outperforming the base return by 8.3% as a 
result of:

 – ODI performance of 0.7%, driven by strong 

performance across the majority of 
measures, with c.80% meeting or exceeding 
regulatory targets;

 – our neutral totex position reflecting good 
cost control and efficient spend over a 
challenging year; and

 – financing performance of 7.7%, driven by our 

AMP7 financing strategy that includes a 
relatively low level of index-linked debt, 
and the tax benefit of super deduction 
capital allowances.

Business Services turnover was £177.1 million 
(up 23.3%) and EBITDA was £65.8 million 
(up 23.7%).

In our Operating Services and Other businesses, 
turnover increased by £10.4 million due to 
increased activity on the Ministry of Defense 
(‘MoD’) and Coal Authority contracts as well as 
sales growth in our water hygiene business, 
Aqualytix. EBITDA was £5.6 million higher 
mainly due to improved margins on these 
contracts.

In Green Power, turnover increased by 
£23.1 million, largely due to significantly higher 
energy prices over the last year which helped 
offset increased power consumption costs in 
RWWW, through the Group’s natural energy 
hedge. EBITDA was up £18.2 million due to 
the higher revenue, partially offset by 
increased costs of food waste, sileage and 
haulage as well as a £2.2 million charge for 
the government energy generator levy in the 
final quarter of the financial year. We do not 
expect to incur the levy in FY24 based on 
latest forecast prices.

Profits from Property Development were 
£11.2 million lower than the prior year mainly 
due to timing of significant disposals and 
delays in the planning process. However,

We hold interest rate swaps with a net notional 
principal of £448.4 million floating to fixed, 
which economically act to hedge exchange rate 
risk on certain foreign currency borrowings. 
We also hold cross currency swaps with a 
sterling principal of £98.3 million, that swap 
foreign currency fixed interest debt to sterling 
floating interest rate.

We revalue the derivatives at each balance 
sheet date and take the changes in value to the 
income statement, unless the derivative is part 
of a cash flow hedge.

Where hedge accounting is not applied, if the 
risk being hedged does not impact the income 
statement in the same period as the change 
in value of the derivative, then an accounting 
mismatch arises and there is a net charge 
or credit to the income statement. During 
the year there was a gain of £35.7 million 
(2021/22: £51.5 million) in relation to 
these instruments.

Note 11 to the financial statements gives an 
analysis of the amounts charged to the income 
statement in relation to financial instruments.

As part of our power cost management 
strategy, we have fixed the wholesale price 
for more than 95% of our estimated wholesale 
energy usage for 2023/24 through physical 
hedges with suppliers and natural hedges 
from the export of self-generated energy. 

Share of loss of joint venture
Water Plus’s performance continues to 
improve and it achieved break even in the 
year. Our share of Water Plus’s result for the 
year was therefore £ – million (2021/22: loss 
of £2.2 million).

Corporate and other
Corporate costs were £8.7 million 
(2021/22: £8.2 million) including directors’ 
bonuses charged to Severn Trent Plc this year 
rather than Severn Trent Water. Our other 
businesses generated PBIT of £0.7 million 
(2021/22: £1.3 million). 

Net finance costs
Net finance costs for the year were 
£93.2 million (34.6%) higher than the prior year 
at £362.6 million. During the year we issued 
£1,351 million of new debt at rates consistently 
below the iBoxx index and our effective cash 
cost of interest (excluding the RPI uplift on 
index-linked debt and pensions-related 
charges) was unchanged at 3.0% 
(2021/22: 3.0%).

Average net debt was up 6.8% at 
£6,720.6 million (2021/22: £6,292.2 million), 
with higher inflation in the year increasing the 
cost of our index-linked debt by £100.9 million. 
Our effective interest cost was 6.2% 
(2021/22: 4.7%).

Capitalised interest of £56.6 million was 
£22.1 million higher year-on-year, due to the 
higher effective interest cost and increased 
capital work in progress compared to the 
previous year.

Our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) interest cover was 
2.6 times (2021/22: 3.5 times) and PBIT interest 
cover was 1.4 times (2021/22: 1.9 times). See 
note 42 for further details.

Gains/losses on financial 
instruments
We use financial derivatives solely to hedge 
risks associated with our normal business 
activities including:

 – exchange rate exposure on foreign currency 

borrowings;

 – interest rate exposures on floating rate 

borrowings;

 – exposures to increases in electricity prices; 

and

 – changes in the regulatory model from RPI 

to CPIH.

No tax was paid relating to the year as the 
allowances available from the super deduction 
resulted in a loss for tax purposes 
(2021/22: £1.2 million paid to Water Plus).

Note 12 in the financial statements sets out 
the tax charges and credits in the year, which 
are described below.

The current tax charge for the year was 
£0.2 million, which arose from adjustments to 
tax provisions from previous years (2021/22: 
credit of £4.8 million). The deferred tax charge 
was £35.5 million (2021/22: £71.7 million 
before the exceptional charge arising from 
the change of rate).

Our effective tax rate excluding the exceptional 
deferred tax charge this year was 21.3% 
(2021/22: 24.4%), which is higher than the 
UK rate of corporation tax in both years (19%), 
mainly due to deferred tax on temporary 
differences arising during the year charged at 
25%, partly offset by the permanent difference 
that arises mainly from the additional 30% 
deduction included in the super deduction.

.

Our adjusted effective current tax rate was nil 
(2021/22: nil%) (see note 42).

UK tax rules specify the rate of tax relief 
available on capital expenditure. Typically this 
is greater in the early years than the rate of 
depreciation used to write off the expenditure 
in our accounts. In the current and previous 
years, this was enhanced by the super 
deduction for certain capital expenditure, 
which gave a 100% tax deduction in the year 
of spend plus an additional allowance of 30%.

The impact of this timing difference applied 
across our significant and recurring capital 
programme tends to reduce our adjusted 
effective current tax rate and corporation tax 
payments in the year. Accounting standards 
require that we make a provision for the tax 
that we would pay in future periods, if the 
depreciation charge arising on expenditure for 
which tax relief has already been received is 
not offset by further tax allowances in those 
periods. However, the nature of our business, 
including a significant rolling capital 
programme and the long lives of our assets, 
means we do not expect these timing 
differences to reverse for the foreseeable 
future, and they may never do so. This is the 
most significant component of our deferred 
tax position.

Profit for the year and earnings 
per share
Total profit for the year was £132.2 million 
(2021/22 loss: £87.2 million).

Basic earnings per share was 52.7 pence 
(2021/22: loss of 35.2 pence). Adjusted 
basic earnings per share was 58.2 pence 
(2021/22: 96.1 pence). For further details 
see note 14.

Operational cash flow was £713.1 million 
(2021/22: £848.9 million). PBIT was broadly 
flat year on year but higher depreciation and 
amortisation were more than offset by 
increased pension contributions and 
working capital movements.

Net cash capex increased to £686.6 million 
(2021/22: £594.3 million), reflecting our progress 
against our £2.9 billion core capital programme.

Our net interest payments of £203.5 million 
(2021/22: £185.0 million) were higher than the 
previous year due to the impact of higher net debt, 
with the effective cash cost of interest (which 
excludes the non–cash indexation charge on index 
linked debt) in line with the previous year.

The benefits of the super deduction capital 
allowance and the impact of higher interest 
costs meant that we had no taxable profit in 
the year and therefore paid no corporation tax 
in relation to the year. Our net tax payments of 
£4.0 million related to previous years. In the 
previous year we paid Water Plus £1.2 million 
for consortium relief.

We received £13.5 million net from the exercise 
of options under the employee Save As You Earn 
share scheme and purchase of shares for other 
share schemes. In the prior year we received 
£11.9 million from option exercises and raised 
net proceeds of £245.3 million from the May 2021 
equity placing. Our dividends paid increased in 
line with our policy to increase by CPIH each year 
during AMP7.

These cash flows, together with accounting 
adjustments to the carrying value of debt, 
resulted in an increase in debt of £652.7 million 
(2021/22: £64.0 million).

At 31 March 2023 we held £28.7 million 
(2022: £107.7 million) in net cash and cash 
equivalents. Average debt maturity was around 
14 years (2022: 13 years). Including committed 
facilities, our cash flow requirements are 
funded until November 2024.

Net debt at 31 March 2023 was £7,160.5 million 
(2022: £6,507.8 million) and balance sheet 
gearing (net debt/net debt plus equity) was 
88.1% (2022: 83.7%). Regulatory gearing (net 
debt of our regulated businesses, expressed 
as a percentage of estimated RCV) was 60.7% 
at 31 March 2023 (2022: 59.5%). Shadow 
regulatory gearing was 60.0% (2022: 59.2%).

The estimated fair value of debt at 31 March 
2023 was £366.2 million lower than book value 
(2022: £1,075.8 million higher). The change in 
the difference between book and fair value is 
largely due to the impact of higher inflation 
expectations on the fair value of our index-
linked debt.

Our policy for the management of interest 
rates is that at least 40% of our borrowings 
should be at fixed interest rates, or hedged 
through the use of interest rate swaps or 
forward rate agreements. At 31 March 2023 
interest rates for 67% (2022: 66%) of our gross 
debt of £7,261.2 million were fixed; 5% were 
floating and 28% were index linked. We 
continue to carefully monitor market 
conditions and our interest rate exposure.

STRATEGIC REPORTCHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW CONTINUED

The movements in the net deficit during the year were:

At start of the period

Amounts credited/(charged) to income statement

Actuarial gains/(losses) taken to reserves

Net contributions received and benefits paid

At end of the period

The income statement includes:

 – current service costs of £0.1 million on the 

DVWS, which remains open to further 
accrual but is closed to new members;

 – a past service credit of £8.3 million following 

a change in the STPS’s rules to allow 
members to take a higher initial pension on 
retirement in exchange for a lower pension 
from state pension age;

 – scheme administration costs of £4.3 million; 

and

 – interest on scheme liabilities and expected 

return on the scheme assets – together a net 
cost of £3.6 million. 

Higher interest rate expectations increased 
the discount rate, which is derived from yields 
on high-quality corporate bonds, by 200bps. 
Inflation expectations decreased by around 
30bps since the previous year end. The 
impacts of these changes resulted in a net 
decrease in the scheme liabilities of around 
£745 million.

Changes to demographic assumptions to align 
with the 2022 funding valuation increased 
scheme liabilities by around £30 million. This 
was partly offset by an update to the most 
recent CMI data tables and also a weighting to 
allow for higher mortality experienced in 2021.

The actual outturn in the year for inflation 
and other assumptions increased scheme 
liabilities by £58.7 million.

Higher bond yields impacted the value of 
scheme assets, which decreased in value by 
£922.0 million more than the return included 
in the income statement in the year.

Contributions paid to the STPS in the year 
included:

 – the amounts due under the asset-backed 
funding arrangements (£26.9 million); and

 – a deficit reduction payment of £34.7 million 
that was deferred from March 2022 to April 
2022 and the payment due for the year ended 
31 March 2023 of £37.8 million.

There were also contributions of £0.2 million to 
the DVWS, a payment of £0.4 million for MIPS 
running costs and payments of benefits under 
the unfunded scheme amounting to 
£0.5 million.

Dividends
In line with our policy for AMP7 to increase the 
dividend by at least CPIH each year, the Board 
has proposed a final ordinary dividend of 
64.09 pence per share for 2022/23 
(2021/22: 61.28 pence per share). This gives 
a total ordinary dividend for the year of 
106.82 pence (2021/22: 102.14 pence).

The final ordinary dividend is payable on 
14 July 2023 to shareholders on the register 
at 2 June 2023.

Pensions
We have three defined benefit pensions 
arrangements, two from Severn Trent and one 
from Dee Valley Water. The Severn Trent 
schemes (‘the Schemes’) are closed to future 
accrual.

The most recent formal actuarial valuation for 
the Severn Trent Pension Scheme (‘STPS’), 
which is by far the largest of the schemes, was 
completed as at 31 March 2022. The future 
funding plan agreed with the Trustee was 
unchanged from the 2019 valuation (save for 
inflationary uplifts where applicable) and 
includes:

 – annual deficit reduction payments to be 

made until the year ending 31 March 2027, 
with a forecast1 payment of c.£40 million in 
the year ending 31 March 2024, increasing 
thereafter in line with November CPI.

 – payments under an asset-backed funding 
arrangement of £8.2 million per annum to 
31 March 2032, which will only continue 
beyond 31 March 2025 if the Scheme’s assets 
are less than the Scheme’s Technical 
Provisions; and

 – inflation-linked payments under an 

asset-backed funding arrangement, with a 
forecast1 payment of c.£28 million in the year 
ending 31 March 2024, potentially continuing 
to 31 March 2031, although these 
contributions will cease earlier should a 
subsequent valuation of the STPS show that 
these contributions are no longer needed.

In June 2021 we executed a bulk annuity buy-in 
for the Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension 
Scheme, which represents around 4% of the 
Group’s defined benefit liabilities. Under the 
buy-in, the liabilities of this scheme will be 
met by an insurance policy and as a result 
the Group’s risk is substantially reduced.

Hafren Dyfrdwy participates in the Dee Valley 
Water Limited Section (‘DVWS’) of the Water 
Companies Pension Scheme. DVWS funds are 
administered by trustees and held separately 
from the assets of the Group. DVWS is closed 
to new entrants. The most recent formal 
actuarial valuation of DVWS was completed 
as at 31 March 2020 and no deficit reduction 
contributions are required. In March 2023, the 
DVWS also entered into a bulk annuity buy-in 
insurance policy that covers the majority of 
the scheme obligations.

On an IAS 19 basis, the net position (before 
deferred tax) of all of the Group’s defined 
benefit pension schemes was a deficit of 
£279.4 million (2022: £128.0 million). 
Calculation of the pension deficit for 
accounting purposes uses corporate bond 
yields as the basis for the discount rate of 
our long-term liabilities, irrespective of the 
nature of the scheme’s assets or their 
expected returns.

On an IAS 19 basis, the funding level decreased 
to 86% (31 March 2022: 95%).

OUR APPROACH TO RISK

Severn Trent has a robust risk 
management framework in 
place to effectively identify, 
assess and mitigate risk. Our 
risk management framework 
enables us to meet our 
strategic priorities and 
optimise our risk exposure 
within our risk appetite.

2022/23 risk positioning
Since 2020/21, we have provided a risk update 
highlighting the challenges and opportunities 
we face as a business, with a greater focus on 
global events and effects of those events, both 
economically and on society, and geopolitical 
instability, including the conflict in Ukraine. 

Another key area of focus for this year has 
been the ‘cost of living crisis’ which has 
impacted many UK households as real 
disposable incomes fall. Inflation has soared, 
with a key driver being the rapid increase in 
energy costs, caused by a rise in the wholesale 
price of gas. Furthermore, the Bank of England 
has raised the base rate several times over the 
last year in an effort to control inflation. We 
recognise that it is a difficult time and it can be 
a real struggle for some of our customers and 
we have a number of customer support 
schemes that are helping customers who are 
struggling with the cost of living (see pages 29 
to 30 for more information).

Risk appetite statement
No business is free of risk and to achieve our 
strategic priorities we often need to take 
calculated risks. We will, however, only take 
risks that are consistent with our Purpose, 
Values and Strategy, and are well understood, 
so that they can be managed effectively.

Our sector has inherent risks, particularly 
due to the nature and scale of our operational 
infrastructure and the importance of our 
activities to the health, safety and wellbeing of 
our people and the communities we serve. The 
sector is also subject to political, regulatory 
and financial market risk, as well as risks 
arising from developments in technology, 
stakeholders’ evolving expectations and 
climate change.

Within the Severn Trent Group, we operate 
both regulated and non-regulated businesses, 
which have different risk profiles and 
tolerances. Our regulated water and waste 
water businesses are monopoly providers that 
are economically regulated and characterised 
by relatively stable, inflation-linked cash flows. 
Our non-regulated businesses have more 
variable cash flows and operate in less 
predictable, competitive environments.

Our risk priorities
The Board has overall responsibility for 
determining the nature and extent of the risks 
Severn Trent takes and for ensuring that risks 
are managed effectively across the Group. In 
addition to managing the inherent risks 
associated with our business, we prioritise 
the following:

 – The health, safety and wellbeing of our 

people and the communities we serve and 
maintaining our essential operational 
services are our top priorities, and we have 
no appetite for risks brought on by unsafe 
actions.

 – Protecting the environment is a key 

long-term commitment. We aim to enhance 
the water environment and improve 
biodiversity. 

 – Adherence to laws and regulations is a 
fundamental requirement and we are 
committed to ensuring compliance with all 
UK water regulations and to operate within 
our licence permits; therefore, we have no 
appetite for compliance-related risks.

 – Our approach to financing is to take 

measured risk consistent with providing 
resilience and delivering sustainable 
outperformance for the best long-term 
value for our customers and shareholders. 

 – We are determined to play a leading role 

Top down 
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
oversight of risk and for maintaining a robust 
risk management and internal control system. 
The Board recognises the importance of 
identifying and actively monitoring all types of 
risk (e.g. strategic, reputational, financial, and 
operational risks) in the short, and longer 
term. The Board regularly receives updates 
on the threats, trends and challenges facing 
the business. 

The Audit and Risk Committee supports 
the Board in the management of risk and is 
responsible for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the risk management and internal control 
framework during the year. 

The Executive Committee reviews strategic 
priorities and assesses the level of risk taken 
in achieving these objectives. 

The Strategic Risk Forum (‘SRF’) assists the 
Executive Committee, the Board, and the Audit 
and Risk Committee to effectively oversee the 
risk framework and its processes of risk 
identification, risk assessment and risk 
mitigation to ensure that the Company meets 
its strategic priorities. 

This top-down risk process helps to ensure 
the bottom-up risk process, described below, 
is aligned to our current Strategy and 
objectives. 

Bottom up 
Operating in the water sector means risk 
management is embedded throughout our 
processes, from day-to-day asset operation 
and monitoring, medium-term deployment of 
capital investment to long-term modelling of 
asset health, performance, and societal and 
environmental changes. 

in addressing the impact of climate change 
through mitigating our own impact and that 
of our supply chain, and adapting to the 
challenges that climate change may bring 
in the future.

Our strong continuous improvement culture 
ensures that risk discussions happen at all 
levels of the business, resulting in risks being 
identified, categorised, assessed and entered 
into the ERM system.

Risk reporting 
The ERM process is operated by the Central 
ERM Team and underpinned by a standardised 
methodology and policies to ensure 
consistency. 

ERM Champions and Co-ordinators operate 
throughout the business, with support and 
challenge from the Central ERM Team, 
continually identifying and assessing risks 
in their business units and reporting on a 
quarterly basis. Standardised criteria are 
used to consider the likelihood and velocity 
of occurrence and potential financial and 
reputational impacts.

Overseeing risk 
Our approach to risk management is designed 
to enable the business to deliver its strategic 
priorities. We have an established Enterprise 
Risk Management (‘ERM’) process and internal 
control framework that help us to identify, 
evaluate and manage risks to influence 
decision making. Our approach cannot 
eliminate all risk entirely, but ensures we have 
the right structure to effectively navigate the 
challenges and opportunities we face, and only 
take risks that are within our risk appetite. 

We operate a top-down and bottom-up model 
of risk management in line with the three lines 
of defence approach that ensures both a clear 
articulation of risk appetite, and a 
comprehensive and structured process of risk 
identification, assessment and management. 
Our risk management framework on the next 
page shows the parties involved in risk across 
Severn Trent.

and Risk Co-ordinators.

 – Assists with the identification and assessment of 

Principal and Emerging Risks.

 – Facilitates risk escalation processes.

The potential causes, impacts and mitigating 
controls related to each risk are well 
documented. This assessment allows us to 
put in place effective risk response strategies 
to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level and, 
following governance checks, to remediate 
any defective controls or implement additional 
controls as required. 

Risk information from our Business Units is 
combined to form a consolidated view of risk 
across the Group. Our significant risks form 
our Group risk profile which is reported to the 
Executive Committee and SRF for review and 
challenge. This is then reported to the Audit 
and Risk Committee and Board on a six 
monthly basis. The report provides an 
assessment of the effectiveness of controls 
over each risk and action plans to improve 
controls where necessary. 

Our recognised ERM risks are linked with our 
Licence to Operate process. This helps create 
a dynamic link and improves our risk reporting 
to the Board and Audit and Risk Committee. 
Additionally, our ERM risks have been mapped 
against our business model and we have linked 
risk causes with recognised climate drivers 
where the likelihood could be exacerbated by 
a different climatic future.

OUR PRINCIPAL RISKS

The Directors have carried out a robust 
assessment of the Principal Risks facing the 
Company, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency, 
or liquidity, to identify risks that could: 

 – adversely impact the safety or security of the 
Group’s employees, customers and assets;

 – have a material impact on the financial or 
operational performance of the Group;

Health and safety

Risk 1
Due to the nature of our operations, we 
could endanger the health and safety of 
our people, contractors, and members of 
the public

Infrastructure failure and 
asset resilience 

Risk 2
We do not provide a safe and secure supply 
of drinking water to our customers 

 – impede achievement of the Group’s strategic 

objectives and financial targets; and/or

 – adversely impact the Group’s reputation or 

stakeholder expectations. 

This list does not comprise all the risks 
that the Group may face, and they are not 
presented in order of importance. The nature 
and profile of these risks are updated each 
year to reflect the changing risk landscape. 

There may be additional risks that emerge 
in the future, and we undertake regular 
horizon scanning to identify and report 
these to the Board. 

Our Principal Risks reported in 2022/23 are 
detailed on pages 75 to 78 and each individual 
Principal Risk includes: 

 – examples of risk mitigation (these mitigation 
examples are not exhaustive, opportunities 
have been consolidated within this section); 
 – the risk exposure level movement at year end;
 – a risk update; and
 – key risk indicators are used as a metric for 

measuring the probability of an event and its 
consequences. They reflect the level of risk 
exposure, and the effectiveness of key controls. 

Key risk indicators play an important role in the 
Severn Trent ERM function, providing advance 
notice of potential risks that could harm Severn 
Trent, insight into possible weaknesses in the 
monitoring and control tools, and ongoing risk 
monitoring between the formal risk 
assessments and reporting.

EMERGING RISKS

We define Emerging Risks 
as upcoming events which 
present uncertainty but that 
we currently are unable to 
fully quantify.

Emerging Risk management ensures potential 
risks are identified, with budget plans 
evaluated and stress tested as if they were 
to materialise. Our processes aim to identify 
new and changing risks at an early stage and 
analyse them thoroughly to deduce the 
potential exposure to Severn Trent. 

We closely monitor Emerging Risks that may, 
with time, become either complete ERM risks, 
incorporated into the existing corporate risk 
reporting process, have potential to be 
superseded by new Emerging Risks, or cease 
to be relevant as the internal and external 
environments in which we operate evolve. 

The Directors have carried out a robust 
assessment of the Company’s Emerging Risks 
and consider the following to be risks that have 
the potential to increase in significance and 
affect the performance of the Group.

We continually identify and monitor Emerging 
Risks using our top-down and bottom-up 
processes. Our network of ERM Co-ordinators, 
ERM Champions and risk owners use 
techniques such as cross functional 
workshops and PESTLE (‘Political, Economic, 
Social, Technological, Legal and 
Environmental’) analysis. This culminates in 
an Emerging Risk horizon map reported 
annually to the Audit and Risk Committee 
and Board.

The cyber threat environment has increased globally 
following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 

Dynamic market conditions can cause supply chain 
shortages and resource security pressures, increasing 
commodity prices globally.

We are dependent on our supply chains, including foreign

STRATEGIC REPORTVIABILITY STATEMENT

Assessment of current position 
and long-term prospects
The Directors’ assessment of the Group’s 
financial position at 31 March 2023 is set out in 
the Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 
66 to 72. Important aspects of that assessment 
that are most relevant to the assessment of 
viability are:

 – The Group’s shadow RCV Gearing is 60.0%, 
equal to Ofwat’s assumed gearing of 60% 
for the notional company on which the 
regulatory allowances for this AMP 
are based;

 – The Group has sufficient cash and available 
facilities to fund its financial commitments, 
including returns to debt and equity 
investors, operating and capital expenditure 
until November 2024;

 – The Group’s credit ratings from two agencies 
(S&P and Moody’s) are above the investment 
grade base level and are stable; and

 – The defined benefit pension deficit increased 

to £279 million in the year. The triennial 
valuation as at 31 March 2022 was completed 
during the year and the contributions 
remained unchanged.

Severn Trent Water, the Group’s principal 
subsidiary, is a regulated long-term business 
characterised by multi-year investment 
programmes and relatively stable revenues. 
The water industry in England and Wales is 
currently subject to economic regulation 
rather than market competition and Ofwat, the 
economic regulator, has a statutory obligation 
to secure that water companies can (in 
particular through securing reasonable 
returns on their capital) finance the proper 
carrying out of their statutory functions. Ofwat 
meets this obligation by setting price controls 
for five-year AMPs including mechanisms that 
reduce the risk of variability in revenues from 
the regulated business in the medium term by 
adjusting future revenues to balance over or 
under recovery compared to the original plan.

AMP7 runs to 31 March 2025 and Severn Trent 
Water has developed its plans to deliver the 
operational and financial performance set out 
in Ofwat’s determination. We have based our 
assessment of prospects for the next 
two years on these plans. 

When considering the Group’s prospects 
beyond 2025, it is necessary to make 
assumptions about the price review process 
for the period 2025–2030 (PR24), which will 
take place in 2024. In making this assessment 
we have taken account of:

 – Ofwat’s statutory duty to secure that 

companies can finance the proper carrying 
out of their functions;

 – Severn Trent Water’s financial structure, 

which is close to the Ofwat notional capital 
structure; and

 – Severn Trent Water’s plans for AMP7, the 

successful execution of which would deliver 
benefits to all stakeholders and financial 
incentives that would help to further 
strengthen our financial resilience in the 
period beyond 2025.

We have significant investment programmes, 
largely funded through access to debt 
markets. Our strategic funding objectives 
reflect the long-term nature of the Severn 
Trent Water business and we seek to obtain 
a balance of secure long-term funding at the 
best possible economic cost. Our Treasury 
Policy requires us to maintain sufficient 
liquidity to cover cash flow requirements for 
a rolling period of at least 15 months in order 
to limit the risk of restricted access to capital 
markets. Our Group treasury team actively 
manages our debt maturity profile to spread 
the timing of refinancing requirements and to 
enable such requirements to be met under 
most market conditions. The weighted average 
maturity of debt at the balance sheet date 
was 14 years.

We have an established process to assess the 
Group’s prospects. The Board undertakes a 
detailed assessment of the Group’s strategy 
on an annual basis and the output from this 
assessment sets the framework for our 
medium-term plan, which we update annually. 

Our medium-term plan reflects the Group’s 
prospects and considers the potential impacts 
of the principal risks and uncertainties. We 
perform stress tests to assess the potential 
impact of combinations of those risks and 
uncertainties. The plan also considers 
mitigating actions that we might take to 
reduce the impact of such risks and 
uncertainties, and the likely effectiveness 
of those mitigating actions.

Period of assessment
The Board considered a number of factors 
in determining the period covered by the 
assessment. The long-term nature of our 
principal business, together with relatively 
stable revenues and a model of economic 
regulation that places a duty on the regulator 
to secure that water companies can finance the 
proper carrying out of their functions, support 
a longer period of assessment. 

However, the changing nature of regulation 
of the Water industry and the uncertain 
geopolitical and macroeconomic outlook 
increase the uncertainty inherent in our 
financial projections. We have an established 
planning and forecasting process and the 
Board considers that the assessment of the 
Group’s prospects is more reliable if based on 
an established process. Our latest medium-
term plan extends in detail to the end of the 
AMP7 period in 2025, with less detailed 
projections looking beyond this.

A longer period of assessment introduces 
greater uncertainty because the variability 
of potential outcomes increases as the period 
considered extends.

Bearing in mind the long-term nature of our 
business; the enduring demand for our 
services; our established planning process; 
and the changing nature of the regulation of 
the Water industry in England and Wales, the 
Board has determined that seven years is an 
appropriate period over which to assess the 
Group’s prospects and make its Viability 
Statement this year.

Assessment of Viability
In assessing our future prospects, we have 
considered the potential effects of risks and 
uncertainties that could have a significant 
financial impact under severe but plausible 
scenarios. The risks and uncertainties 
considered were identified in the Group’s 
ERM process, which is described on pages 
73 to 74, and from the key assumptions in 
the financial model. 

While we have estimated the size of each of 
the severe but plausible scenarios described 
below, we have grouped scenarios with similar 
impact types together and performed stress 
testing for the scenario with the greatest 
impact. Where the scenario occurs at a point 
in time, we have assumed that it occurs at the 
point in the plan with the lowest headroom.

We assessed the impacts of the scenarios on our financial metrics, credit metrics and debt covenants. Where the result of the stress test indicated 
more than a limited impact, a risk of a downgrade of credit rating or a breach of a bank covenant, we considered what mitigating actions would be 
available and whether they would be sufficient to mitigate the potential impact of the stress test.

SEVERN TRENT PLC  

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

Mitigating action

Details

Engage with ratings agencies and banks 

While ratings agencies and banks apply formulaic calculations as part of their ratings and 
covenant assessments, judgment is also applied. Where a threshold for a particular rating is 
breached or a covenant ratio not met, a downgrade might not be applied or a temporary 
covenant waiver might be granted if the agency/bank considers the situation to be temporary 
and likely to reverse in the near future.

Manage liquidity by temporarily reducing 
working capital

We would seek to accelerate collection of amounts receivable with particular focus on 
overdue accounts. We would work with our suppliers to negotiate longer credit terms 
where appropriate.

Cost reduction programme

Reprofile capital programme 

We would review discretionary expenditure to identify costs that could be avoided or reduced 
without a detrimental impact to customer service.

By deferring elements of capital expenditure, we could mitigate the impact of significant 
events on our cash flow and smooth the effect on key ratios over a number of years, reducing 
the size of the impact in any one year.

Close out derivative financial instruments in 
asset positions

Derivative financial assets such as swaps can be closed out with the agreement of the 
counterparty, generating cash in the short term.

Consider new sources of funding, including 
hybrid debt

Consider reducing dividend in the year

The Group has access to a wide range of capital markets and maintains a diverse range of 
funding sources. However, there are instruments that we do not currently use that would be 
available when more traditional funding is not. Hybrid debt instruments are a form of debt 
that has some of the characteristics of equity, for example a bond that features an option to 
convert to equity. 

Our dividend policy for AMP7 is to grow the dividend by CPIH each year. If necessary, we 
would consider diverging from this policy to deal with short term pressure on credit metrics 
or ratings.

Consider downgrading the dividend policy

In circumstances where the pressure on metrics, ratings or covenants was sustained, we 
would consider amending our dividend policy for the AMP to relieve the pressure while giving 
investors a basis to set their expectations for returns.

In selecting which mitigating actions to 
apply, we would seek to balance the 
interests of all stakeholders and, in particular, 
would prioritise mitigating actions that would 
not lead to a breach of our commitments 
to customers.

We have significant funding requirements to 
refinance existing debt that falls due for 
repayment during the period under review and 
to fund our capital programme. Under all 
scenarios considered, the Group would remain 
solvent and have access to sufficient funds in 
normal market conditions. Our Treasury Policy 
requires that we retain sufficient liquidity to 
meet our forecast obligations, including debt 
repayments for a rolling 15-month period.

In making its assessment, the Board has made 
the following key assumption:

 – Any period in which the Group is unable to 
access capital markets to raise finance 
during the period under review will be 
shorter than 15 months.

On this basis, the stress tests indicated that 
none of these scenarios, including the 
combined scenario, would result in an impact 
to the Group’s expected liquidity, solvency or 
debt covenants that could not be addressed by 
mitigating actions and are therefore not 
considered threats to the Group’s viability.

Governance and assurance
The Board reviews and approves the medium-
term plan on which this Viability Statement is 
based. The Board also considers the period 
over which it should make its assessment of 
prospects and the Viability Statement. The 
Audit and Risk Committee supports the Board 
in performing this review. Details of the Audit 
and Risk Committee’s activity in relation to the 
Viability Statement are set out in the Audit and 
Risk Committee report in the Severn Trent Plc 
Annual Report. 

This statement is subject to review by Deloitte, 
our External Auditor. Their audit report is set 
out on page 168. 

Assessment of Viability
The Board has assessed the viability of the 
Company over a seven-year period to March 
2030, taking into account the Company’s 
current position and principal risks. 

Based on that assessment, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 
31 March 2030.

Going Concern
In preparing the financial statements the 
Directors considered the Company’s ability 
to meet its debts as they fall due for a 
period of one year from the date of this 
report. This was carried out in conjunction 
with the consideration of the Viability 
Statement above. 

The Directors have reviewed the cash and 
committed facilities available to the Group 
alongside a cash flow forecast extending 
beyond the period considered for this 
Going Concern Statement. The Directors 
have considered the potential impacts, in 
the period of one year from the date of this 
report, resulting from the scenarios 
described in the Viability Statement set 
out above. 

The Directors are satisfied that the Group 
will have sufficient funds to continue to 
meet its liabilities as they fall due for at 
least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements, and 
that the severe but plausible downside 
scenarios considered indicate that the 
Group will be able to operate within the 
amount and terms (including relevant 
covenants) of existing facilities. 

On this basis the Directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.

STRATEGIC REPORTUnderstanding and supporting 
customers’ diverse needs 
We greatly value customer insights and have a 
programme of continuous customer research 
to monitor and understand customer views and 
perceptions. We conduct customer surveys 
and a six-monthly social barometer survey 
exploring customers’ societal concerns and 
their priorities for the future. In addition, we 
use TapChat, an online research panel of 
around 7,000 customers, to undertake regular 
ad hoc surveys, discussions and 
communications tests. As part of our research, 
we also commission ad hoc quantitative and 
qualitative research, including that specifically 
for price reviews. 

Our PR24 research comprises a mix of 
surveys, focus groups, deliberative workshops 
and in-depth interviews. This includes 
research with those in vulnerable 
circumstances and those without internet 
access. This research is focused on answering 
the following questions: 

 – What are our customers’ needs and 

priorities? 

 – How can we ensure that our service is 

affordable and accessible for everyone? 
 – How, where and when should we invest to 

meet customers’ and communities’ 
long-term needs? 

 – What value do customers place on service 

improvements? 

 – Is our plan acceptable and affordable? 

ENGAGEMENT IN ACTION

OUR CUSTOMERS

We have a relentless focus on improving service delivery for 
customers. Our continuous engagement with them ensures 
that we are truly able to understand what matters to them 
and deliver further improvements in service.

Combining insights from our programme of engagement, the below 
section outlines issues of importance to our customers and signposts 
where you can read more about the steps we have taken to address them:

Customer Priorities

Providing clean, safe drinking water and 
an affordable service, alongside supply 
reliability, customer education and 
protecting the environment. 

Environmental concerns: around seven in 
ten customers agree climate change is 
already having an impact and customers 
expect us to have plans in place to meet 
these challenges and prevent disruption 
to their service. Informed customers are 
willing to invest in resilience, climate 
change and protecting and improving the 
environment. However, in a less informed 
setting, customers are increasingly likely to 
prioritise low bills over PR24 
investments.

Read more: page 15.

Read more: from page 39.

The increasing cost of living, with 
financial anxiety evident even amongst 
those who are not financially vulnerable. 
New categories of vulnerable customers 
are emerging, and whilst we are a leader 
in affordability support, we recognise 
there is more to do to increase 
awareness of these schemes and remove 
psychological barriers to seeking 
support.

The majority of customers are satisfied 
with their water company and consider 
that the company has a good reputation. 
Customers want increasing honesty and 
transparency, and reassurance that we 
are focusing on, and investing sufficiently 
in, those areas in which we are performing 
less well. Customers welcome more 
information about how the way we are 
funded, investment and how customers’ 
interests are protected by regulators.

Read more: page 157.

Read more: pages 6 and 7.

Understanding customers’ views 
In April 2023, we hosted our first ‘Your 
water, your say’ session, allowing our 
customers and other stakeholders to pose 
questions about issues that are important to 
them, including priorities for the future, in a 
public environment. 

We were delighted to have over 100 
attendees, including customers, regional 
stakeholders, other water companies, 
Expert Challenge Panel members and our 
regulators, join us virtually for the event. 

You can read more about the outcomes of 
the session on our website.

OUR COLLEAGUES

We are immensely proud of 
our culture; it is something 
we work on every day and is 
demonstrated by every 
colleague across the business. 
We reinforce our culture 
through the initiatives and 
interventions that we put 
in place as a company. 

Employee voice means different 
things to different people and, as 
such, multiple initiatives are needed 
to achieve effective outcomes. 
We have a combination of collective and 
direct employee feedback mechanisms that 
focus on two-way inclusive dialogue across 
the business. 

All of these communication and engagement 
mechanisms are well established, well utilised 
and cover the full breadth of the organisation.

employee feedback mechanisms

Trade Union forums

Engagement with our 
Company Forum 
Providing opportunities for our employees to 
stay connected to the direction of the Company 
and be involved in business decisions is a key 
part of our culture. Our Company Forum 
facilitates this in a structured way. According 
to a recent survey by Tortoise, we are one of 
only 38% of organisations in the FTSE100 who 
have this in place. 

The Company Forum meets four times a year 
and attendees are invited from Trade Unions, 
all leadership levels, the Executive Committee 
and Board. Through this Forum, we engage 
with employees on all ways of working. It is 
jointly chaired by the Director of Customer 
Operations and the Joint Secretaries of our two 
main Trade Unions (Unison and GMB). Board 
Directors are invited to attend and participate 
at meetings and, over the last twelve months, 
Christine Hodgson, Sharmila Nebhrajani, 
Gillian Sheldon and John Coghlan, as well as 
Liv Garfield, have attended meetings, to listen 
to the discussions and to talk about their areas 
of responsibility and interests. 

The agenda is wide-ranging and topics for 
discussion this year have included working 
time and fatigue, an overview of the 
occupational health contract tender and 
ongoing dialogue on company-wide initiatives 
such as our Societal Strategy, diversity and 
inclusion, and new talent. There are also 
regular updates on company performance, 
year end results, and all large change 
programmes. 

The Company Forum consistently feeds back 
on the value it gets from Board member 
attendance and the Trade Union national 
officers highlight how different this is to the 
experience that they have in other 
organisations. 

Engagement with Business 
Forums and Local Forums 
In order to reach all parts of the business and 
tailor conversations relevant to those areas, 
we hold local forums chaired by area business 
leaders to discuss performance, health and 
safety, successes and areas of concern. To act 
as a bridge between the Company Forum and 
Local Forums, there are Operational and 
Customer Business Forums. They meet to 
discuss business updates and to resolve 
matters that cannot be solved at a local level. 

There is also a separate Health and Safety 
Company Forum and Severn Trent Services 
has its own non-unionised employee forum. 

Engagement with all employees 
Creating, developing and growing the right 
communication and engagement channels for 
our employees is kept under continual review. 
Some forms of communication, such as line 
manager relationships, are well established; 
however, we continue to run regular line 
manager training, especially for new 
managers, as we recognise the crucial role 
that manager behaviours, in particular 
visibility and trust, play in encouraging an 
active employee voice. Likewise, the approach 
and format of local team meetings is an 
important factor in creating an open dialogue 
with the team. The monthly Team Talks 
encourage this discussion and provide 
consistency and structure as part of a wider 
team agenda. 

Yammer is well used across the business, 
particularly in operational areas, allowing 
employees to showcase work and start 
discussions on work-related topics. AskLiv 
provides a route for individuals to raise 
questions to the CEO and Senior Management 
Team that colleagues are unable to find an 
answer to elsewhere. The encouragement of 
open dialogue is complemented by top-down 
communications in the form of the OnTap 
intranet news and the Weekly ‘News Splash’ 
magazine-style round-up of key news articles. 

All employee engagement events 
We know that coming together and taking time 
to connect to our Strategy and ambitions is 
important to our colleagues, and drives 
engagement and curiosity amongst our teams. 
We take pride in delivering engaging 
collaborative leadership events year on year, 
bringing our leaders together to build 
networks and make links to our performance 
opportunities. 

In September 2022, we held our leadership 
events at Tittesworth Water, with over 900 
attendees from across the business. Sessions 
focused on PR24, the launch of our Societal 
Strategy and the promotion of our Company 
benefits offering. The event was hugely 
engaging, with over 95% of colleagues saying 
that it was a positive use of their time, and that 
they were confident of being able to 
communicate the messages to their teams. To 
ensure that the messages reached across the 
whole organisation, a cascade ‘Team Talk’ 
pack was provided for managers to use with 
their employees. 

We also hold Long Service Awards and annual 
‘Awesome Awards’ to celebrate individual and 
team achievements.

STRATEGIC REPORTAll employees have access to independent 
psychological support and legal advice through 
our Employee Assistant Programme, and we 
regularly communicate and increase awareness 
of all whistleblowing routes, including our 
confidential Safecall ‘Speak Up’ line.

arrangements on page 139.

Technology could be provided

I would like to see more meeting 
spaces available, outside of

informal discussions.”

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT CONTINUED

Doing the Right Thing (‘DTRT’) and 
our ‘Speak Up’ approach 
It is important that our colleagues have the 
right processes in place to raise concerns 
should they need to. Whistleblowing 
procedures are in place for all Group 
companies to deal with any allegations of 
breaches of DTRT.  

We remain committed to providing an open 
and transparent ‘Speak Up’ environment to 
foster a culture where employees have the 
confidence to speak out about issues that 
concern them. 

QUEST in action –  
collaboration spaces
Collaboration space and environment were 
identified as key topics of focus by our 
employees this year. Following an in-depth 
assessment, we identified that the primary 
feedback was around collaboration space and 
technology. 

With the return to office environments 
following COVID-19, many colleagues told us 
they felt frustrated with the lack of physical 
spaces and technology available for meetings 
and collaboration. And some, colleagues felt 
that improvements could be made to the 
technology available to facilitate continued 
use of online meetings.

Ask HR Roadshows
During the year, our Ask HR Roadshows visited 
and attended multiple sites and team meetings 
to help our colleagues get their questions 
answered in a more convenient way which can 
often help resolve their queries quicker. The 
sessions allow us to listen and give employees 
and teams an opportunity to air any issues or 
concerns they have while building deeper 
relationships across sites.

QUEST engagement survey 
Our annual employee engagement survey, 
QUEST, helps us to understand what is going 
well and where we can improve. QUEST is 
conducted by an independent research 
company to ensure the results are anonymous. 

We were delighted that our employee 
engagement score achieved 8.4 out of 10 this 
year, placing us in the top 5% of utility 
companies globally. As important as the 
range of opportunities provided is how our 
colleagues feel about them. We continue to 
ask colleagues questions relating to their 
feelings about learning, careers and growth 
at Severn Trent. We are really pleased that all 
topics scored above benchmark, recognising 
our delivery and focus in these areas. 

On career paths, employees scored the 
question, ‘I see a path for me to advance my 
career in our organisation’ as 7.8 out of 10, 
1.3 above benchmark. When asked whether 
their job enables colleagues to develop and 
learn new skills, 8.4 agreed. It is truly lovely 
to see how our teams feel supported in their 
development and see pathways to develop 
and progress. 

It is equally important to colleagues that we 
are able to respond to what they tell us. The 
below section offers an example of how we 
responded to feedback during the year. 

How we responded 
Following publication of the QUEST results, 
we immediately constituted a dedicated 
workstream to review our working 
environments on our sites and were able 
to address the issues raised, including: 

 – a communication campaign to all 

colleagues promoting better meeting 
room etiquette;

 – building multiple breakout areas at sites 

with meeting pods;

 – significant investment in meeting room 

technology; and

 – an upgraded meeting room system to 
automatically reject no-shows to give 
back availability of rooms.

Outcomes
We were delighted that our QUEST scores 
this year showed a marked improvement 
we appreciate there is still more to be 
done in this space. We are pleased at the 
feedback we are receiving from 
colleagues:

“ This has improved since introducing two 
additional breakout spaces within the 
office.”

“ Plenty of room, especially since the 
seating areas have been enhanced.”

“ There are always spaces available to 

have conversations or meetings.”

OUR COMMUNITIES

We work hard to make our 
water wonderful and keep our 
millions of customers ‘on tap’ 
every day. But there is more 
to Severn Trent than that. 
We think it is important to 
give back to the communities 
where our customers and 
people live. Not because we 
have to, but because we think 
we should. Whether that 
means caring for the 
environment, supporting the 
next generation, or just making 
our region a better place to 
live, we want to make a positive 
difference in our communities. 

Findings new ways of working and 
working in partnerships 
Our partnerships, such as local authorities, 
regulators, charities, community groups and 
schools, are fundamental to how we are 
increasing our support to our customers. 

We have written to the Chief Executive of every 
local authority in our region to offer help with 
identifying households that might need 
support, building on the work we have been 
doing with several local authorities in our area 
to help them allocate the funding available 
from central Government through the 
Household Support Fund, allocating some to 
ease water bills. Through our work with local 
authorities, we have also secured additional 
grants being paid directly to customers. 

We have been working with Coventry City 
Council and Birmingham City Council to help 
transition households identified as financially 
struggling onto one of our financial support 
schemes. As part of our programme of 
partnership working, in September 2022 we 
partnered with Nottingham City Council to 
bring together advice and support agencies for 
customers including St. Ann’s Advice Centre 
(debt advice), Green Doctor (energy efficiency 
experts) and Nottinghamshire Energy 
Partnership (delivering projects that tackle 
fuel poverty). 

At the same time, we have been working with 
the Department for Work and Pensions to 
proactively identify customers in need and, 
where possible, move customers directly onto 
one of our support schemes.

We regularly visit foodbanks, community 
centres and outreach centres to raise 
awareness of the support we provide and to 
engage with vulnerable customers. We are 
monitoring the ‘Warm Hubs’ initiative as 
another potential venue for engaging with 
customers and those struggling financially. 
This enables us to engage with hard-to-reach 
customers, including family and friends of 
those who most need help. We assist 
customers in the completion of applications for 
our financial support schemes. 

We announced our Societal Strategy in 
November 2022, which is similarly built on 
long-term collaboration with local authorities, 
community groups and schools. In the first 
implementation area of East Birmingham, we 
have aligned our strategy with the local 
authority’s East Birmingham Inclusive Growth 
Strategy. We are already working with 26 
partners, mostly charities and community 
groups, on delivering 10,000 hours of free 
employability training in communities. We are 
also working with schools to provide work 
experience to 300 young people every year, 
rising to 500 by 2032, in social mobility cold 
spots. We will also work with other 
organisations to understand and remove the 
barriers that could prevent children 
undertaking work experience, such as 
affordability and transport.

Uniting to cut carbon by 
1 million tonnes per year
In September 2022, we announced our 
pioneering global partnership with Aarhus Vand 
(Denmark) and Melbourne Water (Australia) to 
work together to reduce our carbon emissions 
by around a million tonnes every year and to 
lead the green transformation of the sector. 

Through this world-leading collaboration, 
we will build upon our collective experience, 
expertise and innovation capabilities on 
key projects such as:

 – transforming our Strongford sewage 
treatment facility into a Net Zero hub 
(read more on page 19);

 – developing new techniques and 

international standards to measure and 
record nitrous oxide and methane 
releases from waste water treatment sites;
 – identifying ways to enhance waste water 
treatment sites with green technology 
while reducing emissions to net zero; and

 – maximising the use of renewable, 

sustainable resources at treatment facilities.

Severn Trent creates 100 
new Water Saving Champions 
In September 2022, we recruited 100 new 
temporary Community Water Saving 
Champions across Leicestershire and 
Derbyshire to help make homes water-
efficient. Our new Champions are all 
making a positive difference in local 
communities at pop-up events and by 
talking to customers in their 
neighbourhoods, helping to advise people 
on how to save money by reducing water 
consumption, which can in turn help 
reduce water and energy bills. 

Our Champions will also provide 
information on our support schemes that 
customers can access if they are 
struggling to pay their bill, as well as free 
products that will help reduce water use. 

Radical innovation requires 
participants with great 
diversity, different expertise, 
curiousity, ambition and trust-
building – precisely the 
characteristics of our partners 
in the UK and Australia.”

Claus Homann – Chief Executive, 
Aarhus Vand

 We are in the decade that matters 
when the actions we take now 
will define our future. We must 
also adapt our operations to 
prepare for a changing climate, 
which is why we are passionate 
about this international alliance 
with Aarhus Vand and 
Severn Trent.”

STRATEGIC REPORTENGAGEMENT IN ACTION CONTINUED

SHAREHOLDERS AND INVESTORS

Our intention is to drive value 
for all of our stakeholders 
through ensuring strong 
service delivery for customers 
and the environment over the 
long term. Engagement with 
our investors is critical to 
our success. 

What our investors and potential 
investors say matters to them 
Investor meetings are primarily attended by 
our CEO, CFO and Head of Investor Relations, 
although other Executive Committee members 
also attend. The Chair and individual Directors 
regularly engage with major shareholders to 
understand their views on governance and 
performance against Strategy.

During the year, we held around 170 investor 
meetings and met with nearly 140 existing and 
potential investors. These meetings were 
attended by 53 shareholders, representing 
65% of our share register. Over 70% of the 
meetings were held in person compared with 
only 53% in the previous year. However virtual 
meetings enable us to cover large 
geographical areas. 

The meetings focused on the Group’s financial 
performance, our commitment to the 
environment, our outlook on AMP8 and our 
approach to helping customers in the current 
climate.  

Annual Report 
Our Annual Report is available to all 
shareholders, and we aim to make it as 
accessible as possible. Shareholders can opt 
to receive a hard copy in the post, a PDF copy 
via email or download a copy from our website. 
Please contact the Group Company Secretary 
to request a copy.

Annual General Meeting 
Our 2022 AGM was held on 7 July 2022, at 
which 78.05% of our shareholders voted. We 
were delighted to receive in excess of 95% 
votes in favour for all of our resolutions. The 
AGM was held as a hybrid meeting, meaning 
that shareholders were able to follow the 
business of the meeting by virtual as well as in 
person. Shareholders were invited to submit 
questions to a dedicated AGM mailbox and a 
process was put in place for the Board to 
respond to any questions directly and publish 
responses on the Company’s website. 

This year’s AGM is to be held on Thursday, 
6 July 2023 at 10.00am. Following its success 
in 2022, the Board agreed that the AGM would 
be conducted as a hybrid meeting, allowing 
those who join virtually to log into a live 
webcast and pose questions to the Board in 
real time. Shareholders are also able to submit 
questions in writing through our website in 
advance of the AGM. The physical location of 
the AGM will be the Severn Trent Academy, 
Hawksley Park, St. Martins Road, Finham, 
Coventry, CV3 6PR. 

In addition to the AGM, the Group Company 
Secretary communicates with individual 
investors, making sure we respond properly to 
questions in relation to their shareholding. Our 
share registrar Equiniti also has a team to take 
care of shareholders’ needs.

Corporate website 
We continually monitor our website, 
severntrent.com, to ensure it is user-friendly 
for our stakeholders. The website has a 
dedicated investor section which includes an 
overview of Severn Trent Plc and our history, 
our Company information and results, our 
annual reports, results presentations 
(including webcasts) and an investor news 
section containing information which may 
be of interest to our shareholders.

SUPPLIERS AND CONTRACTORS

Our investment plans for AMP7 
and AMP8 will require a 
resilient and highly engaged 
supply chain. Supplier 
engagement is essential to our 
plans and promotes a shared 
culture of trust to share 
knowledge and expertise to 
find the right solutions for our 
customers, ensure continuous 
sustainable development and 
develop responsible business 
strategies. Our enduring 
relationships with our 
suppliers help us to reduce the 
risks we face as a business, for 
the benefit of our wider 
stakeholders, particularly our 
customers and communities.

Supplier engagement is integral 
to our success
We deliver this through our partnership with 
the Supply Chain School, in-person Supplier 
Summits, supplier onboarding events, 
one-to-one engagement, training events and 
dedicated supplier communications. Through 
these channels, we make sure that what we, 
and our customers, expect is relevant and 
appropriate to the suppliers’ activities and 
their environmental and social impact.

AMP8 Supply Chain Engagement Day
We have an array of hugely exciting projects 
and AMP8 schemes aimed at improving our 
network and service and, more importantly 
build resilience to protect and enhance the 
water supply for our region, both now and in 
the future. A key factor of success is working 
collaboratively and creatively with our supply 
chain to deliver new solutions to overcome the 
challenges. So we have been engaging with our 
capital supply chain early. 

On 10 March 2023, we brought together over 
80 of our suppliers, sharing with them our 
ambitions and priorities for AMP8 and 
where they can play a part in delivering 
our shared successes.

The agenda for the day included future 
challenges and innovation (including energy 
prices, climate change and affordability), early 
visibility of our AMP8 investment programme 
and how early engagement can help us identify 
new ways of working and create a strong 
foundation upon which new opportunities and 
collective success can be realised. 

The event was a brilliant success and received 
overwhelmingly positive feedback from 
suppliers. 

Engaging on modern slavery 
Collaboration is key to identifying and 
addressing modern slavery, so we actively 
engage with other organisations to gain insight 
and maintain best practice. We entered our 
second three-year partnership with Slave-
Free Alliance in 2021, which has been 
instrumental in our approach and in the 
progress we have made in identifying and 
mitigating modern slavery risk. We continue to 
sit on the Steering Group of Utilities Against 
Slavery, formerly known as the Utilities 
Modern Slavery Working Group. The working 
group continues to grow, with over 24 utilities 
organisations actively participating. In 2021, 
we also partnered with the Supply Chain 
Sustainability School, which provides access to 
a wide range of learning resources, including 
dedicated modern slavery awareness training 
for all organisations within the Group’s supply 
chain.

Having outperformed our ambition to ensure 
60% of our high-impact suppliers were risk 
assessed for modern slavery, we decided to 
evolve our approach in view of the Ukraine 
conflict, cost of living crisis and labour 
shortages being observed within the 
construction sector, issues that directly 
increase the risk of modern slavery 
occurrence in our supply chain. In 
collaboration with our strategic partner, the 
Slave-Free Alliance, we enhanced our supplier 
selection questions in line with the utilities 
sector, conducted a heat mapping exercise to 
confirm our greatest areas of risk and engaged 
with contract owners to develop bespoke 
assessments where required.

Engaging with suppliers to take 
positive action
Working closely with our supply chain partners 
is critical to the delivery of our sustainability 
ambitions, and we are committed to building 
supplier capability through engagement, 
training and our partnership with the Supply 
Chain Sustainability School to support them. 
Our 2022/23 highlights include:

 – 100% of contracted suppliers signing up to 

our Sustainable Supply Chain Charter;

 – 89 suppliers having been assessed through 
EcoVadis, an independent rating platform 
which assesses suppliers based on their 
environmental and social impact 
performance;

 – being awarded CDP Supplier Engagement 

Leader for the second year running;

 – 44% of suppliers, by emissions, having set a 

Science-Based Target for 2022/23; and

 – all applicable suppliers and their 

subcontractors to pay the real Living Wage 
as a minimum.

SECTION 172 STATEMENT

Stakeholder engagement is 
central to the formulation and 
execution of our Strategy and 
is critical in achieving long-
term sustainable success. The 
needs of our different 
stakeholders, as well as the 
consequences of any decision 
in the long term, are well 
considered by the Board.

It is not always possible to provide positive 
outcomes for all stakeholders and the Board 
sometimes has to make decisions based on 
balancing the competing priorities of 
stakeholders. Our stakeholder engagement 
processes enable our Board to understand 
what matters to stakeholders and consider 
carefully all the relevant factors to select the 
course of action that best leads to high 
standards of business conduct and success of 
Severn Trent in the long term. The principles 
underpinning s.172 are not only considered at 
Board level, they are part of our culture. They 
are embedded in all that we do as a company. 

The differing interests of stakeholders are 
considered in the business decisions we make 
across the Company, at all levels, and are 
reinforced by our Board setting the right tone 
from the top. All of the Board’s significant 
decisions are subject to a s.172 evaluation to 
identify the likely consequences of any decision 
in the long term and the impact of the decision 
on our stakeholders. 

In performing their duties during 2022/23, the 
Directors have had regard to the matters set 
out in s.172 of the Companies Act 2006. You can 
read more on how the Board had regard to 
each matter, during the year, as follows:

consequences of  
any decision in the

Engagement with stakeholders
The Board recognises that stakeholder 
engagement is essential to understand what 
matters most to our stakeholders and the 
likely impact of any key decisions. We have a 
long history of engaging with all of our 

stakeholders and the Board values the insight 
that this engagement provides. Details of how 
we engaged with our stakeholders during the 
year can be found within our Stakeholder 
Engagement section on pages 84 to 94. 

Examples of decisions taken by the Board  
and how stakeholder views and inputs,  
as well as other s.172 considerations,  
have been taken into account in its decision  
making are set out below.

SOCIETAL STRATEGY

Context 
We have a range of measures in place to help 
support customers who are experiencing 
affordability pressures. The pandemic and 
recent geopolitical events in Ukraine have 
exacerbated affordability and cost of living 
pressures. Inflation is now the highest it has 
been since 1992 and households are seeing 
significant price rises, notably for electricity, 
gas, food and petrol. As a result, many more 
households now find themselves in water 
poverty. 

As a socially responsible company that 
genuinely cares about its customers and the 
communities it serves, the Company 
launched its Societal Strategy in November 
2022, which focuses on the underlying 
causes of water poverty to address the 
drivers of long-term affordability issues and 
contribute to the wider levelling-up agenda 
given the overlap between water poverty and 
income poverty. The Board developed the 
Societal Strategy with the objective of 
addressing affordability in the immediate 
term and proposing a multi-AMP strategy to 
eradicate water poverty in our region by 
improving the life chances of people in our 
communities.

Strategy on page 32 and at stwater.co.uk.

Consideration of s.172 impacts by the Board in its decision making

 Customers:

 Suppliers and Contractors: 

The Board considered the Company’s Societal 
Strategy in view of its existing commitment to keep 
absolute bills as low as possible for all customers 
whilst also delivering improved resilience, 
sustainability and strong service delivery, by ensuring 
that every pound is spent wisely and efficiently. 
Potential impacts to customer bills were central to 
Board discussions and, as such, the Societal Strategy 
was structured so as not to increase costs to any 
non-water-poor customers above the level assumed 
in the Company’s Final Determination.

The Board recognised that the Company could have a 
greater and faster impact by engaging with the supply 
chain, building relationships with partners across a 
multitude of sectors, and utilising our influence to 
encourage and lobby for regional and national change. 
As part of this approach, the Company engaged its 
Supply Chain and Procurement Teams to encourage 
and challenge our largest suppliers to join us on this 
journey, asking them to match our ambitions on 
apprenticeships, recruitment, and work experience, 
as well as on real Living Wage, fairness and inclusion. 

 Regulators and Government:
The Board has a strong track record of engaging 
with its regulators. Alongside our extensive support 
for our customers and communities, the Board 
engaged with CCW and Ofwat’s initiatives on 
affordability, including the recommendations of 
CCW’s Independent Water Affordability Review. 
These stakeholders have indicated their support of 
the Societal Strategy, as have local Government and 
MPs. 

 Employees: 

Our annual engagement survey, QUEST, tells us 
that our colleagues are the most engaged they have 
ever been. They are motivated by this programme of 
work, which will make a positive impact in the 
communities that they serve and live and work in. 
Our people will also have the opportunity to 
volunteer as mentors to support the delivery of our 
Societal Strategy.

Outcomes and impact on the  
long-term sustainable success  
of the Company 
Our Societal Strategy will provide support for the 
most financially vulnerable customers in our 
region, through supporting an additional 100,000 of 
our customers and equip them with the skills and 
experiences to help lift them out of water poverty, at 
no increase in costs above those assumed in our 
Final Determination to our non-water-poor 
customers.

Following careful analysis, the Board determined that 
the Societal Strategy would provide both immediate 
support to customers experiencing affordability 
pressures and help address the underlying causes of 
poverty for the long term. 

To inform its approach, the Board engaged a 
research agency to carry out the Company’s 
largest-ever, in-depth survey of stakeholder and 
customer views on affordability. The research was 
designed to include in-depth interviews, surveys, 
focus groups, follow-up interviews and deliberative 
workshops to make sure the Company, and the 
Board, thoroughly understood the needs of its 
customers prior to finalising its plans. 

 Communities: 

Notwithstanding the Company’s Affordability 
Strategy announced in May 2022, the Board 
acknowledged that more needed to be done to 
address the long-term drivers that perpetuate 
poverty in our society. Therefore, the Board 
determined that the Societal Strategy should be 
developed to complement the Company’s extensive 
work on affordability with an equally ambitious 
approach to water poverty. By pulling together the 
Company’s socially directed programmes into a 
clearer framework, the Board recognised that it 
would make it easier for communities to access the 
support they need. 

As part of this, the Board agreed to increase the 
proportion of Community Fund grants going into 
training and skills outreach, targeting a combined 
allocation of £1 million by 2030 with the ambition of 
helping 100,000 people, in or at risk of water 
poverty, through access to high-quality careers and 
employment-related training. Careers and 
employability skills were determined to be the most 
appropriate route as they impact three of the main 
drivers of poverty: unemployment, low pay, and 
insufficient working hours.

The Company engaged with key stakeholders, 
including Ofwat, CCW, shareholders, local 
communities, Business In The Community, 
Birmingham City Council and Solihull Council, MPs, 
and schools, to listen to and understand their views 
and the challenges they face.

CORPORATE STRATEGY – PERFORMANCE DRIVEN, SUSTAINABILITY LED

Consideration of s.172 impacts by the Board in its decision making

 Customers:

The Board determined that the Group’s Corporate 
Strategy should focus on service delivery for 
customers, including providing safe and consistently 
high-quality drinking water to customers, ensuring 
that supply interruption and low-pressure events 
are well managed and ensuring that bills remain 
affordable and represent good value for customers. 
The Board also considered that the Corporate 
Strategy should facilitate a continued high-quality 
customer experience both now and over time, in 
consideration of long-term water scarcity and 
climate change, and future customer demand.

 Employees:

The Board considered that the Corporate Strategy 
would also provide clarity to employees on its 
strategic priorities, which would inspire their 
contribution to the Company’s future success and 
drive transformational change programmes to 
support improved service delivery for customers 
and the environment. 

The Corporate Strategy also provided clarity on the 
skills and capabilities required to deliver the 
Group’s priorities and increased employee 
engagement at all levels of the organisation, 
through demonstrating opportunities to give back to 
the communities in which we serve and reinforce 
the Group’s socially purposeful culture.

 Environment and our 

Communities:
The Board considered the vital role of nature and the 
natural environment for the Group, including its 
ability to supply and treat water in a way that is 
sustainable for the long term. 

The Board reviewed the appropriateness of the 
Corporate Strategy in supporting the continued 
protection and improvement of our region’s natural 
environment, and the creation of new community 
resources – through supporting local community 
projects, giving support to vulnerable and 
disadvantaged members of society and, crucially, 
increasing the availability of jobs and training 
opportunities.

Outcomes and impact on the 
long-term sustainable success  
of the Company 
Successful execution of the Group’s Corporate 
Strategy will deliver long-term sustainable success 
through delivering the Group’s sustainability aims, 
increasing profitability, value growth and enhanced 
reputation. In setting the Group’s Corporate Strategy, 
the Board critically assessed business performance 
and the future direction of the Company, and 
identified areas where additional value could be 
generated for its stakeholders. 

Context 
During the year, the Board considered its 
Corporate Strategy, with the objective of 
ensuring that it reflected the business that 
we are today, while clearly outlining the 
ambitions we have for the future. The Board 
discussed the global context the business 
operates within, and the challenges faced to 
maintain its success as a sector-leading 
Company. 

The Board discussed the need to be a 
performance driven, sustainability led 
organisation and the desire to deliver 
financial and operational outperformance in 
balance with the long-term needs of the 
environment and the customers and

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SUCCESSION

Context 
A key focus of the Board and Nominations 
Committee is Board succession and 
composition, to ensure the appropriate 
balance of skills, independence, experience 
and diversity on the Board and Executive 
Committee. Succession planning allows the 
Board to undertake the necessary 
preparations to manage changes without 
disruption to the business and ensure 
continuity through effective handover 
processes. 

In February 2023, the Board announced the 
retirement of James Bowling as Executive 
Director and CFO at the Annual General 
Meeting in July 2023. 

The Chair and CEO led the process to 
identify suitable candidates for the role and 
an executive search firm was engaged as 
part of the recruitment process. It was 
announced that Helen Miles, Capital and 
Commercial Services Director, would be 
appointed as an Executive Director and CFO 
Designate with effect from 1 April 2023.

Consideration of s.172 impacts by the Board in its decision making

 Communities:

 Employees:

The Board recognised the importance of 
considering the Board Diversity Policy whilst 
considering candidates for appointment and 
aligning with the diversity of our region, 
specifically in respect of gender, social and 
ethnic backgrounds, skills and experience. 

The Board recognised that the appointment of 
an internal candidate would demonstrate the 
Group’s commitment to the development, 
upskilling and reskilling of its employees, and 
the priority it places on its internal succession 
pipeline. 

 Shareholders and Investors:
A key success of the Group has been its 
delivery of an effective financing strategy to 
position Severn Trent as a leader on financing 
performance.

The CFO successor would need to 
demonstrate the same commitment and 
acumen to ensure continued high 
performance and return for shareholders and 
investors. As a highly experienced and 
commercial CFO, possessing strong finance 
and regulatory accounting experience, the 
Board determined that Helen was the best 
candidate for the role. 

Outcomes and impact on the 
long-term sustainable success  
of the Company 
The Board approved Helen’s appointment, 
given her highly experienced and commercial 
background and detailed understanding of the 
water sector, with a proven track record of 
exceptional delivery. Helen also has an 
extensive knowledge of the Group and its 
culture, and an in-depth understanding of the 
regulated sector in which the Group operates.

STRATEGIC REPORTCHAIR’S INTRODUCTION 
TO GOVERNANCE

Christine Hodgson
Chair

The strong leadership and 
breadth of experience we 
have on the Board enables 
us to make sound and 
balanced decisions for 
the long-term benefit of 
our customers and wider 
stakeholders, both now and 
in the future.

The last year has seen an increasing number of challenges impacting 
our sector, our business and our customers. The consequences of 
ongoing geopolitical events, significant increases in energy costs and 
rising inflation and interest rates are set to continue to impact 
companies and communities for some time. 

We are positioned well to manage these impacts, and the Board and 
Executive Committee are confident that the Company’s adaptability 
and agility will ensure we can respond to circumstances as they arise, 
and continue to deliver for our customers and communities at a time 
when they need us most.

As outlined in my Chair’s Statement, the last 
18 months have been some of the most 
challenging in our history and many of those 
challenges continue – with high inflation driving 
increases in energy costs for customers and 
companies alike, and the continued impact of 
geopolitical events. Despite these challenges, we 
have delivered robust operational and resilient 
financial performance for our customers and 
wider stakeholders. This success depends on our 
commitment to exceptional corporate governance 
standards, which underpin the confident delivery 
of everything we do. It drives ethical behaviours, 
informs sound decision making, enables the 
effective running of our business and, ultimately, 
builds trust. The Board is fully committed to open 
and transparent reporting, and I hope that this is 
evident in our Annual Report this year. 

I referred to the Board’s review of our Corporate 
Strategy in my Chair’s Statement, to reflect 
where the business is today and outline the 
ambitions we have for tomorrow. In line with our 
robust governance framework, the Board will 
oversee the delivery of this Strategy and hold 
management to account, in order to maintain the 
Group’s success in the period ahead. You can 
read more about our Corporate Strategy in my 
Chair’s Statement from page 8.

Evolution of the Board and 
Executive Team
Succession planning is a key area of focus for 
the Board and, during the year, we announced a 
number of significant changes to the composition 
of our Board, following the retirement of Philip 
Remnant, former Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, in November. I would like to thank 
Philip for his dedication and significant and 
impactful contributions to the Board and 
Committee discussions. Sharmila Nebhrajani 
has taken on the role of Remuneration 
Committee Chair and, as such, will introduce 
her first Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
shareholders this year. I am delighted that Sarah 
Legg joined the Board as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director during the year. Sarah 
brings significant financial and sustainability 
experience to the Board and I look forward to 
working with her over the coming years.

During the year, the Company also announced 
the planned retirement of James Bowling, 
our Chief Financial Officer of eight years, and 
Bronagh Kennedy, our Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary of nearly twelve years. 
The Board was delighted that, following rigorous 
internal and external search and selection 
processes, the appointments in relation to both 
these roles, and the subsequent opportunities 
created on the Executive Committee, were 
largely made from talent within our business. 
This helps us promote the incredible knowledge 
and experience that has been developed. We are 
confident that this will contribute to the Group’s 
continued success over the coming years. It also 
provided the opportunity to recruit an excellent 
Partner from Pinsent Masons, Didar Dhillon, 
bringing broad experience and a fresh 
perspective to the Executive Committee. Further 
detail regarding the changes made to our Board 
and Executive Committee can be found in the 
Nominations Committee Report from page 121.

Listening and responding to our 
stakeholders
The Board values feedback from our stakeholders 
and places significant importance on maintaining 
close relationships with them and responding to 
their views. We pride ourselves on listening and 
reflecting, before then taking action. Decisions are 
never taken in isolation; rather they are fully 
discussed and therefore the Board welcomes 
input from all who can add value to those 
conversations. Further details of how the Board 
has considered the views and balanced the 
interests of stakeholders is set out in our Section 
172 Statement on pages 96 to 97.

As a Board, we want our stakeholders to hold us to 
account and therefore need to ensure that they 
have appropriate access to the facts on a range of 
topics so they can form a balanced opinion. A good 
example of this is our river pledges, which were 
developed through listening to our customers, 
local communities and campaign groups – who 
told us how important river quality is to them. The 
Board shares their passion that our region’s rivers 
should be the healthiest they can be, and we 
therefore developed our river pledges aimed at 
protecting and revitalising rivers in our region.

SEVERN TRENT PLC  

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

I am pleased that our commitment to ‘Get River 
Positive’ has now been embraced by others, 
driving improvements across the sector. You can 
read about our progress against each of the five 
river pledges on pages 20 to 21 and in our 
dedicated Get River Positive Annual Report, which 
is published on our website.

We have also responded to stakeholder feedback in 
respect of remuneration, and the way in which it is 
linked to performance and particularly in areas that 
are most important to customers, such as the 
environment. In response to this, in 2022 we linked 
the river pledges to our remuneration structures, 
through introducing some of the measures into our 
Annual Bonus Scheme – with 8% of every 
employee’s bonus aligned to their achievement in 
2022/23. Whilst we have consistently focused on 
connecting remuneration to environmental 
outcomes, we recognise the strength of external 
opinion on the performance of the sector and made 
further changes to our Annual Bonus Scheme 
during the year to strengthen the focus on 
environmental performance – increasing the 
weighting within our 2023/24 Annual Bonus 
Scheme of river pledges to 12%, and overall 
environmental measures to 30%. Our 
Remuneration Policy is designed to incentivise 
exceptional, sector-leading performance for the 
benefit of customers, communities and the 
environment, and to attract, retain and motivate 
our Executive Directors. Three-quarters of our 
potential Executive pay is variable in nature, based 
on stretching targets that are reviewed annually by 
the Remuneration Committee. In this way, we 
ensure that our Executives are rewarded 
commensurate with their performance, which we 
believe is more beneficial to all stakeholders than 
removing variable pay opportunity and driving up 
base pay costs. Further detail can be found within 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 157.

Diversity and inclusion
The Board recognises the importance of diversity 
– on the Board itself, throughout the 
organisation, and more widely – and the need to 
foster an inclusive culture which encourages all 
colleagues to bring their whole selves to work, 
fulfil their potential and perform at their best. 

We are encouraged by our gender and ethnic 
diversity representation on the Board – 56% 
female and 22% minority ethnic representation 
as at 31 March 2023 – but we are not complacent 
and know this needs to be maintained going 
forwards. We support the targets introduced by 
the Financial Conduct Authority and the 
transparency of the reporting framework that 
has been developed in this regard, to allow 
investors and other stakeholders to compare the 
progress being made across the FTSE and drive 
progress in this important area. We conducted a 
review of our Board Diversity Policy during the 
year, following which the Policy was amended to 
cover a broader range of diversity characteristics 
and facilitate open and transparent reporting. 
We have developed a refreshed diversity 
disclosure this year, which can be found within 
the Nominations Committee Report on pages 125 
and 126, and we welcome feedback on this.

I was also personally delighted that Severn 
Trent was acknowledged as the first FTSE100 
company to appoint women to the positions of 
Chair, Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer following the announcement of Helen 
Miles’ appointment as Chief Financial Officer 
Designate. Whilst appointments will only ever 
be made on merit, we continue to support the 
increase in female appointments to leadership 
roles across the FTSE and hope that our actions 
inspire the next generation of company leaders.

Board and Committee effectiveness
We spent time assessing and considering the 
effectiveness of the Board and its Committees 
earlier this year through an internally-facilitated 
Board effectiveness evaluation. The Board was 
pleased by the results of the review, which 
concluded that the Board, its Committees and 
individual Directors continue to operate 
effectively. A small number of improvements 
were identified, which will be implemented 
promptly. You can read more about the 
evaluation process and the outcomes of this 
year’s review on pages 118 to 119.

Corporate governance reforms
The Board remains fully committed to open and 
transparent reporting, and we welcome the 
outcomes from the Department for Business, 
Energy and Industrial Strategy (‘BEIS’, now the 
Department for Business and Trade) consultation 
on ‘Restoring trust in audit and corporate 
governance’. The Board embraces emerging 
corporate governance and regulatory 
developments – often adopting new 
requirements earlier than required where it is 
practicable to do so. As such, the Board 
requested that the Audit and Risk Committee 
review the Group’s preparations for future 
corporate reform during the year, which 
concluded that we are well positioned for the 
proposed changes. Read more in the Audit and 
Risk Committee Report on pages 127 to 134. 

Looking ahead to AMP8
With three years of AMP7 now behind us, 
the Board is spending a great deal of time 
formulating our business plan for AMP8. PR24 
will be my first price review process at Severn 
Trent and I, along with my fellow Directors, have 
invested a significant amount of time preparing 
for PR24, including understanding the way in 
which the Company can deliver positive 
customer outcomes, greater environmental and 
social value, drive improvements through 
efficiency and innovation, and increase our 
focus on the long term. This activity is being 
informed through deepening our understanding 
of our customers and communities. Individual 
Directors, and the Board as a whole, have spent 
time engaging with our customers, attending 
community events and having discussions with 
Severn Trent’s Expert Challenge Panel, ably 
chaired by Bernard Crump, all to ensure that 
our future plans continue to fulfil our Purpose 
of ‘taking care of one of life’s essentials’. 

Our draft business plan is well advanced and will 
be submitted to Ofwat in October 2023.

Alongside our PR24 submission, the Board also 
spent a significant amount of time considering 
key long-term programmes that are inextricably 
linked to our environment and PR24, such as our 
Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan, 
Water Resources Management Plan and the 
Water Industry National Environment 
Programme, to ensure that we have long-term 
plans in place that consider the impacts of 
population growth, drought, our environmental 
obligations and climate change uncertainty, so 
we can continue to deliver our essential services 
for customers now and in the long term whilst 
also transitioning to a net zero world.

As we look ahead to the next regulatory cycle, 
I want to thank everyone involved – our 
customers, communities, investors, regulators 
and suppliers. But above all, thank you to our 
colleagues, for their unfaltering commitment to 
deliver our Strategy and fulfil our Purpose and 
Values each and every day, and their contribution 
to the communities they work and live in.

I look forward to the year ahead with confidence, 
knowing that our focus on improving services for 
our customers will be delivered through the 
talent of our people, the financial resilience of 
our business, and our commitment to serving 
our stakeholders will ensure that we continue 
to be a socially responsible business providing 
a high quality, essential public service.

GOVERNANCE REPORTCULTURE

Christine on a water bar shop at the Commonwealth Games

The Board places great importance on 
ensuring that the Group’s culture and Values 
are established throughout the organisation, 
aligned across directorates and demonstrated 
consistently by everyone who works with us. 
As such, the Board spends a significant 
amount of time, both inside and outside of 
Board meetings, engaging with our people 
through a variety of mechanisms. The Board’s 
participation in the Company Forum (our 
workforce engagement mechanism), review 
of QUEST engagement results, attendance 
at our engaging ‘Ask Our Board’ session, 
complemented by a range of site visits 
throughout the year, are all crucial to 
informing the Board’s understanding of our 
culture. In addition, the Board recognises the 
need to foster an inclusive culture where all 
colleagues are able to bring their whole selves 
to work, fulfil their potential and perform at 
their best. 

Our people are fundamental to our success 
and form a critical part of us being a trusted 
company. Our people tell us that they work 
best together, in an environment of 
collaboration and innovation. Our culture of 
empowerment and accountability, with a focus 
on skills, talent and career development, not 
only ensures we continue to deliver great 
performance but also that we continue to make 
Severn Trent a wonderful place to work. This is 
borne out by our excellent QUEST employee 
engagement score of 8.4 out of 10, putting us in 
the top 5% of utility companies globally.

Our Values of Having Courage, Embracing 
Curiosity, Taking Pride and Showing Care are 
brought to life in our culture and are integral to 
the way we behave and the way we do business. 
Our Values are demonstrated by our people 
every day as they work tirelessly to deliver our 
essential service. Their commitment is evident 
in the dedication they show in delivering for our 
customers and communities – 24 hours a day, 
365 days a year. Our people are also supported 
by the systems and processes we have in place 
that enable us to deliver consistent operational 
performance. This consistency has created 
capacity for our talented people to do even 
more to make a positive difference for all 
of our stakeholders.

How the Board monitors and 
assesses culture
The Board understands the importance of 
setting the right tone from the top, with each 
Director leading by example to promote a 
culture of inclusivity. Great emphasis is placed 
by the Board on ensuring that the Group’s 
culture is aligned to our Strategy, Purpose and 
Values. As such, one of the Board’s key focus 
areas is to monitor and assess the culture 
across the Group.

The Board recognises the importance 
of ensuring that the Severn Trent culture 
celebrates diversity and inclusion in all 
its forms, and embraces individuals’ 
contributions, no matter what their age, 
gender, race, ethnicity, disability, sexual 
orientation, social background, religion or 
belief. The Board was pleased that Severn 
Trent was recognised as a Top 3 FTSE100 
company for representation of women on the 
Board in the FTSE Women Leaders Review 
2023, in addition to being named a Top 25 
employer by Stonewall.

The Board monitors and assesses the culture 
of the Group by regularly meeting with the 
Executive Committee and management, 
reviewing the outcomes of employee surveys, 
engaging directly with individual employees 
throughout the Group, and listening to 
feedback from our stakeholders. We believe 
that our culture is a unique strength and we 
see the benefits of this flow through into 
employee engagement, retention and 
productivity. The Board places great 
importance on employee engagement and 
regularly reviews its approach, taking into 
account the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018. All of these 
touchpoints with colleagues and other 
stakeholders provide cultural insight that the 
Board can act upon and factor into its decision 
making. The table on the next page provides 
further detail on the activity undertaken during 
the year to assess the Group’s culture.

OUTCOME/ACTIONS

Review results of the annual QUEST survey, 
particularly around employee engagement levels 
benchmarked against peers, and how Severn Trent’s 
Values link to its Purpose and behaviour.

Understanding strengths and opportunities as 
identified by employees, and that our Purpose 
and Values reflect the Company’s culture 
and behaviours.

The Company Forum provides an opportunity for 
employee and Trade Union employee representatives 
to meet with Board members on a regular basis. 
Members of the Board and Executive Committee 
attend the Severn Trent Company Forum on a 
rotational basis, so each Director receives 
the opportunity to listen directly to what employees 
have to say and for our employees to hear about 
matters that the Board is reviewing and considering. 

The ‘Ask Our Board’ event ensures a direct dialogue 
with the workforce across the Group. The most 
recent event in May 2023 saw 110 colleagues join, and 
feedback from the Board and employees was very 
positive.

A better understanding of day-to-day 
operations, the practical execution of 
strategy and the cultural context in which 
employees work. 

Provides the Board with insight into colleague 
sentiment and topics of importance to 
colleagues, including diversity and inclusion 
and our societal contribution.

Actions taken to address the insights gained 
from the QUEST survey are continuously 
monitored by the Board through regular 
agenda topics structured around our people. 
The Board also received assurance that our 
culture is aligned to our Purpose and Values.

It ensures that views from a diverse cross 
section of the workforce – in terms of 
seniority, gender, ethnicity, tenure of 
employment and job types – are considered 
in Board discussions and decision making, 
and each meeting generates wide-ranging 
exchanges of opinion and insights. 

Outputs from employee engagement 
sessions are used to shape future Board 
agenda topics and employee updates. 
Questions at the event in May 2023 included 
performance highlights over the year, the 
Group’s Societal Strategy, River Quality and 
affordability initiatives.

Board members attend meetings of the four active 
employee advisory groups – LQBTQ+, Ethnicity, 
Disability and Women in STEM and Ops.

Ability to hear directly about the progress made 
against the diversity and inclusion action plans 
across the business.

Outputs from employee engagement 
sessions are used to shape future Board 
agenda topics and employee updates.

Annual review and monitoring by the Audit and Risk 
Committee of the effectiveness of the Group Speak 
Up Policy, processes and framework. Speak Up 
reports are considered at every Audit and Risk 
Committee meeting, with onward reporting to 
the Board.

Review by the Remuneration Committee of the wider 
workforce policies and practices, including gender 
and ethnicity pay gaps, CEO pay ratios and alignment 
of Directors’ pension contributions to the workforce. 
Integration of sustainability measures into short- and 
long-term incentive targets. Remuneration is an 
annual agenda item at the Company Forum and 
outputs are reported to the Board.

Regular reviews by the Nominations Committee of 
senior management talent and succession planning.

A perspective on the nature of colleague 
concerns and trends in the behaviours of 
colleagues generally. Insight into how concerns 
are escalated and resolved by Severn Trent.

The Audit and Risk Committee will continue 
to monitor the effectiveness of the Speak Up 
Policy, and report to the Board the extent to

of Internal Audit reports, compliance reports, risk 
deep dives, incident reports and policies and training.

behaviours, and how these align with the 
Purpose, Values and Strategy of the Group, 
including an understanding of the Group’s

culture of the Group.

colleagues by all Board members on the Group’s

The Board and its Committees provide 
appropriate scrutiny and challenge of 
management, and receive assurance over 
the Company’s approach to managing risk 
and business integrity matters.

undertake training on an annual basis, to 
ensure their knowledge and understanding 
is up to date.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 2018

The Group’s long-term success depends on 
our commitment to exceptional corporate 
governance standards and the Board continues 
to be guided in its approach through the 
application of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2018 (the ‘2018 Code’).

We believe good corporate governance is about 
how we provide confidence in the delivery of 
our performance to our stakeholders and is 
essential for the long-term sustainable 
success of our business.

With this in mind, we welcome the proposed 
enhancements to the future corporate 
governance regime, including the 
recommendations from BEIS (now the 
Department for Business and Trade).

During the year ended 31 March 2023, we have 
fully applied the principles of good governance 
and have been compliant with the provisions 
contained in the 2018 Code.

The Board remains dedicated to open and 
transparent reporting, and the table below 
shows where shareholders can evaluate how 
the Company has applied the principles of the 
2018 Code and where key content can be found 
in this report.

The full wording of the 2018 Code is available 
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website.

DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES

As at the date of this report, our Board 
comprised the Chair, six Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and three Executive 
Directors. There are clear divisions between 
Executive and Non-Executive responsibilities, 
which ensure accountability and oversight. The 
roles of Chair and Chief Executive are 
separately held and their responsibilities are 
well defined, set out in writing in the Charter of 

Expectations, and regularly reviewed by the 
Board. The Chair and the other Non-Executive 
Directors meet routinely without the Executive 
Directors, and individual Directors meet 
outside formal Board meetings in order to gain 
first-hand experience of our operations and 
engage with our workforce. The Executive 
Directors meet weekly as part of the Executive 
Committee to attend to the ongoing 

management of the Group. Any significant 
operational and market matters are 
communicated to the Non-Executive Directors 
on a timely basis outside of Board meetings. 
The Board is supported by the Group Company 
Secretary, to whom all Directors have access 
for advice and corporate governance services.

GOVERNANCE REPORTBOARD ACTIVITIES

BOARD MEETINGS
The Board is committed to maintaining a 
comprehensive schedule of meetings and a 
forward agenda to ensure its time is used 
most effectively and efficiently, and it is 
supported by the Group Company Secretary 
to facilitate this. Flexibility in the 
programme is important to permit key 
items to be added to any agenda, so that the 
Board can focus on evolving and important 
matters at the most appropriate time.

Board meeting discussions are structured 
using a carefully tailored agenda that is 
agreed in advance by the Chair, in conjunction 
with the CEO and Group Company Secretary.

A typical Board meeting will comprise the 
following elements:

 – Written reports from the Chairs of our 
Board Committees on the proceedings 
of those meetings, including the key 
discussion points and particular matters 
to bring to the Board’s attention.

 – Following every Company Forum, a 
report on the topics discussed at the 
Forum is circulated and the Directors 
who attended that particular Forum add 
further context at the Board meeting.

 – Performance reports, including: CEO 

Overview; CFO Review; and Operational 
Performance Reports.

 – Deep dive reports into areas of 

particular strategic importance, 
opportunities and risks, to evaluate 
progress, provide insight and, where 
necessary, decide on appropriate 
action. Read more about some of the 
topics covered during the year opposite.

 – Legal and governance updates, including:
 – Approval of arrangements for delegated 
financial authority across the Group; 
 – Review of adequacy of Whistleblowing 

Procedures; and 

 – Approval of the Anti-Slavery and 
Human Trafficking Statement.

Time is set aside at the end of every Board 
meeting for the Chair to hold an 
Independent Non-Executive Director only 
meeting, where it is considered appropriate, 
which provides the opportunity for 
discussion on key agenda items and other 
matters without the Executive Directors and 
management present.

On the evening before most scheduled 
Board meetings, all the Non-Executive 
Directors meet either by themselves, or 
together with just the CEO, or with the entire 
Board and the Group Company Secretary. 
This time is usefully spent enabling Board 
members to build a rapport with each other 
and a relationship on a personal level, share 
external views and consider issues 
impacting the Company, resulting in better 
Board dynamics and decision making.

The following schematic aims to bring the 
Board’s rich programme to life.

GOVERNANCE REPORTKEY TOPICS CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD IN 2022/23

The Board’s 2022/23 agenda was wide-ranging, with a variety of topics drawn from the 
Schedule of Matters Reserved to the Board, including those related to our Strategy and culture, 
and overall oversight of management and operations. Set out below are examples of topics 
considered by the Board during the year.

APPROVAL OF THE SEVERN TRENT SOCIETAL STRATEGY

NET ZERO TRANSITION PLAN UPDATES

Our customers are facing a sustained increase in financial pressures – driven 
by rising inflation and energy costs. As a socially responsible company, that 
genuinely cares about its customers and the communities it serves, the Board 
reviewed and approved the Group’s Societal Strategy, which focuses on the 
underlying causes of water poverty to reduce long-term affordability issues 
and contribute to the wider levelling-up agenda. The Board considered that the 
best way in the longer term to help households experiencing water poverty 
was to give them the tools to improve job prospects and life chances, with 
much of the support being delivered by the Severn Trent Academy.

Stakeholders / Considerations:

  Customers – our Societal Strategy focuses on careers and employment-

related skills and training to support customers and others in our 
communities in securing employment and helping to address a key 
driver of financial hardship.

  Communities – helping customers and households will also help the 
wider community. Interventions are targeted through school work 
experience programmes, mentoring young offenders and establishing 
pop-up Academy Hubs in the areas that need them the most.

  Employees – as a large regional employer, we can have a positive impact 
on our local communities and we know colleagues are very supportive of 
the work we are doing in this area. Programmes are being delivered by 
our Academy Team with support from Community Champion volunteers 
across the workforce.

Climate change remains a crucial focus for Severn Trent. As such, the Board 
receives regular updates on the progress made in delivering the Group’s 
commitments to transition to net zero. Through these updates, the Board 
received assurance that the activities and investments required to meet the 
Group’s commitments were meeting their Key Performance Indicators and 
timescales, and that external reporting, including the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’), was comprehensive, 
transparent and understood by investors. The Board also considered the risks 
and opportunities associated with the plan, and how these could be mitigated 
and explored. 

Stakeholders / Considerations:

  Suppliers and Contractors – Scope 3 emissions arising from Severn 
Trent’s supply chain are discussed regularly with suppliers and we 
encourage completion of sustainability assessments ahead of agreeing 
Science-Based Targets.

  Sustainability and ESG – the UK water and waste water industry is 

responsible for c.1% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. As such, the 
Board supports the Company’s leading role both within the sector and in 
the wider economy to drive down these emissions.

  Regulators and Government – we engaged with Ofwat around 

incorporating net zero investment and targets into its PR24 methodology 
and the Board welcomed the addition of environmental performance 
commitments, including in relation to the reduction of emissions.

  Suppliers and Contractors – our supply chain is an extension of our 
business and, as such, we have encouraged and challenged our 
suppliers to join us on this journey, and many have already offered their 
support to the initiatives being delivered through our Societal Strategy.

  Shareholders and Investors – investors continue to place increasing 

focus on financial grade reporting, such as TCFD, and this is seen as a 
further opportunity to engage with investors on the proactive approach 
taken by the Company.

Read more about how we engaged with stakeholders throughout the 
development of our Societal Strategy in our Section 172 Statement on 
pages 95 to 97

FINANCIAL MATTERS

RESILIENCE IN THE ROUND

Resilience is our ability to cope with and recover from disruption, and 
anticipate emerging trends and variability in order to maintain service delivery 
for our customers and the environment, both today and over time. The Board is 
supportive of Ofwat’s core concept of ‘Resilience in the Round’ – comprising 
operational, financial and corporate resilience – recognising its importance 
for customers and broader stakeholders. It is vital that our services remain 
resilient over the long term. As such, the Board discusses a deep dive on 
Resilience in the Round on an annual basis, which provides an overview 
of future plans to grow our resilience and shape our long-term 
planning approach.

Topics featured within the deep dive included: climate change and the resulting 
impact on resource availability, carbon and environmental sustainability; 
extreme weather events, high-impact operational events; cyber security and 
the pace at which technology continues to evolve; attracting and retaining 
people with the skills and experience the business needs; and economic and 
social changes, such as population growth, urbanisation, consumer habits and 
perceptions, future financing and regulation.

The Board discussed the innovative approach being taken in consideration 
of the Company’s suite of regulatory plans for our medium- and longer-term 
future to bolster the Group’s resilience and mitigate the impact on services 
for customers, the environment, the economy and communities.

 – Group Budget – the Board reviewed the Group’s performance versus the 

2022/23 Group budget and agreed the 2023/24 Group budget.

 – Viability Statement – on the recommendation of the Audit and Risk Committee, 
the Board reviewed and approved the Viability Statement to be reported in the 
Annual Report and Accounts. Read more on pages 80 to 83.

 – Results and Regulatory Reporting – on the recommendation of the Audit and 

Risk Committee, the Board reviewed and approved the half and full year results 
announcements, Annual Report and Accounts, and Annual Performance Report.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

 – Enterprise Risk Management (‘ERM’) – the Board, in conjunction with the Audit 

and Risk Committee, conducts regular reviews of the Group’s ERM Risk Register. 
Enhancements continue to be made to risk management processes, including 
the identification, assessment, response and monitoring of all existing and 
emerging risks. Read more on pages 73 to 79.

 – Review of Effectiveness of Risk Management and Internal Controls – the 
Board, in conjunction with the Audit and Risk Committee, assessed the 
effectiveness of the risk management and internal controls in place across 
the Group, including in relation to whistleblowing procedures, and 
determined that the Group’s systems had operated effectively throughout 
the year. Read more on pages 130 to 131.

 – Deep Dives – the Board received dedicated sessions on cyber risk, our 

compliance with statutory requirements relating to reservoirs, and health, 
safety and wellbeing to scrutinise the internal controls in place and review 
the external assurance undertaken.

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

CULTURE AND ENGAGEMENT

LONG-TERM PLANNING

The Board is responsible for assessing and monitoring the Group’s culture, 
and regularly considers items relating to the workforce as part of its 
responsibilities. The Board is satisfied that the Group’s culture remains 
aligned to the Company’s Strategy, Purpose and Values, and did not identify 
any corrective action required to be taken by management.

During the year, the Board considered updates on the following workforce-
related topics:

 – Company Forum – Directors attend the Company Forum, which is the 

Board’s selected workforce engagement mechanism, on a rotation basis 
and report back on proceedings to the rest of the Board.

 – Employee Voice – the Board reviews the results and feedback from the 

annual employee engagement survey, QUEST, and monitors how the areas 
of employee focus are being addressed. The Board determined that 
appropriate interventions were made in a timely manner. 

 – Succession Planning and Talent Management – in order to deliver for its 

stakeholders, it is vital that the Group maintains a skilled workforce today 
and into the future. As such, succession planning and talent management at 
all levels remains a key topic for the Board, with discussion focused on 
building technical and leadership capability while creating diverse talent 
pipelines for the future.

 – Diversity and Inclusion (‘D&I’) – significant progress has been made in 
advancing the Group’s D&I ambitions, to ensure that our workforce 
increasingly reflects the communities we serve. The Group’s four D&I 
Advisory Groups and initiatives such as the 10,000 Black Interns 
programme continue to play an important role. This is evident in the QUEST 
survey results on engagement and equality, both of which remain ahead of 
global benchmarks.

 – Employee Relations – the Board maintains a strong and open relationship 
with employees throughout the Group, through a combination of dedicated 
engagement events such as ‘Ask Our Board’, site visits and informal 
meetings. These are all key components of the Group’s approach to 
workforce engagement.

 – Workforce Policies and Practices – the Board formally reviews the Group’s 
workforce policies and practices to ensure these remain consistent with the 
Company’s Purpose and Values and support the Group’s long-term 
sustainable success.

A key focus for the Board this year has been reviewing the Group’s Strategy 
to reflect where the business is today and outline its ambitions for the future, in 
consideration of the changing environment within which the Company operates. 
Central to the Group’s Strategy is a desire to be performance driven and 
sustainability led – positioning the Group to deliver consistently outstanding 
operational and financial performance in a manner that has a positive sustainable 
impact for all stakeholders. The Board determined that this is best achieved 
through balancing the long-term interests of all stakeholders. Read more about 
our Strategy on pages 2 to 3.

The Board also spent a significant amount of time considering key long-term 
programmes that are inextricably linked to our environment, such as our 
Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan (‘DWMP’), Water Resources 
Management Plan (‘WRMP’), the Water Industry National Environment 
Programme (‘WINEP’) and our PR24 submission, including our Long-Term 
Delivery Strategy. Through these interrelated plans, the Board has ensured that 
we have appropriate, and aligned, plans in place to consider the impacts of 
population growth, drought, environmental obligations and climate change 
uncertainty so that we can continue to deliver our essential services for 
customers now and in the future whilst also transitioning to a net zero world.

 – DWMP – the Board reviewed the draft and final DWMP proposals detailing the 

Company’s plans to extend, improve and maintain a robust and resilient 
drainage and waste water system over the next 25 years, in consideration of 
challenges posed by factors such as population growth, drought, 
environmental obligations and climate change uncertainty. 

 – WRMP – the Board reviewed the draft WRMP proposals detailing the 

Company’s plans in relation to our water system today and in the future, in 
consideration of challenges posed by factors such as population growth, 
drought, environmental obligations and climate change uncertainty. The final 
WRMP is due to be published in Autumn 2023.

 – WINEP – the Board reviewed and considered the impact of our proposed 

environmental programme for PR24, which is aimed at driving positive change 
in environmental performance across both water and waste. The Company 
continues to make significant investment in this important area and, as such, 
the Board agreed a programme that is approximately three and a half times 
bigger than that submitted for AMP7, comprising proposed improvements, 
investigations and monitoring to deliver against a range of statutory drivers.

 – PR24 – the Board continues to shape the business plan for the next AMP, due to 
be submitted to Ofwat in October 2023, and PR24 continues to be tabled as a 
standing agenda item at all Board meetings. The Board considers, reviews and 
discusses detailed updates at each meeting and provides management with the 
challenge and scrutiny required to develop our proposals. Engagement with 
stakeholders is an essential input to progressing the plan, and individual Board 
members attended customer research groups to listen to, and understand, 
customers’ views first hand. Similarly, individual Board members, and the 
Board as a whole, have taken part in informed discussions with Ofwat.

GOVERNANCE

 – Governance Strategy – the Board considered the proposed Governance 
Strategy, which sets out our governance approach in the context of the 
Group’s Purpose and Values, prior to its publication for consultation. The 
Governance Strategy can be found on the Severn Trent Plc website.

 – Board Succession Planning – on the recommendation of the Nominations 
Committee, the Board oversaw the arrangements for Board succession 
planning and, in consideration of maintaining a diverse, experienced and 
appropriately skilled Board, approved the appointment of Sarah Legg as 
an Independent Non-Executive Director and Helen Miles as an Executive 
Director and the Chief Financial Officer Designate. Read more on pages 
123 to 124.

 – Board Effectiveness Evaluation – the Board reviewed the progress made 
against the action plan for 2022/23 and, having considered the feedback 
from the 2023 evaluation, set the action plan for 2023/24. Read more on

BOARD GOVERNANCE

The requirements of the Board are clearly 
documented in the Severn Trent Plc Articles  
of Association, Charter of Expectations and 
Schedule of Matters Reserved to the Board. 
All of these documents are available on the 
Severn Trent Plc website.

An effective Board
The operation of our Board is supported by the 
collective experience of the Directors and the 
diverse skills and experience they possess. This 
enables the Board to reach decisions in a 
focused and balanced way, supported by 
independent thought and constructive debate 
between the Directors. Trust and mutual 
respect are the cornerstones of relationships 
between our Directors, with a Board dynamic 
that supports open and honest conversations to 
ensure decisions are taken for the long-term 
success of Severn Trent in full consideration of 
the impact upon all stakeholders.

As outlined on page 109, there is a clear 
division of responsibilities between the roles of 
Chair and Chief Executive. To allow these 
responsibilities to be discharged effectively, 
the Chair and Chief Executive maintain regular 
dialogue outside the boardroom, to ensure an 
effective flow of information.

The Non-Executive Directors have direct access 
to senior management at all times. Informal as 
well as formal contact with the wider business 
is encouraged to develop a deeper 
understanding of Severn Trent’s operations and 
this engagement is welcomed. This broadens 
the Non-Executive Directors’ sources of 
information and enables them to consider the 
wider impact of any Board decisions on 
stakeholders more broadly. The effectiveness 
of the Board is reviewed at least annually and 
conducted according to the guidance set out in 
the 2018 Code and Financial Reporting Council 
(‘FRC’) Guidance on Board Effectiveness. You 
can read more about this year’s internally-
facilitated Board Effectiveness evaluation on 
pages 118 to 120.

Board independence
The independence of the Board is a matter of 
utmost importance given the vital role 
Non-Executive Directors play in scrutinising 
the performance of management and holding 
individual Executive Directors to account 
against agreed performance objectives. The 
Chair regularly holds meetings with Non-
Executive Directors without the Executive 
Directors or any management present, and 
Non-Executive Directors can obtain 
independent professional advice, at the 
Company’s expense, in the performance of 
their duties. All Directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Group Company 
Secretary, whose appointment and removal is 
a matter reserved for the Board.

The independence of our Non-Executive 
Directors is formally reviewed annually by the 
Nominations Committee, and as part of the 
Board Effectiveness evaluation. Particular 
focus is applied to Directors who have served 
over six years on the Board and John Coghlan, 
has been subject to a particularly stringent 
independence assessment, as detailed on 
page 120. The Nominations Committee and 
Board consider that there are no business or 
other circumstances that are likely to affect 
the independence of any Non-Executive 
Director and that all Non-Executive Directors 

continue to demonstrate independence. Read 
more in the Nominations Committee Report on 
pages 121 to 126.

All of the Non-Executive Directors who served 
during 2022/23 were considered by the Board 
to be independent for the purposes of the 2018 
Code and the Chair was considered to be 
independent upon her appointment. 

In accordance with the 2018 Code, all Directors 
will retire at this year’s AGM and, with the 
exception of James Bowling, submit 
themselves for appointment or reappointment 
by shareholders. Each of the Non-Executive 
Directors seeking appointment or 
reappointment are considered to be 
independent in judgment and character.

Conflicts of interest
Severn Trent Plc has a Conflicts of Interest 
Policy in place for all Group companies. Our 
Board and its Committees consider potential 
conflicts at the outset of every meeting and the 
Board formally reviews the authorisation of 
any potential conflicts of interest every six 
months, with any conflicts being recorded in 
the Conflicts of Interest Register. The Conflicts 
of Interest Register sets out any actual or 
potential conflict of interest situations which a 
Director has disclosed to the Board in line with 
their statutory duties and the practical steps 
that are to be taken to avoid conflict situations. 
When reviewing conflict authorisations, the 
Board considers any other appointments held 
by the Director as well as the findings of the 
Board Effectiveness evaluation.

Board members hold external directorships and 
other outside business interests and we 
recognise the significant benefits that greater 
boardroom exposure provides for our Directors. 
However, we closely monitor the nature and 
number of external directorships our Directors 
hold in order to satisfy ourselves that any 
additional appointments will not adversely 
impact their time commitment to their role at 
Severn Trent, and to ensure that all of our Board 
members remain compliant with applicable 
shareholder advisory groups’ individual guidance 
on ‘overboarding’. These requirements specify a 
limit on the number of directorships both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors are 
permitted to hold and no Directors exceed these 
guidelines, as outlined in the AGM Notice of 
Meeting. Our Non-Executive Directors commit 
sufficient time to discharging their 
responsibilities as Directors of Severn Trent in 
line with the requirements set out in our Charter 
of Expectations. Details of the Directors’ external 
directorships can be found in their biographies 
on pages 104 to 105.

Before committing to an additional 
appointment, Directors confirm the existence 
of any potential or actual conflicts; that the role 
will not breach the Company’s overboarding 
limit; and provide the necessary assurance 
that the appointment will not adversely impact 
their ability to continue to fulfil their role as a 
Director. Directors are required to obtain 
formal approval from the Board ahead of

Stakeholder engagement
Stakeholder engagement is central to our 
Strategy and, as such, a detailed disclosure 
setting out stakeholder engagement activity 
conducted during the year is included in our 
Strategic Report. The Board ensures that the 
Company engages effectively with its 
stakeholders and encourages a two-way 
dialogue in order that the decisions made by 
the Board take into account the views of, and 
potential impacts on, stakeholders. Our 
dedicated Stakeholder Engagement section 
and Section 172 Statement on pages 84 to 94 
and 95 to 97 respectively set out how the Board 
has considered and contemplated the interests 
of stakeholders. A detailed overview of the 
Board’s engagement with our workforce is set 
out on pages 89 and 90.

Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’)
Our 2022 AGM was held on 7 July 2022, at 
which 78.05% of our shareholders (by voting 
capital) voted in person, through the Chair of 
the AGM as their proxy or by submitting their 
proxy forms either electronically or by post. 
We were delighted to receive in excess of 95% 
votes in favour for all of our resolutions, 
including in relation to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. Shareholders were 
invited to submit questions to a dedicated AGM 
mailbox in advance of the AGM and 
shareholders could also raise questions 
during the AGM via the virtual platform, or in 
the room if attending in person. No questions 
were posed to the Board in advance of the 
AGM, but one question was asked and 
responded to during the AGM.

This year’s AGM is to be held on Thursday, 
6 July 2023 at 10.00am. The AGM will be 
convened as a physical meeting, with an option 
for shareholders to follow the business of the 
meeting by virtual means as well as attend in 
person. Those joining virtually will be able to 
log into a live webcast and pose questions to 
the Board in real time, in accordance with the 
2018 Code and the Annual General Meeting 
Guidance published by the FRC in October 
2020. Shareholders are also able to submit 
questions in writing through our website in 
advance of the AGM. The physical location of 
the AGM will be the Severn Trent Academy, 
Hawksley Park, St. Martins Road, Finham, 
Coventry, CV3 6PR.

Full details of the resolutions being tabled for 
shareholder approval can be found in the 
Notice of Meeting on our website.

undertaking any new external appointments 
and approval was sought during the year in 
relation to external appointments for both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. In 
each case, the Board determined that there 
would be no impact on the time commitment 
required for each Director, nor on the 
independence and objectivity required to 
discharge the agreed responsibilities of each 
role. The resultant position is believed to be 
consistent with applicable shareholder 
advisory groups’ guidelines on overboarding.

The Conflicts of Interest Policy continues to  
be applied practically throughout the year, 
such as considering the potential conflict 
presented by Directors having roles on  
other Group companies.

Schedule of Matters 
Reserved to the Board
To ensure the Board maintains oversight of the 
areas material to the delivery of the Group’s 
Strategy and Purpose, the Board undertakes 
an annual review of the Matters Reserved to 
the Board. The latest review took place in 
March 2023 and the Board agreed that the 
Schedule contained areas appropriate to 
require Board involvement, including in 
relation to strategy, structure and capital, 
financial reporting, controls and 
communication with stakeholders. The Board 
also reviewed its skills matrix to determine 
whether any additional skills or development 
opportunities were needed in order for the 
Board to discharge its duties effectively. The 
Schedule of Matters Reserved to the Board is 
available on the Severn Trent Plc website. 

Strategy
Appropriately evaluated strategic decisions are 
crucial to help us to deliver our Strategy and 
achieve our Purpose of ‘taking care of one of 
life’s essentials’. Responsibility to all of our 
stakeholders for the approval and delivery of 
the Group’s Strategy and for creating and 
overseeing the framework to support its 
delivery sits with the Board. During the year, the 
Board considered and approved the Group’s 
new Corporate Strategy, further details of 
which can be found within the Strategic Report 
on pages 2 to 99. As well as standing strategic 
items at every Board meeting, the Board also 
holds a dedicated Strategy Day with the 
Executive Committee to help consider the 
strategic direction of the Company for the short, 
medium and long term.

Responsibility for the development and 
implementation of the Group’s Strategy and 
overall commercial objectives rests with the 
Chief Executive who is supported by the 
Executive Committee.

The Directors present their report and the 
audited Group financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2023. The performance review 
of the Company can be found within the

GOVERNANCE REPORTCOMPOSITION, SUCCESSION AND EVALUATION

As at the date of this report, 
our Board comprised the 
Chair (who was independent 
on appointment), six 
Independent Non-Executive 
Directors and three Executive 
Directors. The details of 
their career backgrounds, 
relevant skills, Committee 
membership, tenure and 
external appointments can be 
found within their individual 
biographies on pages 104 to 
105. Further detail on the role 
of the Chair and members of 
the Board can be found on 
page 109.

Board composition
The Chair, Senior Independent Director and 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a 
three-year term, subject to annual re-election 
by shareholders following consideration of the 
annual Board Effectiveness evaluation 
outputs. Directors serving over six years on 
the Board are subject to a particularly rigorous 
review. The current Letters of Appointment are 
available on the Severn Trent Plc website. 

The composition and effectiveness of the Board 
is subject to regular review by the Nominations 
Committee which, in particular, considers the 
balance of skills, tenure, experience and 
independence of the Board, in accordance with 
the Board Diversity Policy, which is available on 
the Severn Trent Plc website. 

Any new appointments to the Board result 
from a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure, responsibility for which is 
delegated to the Nominations Committee 
(although decisions on appointments are a 
matter reserved for the Board).

The Board and the Nominations Committee 
have spent a significant amount of time 
considering Board composition during the 
course of the year to ensure that the Board has 
the right mix of skills and experience, as well 
as the capability to provide effective challenge 
and promote diversity.

Further information on the work of the 
Nominations Committee can be found on 
pages 121 to 126.

Directors’ skills and experiences
An effective Board requires the right mix of 
skills and experience and, as can be seen from 
the individual biographies on pages 104 to 105 
and the Board skills matrix on page 106, our 
Board members contribute a diverse range of 
backgrounds, skill sets and experiences that, 
combined together, produce an effective team, 
focused on promoting the long-term success of 
the Group. 

The skills matrix is reviewed at least annually 
to ensure that the right balance of skills and 
experience are in place to enable the effective 
oversight of the Company and execution of  
our Strategy.

Diversity
A diverse organisation benefits from 
differences in skills, regional and industry 
experience, background, ethnicity, gender, 
sexual orientation, religion, belief and age, as 
well as culture and personality. The Board is 
pleased that Severn Trent is recognised as a 
leader in this area and remains focused on 
promoting broader diversity and creating an 
inclusive culture across the organisation and 
including on the Board itself. More details 
about the Board Diversity Policy and how the 
Company has performed against its Board 

Diversity Targets in relation to membership of 
the Board and Executive Committee can be 
found in the Nominations Committee Report, 
from page 121. 

Development, training and resources
The environment in which we operate is 
continually changing. It is therefore important 
for our Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
to remain aware of recent, and upcoming, 
developments and keep their knowledge and 
skills up to date, so the composition of the 
Board continues to operate effectively and 
support delivery of our long-term Strategy.

Our Board Effectiveness evaluation process 
includes training discussions with the Group 
Company Secretary and, as required, we invite 
professional advisers and subject matter 
experts to provide in-depth updates. These 
updates are not solely reserved for legislative 
developments but aim to cover a range of 
strategic issues including, but not limited to, 
the economic and political environment, and 
environmental, sustainability, technological 
and social considerations. Our Group Company 
Secretary also provides regular updates to the 
Board and its Committees on regulatory and 
corporate governance matters.

The aim of the training sessions is to refresh 
and expand the Board’s knowledge and skills. 
In doing so, the Directors can contribute to 
discussions on technical and regulatory 
matters more effectively. The sessions also 
serve as an opportunity for the Board to 
discuss strategy and risks with management 
below Executive Committee level and gain 
further direct insight into our businesses and 
management capability.

During the year, the Board took part in a 
number of training and deep dive sessions 
including in relation to PR24, river quality, 
innovation, resilience in the round and talent 
management. Further details can be found 
on pages 112 to 113.

Directors also have access to our online 
resource library, which is continually reviewed 
and updated. The library includes a Corporate 
Governance Manual, tailored training and 
development content, a Results Centre and 
Investor Relations section, and briefings on 
regulatory topics. It also contains a further 
reading section which covers updates and 
guidance on changes to legislation and 
corporate governance best practice.

Board succession
Along with ensuring an appropriate mix of skills 
and experiences on the Board as a whole for the 
effective oversight of the Company’s Strategy 
and operations, the composition of the Board is 
also informed by the need for orderly succession 
across key Board and Committee roles.

SARAH LEGG’S INDUCTION

MEMBER OF:

 – Audit and Risk Committee
 – Corporate Sustainability Committee
 – Nominations Committee
 – Treasury Committee

The Board welcomed Sarah Legg during  
the year, and her extensive induction 
programme covered a range of areas across 
the business. Along with a detailed overview 
of the water sector and the regulatory 
requirements we operate under, Sarah 
attended a number of sessions covering 
topics including governance, stakeholder 
engagement and the environment. The 
sessions were a mix of virtual and physical 
meetings, including visits to a range of 
operational sites.

Additional areas of focus for Sarah’s 
induction were matters pertinent to her role 
on the Board Committees. For her role on 
the Audit and Risk Committee, this included 
receiving an overview of the current risks 
faced by the Group, regulatory finance 
model, risk management framework, 
Internal Audit programme and internal 
control processes, and an overview of the 
Group’s AMP7 funding strategy in relation to 
her role on the Treasury Committee. In 
relation to her membership of the Corporate 
Sustainability Committee, Sarah undertook 
a series of deep dives in relation to the 
Group’s Sustainability Strategy and net zero 
commitments. A high-level overview of the 
induction process is set out below.

The Nominations Committee and Board have 
applied particular focus to this important area 
over the last 18 months and further detail can 
be found in the Nominations Committee Report 
on page 122.

Induction
We develop a detailed, tailored induction for 
each new Non-Executive Director. This 
includes one-to-one meetings with the Chair 
and each of the existing Non-Executive 
Directors. One-to-one meetings are also 
arranged with the CEO, CFO and the Group 
Company Secretary, along with other 
members of the Executive Committee and 
Senior Management Team. New Directors also 
meet members of the operational teams and 
visit our key sites and capital projects to 
ensure they gain a detailed understanding of 
the water and waste water businesses, and 
have a chance to experience our unique culture 
first hand. We provide briefings on the key 
duties of being a Director of a regulated water 
company and proposed appointees meet with 
Ofwat ahead of their formal appointment.

We enhance the Board’s induction 
programme in light of feedback from new 
Directors and the Board Effectiveness 
evaluation, for example, the introduction of 
the Board buddy scheme.

My Severn Trent Board 
induction has been an 
incredibly thorough and 
well thought-out journey. 
I have experienced both 
the Group’s operations and 
its culture, and have met 
some wonderful people 
along the way.

EVALUATION

Our annual Board evaluation provides the Board, 
and its Committees, with an opportunity to 
consider and reflect on the quality and 
effectiveness of its decision making, the range 
and level of discussion, and for each member to 
consider their own contribution and performance.

This year, the review was facilitated internally 
by the Group Company Secretary, who is well 
placed as an independent sounding board to 
the process. Meetings took place during 
February and March 2023, and key themes 
were shared with the Board and Nominations 
Committee along with a 2023 action plan.

An externally-facilitated evaluation was 
conducted by Independent Board Evaluation in 
2020/21 and the next externally-facilitated 
evaluation will be scheduled for 2023/24 in 
accordance with the 2018 Code provision that 
the Company should undertake an externally-
facilitated Board Effectiveness evaluation at 
least every three years.

BOARD EVALUATION 
REVIEW CYCLE

During the year, the Board reviewed the 
nature of its evaluation process and 
agreed to adopt a three-year assessment 
cycle moving forward, to build on 
momentum in prior years, whilst also 
ensuring a rigorous and balanced 
approach to implementing incremental 
improvements. 

The cycle is set out below and 2023/24 
will be the first year of a new three-year 
cycle, and therefore will involve an 
externally-facilitated evaluation exercise. 
The Nominations Committee has 
commenced the process to select a

CONSIDER RESULTS  
AND AGREE ACTIONS

MARCH 2023

The Group Company Secretary undertook a detailed review of 
the 2021/22 Board Effectiveness evaluation process in order to 
develop the approach for 2022/23, incorporating 
recommendations from the 2018 Code, Parker Review, FRC 
Guidance on Board Effectiveness and Ofwat’s Board leadership, 
transparency and governance principles. A focused 
questionnaire was designed to gather individual Directors’ 
perceptions of the effectiveness of the Board and its operations, 
including in relation to accountability, oversight, strategy, value 
creation, culture, ethics, behaviours, stakeholder engagement 
and information flows to the Board and its Committees.

The questionnaires were issued and each Director was also 
asked to complete an updated entry for the Board skills matrix, 
taking into consideration skills that had been strengthened 
through training and development over the previous year. 
Directors were also asked to highlight any additional skills that 
they felt may be beneficial for the Board to have amongst its 
members in order to discharge its duties effectively. 

Board members participated in comprehensive one-to-one 
meetings with the Chair and Group Company Secretary, with 
additional input from the Senior Independent Director, to allow 
reflection on their personal responses to the questionnaire and 
discussion of matters relevant to boardroom culture, process 
and development. Separate discussions were held to consider 
the effectiveness of the CEO, CFO and Group Company 
Secretary, led by the Chair. The Chair’s performance evaluation 
was led by the Senior Independent Director.

The Group Company Secretary collated the individual 
responses, including analysis of themes and proposed 
actions. A detailed report, setting out the findings of the 
evaluation, was provided to the Chair for consideration. The 
Group Company Secretary and Chair met to discuss the 
findings, with the resulting report being tabled to the 
Nominations Committee and Board in March 2023.

The findings of the evaluation exercise were fully considered 
when making recommendations in respect of the appointment 
and reappointment of individual Directors, and included an 
assessment of their independence, time commitment and 
individual performance. The respective proposed 2023 AGM 
Resolutions were considered and agreed by the Board. The 
proposed actions arising from the evaluation were thoroughly 
discussed and agreed for implementation and monitoring.

STAGE 5 

MONITOR PROGRESS

APRIL 2023 ONWARDS

The Board will continue to oversee the progress made in 
relation to the agreed actions to ensure their timely 
completion. The Nominations Committee will also continue to 
play a key role in monitoring the actions relating to Board 
succession, composition, recruitment and induction.

RECOMMENDATION

INITIAL PROGRESS

SUCCESSION PLANNING AND BOARD COMPOSITION

Ensure process to enable the smooth succession of Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Senior Independent Director, commences 
well in advance of scheduled retirements.

Succession planning continues to be a key focus of the Board and a 
standing item on the agenda for Nominations Committee meetings. 
Robust succession plans are in place for all roles.

BOARD AGENDA

Notwithstanding the well-structured agendas which comprise an optimal 
mix of strategic and operational items, consideration should be given to:

The Board forward agenda has been reviewed to ensure that:

 – All matters are appropriately scheduled for discussion at future 

 – Scheduling key strategic and complex regulatory topics earlier on 

Board meetings; and 

the Board agenda to ensure sufficient time for discussion and 
debate; and 

 – Allocating more time on the Board agenda to discuss strategic 

developments and opportunities, as well as innovation initiatives, 
both within and outside of the utilities sector.

BOARD REPORTS

Notwithstanding the high quality of Board reporting, there was 
an opportunity to enhance executive summaries and articulate 
key takeaways within Board reports to facilitate focus of 
Board discussions.

 – Sufficient time is devoted to the discussion of strategic and 

innovative topics.

Feedback on Board reporting has been incorporated into the Group’s 
suite of report writing training. 

EVALUATION RECOMMENDATIONS FROM 2021/22

The internally-facilitated board effectiveness process also provided an update on the recommendations identified in the 2021/22 review. The report 
concluded that good progress had been made in relation to the recommendations from the 2021/22 evaluation. Further details are set out in the table below.

RECOMMENDATION

BOARD AGENDA

ACTION TAKEN

Notwithstanding the well-structured agendas which comprise an 
optimal mix of strategic and operational items, more opportunity 
could be afforded to allow the Board to discuss bolder strategic 
moves and opportunities, future likely trends and developments 
outside of the utilities sector, and potential areas of differentiation.

The Board developed and agreed a set of Board objectives for 2022/23, 
which were reviewed at its meetings in March and April 2022. The 
Board forward agenda was also reviewed to ensure that all matters 
were appropriately scheduled for discussion at future Board 
meetings.

In addition to the informative oral reports provided to the Board by 
the Chair on her meetings with shareholders, consideration should 
be given to include dedicated time on the agenda for all Directors to 
provide feedback on engagement with stakeholders.

ENGAGEMENT OUTSIDE MEETINGS

The Board agenda allows time for Directors to provide individual 
feedback on their engagement activity with all stakeholders.

Non-Executive Directors should continue to be invited to additional 
site visits outside the Board meeting rhythm to further build 
relationships with each other and gain an even deeper 
understanding of the business.

Alongside the regular programme of Board meetings being held at 
operational sites, a number of additional site visits were scheduled, 
covering the full range of the Group’s operations. See page 110 for 
further details.

‘Teach in’ sessions for non-Treasury Committee members should be 
established to provide other Non-Executive Directors with additional 
knowledge and experience of this technically complex area.

A programme of ‘teach in’ sessions was developed, including 
Treasury-related topics and other technical matters.

BOARD COMMITTEES

Nominations Committee – consideration should be given as to 
whether the Committee’s remit should be expanded to cover wider 
talent development, below Executive Committee level.

The Committee’s remit was considered during the review of its Terms 
of Reference undertaken in March 2023 and it was determined that 
these remained appropriate and reflective of the requirements 
outlined in the 2018 Code. The Board participated in a Group-wide 
succession planning and talent management session during the year. 
Read more in the Nominations Committee Report on pages 121 to 126.

Remuneration Committee – consideration should be given as to 
whether there should be an additional Non-Executive Director on 
the Committee.

As part of its ongoing succession planning activity, the Board 
continues to consider the composition of all Committees, including 
that of the Remuneration Committee.

GOVERNANCE REPORTCOMPOSITION, SUCCESSION AND EVALUATION CONTINUED

External appointments
It is imperative that Directors have sufficient time 
to meet their responsibilities of providing 
constructive challenge and strategic guidance, 
and holding management to account. Approvals 
were sought from the Board during the year for 
Directors’ additional roles and due consideration 
was given to any potential conflicts of interest 
and ability to devote sufficient time to Severn 
Trent Plc before consent was granted. 

A further review of each Director’s time 
commitment was undertaken as part of the 
evaluation, with full consideration given to 
the number of external positions held by the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors, including 
the time commitment required for each. The 
Nominations Committee, in considering the 
Continuing Office of Directors, did not identify any 
instances of overboarding and confirms that all 
individual Directors have sufficient time to commit 
to their appointment as Directors of Severn Trent 
Plc. The full list of key external appointments held 
by our Directors can be found in their biographies 
on pages 104 to 105. 

Effectiveness of Board Committees
The Board places significant reliance on its 
Committees by delegating a broad range of 
responsibilities and issues to them. It 
therefore remains crucial that effective links 
are maintained between the Committees and 
the Board, not least as it is impracticable for 
all Independent Non-Executive Directors to be 
members of all the Committees. Mechanisms 
are in place to facilitate these links, including 
ensuring that there are no gaps or 
unnecessary duplications between the remit of 
each Committee and overlapping membership 
between Board Committees where necessary. 
Each Committee has its own Terms of 
Reference, which are reviewed annually, and 
the Board receives a written summary of each 
of the Committee’s meetings along with oral 
updates at the Board, where appropriate. 

The effectiveness of the Board Committees is 
therefore an important part of the evaluation 
and, along with each respective Committee, the 
Board also monitors any Committee-related 
recommendations that arise from the review. 
Overall, Board members are fully satisfied that 
the governance and controls in place are working 
well and give the Board the visibility it needs to 
carry out its oversight duties. Each Committee 
remains effective in providing the Board with the 
support it has requested. Further details on each 
Committee, including its oversight and focus 
during the year, can be found in the Committee 
reports starting on page 121.

Chair’s performance
The Senior Independent Director, Kevin Beeston, 
carried out a review of the performance of the 
Chair, which included meeting with the Non-
Executive Directors without the Chair being 
present. The consolidated feedback, which was 
wholly positive in nature, was discussed with the 
Chair and subsequently reported to the 
Nominations Committee and Board. The review 
confirmed that the Chair continued to 
demonstrate strong leadership and commitment, 
highlighting her expert management of the Board 
succession process during the year. It was 
concluded that the Chair promoted a culture of 
inclusivity, openness and debate, ensuring that 
views from others were sought before expressing 
her own perspective. As such, meetings were 
constructive and focused, and Directors received 
accurate, timely and clear information in advance. 
Board members confirmed that the Chair devoted 
sufficient time to the role, including in relation to 
building good relationships with key stakeholders, 
and in all respects met the requirements of the 
2018 Code.

John Coghlan’s independence
John Coghlan will have served on the Board for 
nine years in May 2023. The Board is satisfied that 
John continues to demonstrate independent 
character, judgment and objectivity. Continual 
monitoring of his independence and performance 
will be undertaken over his remaining tenure.

The Board, taking into account the provisions set 
out in the 2018 Code, considered that John 
remained independent notwithstanding the fact 
he would be serving for a period of more than 
nine years and concluded that there were no 
relationships or circumstances likely to impair 
his judgment. This was based on a number of 
factors, including: 

 – John’s strong record in making objective 

decisions and holding management to account, 
and remaining willing and able to do so;

 – His clear independence demonstrated in terms 

of his participation at meetings with 
management and his interactions with 
stakeholders including the External Auditor;

 – His arm’s-length approach to dealing with 

Executive Directors and continued challenge of 
management where appropriate; 

 – The fact that none of John’s external 

directorship appointments conflicted or 
potentially conflicted with those of the 
Company; and

 – The broader composition of the Board, 

including the fact that no other Non-Executive 
Director had a tenure in excess of nine years.

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT

Dear Shareholder 
This report details the role of the Nominations 
Committee and the important work it has 
undertaken during the year. It highlights the 
vital part played by the Committee to ensure 
that the Board has the appropriate balance of 
skills, experience, knowledge and diversity to 
provide the Company with the strong 
leadership required to support its workforce 
and deliver long-term sustainable success.

The Committee also ensures there is a 
high-quality, stable Executive Team in place, 
focused on the long term but adaptive to the 
changing world around us in order to deliver 
for all of our stakeholders.

This year has seen a number of significant 
changes to the composition of the Board, 
following the retirement of Philip Remnant, 
former Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
in November. I would like to convey my thanks 
to Philip for his dedication and significant and 
impactful contributions to the Board and 
Committee discussions. Sharmila Nebhrajani 
has taken on the role of Remuneration 
Committee Chair and, as such, will introduce 
her first Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
shareholders this year. 

We also welcomed Sarah Legg as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director of the 
Board from 1 November 2022. Given her 
strong financial background and deep interest 
in sustainability matters, Sarah joined our 
Audit and Risk, Treasury and Corporate 
Sustainability Committees, in addition to the 
Nominations Committee. Details of her 
ongoing induction programme can be found on 
page 117. 

During the year, we also announced the 
planned retirement of James Bowling, our 
Chief Financial Officer of eight years, and 
Bronagh Kennedy, our Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary of nearly twelve years. 
The Committee was delighted that, following 
rigorous internal and external search and 
selection processes, the appointments in 
relation to both these roles, and the 
subsequent opportunities they created on 

the Executive Committee, were largely made 
from existing talent within our business, 
helping us preserve the incredible knowledge 
and experience we possess and help drive us 
forward over the coming years. As a result of 
the Committee’s positive action, the Group’s 
succession readiness has been strengthened 
and the Committee considers that all key roles 
have credible succession plans in place. You 
can read more about these appointments 
on pages 123 and 124.

Following the implementation of these 
changes, the Committee has been focused on 
planning for the transition of our long-standing 
Non-Executive Directors, ensuring that the 
Board remains well balanced, with a strong 
pipeline of candidates with the appropriate 
skill sets, experience and capabilities.

During the year, the Committee also 
considered the Board Diversity Policy (the 
‘Policy’) and reviewed progress made against 
the agreed objectives set out in the Policy. The 
importance of the Policy aligning with the 
diversity of our region, specifically in respect 
of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, 
skills and experience, was paramount. The 
Committee also considered the new Listing 
Rule requirements in relation to diversity and 
inclusion, and progress in achieving the 
individual targets. Following its review, the 
Committee recommended to the Board that 
the Policy was amended to cover a broader 
range of diversity characteristics and facilitate 
the open and transparent reporting by 
Directors. Read more on page 125.

I am pleased to report that the Company 
complies with the targets outlined within the 
Listing Rules, with 60% of the current Board 
Directors being women, two of the senior 
positions currently held by women (Chair and 
Chief Executive) – moving to three following 
Helen Miles’ appointment as Chief Financial 
Officer in July 2023 – and two members of our 
Board from non-White Ethnic Minority 
backgrounds. We have developed a refreshed 
disclosure this year, which can be found on 
page 126, and we welcome feedback on this.

Christine Hodgson
Chair

The evolution of the Board 
and succession planning for 
the Executive Committee 
have been key areas of focus 
for the Committee this year 
and we believe we have 
the right team in place to 
deliver our Strategy into the 
next AMP and beyond.

All members of the Committee are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors of 
the Board, with the exception of Christine 
Hodgson (who was independent on 
appointment). Only members of the 
Committee have the right to attend 
Committee meetings. Other individuals, 
such as the Chief Executive, the Director 
of Human Resources and other senior 
management and external advisers, may 
be invited to attend meetings as and when 
appropriate. None of these attendees are 
members of the Committee.

GOVERNANCE REPORTNOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

As part of the Committee’s governance oversight 
role, the Committee also assists the Board in its 
consideration of conflicts of interest and 
independence issues. As part of its 
recommendation to the Board in respect of the 
Continuing Office of Directors, the Committee 
conducted its annual review of individual Director 
conflict authorisations as recorded in our 
Conflicts of Interest Register. When reviewing 
conflict authorisations, the Committee 
considered any other appointments held by 
the Director as well as the findings of the Board 
Effectiveness evaluation.

Following the review, the Committee 
recommended to the Board that each conflict 
authorisation remained appropriate and that 
there were no business or other circumstances 
that were likely to affect the independence of 
any Non-Executive Director. As such, the 
Committee determined that all Non-Executive 

Directors continued to demonstrate 
independence and I am pleased to report that 
the Board concurred with our conclusion.

In accordance with the 2018 Code, all the 
Directors will retire at this year’s AGM and, 
with the exception of James Bowling, submit 
themselves for appointment, in the case of 
Sarah Legg and Helen Miles, or reappointment 
by shareholders. Each of the Non-Executive 
Directors seeking appointment or 
reappointment are considered to be 
independent in judgment and character.

Finally, in what has been a very busy year 
for the Committee, we also paid significant 
attention to enhancing the effectiveness of 
the Board and its Committees. An internally-
facilitated Board Effectiveness evaluation was 
conducted earlier this year, which concluded 
that the Board continues to operate effectively 
while also signalling minor areas for 
improvement, details of which can be 
found on page 119.

I would like to thank the members of the 
Committee for their continued commitment 
throughout the year, for the open discussions 
that take place at our meetings, and for the 
contribution they all provide in support of 
our work.

KEY AREAS OF 
FOCUS IN 2022/23

The Committee has responsibility for 
keeping the size, structure and composition 
of the Board and its Committees under 
review and is responsible for ensuring that 
there are formal plans in place for an 
orderly succession to both Board and senior 
leadership positions. The Committee also 
oversees the development of a diverse 
pipeline for succession. The composition of 
the Board is reviewed and refreshed on a 
regular basis and there is a rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the appointment 
of Directors. The Committee leads the 
process for Board and Board Committee 
appointments and makes recommendations 
to the Board. The Committee reports to the 
Board on its key areas of focus following 
each Committee meeting.

Key areas of focus for the Committee this 
year included the following:

 – Consideration of the composition of the 

Board and Committees and the succession 
of Non-Executive Directors and the skills, 
knowledge, experience, diversity and 
attributes required of current and future 
Non-Executive Directors. In considering 
Board succession, the Committee took into 
account the length of tenure of the 
Non-Executive Directors and the 
importance of the progressive refreshing 
of Board membership.

 – Review of individual Director independence 

through the established Conflicts of 
Interest and Persons Closely Associated 
declaration process and concluded that 
there were no concerns as regards the 
composition of the Board, or the 
contribution or commitment of any of 
the Directors.

 – Review of the search firm providers for 

the next stage of the Board’s succession 
planning and engaged the executive search 
firms Hedley May1 and Spencer Stuart2.
 – Oversight of the succession plans in place 
for the Executive Committee and other 
members of senior management, including 
consideration of the Group’s talent 
development programmes to build 
technical and leadership capability.
 – Oversight of the Board Effectiveness 

evaluation and discussion of the feedback, 
observations and recommendations from 

the review of the Board and Committees, 
including the 2023 action plan for approval 
by the Board.

 – Reviewed the Board Diversity Policy 

to ensure it remained aligned with the 
requirements of the Listing Rules and 
incorporated any other best practice.

 – Continued application of the Board 
Diversity Policy and initiatives, and 
reviewed progress made against the 
agreed objectives set out in the Board 
Diversity Policy.

 – Discussion of the role of the Board 
Diversity Policy in advancing the 
composition and effectiveness of the Board 
and Executive Committee.

The Committee also reviewed and approved 
its Terms of Reference, prior to making a 
recommendation to the Board. In completing 
its review, the Committee concluded that the 
Terms of Reference remained appropriate 
and reflected the manner in which the 
Committee was discharging its duties.

The Committee is authorised to seek 
external legal or other independent 
professional advice as it sees fit but did not 
need to do so during the year.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SUCCESSION PLANNING

1
ENHANCED 
REVIEW OF  
INDEPENDENCE

Whilst we see long service on the Board as a positive 
characteristic, the Board is mindful that the 2018 Code 
indicates that Non-Executive Directors should not 
serve for more than nine years and Non-Executive 
Directors that have served over six years should be 
subjected to a particularly rigorous review. 

Such reviews, in line with the requirements of the 2018 
Code, had been undertaken in relation to the 
independence and commitment of the following 
Non-Executive Directors since reaching their six-year 
tenures:

 – Philip Remnant
 – John Coghlan
 – Kevin Beeston

In all cases, the Board remained satisfied that Philip, 
John and Kevin continued to act with the utmost 
independence and considered that their continued 
appointment was in the long-term best interests of 
shareholders. The length of service, independence and 
potential for conflicts of interest of John and Kevin were 
also considered as part of our internally-facilitated 
Board Effectiveness evaluation conducted this year, 
further details of which are set out on pages 118 to 119.

2
PREPARATION  
FOR 
RECRUITMENT

In preparation for two of its longest-serving 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, Philip Remnant 
and John Coghlan, approaching their maximum tenures 
of nine years, the Committee was tasked with reviewing 
the succession plans in place and recruiting additional 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, where 
appropriate, to ensure the optimum balance of skills and 
experience on the Board. During 2021/22, the 
Committee appointed an independent search firm, which 
is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for 

Executive Search Firms, to support with the evolution 
of the Independent Non-Executive membership of the 
Board over the next two to three years. 

Both Philip and John held Committee Chairships and 
therefore tailored recruitment criteria and role 
specifications were developed to outline the appropriate 
skills and experience required to ensure the Board 
continued to comprise members who were qualified 
to carry out these vital roles. 

3
SHORTLIST AND 
SELECTION

The Committee ensured that the recruitment process 
was conducted in line with the Board Diversity Policy, 
in particular that diverse candidates from a wide 
variety of backgrounds and those with non-listed 
company experience were included within the 
respective shortlists. Read more about our Board 
Diversity Policy on page 125.

Interviews were conducted by the Chair, Senior 
Independent Director and Chief Executive, with support 
from the Group Company Secretary. Once a preferred 
candidate had been selected, a pre-appointment 
meeting with Ofwat was arranged ahead of the 
proposed Non-Executive Director being formally 
appointed to the Board of Severn Trent Water Limited. 

4
APPOINTMENTS

Since 2021, the Committee has recommended the 
following appointments to the Board:

 – Gillian Sheldon – as an Independent Non-Executive 

Director and member of the Audit and Risk, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees, and 
Chair of the Treasury Committee.

 – Tom Delay – as an Independent Non-Executive 

Director, Chair of Corporate Sustainability 
Committee and member of the Nominations 
Committee.

 – Sarah Legg – as an Independent Non-Executive 

Director and member of the Audit and Risk, 
Nominations, Corporate Sustainability and 
Treasury Committees.

The Committee had also recommended to the Board 
the appointment of Sharmila Nebhrajani, an existing 
Independent Non-Executive Director, to the 
Remuneration Committee in anticipation of her 
succeeding Philip Remnant as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee.

The Committee also considered succession plans for 
the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, John 
Coghlan, who will have served on the Board for nine 
years in May 2023. The Committee and Board 
are satisfied that John continues to demonstrate 
independent character, judgment and objectivity. 

5
SUCCESSION 
AND INDUCTION

All newly appointed Directors undertook thorough, tailored induction programmes, overseen by the Committee, 
which included specific focus on key aspects of their roles on the Board Committees. Further details on Non-
Executive Director induction programmes can be found on page 117.

FUTURE 
PLANNING

The Committee is satisfied that all key roles have credible succession plans in place. Notwithstanding this, the 
Committee considers succession planning at each of its meetings and will continue to make appropriate 
recommendations to the Board as necessary.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE SUCCESSION PLANNING

THE NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE ALSO CONSIDERED SUCCESSION PLANNING FOR MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DURING THE YEAR, 
INCLUDING IN RELATION TO THE BELOW ROLES.

CHIEF FINANCIAL 
OFFICER

The Company announced on 1 February 2023 that 
James Bowling, Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’) and 
Executive Director, intended to retire from the 
Severn Trent Board following the conclusion of 
the AGM on 6 July 2023, having served the 
Company for over eight years.

Following a rigorous internal and external search 
and selection process, led by the Committee, it 
was announced that Helen Miles, the Group’s then 
incumbent Director of Capital and Commercial 
Services, would be appointed as an Executive 
Director and the CFO Designate with effect from 
1 April 2023.

The Chair and the CEO led the process to identify 
suitable candidates for the CFO role and the 
executive search firm Spencer Stuart1 was engaged 
as part of the recruitment process, having 
demonstrated, of the executive search firms 
considered, that it had the best understanding and 
knowledge of the Group and its culture. Having 
been provided with a role specification and detailed 
brief of the desired candidate profile, Spencer 
Stuart undertook the initial independent appraisal 
process and identified a number of potential 
internal and external candidates for the Committee 
to consider. Those shortlised were then interviewed 
by members of the Committee.

The Committee was pleased to recommend to the 
Board the appointment of Helen Miles given her 
highly experienced and commercial background 
along with a detailed understanding of the water 
sector and proven track record of exceptional 
delivery.

Furthermore, the Committee was particularly 
pleased that Helen would have the opportunity to 
work alongside James prior to his retirement to 
ensure an effective and orderly handover.

1   Spencer Stuart is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct 
for Executive Search Firms. Christine Hodgson acts as an 
External Board Adviser to Spencer Stuart Management 
Consultants NV. The decision to appoint Spencer Stuart was 
first discussed with John Coghlan, Chair of the Audit and Risk 
Committee, before the Board considered the matter and 
determined that the engagement of Spencer Stuart would 
present no conflict of interest.

GROUP GENERAL 
COUNSEL  
AND GROUP COMPANY 
SECRETARY

The Company announced on 13 September 2022 
that Bronagh Kennedy, Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, intended to retire from 
Severn Trent on 2 December 2022, having served 
the Company for nearly twelve years. 

Following a rigorous internal and external search 
and selection process, the Committee considered 
that the role should be split into two roles – Group 
General Counsel and Group Company Secretary – 

with the following two candidates recommended 
for appointment:

 – Didar Dhillon was appointed as the Company’s 
new Group General Counsel with effect from 
2 December 2022, having joined the Group in 
October 2022.

 – Hannah Woodall-Pagan was appointed as Group 
Company Secretary with effect from 2 December 
2022, having joined the Group in October 2015.

DIRECTOR OF CAPITAL 
AND COMMERCIAL 
SERVICES AND DIRECTOR 
OF CUSTOMER 
OPERATIONS

Further to Helen Miles’ appointment as CFO 
Designate, the Committee oversaw the succession 
plans in place for the Executive Committee. 

 – Director of Customer Operations – Appointment 

of Steph Cawley, who has held a number of 
senior roles since joining the Group in 2018.

The Committee recommended to the Board the 
following:

 – Director of Capital and Commercial Services – 
Appointment of James Jesic, who previously 
served as Director of Customer Operations since 
2020 and has been with the Group since 2003.

The Committee was particularly pleased to 
appoint internal candidates to these roles, as 
it demonstrates the strength and talent of the 
Senior Management Team within the business.

Diversity on our Board  
and Committees
The Committee and Board continue to drive the 
agenda of diversity across the Group in setting 
the right tone from the top and are proud of the 
progress being made to date. Whilst Severn 
Trent has long been an advocate of a diverse 
workforce and the huge advantages that this 
brings teams across the business, the 
Committee acknowledges that there is more to 
be done to encourage greater diversity, so that 
all companies can experience the benefits of 
wide-ranging experience and backgrounds.

We welcome the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
(‘FCA’) policy statement, published in April 
2022, regarding changes to the Listing Rules in 
relation to diversity and inclusion on company 
boards. This section of the Annual Report 
addresses the FCA’s requirements in relation 
to diversity and inclusion disclosures set out in 
Listing Rule 9.8.6R(9).

The Nominations Committee reviews the 
Board Diversity Policy (the ‘Policy’) on an 
annual basis and makes recommendations 
to the Board where it identifies changes 
that can be made to further contribute to 
improving the diversity of the Board and 
Executive Committee.

This year, the Policy was updated to include 
reference to the Board Committees required 
to be considered under the 2018 Code and in 
consideration of how wider diversity 
characteristics can be addressed. The main 
objectives contained in the Policy are set out 
below, alongside an overview of the action 
taken to implement the Policy. The full Policy 
is available on the Severn Trent Plc website.

BOARD POLICY OBJECTIVES

IMPLEMENTATION

PROGRESS MADE

Ensure the Board comprises an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience and knowledge 
required to effectively oversee and support 
the management of the Company.

Annual review of the Board’s composition by 
the Nominations Committee with particular 
consideration being given to the balance of 
skills, experience and independence of the 
Board. The Board Effectiveness evaluation 
specifically considered the composition of the 
Board and the contribution, commitment and 
independence of individual Directors.

Ensure consideration is given to diverse 
candidates for Non-Executive Director 
Board appointments from a wide pool, 
including those with no listed company 
Board experience.

Ensure Board appointment ‘longlists’ include 
candidates with a diversity of social and 
ethnic backgrounds and cognitive and 
personal strengths.

The Board and Nominations Committee 
recognise the importance and benefits of 
greater diversity, including gender diversity, 
social and ethnic background and cognitive 
and personal strengths, throughout the 
organisation, including on the Board itself.

On instruction of an executive search firm, the 
specification will ensure that candidates with 
no listed company Board experience are fully 
considered.

Ensure focus is given to the development of 
a pipeline of diverse, high-calibre candidates 
for Board level roles and report annually on 
the diversity of the Executive pipeline as 
well as the diversity of the Board.

Regular Board and Nominations Committee 
consideration of the importance and benefits 
of greater diversity, including gender diversity, 
social and ethnic background and cognitive and 
personal strengths. This includes 
representation of these cohorts in the Group’s 
talent pipeline and on the Board itself.

At its March 2023 meeting, the Committee 
formally reviewed the composition of the 
Board and the performance, contribution and 
commitment of individual Directors in the 
context of the Board Effectiveness evaluation. 
No concerns were raised in relation to the 
composition of the Board and the balance 
of skills, experience and knowledge on the 
Board as a whole. All Board succession 
discussions took place in consideration of 
the Policy.

Sarah Legg was appointed to the Board as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director on 
1 November 2022. 

Following the end of the financial year, 
Helen Miles was appointed to the Board as 
an Executive Director and the CFO Designate 
on 1 April 2023.

The recommendations in respect of these 
Board appointments were conducted in full 
consideration of the Policy, the 2018 Code 
and additional relevant guidance.

The Committee ensured that Hedley May and 
Spencer Stuart, the executive search firms 
engaged for these appointments, presented 
a diverse potential candidate list, including 
candidates with no listed company 
experience.

At its April 2023 meeting, the Board 
considered diversity and inclusion within the 
Group. The Board committed to building on 
existing graduate, apprentice and leadership 
programmes to embed inclusivity in our 
succession planning and talent development 
work. This included discussion on 
strengthening our talent pipeline, with an 
enhanced focus on ensuring appropriate 
representation from minority ethnic 
candidates, as well as other relevant diverse 
cohorts. This was also an area of specific 
focus within the Board and Executive 
Committee succession planning discussions 
that took place during the year.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT

Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present this report, which aims 
to give shareholders a clear insight into the 
work we have done as a Committee to provide 
challenge and assurance on the integrity of the 
2022/23 Annual Report and Accounts and the 
Group’s regulatory reporting requirements.

The Committee assists the Board by 
establishing, reviewing and monitoring the 
formal and transparent policies and procedures 
to ensure the independence and effectiveness 
of the Internal and External Audit functions, the 
integrity of financial and narrative reporting, the 
Company’s internal control framework and the 
adequacy of the process that enables the Board 
to assess the extent of Principal Risks the 
Company is willing to take to achieve its 
long-term strategic objectives. 

Throughout the year, I maintained regular 
dialogue with other members of the 
Committee, the Chief Financial Officer and 
other members of management, including 
presenters of upcoming agenda items prior 
to meetings, to ensure the Committee was 
provided with the necessary information to 
enable it to guide, challenge and advise and, 
when required, make informed decisions. I 
also met privately with the Head of Internal 
Audit and representatives from the External 
Auditor and External Assurer, both to discuss 
any issues that may have arisen and as part of 
my ongoing assessment of their effectiveness. 

Much of the Committee’s work relates to the 
regulated activities of Severn Trent Water, which 
represent over 91% of Group turnover. The 
Committee’s vital contribution to our Purpose 
of ‘taking care of one of life’s essentials’ ensures 
that the interests of shareholders and other 
stakeholders, particularly our customers and 
regulators, are properly protected, by overseeing 
the Group’s financial reporting and internal 
control arrangements. The Committee uses its 
collective expertise, with input from the External 
Auditor, to provide challenge to the approach and 
judgments made by management in the 
treatment of financial matters and the resulting 
disclosures within the financial statements. 
Transparency and openness are fundamental 
to the relationship between management and 
the Committee, which is further reinforced 
through our culture of Doing the Right Thing.

As such, one of our key roles is to advise the 
Board that we are satisfied that the Annual 
Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 

Company’s position, performance, business 
model and strategy. In doing so, we ensure that 
management’s disclosures reflect the 
supporting detail, or challenge them to explain 
and justify their interpretation and, if necessary, 
re-present the information. The Committee has 
spent considerable time reviewing and 
scrutinising the Group’s financial results, and 
details of the significant issues we considered 
can be found on page 134.

The External Auditor performs its statutory 
audit, by auditing the accounting records of the 
Company against agreed accounting practices, 
relevant laws and regulations. Deloitte’s audit 
report can be found on pages 168 to 175. 

The Financial Reporting Council’s Audit Quality 
Review (‘AQR’) team selected for review the 
audit of the Severn Trent Plc financial 
statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 
as part of its annual inspection of audit firms. 
As Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, I 
received a full copy of the findings of the AQR 
and have discussed these with Deloitte. The 
findings were largely positive, with no 
significant areas for improvement identified 
within the report. The Committee is also 
satisfied that there is nothing within the report 
which might have a bearing on the audit 
appointment. Based on consideration of the 
responses to our internal effectiveness review, 
and taking into account the AQR report, the 
Committee remains satisfied with the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the audit.

We were pleased to advise the Board that the 
2022/23 Annual Report and Accounts are fair, 
balanced and understandable, and that the 
Directors have provided the necessary 
information for our shareholders to assess 
the Company’s position, prospects, business 
model and strategy. Our review process is 
described in further detail on page 131.

During the year, the Committee reviewed and 
agreed with management’s proposal for the 
Company’s long-term Viability Statement to 
continue to cover a seven-year period (see pages 
80 to 83). It was agreed that this was appropriate, 
given the nature of the regulatory framework in 
the water sector and Ofwat’s statutory duty to 
ensure that companies can finance the proper 
carrying out of their functions.

The increasing focus of stakeholders on 
the impact of climate change and other 
environmental issues has become evident in 
the Committee’s workload. The Committee 
plays a key role in the governance of 
environmental and climate-related reporting, 

John Coghlan
Chair

Against the backdrop of upcoming audit 
and corporate governance enhancements, 
the Committee’s contribution to ensuring 
that reporting is fair, balanced and 
understandable is increasingly vital for 
shareholders and other stakeholders who 
want to assess the Company’s performance 
and hold the Board to account.

All members of the Committee are Independent 
Non-Executive Directors of the Board. The Board 
considers that all members of the Committee 
have recent and relevant financial experience and 
competence relevant to the sector, with the Chair 
and the majority of the Committee members being 
qualified accountants. Only members of the 
Committee have the right to attend Committee 
meetings. Other regular attendees at meetings at 
the invitation of the Committee include the Chair 
of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Chief 
Financial Officer (‘CFO’), the Group Company 
Secretary, the Group General Counsel, the Group 
Financial Controller, the Head of Internal Audit, 
other members of senior management, 
representatives from the External Auditor, 
Deloitte, and non-financial regulatory 
performance and data assurers, Jacobs. None of 
these attendees are members of the Committee.

The Committee regularly holds private 
discussions with the Head of Internal Audit and 
the External Auditor separately, without 
management present. The Chair of the Committee 
regularly holds separate one-to-one meetings 
with the CFO, the Head of Internal Audit, the 
External Auditor and with Committee members 
outside of scheduled meetings to better 
understand any issues or areas for concern.

GOVERNANCE REPORTAUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

including overseeing, in conjunction with the 
Corporate Sustainability Committee and 
supported by independent third-line assurance 
by Jacobs, the Group’s Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’). 

The Committee has also spent a considerable 
amount of time reviewing the Group’s risk 
management processes and procedures, with 
good progress made in enhancing their 
effectiveness during the year. You can read more 
about our approach to risk on pages 73 to 74.

You will see that this report contains an overview 
of the Company’s whistleblowing arrangements. 
The Board has previously agreed that the 
responsibility for oversight of whistleblowing 
arrangements should continue to be delegated to 
the Audit and Risk Committee and not be a 
matter reserved solely to the Board. However, 
the Board as a whole monitors and reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s whistleblowing 

arrangements annually, to ensure that it has 
sufficient oversight of whistleblowing to support 
its work on culture, risk and stakeholder 
engagement. The Audit and Risk Committee 
continues to receive reports on investigations 
and all significant whistleblowing matters are 
reported directly to the Board. The Board has 
reviewed these arrangements again this year 
and is satisfied that they are effective, facilitate 
the proportionate and independent investigation 
of reported matters and allow appropriate 
follow-up action to be taken.

The annual Board Effectiveness evaluation, which 
was conducted internally this year, assessed our 
performance as a Committee, and I am pleased 
that this concluded that we operate effectively and 
that the Board takes assurance from the quality of 
our work. The Board is satisfied that the 
Committee members bring a wide range of 
financial experience across various industries and 

all members have competence relevant to our 
sector, with significant recent and relevant 
financial experience. Further information about 
each Committee member is contained in their 
individual biographies, which can be found on 
pages 104 to 105.

I would like to thank the members of the 
Committee, the management team, Internal 
Audit, Deloitte and Jacobs for their continued 
commitment throughout the year, for the open 
discussions that take place at our meetings, and 
for the contribution they all provide in support 
of our work.

KEY AREAS 
OF FOCUS IN 2022/23

The Committee has an extensive  
agenda focusing on the audit, risk and 
assurance processes within the business 
which it deals with in conjunction with 
management, the External Auditor, Internal 
Audit and the Finance and Regulatory 
Compliance and Assurance teams.

Internal Audit and assurance
 – Considered Internal Audit reports 

presented to the Committee and satisfied 
itself that management had resolved or 
was in the process of resolving any 
outstanding issues or actions.

 – Reviewed and approved the Internal Audit 

plan and approach for 2023/24.

 – Reviewed the quality and effectiveness  
of Internal Audit and the effectiveness of 
the current co-source arrangements.
 – Considered the findings of the assurance 

that had been undertaken as part of 
regulatory submissions for the Drainage 
and Wastewater Management Plan, Water 
Resources Management Plan, Water 
Industry National Environment Programme 
and Strategic Resource Options.

 – Reviewed the detailed assurance plan and 
approach for the Severn Trent Water PR24 
submission. 

Internal controls and risk 
management
 – Reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 

ERM processes and procedures and internal 
control systems, and integration of the 
components of the risk framework into 
Board and Committee reporting, prior to 
making a recommendation to the Board.
 – Received updates on legal, regulatory and 

ethical matters, and monitored fraud 
reporting and incidents of whistleblowing, 
including a review of the adequacy of the 
Group’s whistleblowing processes and 
procedures, prior to reporting to the Board 
on this activity.

 – Oversaw and monitored the Group’s 

compliance with the Bribery Act 2010, 
including a review of the adequacy of the 
anti-bribery, corruption and fraud processes 
and procedures (and associated policies).

External Audit
 – Managed the relationship for the 2022/23 

statutory audit, including the key audit risks 
and level of materiality applied by Deloitte, 
audit reports from Deloitte on the financial 
statements and the areas of particular 
focus for the 2022/23 audit.

 – Considered the outcome of the FRC’s Audit 
Quality Review of Deloitte’s audit of the 
Company’s 2021/22 financial statements.
 – Assessed the effectiveness of the External 
Auditor and made a recommendation to the 
Board on the reappointment of Deloitte as 
the External Auditor.

 – Agreed the statutory audit fee for the year 

ended 31 March 2023.

 – Reviewed and approved the non-audit 

services, provided by the External Auditor 
and related fees for 2022/23. 

Financial and regulatory reporting
 – Reviewed and discussed reports from the 
Chief Financial Officer on the financial 
statements, considered management’s 
significant accounting judgments and the 
policies being applied, and assessed the 
findings of the statutory audit in respect of 
the integrity of the financial reporting of full 
and half-year results.

 – Reviewed the integrity of the regulatory 
reporting process relating to the Annual 
Performance Report, and other regulatory 
submissions, for Severn Trent Water as 
required to be submitted to Ofwat.

 – Reviewed the 2022/23 Annual Report and 

Accounts, and provided a recommendation 
to the Board that, as a whole, they complied 
with the 2018 Code principle to be ‘fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy’.
 – Challenged and scrutinised management’s 

detailed assessment of the Group’s 
long-term viability and its ability to 
continue as a going concern. In doing so, 
the Committee took into account the risks 
facing the business, and its ability to 
withstand a number of severe but 
plausible scenarios. Having considered 
management’s assessment, the 
Committee recommended to the Board the 
long-term Viability Statement set out on 
pages 80 to 83.

 – Considered the Company’s proposals 

to address the response to the 
Government’s call to strengthen the audit, 
corporate reporting and corporate 
governance regime in the United Kingdom. 
Read more on page 129.

The Committee also reviewed and approved the Committee’s Terms of Reference, prior to making a recommendation to the Board. In 
completing its review, the Committee concluded that the Terms of Reference remained appropriate and reflected the manner in which the 
Committee was discharging its duties.

The Committee is authorised to seek external legal or other independent professional advice as it sees fit but did not need to do so during the year.

SPOTLIGHT ON 
CORPORATE REFORM

The quality and accuracy of reported 
information has always been a key focus of 
the Committee’s work. As such, the 
Committee welcomed the response from the 
Department of Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy (‘BEIS’) on proposals to 
strengthen the UK’s audit, corporate 
reporting and corporate governance 
systems, which was published during the 
year. Whilst the timelines and final 
conclusions of the reforms are uncertain, the 
Committee requested from management a 

summary of the measures that the Financial 
Reporting Council (‘FRC’) and the Audit 
Reporting and Governance Authority (‘ARGA’, 
the successor to the FRC) intend to progress, 
an initial assessment of how the changes 
could impact the Group and any proactive 
action that could be taken in the interim 
period ahead of formal legislation being 
passed.

and internal control system in relation to 
financial reporting was strong and, as a 
result, many of the proposed reforms were 
expected to be implemented efficiently and 
effectively. A number of action points were 
considered by the Committee for the short to 
medium term, whilst clarity was awaited on 
potential amendments to the 2018 Code and 
the enactment of relevant legislation. 

The review undertaken by the Finance and 
Company Secretariat teams concluded that 
the Group’s existing governance framework 

A summary of the Committee’s 
considerations is set out below.

PUBLICATION OF AN AUDIT AND 
ASSURANCE POLICY EVERY THREE YEARS 
AND AN IMPLEMENTATION  
REPORT ANNUALLY

By virtue of the Group’s existing regulatory requirements, a robust audit and assurance 
framework and system are already in place. Details of our current audit and assurance 
framework and systems are reported externally through the Annual Report and Annual 
Performance Report. We welcome further guidance and look forward to publishing our 
Audit and Assurance Policy in due course.

STRENGTHENING OF INTERNAL CONTROL 
PROVISIONS IN THE 2018 CODE

The Committee oversees the annual review of the Group’s systems, processes and 
procedures in order to provide assurance to the Board that the Group’s internal control 
systems continue to operate effectively. As such, the Committee noted that there will be 
future changes to the 2018 Code which will require a formal statement regarding the 
effectiveness of controls and the basis of the assessment that has been completed. The 
Group will continue to review any proposed changes in relation to internal control to ensure 
compliance to future changes.

PROVISION OF A RESILIENCE STATEMENT 
TO REPORT ON MATTERS THAT THE 
COMPANY CONSIDERS WILL RESULT IN A 
MATERIAL CHALLENGE TO ITS RESILIENCE 
OVER THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM

Given the existing risk, going concern and viability requirements and disclosures, the Group 
is well positioned to address developments relating to the introduction of a formal 
Resilience Statement. The Group will continue to comply with current requirements and 
will review any amendments to legislation and the 2018 Code to ensure readiness ahead of 
changes coming into effect.

REQUIREMENT FOR DIRECTORS TO MAKE 
A STATEMENT ON STEPS THE COMPANY 
HAS TAKEN TO PREVENT AND DETECT 
MATERIAL FRAUD

To ensure the Group has an appropriate and effective fraud risk management framework in 
place, during the year an initial review of our existing framework was undertaken. As a 
result of the review, minor amendments have been implemented, including training staff to 
recognise common forms of bribery and corruption, and ensuring Group Authorisation 
Arrangements remain appropriate. 

DISCLOSURE AND AUDIT OF 
DISTRIBUTABLE RESERVES

INCREASED TRANSPARENCY OVER 
EXECUTIVE PAY

We currently disclose the amount of reserves that are distributable and we publish the 
Group’s approved Dividend Policy. Once further guidance has been made available, a review 
of the reporting requirements will be undertaken and any additional detail relating to 
dividends and capital maintenance will be included to ensure compliance.

The Government has proposed changes to the provisions of the 2018 Code, including greater 
transparency of the conditions under which Executive pay can be withheld or recovered and 
provisions in relation to minimum malus and clawback conditions which should be applied 
by remuneration committees. Once guidance has been published, a review of the updated 
requirements will be undertaken and the Committee will work alongside the Remuneration 
Committee to ensure the necessary disclosures are made.

ENGAGEMENT OF SMALLER CHALLENGER 
AUDIT FIRMS TO CONDUCT A MEANINGFUL 
PORTION OF SUBSIDIARY AUDITS

We await further guidance on the definition of a ‘meaningful portion’. Once the guidance is 
available, an assessment will be undertaken to consider how the appointment of a 
challenger audit firm could be implemented and how this might impact our next external 
audit tender process, which we anticipate will be conducted no later than 31 March 2024.

GOVERNANCE REPORTAUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

INTERNAL AUDIT

Internal Audit is an independent assurance function available to the Board, Audit and Risk Committee and all levels of management, and is a 
key element of the Group’s corporate governance framework.

Support is provided by four main co-sourcing partners: PwC, EY, KPMG and BDO. Co-source arrangements are reviewed annually and we 
believe this structure adds value, through greater access to specific areas of expertise, increased ability to flex resources, and the ability to 
challenge management independently. Co-source specialists continue to bring expertise to support the team and delivery of the audit plan 
where relevant.

INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN AND ACTIONS

The role of Internal Audit is to provide independent and objective 
assurance that the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems are well designed and operate effectively, and that any 
corrective action is taken in a timely manner.

A three-year strategic audit planning approach is applied, from which 
Internal Audit develops an annual risk-based audit plan; this 
facilitates an efficient deployment of resource in providing assurance 
coverage over time across the whole business. The Committee’s role 
is to review and challenge the plan, specifically whether the key risk 
areas identified as part of our ERM process are being audited with 
appropriate frequency and depth. Individual Committee members 
also bring an external view of risks the Company may be exposed to. 
Once approved by the Committee, regular reporting enables the 
Committee to monitor delivery of the audit plan and ensure that 
Internal Audit performs its work in accordance with the mandatory 
aspects of the International Professional Practice Framework of the 
Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (the ‘CIIA’), with integrity 

(honestly, diligently and responsibly) and objectively (without conflicts 
of interest).

Following the completion of each planned audit, Internal Audit seeks 
feedback from management and reports to the Committee on the 
findings of the audit, including any action that may be required. Where 
any failings or weaknesses are identified in the course of the review 
of internal control systems, management puts in place robust actions 
to address these on a timely basis. No material weaknesses were 
identified during the year. Action closure is reported to, and 
monitored by, the Committee and we are pleased to confirm that our 
review established that management places a strong focus on closing 
audit actions and ensuring timely completion.

The Internal Audit function also liaises with the External Auditor, 
discussing relevant aspects of their respective activities which 
ultimately supports the assurance provided to the Committee 
and Board.

EFFECTIVENESS

We undertake an annual review of the effectiveness of the Internal 
Audit function in line with the CIIA Internal Audit Code of Practice and 
the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees. The CIIA guidance states that 
Audit Committees should obtain an independent and objective external 
quality assessment at least every five years. However, we consider it 
prudent to carry out external effectiveness reviews every three years. 
The last external review of the effectiveness of the Internal Audit 
function was undertaken in December 2021. The review was carried out 
by BDO, which concluded that the Internal Audit function remained fit 
for purpose, was operating efficiently and effectively, and in line with 
good practice. 

BDO’s findings also highlighted clear evidence that the Internal Audit 
function operated with strategic alignment, a focus on risk and an 
emphasis on quality and continuous improvement, all underpinned 
by objectivity and integrity. The minor areas of improvement raised 
by BDO have been incorporated into an action plan which was shared 
and agreed with the Chair of the Committee. All actions were 
completed in line with the proposed timescales.

Taking all these elements into account, the Committee concluded that 
the Internal Audit function was an effective provider of assurance 
over the Group’s risks and controls, and appropriate resources were 
available as required.

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The 2018 Code sets out requirements in relation to companies’ internal controls and risk management and, as such, throughout the year, 
the Committee receives and reviews regular management reports and updates in relation to internal controls and risk management 
to assure itself that the processes in place remain effective.

INTERNAL CONTROLS

An internal control system can provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss, as it is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives. The Committee reviews the Group’s internal control 
systems and receives updates on the findings of Internal Audit’s 
investigations at every meeting, prior to reporting any significant 
matters to the Board, which retains overall responsibility for the 
effectiveness of the full suite of internal controls across the Group.

As set out on page 130, the Audit and Risk Committee has oversight of 
the Group’s preparations to enact early recommendations that have 
arisen from the BEIS consultation on ‘Restoring trust in audit and 
corporate governance’. We are fully committed to ensuring that the 
Group’s audit and governance arrangements reflect best practice and 
address any new requirements within the expected timeframes.

As part of this, during the year a detailed review of the Group’s 
systems, processes and procedures was undertaken by the 
Committee in order to provide assurance to the Board that the 
Group’s internal control systems, including those which cover 
financial reporting, continue to operate effectively.

Further to the reports received by the Committee, which set out 
the Group’s processes, systems and assurance procedures, the 
Committee has concluded that it has complied with its obligations 
under the 2018 Code in relation to the assessment of risk and the 
monitoring and review of the effectiveness of internal controls and 
risk management. The Committee is pleased to confirm that it was 
able to provide the Board with assurance that the Group’s internal 
control systems and risk management procedures are effective, 
efficient and operating as required.

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group has an ERM process in place through which our Principal 
Risks and related controls are identified and assessed. The Board has 
overall responsibility for setting the Group’s risk appetite and ensuring 
that there is an effective risk management framework in place, and has 
delegated responsibility for review of the risk management methodology 
and effectiveness of internal controls to the Audit and Risk Committee. 
The Committee reviews the processes for, and outputs from, the Group’s 
ERM activity, through which our Principal Risks and related controls are 
identified. It also reviews the effectiveness of the risk management 
system on behalf of the Board and keeps under review ways in which the 
control and assurance arrangements can be enhanced. The Audit and 
Risk Committee is complemented by a Strategic Risk Forum which 
assists the Committee in reviewing the risk management system, 
internal controls that mitigate risks and undertaking reviews of 
assurance risk reports prior to Audit and Risk Committee meetings. 
The Central ERM Team also undertook a review of the integration of the 
components of the risk framework into Board and Committee reporting, 
prior to making a recommendation to the Board. 

This year, the Committee spent a considerable amount of time 
reviewing the Group’s ERM processes and procedures, with good 
progress made in enhancing its effectiveness during the year. The 
Committee also reviewed the Group’s Risk Appetite Statement and 
recommended this for consideration and approval by the Board. You 
can read more about this important work on pages 73 to 74.

The Committee received half-yearly reports from the Head of Risk, 
detailing the significant risks and uncertainties faced by the Group. 
Each risk submitted for review includes an assessment of the overall 
risk status, status of the control environment and a summary of the 
risk mitigation plan to take the risk to the target risk position, which 
needs to be in line with the risk appetite. The risk mitigation plan 
covers action plans to improve controls where this has been assessed 
as necessary and assesses whether actions are on target, with the 
correct prioritisation in place. Further details of the Group’s risk 
management systems and controls and Principal Risks can be found 
in the Strategic Report on pages 73 to 79.

WHISTLEBLOWING

The Group has established procedures by which all employees may, in 
confidence, report any concerns. Our Whistleblowing Policy, ‘Speak 
Up’, sets out the ethical standards expected of everyone that works 
for, and with, us and includes the procedure for raising concerns in 
strict confidence. Our workforce can raise concerns through their line 
manager, senior management and through our confidential and 
independent whistleblowing helpline and online channel, ‘Safecall’. 
All investigations are carried out independently with findings being 
reported directly to the Audit and Risk Committee.

The Board as a whole monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s whistleblowing arrangements annually, to ensure that it has 

sufficient oversight of whistleblowing to support its work on 
assessing culture, risk and stakeholder engagement. The Audit and 
Risk Committee receives reports on investigations and all significant 
whistleblowing matters are reported directly to the Board. The Board 
also receives regular updates from the Committee and the Board 
completes an assessment of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
whistleblowing procedures. The Board has reviewed these 
arrangements again this year and is satisfied that they are effective, 
facilitate the proportionate and independent investigation of reported 
matters and allow appropriate follow-up action to be taken.

FAIR, BALANCED AND 
UNDERSTANDABLE 
REPORTING
At the request of the Board,  
the Committee has considered 
whether, in its opinion, this  
Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is ‘fair, balanced 
and understandable’ (‘FBU’) and 
whether it provides  
the ‘information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy’.

The following process was 
followed by the Committee in 
making its assessment.

1

REGULAR DISCLOSURE  
COMMITTEE REVIEW

The Disclosure Committee reviewed the Annual 
Report and Accounts throughout the drafting process 
and undertook a detailed FBU assessment ahead of 
tabling a detailed report to the Audit and Risk 
Committee.

2

REGULAR AUDIT AND RISK  
COMMITTEE REVIEW

The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the Annual 
Report and Accounts at an early stage, and 
throughout the drafting process, to enable sufficient 
time for review and comment, and to ensure overall 
balance and consistency between the narrative 
sections and the financial statements.

The Audit and Risk Committee was supported in its 
review by the Disclosure Committee, whose 
appraisal of the Annual Report and Accounts is 
undertaken by members of the Executive Team who 
are not directly involved in drafting any content.

3

INTERNAL AUDIT VERIFICATION 
AND OVERSIGHT

Internal Audit reviewed the Annual Report and 
Accounts, and oversaw the verification process for 
all factual content and reported back to the Audit and 
Risk Committee on its assessment findings.

4

FBU ASSESSMENT

The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed and 
approved the process in place to support the FBU 
assessment and reviewed the findings of this 
process. The Audit and Risk Committee was satisfied 
that all the key events and issues reported to the 
Board by management (both positive and negative) 
had been adequately referenced or reflected within  
the Annual Report and Accounts.

5

EXTERNAL AUDITOR REVIEW

The External Auditor is required to consider whether 
there are any material inconsistencies between 
information presented in different sections of the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taking into account the 
Auditor’s knowledge obtained during the audit and 
the Auditor’s understanding of the legal and 
regulatory requirements applicable to the narrative. 

The External Auditor presented the results of its 
audit work. The significant issues the Audit and Risk 
Committee considered were consistent with those 
identified by the External Auditor in its report (see 
pages 168 to 175 for more detail).

6

RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD

The Board approved the Audit and Risk Committee’s 
recommendations that the FBU statement could be 
made in the Annual Report and Accounts. A 
declaration to this effect is included within the 
Directors’ Responsibility Statement on page 167.

GOVERNANCE REPORTAUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

EXTERNAL AUDITOR

The Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with the External Auditor, including assessing its performance, 
effectiveness and independence annually, and making a recommendation to the Board in respect of its reappointment or removal.

TENDER AND APPOINTMENT

Following a formal tender process in 2015/16, Deloitte LLP was 
reappointed as External Auditor at the 2016 AGM. Following the rule 
that the audit engagement partner must change every five years, 
Jacqueline Holden became the senior statutory auditor and has 
overseen the audit of the Severn Trent Group since 2020/21. Other 
senior audit staff also rotate at regular intervals.

The Committee anticipates that the next competitive tender will be 
conducted no later than 31 March 2024, in accordance with current 
regulation that requires a tender every ten years. Deloitte will not be 
able to participate due to mandatory rotation requirements.

EFFECTIVENESS AND COMPETENCE

The Committee considers audit quality to be the principal 
requirement of the annual audit process and, as such, a full 
effectiveness review is conducted annually. This year, it involved 
assessment of the External Auditor by the Committee, key Executives 
and relevant senior management, including an evaluation of whether 
the External Auditor met the minimum standards of qualification, 
independence, expertise, effectiveness and communication. All 
members of the Committee, as well as key members of management 
and those who have regular contact with the External Auditor, 
completed a feedback questionnaire focusing on the following areas:

 – Robustness of the external audit process, ‘professional scepticism’ 

of the External Auditor and degree of challenge to matters of 
significant audit risk and areas of management subjectivity.

 – Appropriateness of the scope of the audit and the planning process 

for the delivery of an effective and efficient audit.

 – Quality of the delivery of the audit, the service provided by the 
External Auditor and its knowledge and understanding of the 
Group’s business.

INDEPENDENCE

The Committee regards independence of the External Auditor as 
absolutely crucial in safeguarding the integrity of the audit process 
and takes responsibility for ensuring the three-way relationship 
between the Committee, the External Auditor and management 
remains appropriate.

The Committee recognises that independence is also a key focus for 
the External Auditor, and Deloitte has confirmed that it has complied 
with its own ethics and independence policies, which are consistent 
with the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard (2019). This includes the 
External Auditor’s assurances that all of its partners and staff 
involved with the audit are independent of any links to the Group and 
that none of its employees working on our audit hold any shares in 
Severn Trent Plc. 

The proposed tender date is in the best interests of shareholders and 
the Company as Deloitte has a detailed knowledge of our business, an 
understanding of our industry and continues to demonstrate that it 
has the necessary expertise and capability to undertake the audit.

The Company has complied with the provisions of the Competition and 
Markets Authority’s Order for the financial year under review in 
respect to audit tendering and the provision of non-audit services.

 – Expertise of the audit team conducting the audit.
 – Independence applied by the External Auditor and that policies and 

procedures were consistently applied.

 – Views on the quality of the interaction between the audit partner 

and senior members of the audit team and the Company.

 – Whether the statutory audit contributed to the integrity of the 

Group’s financial reporting.

Feedback was collated and presented to the Committee in March 
2023, without the External Auditor present. The Committee discussed 
the conclusions and any opportunities for improvement, which were 
brought to the attention of the External Auditor. The Committee also 
considered the outcome of the FRC’s Audit Quality Review into the 
External Auditor’s audit of Severn Trent Plc’s financial statements for 
the year ended 31 March 2022. No significant issues were reported as 
part of either the internal or external review processes, and it was 
concluded that the external audit process and services provided by 
Deloitte were satisfactory and effective.

Deloitte provides confirmation of independence during the planning 
stage of the audit, disclosing matters relating to its independence and 
objectivity. There were no independence issues raised in respect of 
the 2022/23 audit.

The Committee also develops and recommends to the Board the 
Group’s policy on non-audit services and associated fees paid to 
Deloitte, to ensure the External Auditor is not providing any additional 
services which could impede its independence. You can read more 
on this policy on page 133.

STATUTORY AUDITOR REAPPOINTMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 MARCH 2024

The Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP be proposed for reappointment for the year ending 31 March 2024 at the 
forthcoming AGM on 6 July 2023. There are no contractual obligations that restrict the Committee’s choice of auditor; the recommendation is 
free from third party influence and no auditor liability agreement has been entered into.

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

NON-AUDIT SERVICES

To preserve objectivity and independence, the External Auditor is not 
asked to provide other services unless it is in the best interests of the 
Company that these are provided by Deloitte rather than another 
supplier, in accordance with our Non-Audit Services Policy (the 
‘Policy’).

We reviewed and updated the Policy during 2019/20 to reflect the 
FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard and the more restrictive list of 
services that are now permitted, and the Policy was subject to a 
further review during the year. The Policy requires Committee 
approval for all such non-audit services. The Policy also prohibits 
aggregate fees for non-audit services in excess of 70% of the 
average audit fee for the previous three financial years. Non-audit 
services for which the External Auditor may be used include 
audit-related services required by statute or regulation and other 
audit or assurance services as set out in the Ethical Standard.

During the year, Deloitte received £1.3 million in fees for work relating 
to the audit services it provides to the Group. Non-audit-related work 
undertaken by Deloitte amounted to fees of £0.3 million this year, 

which is 23.1% of the total audit fees paid to it (as shown in the chart 
below). The more significant non-audit services provided by Deloitte 
were the audits of the financial information contained within the 
Severn Trent Water and Hafren Dyfrdwy Annual Performance 
Reports and the independent review of the Company’s half-yearly 
financial report. 

Audit and non-audit fees paid to Deloitte are set out in note 7 to the 
financial statements on page 192. In approving these non-audit fees, 
we considered the overall ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees and, 
given the scope of work, considered that Deloitte was best placed to 
perform these services. Where Deloitte was chosen, this was as a 
result of its detailed knowledge of our business and understanding 
of our industry, as well as demonstrating that it had the necessary 
expertise and capability to undertake the work cost effectively whilst 
maintaining its objectivity and independence.

Details of audit and non-audit fees and the significant non-audit work 
undertaken during the year are set out below.

GOVERNANCE REPORTAUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED AND ADDRESSED IN RELATION TO THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Committee looked carefully at those 
aspects of the financial statements that 
required significant accounting judgments or 
where there is estimation uncertainty. These 
areas are explained in note 4 to the Group 
financial statements. The Committee also 
considered the accounting treatment for 
revenue and accrued income. It received 

detailed reports from both the CFO and the 
External Auditor on these areas and on any 
other matters which they believed should be 
drawn to the Committee’s attention.

The draft External Auditor’s report on the 
financial statements was also reviewed, with 
particular reference to those matters reported 
as carrying risks of material misstatement.

The Committee discussed the range of 
possible treatments both with management 
and with the External Auditor, confirming that 
the judgments made by management were 
robust and supportable. For all the matters 
described below, the Committee concluded 
that the treatment adopted in the Group 
financial statements was appropriate.

SIGNIFICANT ISSUE

HOW THE ISSUE WAS ADDRESSED BY THE COMMITTEE

GOING CONCERN BASIS FOR THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS AND LONG-TERM VIABILITY STATEMENT

DETERMINATION OF THE PROVISION FOR 
IMPAIRMENT OF TRADE RECEIVABLES IN 
SEVERN TRENT WATER LIMITED

At 31 March 2023, the provision in the Group’s financial 
statements was £135.1 million and the charge for the 
year was £24.5 million. Severn Trent Water Limited has a 
statutory obligation to continue to supply water and waste 
water services to customers even when their bills are 
unpaid. This increases the risk of bad debts. In addition, 
it has a large and diverse customer base which requires 
impairments against trade receivables to be assessed 
on a systematic basis.

The Committee reviewed and challenged the evidence and assumptions underpinning 
the use of the going concern assumption in preparing the accounts and in making the 
statements in the Strategic Report on going concern and long-term viability.

In particular, the Committee considered severe but plausible scenarios modelled in 
relation to the Company’s Principal Risks, noting the stress tests performed by 
management and the potential mitigating actions identified.

Our Business Model can be found on pages 4 to 5. Principal Risks and uncertainties 
can be found on pages 75 to 78. The Viability Statement can be found on pages 80 to 83 
and the Going Concern Statement on page 83.

The Committee challenged management’s assumptions regarding historical cash 
collection and the impact of the cost of living pressures on Severn Trent Water’s 
customers on the expected credit losses for trade receivables existing at 31 March 
2023, noting the independent forecasts of the likely economic impacts and the recent 
evidence of a link between macroeconomic conditions and the Group’s bad debt 
experience.

The Committee considered the work performed by the External Auditor and the 
conclusions they reached regarding the adequacy of the provision.

The Committee determined that no adjustment to the amounts recorded was required.

THE PROPOSED CLASSIFICATION OF COSTS 
BETWEEN OPERATING EXPENDITURE AND CAPITAL 
EXPENDITURE IN SEVERN TRENT WATER LIMITED

The Committee considered the application of the Group’s accounting policies in 
relation to capital expenditure during the year. The Committee enquired of 
management whether the policies had been applied consistently from year to year.

Severn Trent Water Limited has a significant capital 
programme that includes projects made up of 
combinations of expenditure and activities, some of which 
are recognised as property, plant and equipment and 
some of which are recognised as operating costs. For 
most of the expenditure this distinction is clear but there 
is an element where subjective judgments are required to 
determine the appropriate accounting treatment.

DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE GROUP’S 
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

At 31 March 2023, net retirement benefit obligations 
amounting to £279.4 million were recognised. The net 
obligation recognised on the balance sheet is the difference 
between the fair value of the schemes’ assets at the balance 
sheet date and the present value of the benefits expected 
to be paid to members of the schemes. This requires 
assumptions to be made for the expected age of retirement 
and longevity of members, future inflation rates and 
increases to benefits.

It is also necessary to determine an appropriate discount 
rate to calculate the present value of the estimated 
gross obligations. 

Management takes advice from external qualified actuaries 
who perform the calculation of the present value of the 
benefits based on the assumptions set by management.

The Committee considered the results of the External Auditor’s work and discussed 
the conclusions with the External Auditor.

The Committee determined that no adjustment to the amounts recorded was required.

The Committee scrutinised the assumptions underlying the valuation of the obligations 
and obtained explanations for the significant reduction in the deficit recorded. The 
Committee considered whether the assumptions, taken as a whole, were appropriate, 
taking into account the work of the External Auditor and the benchmark information 
provided. The Committee also scrutinised the methodologies applied in assessing the fair 
values of the schemes’ assets and considered the estimation techniques used for assets 
for which an up-to-date valuation was not available.

The Committee considered that the assumptions and methodologies were reasonable, 
and that no adjustment was required to the draft Group financial statements.

The Committee further considered the accounting treatment for the bulk annuity 
buy-in for the Dee Valley Water Section of the Water Companies Pension Scheme and, 
in particular, management’s conclusion that this transaction did not represent a 
settlement under IAS 19. The Committee noted that the Group retained the legal 
obligation to pay the member benefits as they fall due and discussed this conclusion 
with the External Auditor.

The Committee determined that no adjustment to the amounts recorded was required.

TREASURY COMMITTEE REPORT

Dear Shareholder 
I am delighted to introduce my first report as 
Chair of the Treasury Committee and would 
like to convey my thanks to John Coghlan for 
his leadership of the Committee over the 
previous seven years and for the significant 
time he has invested in ensuring a smooth and 
effective handover to me.

The Committee continues to oversee the Group’s 
funding requirements and financing risks and 
opportunities and, in doing so, assists the Board 
in the effective discharge of its responsibilities 
in relation to treasury management. 

The Committee plays a key role in ensuring that 
the Group remains in a strong financing position 
and, in recognition of the importance of its work, 
feedback from the 2021/22 Board evaluation led 
to a dedicated ‘teach-in’ session on Treasury 
matters being held during the year for Directors 
who were not members of the Committee.

Future funding is an important part of the 
normal business planning process and the 
Committee provides regular updates to the 
Board in respect of funding, solvency and 
liquidity matters so that the Group can respond 
quickly to any opportunities.

This year the Committee spent a large amount 
of time considering the impact of the external 
economic environment on the Group, including 
the growing cost of energy, the impacts of the 
rise in interest rates and increasing inflation, and 
the ongoing effects of geopolitical events. The 
Committee also continually reviews financial 
counterparty risk. Against this tumultuous 
backdrop and resulting uncertainty, it was 
crucial that the Group continued to develop and 
maintain a diverse range of funding sources and 
access to a range of global debt markets.

During the year, the Group refinanced £979 million 
of its debt and issued £1,351 million of new debt. 
The Treasury Team has been active in diversifying 
its sources of funds, promoting the Group in new 
global markets. This comprehensive activity 
ensured that the Group remained in a strong 
liquidity position and in compliance with its 
Liquidity Policy. At the balance sheet date, the 
Group had sufficient liquidity to meet its forecast 
cash flow requirements in line with the Group’s 
treasury policies.

Of the total debt raised, Severn Trent Water issued 
a further £600 million under the European Medium 
Term Note Programme, providing cost-effective 
liquidity, whilst continuing to maintain diversity in 
the Company’s sources of funding. This comprised 
a £400 million sustainable GBP fixed-rate bond and 
£100 million CPIH debt issue, which provides a 
hedge against the Company’s index-linked 
revenues and Regulatory Capital Growth (‘RCV’), 

and fixed-rate Private Placements totalling 
£100 million. In addition, Severn Trent Water raised 
a further £350 million through bank loans and 
£200 million from US Private Placements.

In common with many other companies, we closely 
monitored the volatile energy market during the 
year and the effect that the rapid rise of energy 
costs was having on inflation. The Group’s Hedging 
Policy was reviewed to ensure it remained 
appropriate in consideration of market volatility 
being observed. In line with its Terms of Reference, 
the Committee proposed to the Board that 
amendments were made to the Group Authorisation 
Arrangements to enable management to act swiftly 
in relation to future hedging opportunities.

Sustainable finance remained a core element of the 
Group’s funding strategy and an updated 
Sustainable Finance Framework was published in 
July 2022. The Group closely monitors developments 
in sustainable finance through its Sustainable 
Finance Committee, which reports to the Treasury 
Committee on at least an annual basis.

During the year the Dee Valley Pension Scheme 
completed a bulk annuity buy in with Just 
Retirement Limited, effectively de-risking the 
scheme from future interest rate, inflation and 
longevity risk. The UK Gilt market also saw 
unprecedented volatility, which affected many 
pension schemes. The Treasury Team, with the 
oversight of the Treasury Committee, worked 
closely with the Trustee of the Severn Trent 
Pension Scheme to review its risk management 
controls and procedures and ensure continued 
liquidity throughout the market volatility.

The annual Board Effectiveness evaluation, which 
was conducted internally this year, assessed our 
performance as a Committee and I am pleased that 
this concluded that we operate effectively and that 
the Board takes assurance from the quality of our 
work. The Board is satisfied that the Committee 
members bring a wide range of financial experience 
across various industries and all members have 
competence relevant to our sector, with significant 
recent and relevant financial experience. Further 
information about each Committee member is 
contained in their individual biographies, which 
can be found on pages 104 to 105.

I would like to thank the members of the Committee, 
the management team and our debt advisers, 
Rothschild & Co, for their continued commitment 
throughout the year, for the open discussions that 
take place at our meetings, and for the contribution 
they all provide in support of our work.

GOVERNANCE REPORTTREASURY COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

KEY AREAS 
OF FOCUS IN 2022/23

The Committee provides Board 
oversight of the Group’s key financing 
risks and opportunities.

 – Execution of the Group’s financing 
plan and evaluation of funding 
opportunities, in consideration of the 
external operating environment, 
including entering new financial 
markets.

 – Consideration of the Group’s Liquidity 

Policy and confirmation that a 
15-month Policy remained 
appropriate.

 – Review of the Group’s treasury 

policies in relation to hedging of 
market risks (including energy, 
interest rates, inflation and currency), 
and financial counterparty credit risk 
and credit ratings.

 – Annual update of the Group’s 
European Medium Term Note 
Programme and approval for bonds 
to be issued pursuant to that 
Programme during the year, including 
a £400 million Sterling Bond 
completed in November 2022.

 – Review of the Group’s Sustainable 

Finance Framework and associated 
governance.

 – Regular review of the Group’s Funding 

Strategy, including interest rate 
strategy to support the Group in 
consistently outperforming the cost 
of debt allowance.

The Committee also reviewed and 
approved its Terms of Reference, prior to 
making a recommendation to the Board. 
In completing its review, the Committee 
concluded that the Terms of Reference 
remained appropriate and reflected the 
manner in which the Committee was 
discharging its duties.

The Committee is authorised to seek 
external legal or other independent 
professional advice as it sees fit but 
did not need to do so during the year.

Sustainable Finance Framework
Our financing strategy recognises that a strong 
liquidity position and the availability of 
committed funding are essential to meeting 
the Group’s objectives and obligations. It is 
also imperative that we achieve these aims in 
a responsible and sustainable way.

The Sustainable Finance Framework (the 
‘Framework’) was first established in 2019 to 
enable Severn Trent Plc and its subsidiaries 
to raise debt in support of the financing and/or 
refinancing of assets and expenditure of a 
sustainable nature across the Group’s 
activities. The Framework was updated 
during the year to align to the latest market 
standards.

Under the Framework, we report on a range 
of environmental and social impacts resulting 
from the investments and the eligible projects 
funded by the proceeds. To date, around 
£3 billion of finance has been raised under 
the Framework and these proceeds have 
been allocated to the areas listed below.

Environmental:
 – Generating energy from renewable sources 

for use on site.

 – Reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

 – Reducing leakage.

 – Increasing biodiversity by planting trees 
and ensuring sustainable land and water 
resources management practices.

 – Improving the quality of our rivers in the 

Severn Trent region.

Social:
 – Supporting vulnerable customers 

struggling to pay their bills.

 – Providing free employability training 
under our Employability Scheme.

More information on how proceeds from 
the Framework have been used to progress 
our eligible projects can be found in the 
dedicated Allocation Reports on our website. 

We are committed to applying the most 
up-to-date standards and methodologies to 
measure and report on the impact of future 
issuances. All reporting under the Framework 
is available to investors via our website in line 
with the reporting requirements.

Ahead of the updated Framework being 
published, independent assessors, DNV, 
provided a Second Party Opinion on the 
accuracy and integrity of the Framework to 
give investors confidence that the Framework 
was aligned to accepted market principles. A 
copy of DNV’s opinion confirming the 
Framework’s compliance with the required 
standards and protocols can also be found on 
our website.

CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE REPORT

Dear Shareholder 
I am delighted to introduce my second report 
as Chair of the Corporate Sustainability 
Committee. The following pages describe the 
activities of the Committee and provide an 
overview of the topics addressed during 
the year.

The Corporate Sustainability Committee has a 
key role in supporting the Board by providing 
guidance and direction on the Company’s 
sustainability ambitions. The Committee 
provides Board oversight for elements of the 
Group’s Strategy that relate to the environment 
and also social and economic priorities in 
accordance with the Company’s Sustainability 
Framework, ensuring the Company can 
demonstrate that it lives through its Purpose 
and Values, and acts responsibly in its 
engagement with all stakeholders.

Sitting alongside me on the Committee are 
Christine Hodgson, Sharmila Nebhrajani and 
Sarah Legg, and Liv Garfield attends each 
meeting, with an open invitation, to bring the 
benefit of her expertise in sustainability 
matters. Our collective experience and 
capability lead to insightful and passionate 
debate around a wide range of existing and 
emerging sustainability topics. The 
Committee’s discussion is then presented to 
the Board at the beginning of every meeting to 
ensure that its oversight of Environmental, 
Social and Governance (‘ESG’) matters 
remains strategic, current and effective. 

I would like to extend a personal welcome 
to Sarah Legg, who joined the Board as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director from 
1 November 2022 and as a member of the 
Corporate Sustainability Committee. In 
addition to a strong financial background, 
Sarah has a wide range of experience having 
been heavily involved in community work and 
diversity initiatives during her career. I know 
that sustainability is a topic of particular 
interest to her and we are delighted to have 
her as a member. 

Following the refresh of the Group’s Strategy, 
the Committee reviewed and approved its 
Terms of Reference during the year before 
getting the approval of the Board. In its review, 
the Committee concluded that the Terms of 
Reference remained appropriate and reflected 
the manner in which the Committee was 
discharging its duties. Additional duties were 
introduced to strengthen the role of the 
Committee in advising the Severn Trent Plc 
Remuneration Committee on the Group’s 
performance against sustainability metrics 
and on the setting of sustainability-related 
targets.

See pages 2 to 3

Global sustainability agenda
The turbulence of the last year has led to many 
of the long-term challenges around 
sustainability being accelerated. From a 
climate resilience perspective, we have seen 
extremes from across the globe that bring into 
sharp focus the real-life impact behind the 
climate science, such as water scarcity, 
extreme heat and rainfall intensity. At the 
same time, geopolitical unrest has created 
unprecedented supply pressures, and 
subsequent price volatility across a range of 
commodities, including energy and chemicals. 
These have created significant cost pressures 
for both businesses and individual households, 
our customers. Inflationary increases are 
putting pressure on household income, further 
exacerbated by interest rate rises, recession, 
and potential job losses. 

While the evidence continues to build that 
systemic change is needed to address these 
issues that the world is facing, there are 
divided opinions on how change should happen 
and who should deliver it. Severn Trent 
continues to take a pragmatic approach, 
maintaining a balance between the needs of our 
stakeholders, the drive for sustainable change 
and the needs of the communities we serve.

Tom Delay
Chair

Sustainability is not a new 
or separate direction for 
us. Our drive to deliver 
outstanding performance 
in a way that has a positive 
sustainable impact is what 
makes Severn Trent so 
unique, guiding our purpose 
of ‘taking care of one of life’s 
essentials’.

All members of the Committee are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors of 
the Board, with the exception of Christine 
Hodgson (who was independent on 
appointment). Only members of the 
Committee have the right to attend 
Committee meetings. Other individuals, 
such as the Chief Executive, the Director 
of Human Resources and other senior 
management and external advisers, may 
be invited to attend meetings as and when 
appropriate. None of these attendees are 
members of the Committee.

GOVERNANCE REPORTCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

Sustainability led culture
Sustainability is not a new or separate direction 
for us. Acting in a responsible manner is 
integral to our Purpose of ‘taking care of one of 
life’s essentials’ and our culture reflects the 
social challenges that we face. We developed 
our Sustainability Framework to draw together 
our ESG ambitions, which form an integral part 
of our business plan that is deeply embedded 
within the organisation. Performance against 
the Sustainability Framework is reported on a 
quarterly basis to the Committee, in our Annual 
Report and Accounts, on our website and 
through selected ESG indices. You can read 
more in our standalone Sustainability Report, 
which will be available on the Severn Trent Plc 
website in June.

The Group’s Remuneration Policy is designed 
with all stakeholders in mind and incentivise 
service delivery for our customers, society and 
the environment. 

In 2021, the Company agreed the development 
of sustainability performance measures in the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) with a 
weighting of 20%. In March 2022, we 
announced our commitment to ‘Get River 
Positive’ and directly linked our river pledges 
to our remuneration structures through 
including them in our Annual Bonus Plan for 
2022/23. This year, the Board approved two 
new equally-weighted carbon measures for 
the 2023-26 LTIP aligning more closely to 
internationally recognised mechanisms such 
as the Science Based Target Initiatives for 
Scope 1, 2 and 3. These are: ‘Direct 
Contributors to Carbon Reduction’ and 
‘Innovation and Engagement for Carbon 
Reduction’. For the 2023 award, each of these 
has two components. 

Our culture ensures that we care about our 
customers and the broader communities that 
we serve. Many of our people live in these 
communities, which is why we are so 
committed to our new Societal strategy 
announced in November 2022. Our ambitious 
ten-year plan aims to address the underlying 
causes of poverty across the Midlands in a 
landmark scheme designed to help 100,000 
people out of poverty. The scheme supports 
more people to help themselves and improve 
their life chances, through initiatives such as 
work experience, training and employability 
skills development, partnerships, mentoring 
and more. 

READ MORE: SOCIETAL STRATEGY

See pages 32

This year we continued to test, at scale, how 
innovation can drive the reduction of our 
carbon footprint. Recognising the importance 
of early action, we recently announced an 
exciting partnership with Melbourne Water and 
Aarhus Vand Partners, working collaboratively 
to develop and test technologies that could 
reduce the carbon footprint of waste water 
treatment sites, share existing expertise, and 
establish new international standards for 
measuring and reporting emissions. This joint 
commitment looks to reduce carbon emissions 
by over a million tonnes and aims to lead the 
green transformation of the sector. I am 
encouraged by this collaborative approach 
to support our transition to net zero and embed 
circular economy principles so we can 
maximise the value from the material that is in 
our waste.

described within the Strategic Report on pages 
2 to 99, and the work we have undertaken to 
positively impact communities within our 
region. Further detail on key matters, 
ambitions and achievements that the 
Committee has considered during the year are 
set out on the pages that follow, in addition 
to the areas of focus for 2023/24. 

The increasing focus of stakeholders on the 
impact of climate change and other 
environmental issues has become evident in 
the Committee’s workload. The Corporate 
Sustainability Committee plays a key role in 
the governance of environmental and 
climate-related reporting, including 
overseeing, in conjunction with the Audit and 
Risk Committee and supported by independent 
third-line assurance by Jacobs, the Group’s 
TCFD disclosure. 

I would like to thank the members of the 
Corporate Sustainability Committee for the 
open, constructive, ambitious and progressive 
discussions that take place at our meetings, 
and for their passion and personal 
commitment to our wide-ranging and 
purposeful agenda.

The Committee recognises that our 
sustainability ambitions are deeply rooted and 
owned across the whole Company. We are 
proud that our affordability approach won ESG 
Initiative of the Year at the Corporate 
Governance Institute Awards 2022, and were 
delighted to have been placed 58th by Corporate 
Knights as one of the world’s most sustainable 
companies. In August 2022, we also achieved 
the ‘Advancing’ tier of Carbon Trust Route to Net 
Zero, a new certification that we piloted last 
year. These achievements underline our 
commiment to delivering excellence on the 
sustainability agenda. The Committee has a 
clear view of the focus areas for our 
sustainability journey, and both the Committee 
and Board are confident that we have the right 
aims and approach in place.

OUR TCFD 
DISCLOSURE

We are committed to the 
recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(‘TCFD’), providing our stakeholders with 
transparent information on climate-
related risks and opportunities that are 
relevant to our business. 

Our fifth TCFD disclosure can be found on 
pages 39 to 56. 

Human rights and modern slavery 
We are committed to protecting the human 
rights of our employees and contractors, as 
outlined in our Code of Conduct, Doing the 
Right Thing. 

We have a responsibility to understand our 
potential impact on human rights and to 
mitigate potentially negative impacts. Whilst 
not having a specific human rights policy, 
we have a range of Group policies on Human 
Resources, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Fraud, 
Whistleblowing (‘Speak Up’) and 
Procurement, as well as a Modern Slavery 
Escalation and Remediation Policy and a 
separate Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking 
Statement. We consider this approach goes 
above and beyond a human rights policy. 
Additionally, our Group policies are well 
embedded across the Group. 

NET ZERO HUB AT 
STRONGFORD

Process emissions contribute significantly 
to our reduction challenge, accounting for 
around 83% of operational emissions. We 
aim to convert a large number of our sites to 
low carbon works, necessitating scale 
deployment of new technologies and 
alternative processes to reduce our process 
emissions. Our first pilot project in this area 
is to deliver a Net Zero hub at Strongford, 
working in partnership with others in the UK 
and internationally. Proving the value of this 
concept now will provide the basis for wider 
roll-out across our region in coming years.

We know modern slavery is a growing global 
issue and our customers and other 
stakeholders share our concern, which is why 
we remain fully committed to protect against 
modern slavery in our business and supply 
chain. Our highest risk is within our supply 
chain and, as such, we work closely with our 
suppliers to ensure they operate to the same 
standards we set ourselves and ensure the 
risks involved in their own supply chains are 
understood and mitigated. All suppliers are 
required to sign up and operate in line with 
our Code of Conduct, which clearly sets out a 
zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, 
and this requirement is built into our 
procurement tender process.

Our commitment to training colleagues, senior 
managers and Board members remains as 
strong as ever, and our partnerships with 
Slave-Free Alliance, the Supply Chain 
Sustainability School and Utilities Against 
Slavery help support this. We provide our 
employees with access to a wide range of 
learning resources, including dedicated 
modern slavery awareness training for 
all organisations within the Group’s supply 
chain. Our full Anti-Slavery and Human 
Trafficking Statement can be found on the 
Severn Trent Plc website. 

Freedom of association and 
collective bargaining 
We recognise the right of all employees to 
Freedom of Association and Collective 
Bargaining. We seek to promote co-operation 
between employees, our management team 
and recognised Trade Unions. We meet with 
our Trade Unions on a quarterly basis at the 
Company Forum and see mutual benefit in 
sharing information with our colleagues and 
seek their feedback and suggestions. We 
believe this fosters a common understanding 
of business needs and helps to deliver joint 
solutions aimed at making our business 
successful. The Company Forum also provides 
an invaluable opportunity for engagement with 
the whole workforce to ensure their views are 
taken into account.

Responsible business practices are an integral 
part of our business strategy. Performance 
against our sustainability commitments is 
reported throughout our Annual Report and 
Accounts, reflecting their embedded nature in 
our Governance Framework. You can read 
more in our standalone Sustainability Report 
and on our dedicated sustainability webpages, 
which will be available on the Severn Trent Plc 
website in June.

The Committee is fully 
aware of the unique nature 
of our business, being 
both a regional monopoly 
and an essential public 
service. We strive to ensure 
management is held to 
account through setting 
stretching targets and 
assessing performance in 
the round and over time, 
with incentives that can 
only be achieved through 
the delivery of value for 
our stakeholders.

All members of the Committee are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors of 
the Board, with the exception of Christine 
Hodgson (who was independent on 
appointment). Only members of the 
Committee have the right to attend 
Committee meetings. Other individuals, 
such as the Chief Executive, the Director 
of Human Resources, the Chief Financial 
Officer, other senior management and 
external advisers, may be invited to 
attend meetings as and when appropriate. 
None of these attendees are members 
of the Committee.

Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to present my first Directors’ 
Remuneration Report as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’). I 
joined the Severn Trent Board in May 2020 and 
took over as Chair of the Committee from 
Philip Remnant in December 2022. On behalf of 
the Committee, I am pleased to provide an 
overview of both Executive Director and wider 
workforce remuneration for the financial year 
ended 31 March 2023. 

Over the next few pages, I set out how we  
are actively addressing and factoring in 
stakeholder expectations into our approach  
to Executive pay, for the benefit of our 
customers, colleagues, communities and 
shareholders alike.

In this letter, as well as setting out 
performance for the year under review and 
remuneration decisions for the year ahead, I 
focus on how the Committee takes into account 
broader stakeholder views when setting and 
determining our remuneration policy, 
structure and outcomes. 

We are in no doubt that the issue of Executive 
pay has struck a powerful chord with the 
public and is understandably under scrutiny. 
There is also no doubt that water companies 
need to acknowledge this as a totemic issue 
and demonstrate robust principles and 
decision making on Executive pay. 

Our Remuneration Policy is designed to 
deliver balanced outcomes for our 
stakeholders, driving long-term sustainable 
performance for the benefit of all groups. 
In overseeing remuneration outcomes, the 
Committee ensures that performance is 
assessed in the round and over time through 
a number of lenses, incorporating a variety 
of stakeholder perspectives. Page 148 
provides more detail about how the 
Committee reviewed the formulaic bonus 
and Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
outcomes for 2022/23, taking into account 
broader aspects of the Company’s 
performance.

Looking beyond the year in review, the 
Committee always considers the impact 
on broader stakeholder groups when 
making decisions on remuneration. The 
table overleaf shows the principles on which 
our Remuneration Policy is built to ensure 
stakeholders are considered.

long-term 
performance

How applied

 – All of our people share in our success by participating in our all-employee bonus plan, ensuring employees are aligned with the 

same measures and rewarded for achieving our key objectives.

 – The Company has real Living Wage employer accreditation and reviews salaries in this context.
 – As of April 2022, Executive Director employer pension contributions are fully aligned to those of the wider workforce.
 – All employees can participate in the Save As You Earn scheme, Sharesave, which attracts significant take-up rates with 73.4% 

of employees actively participating.

 – All employees are eligible to participate in our flexible benefits scheme, which we believe is one of the best in the industry and 

is designed to support all aspects of physical, mental and financial wellbeing. See page 24 for our range of benefits.

 – We take our commitment to keeping our employees safe and well very seriously and as a result we set stretching targets for 

this via a Lost Time Incidents (‘LTI’) measure which comprises 8% of the annual bonus. 

 – In 2022/23, the Company delivered its best ever health and safety performance, with a world-leading LTI rate of 0.11.

 – 50% of Executive Directors’ annual bonuses are awarded in shares that are deferred for three years and 100% of the LTIP is 

awarded in shares, which are subject to a two-year holding period post-vesting. 

 – All of the Company’s incentive scheme rules contain malus and clawback provisions, allowing the Committee to reduce or 
recoup any past incentive payments from individual Executives if we later learn of information that was material to the 
incentive scheme outcome after the time of the award. Use of deferral mechanisms aids our ability to operate malus and 
clawback as required, though neither have been deemed necessary to date. 

 – Post-cessation shareholding requirements were introduced as part of the 2021 Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) to reinforce 

the importance of sustainable long-term performance. 

Proportionate  
base pay

 – The Committee regularly assesses the position of base pay against other water and sewerage companies (‘WaSCs’) and 

similar listed companies with benchmark data provided by our external remuneration advisers, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (‘PwC’). 

 – Cumulative Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) and Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’) pay increases have been below both inflation 

every year since appointment and the cumulative increases applied to the wider workforce during the same period.

 – Three-quarters of potential CEO pay is variable in nature (see chart below), based on stretching targets that are reviewed 

annually by the Committee.

Assessment 
of 
performance  
in the round

Stretching  
targets

Focus on the 
environment

 – When determining Executive pay outcomes, we do not simply follow the formulaic outcome of each performance measure but 
also undertake a thorough assessment of ‘performance in the round’ through several lenses. This assessment examines 
whether formulaic outcomes are appropriate in the context of overall business performance and service delivery for 
customers, the environment and wider stakeholders. 

 – ‘Performance in the round’ is also assessed by an independent market assessment report prepared for the Committee by PwC.

 – LTIP maximum outturn can only be achieved if Severn Trent’s Return on Regulated Equity (‘RoRE’) performance is upper 

quartile (‘UQ’) relative to other WaSCs. 

 – We set stretching targets on the profitability component of the Annual Bonus Scheme (‘ABS’), and the degree of stretch is 

shown by the fact that the overall outturn for this measure has only paid out once in full during AMP6 and AMP7.

 – Customer Outcome Delivery Incentives (‘ODI‘) bonus measures are split into three buckets to ensure the Company focuses on 
performing well across all measures, rather than prioritising a few. The Committee’s insistence on stretching targets means 
that we have not paid out the maximum possible bonus during AMP7 to date, despite delivering sector-leading ODI 
performance.

 – In 2021, we introduced a sustainability-based performance measure within the LTIP, with a weighting of 20%, with targets 

aligned to our Triple Carbon Pledge. 

 – In 2022, we created a specific section of the annual bonus for measures and targets linked to river health equating to 8% of the 

total bonus. This took the overall the weighting of environmental measures from 12% to 20%.

 – In 2023/24, the weighting of environmental measures in the bonus has been increased again from 20% to 30%. This was done 

primarily by increasing the river health weighting from 8% to 12%, and introducing a new EPA 4* measure worth 5%.

Performance for  
the year under review
This year has been a challenging one for most 
businesses in the UK, and Severn Trent is no 
exception. Rising energy and chemical costs, 
coupled with one of the hottest summers on 
record, has tested the Company both 
financially and operationally. Notwithstanding 
the challenging backdrop, the Company has 
delivered a resilient set of results and 
maintained its focus on delivering for 
customers, caring for communities and 
colleagues, and nurturing the environment. 

There can be no doubt that the cost of living 
crisis has affected many employees. The 
Committee was pleased to see the Company 
continuing to prioritise its duty of care to 
employees throughout the year. As well as 
being a real Living Wage employer, employees 
have access to a wide range of services and 
benefits designed to take care of all aspects of 
wellbeing; physical, mental and financial. For 
more details of how we are helping colleagues 
through the cost of living crisis, see the case 
study on page 157.

2022/23 bonus outcome
A consistent bonus design is operated 
throughout the organisation. When 
implementing the 2022/23 scheme, the 
Committee determined that it would continue to 
use the measures and weightings agreed with 
shareholders. Page 146 sets out details of the 
2022/23 annual bonus outturn, which will pay 
out at 38.5% of maximum opportunity, 
compared to 81% in 2021/22. The payout for 
2022/23 is equivalent to 46.2% of salary for both 
the CEO and CFO, versus 97.2% in 2021/22. The 
lower outturn is driven largely by lower 
performance against the PBIT measure, 
reflecting a significantly tougher operating 
environment, particularly the impact of higher 
energy and chemical costs. Whilst the overall 
outcome of our Customer and Environment ODI 
measures is below target and lower than last 
year, c.80% of measures are green, and we 
performed well against our health and safety 
targets, with a formulaic outcome just below 
maximum performance. 2022/23 was the first 
year of operation of our river health bonus 
measure and we achieved full vesting following 
excellent performance against our reduction in 
Combined Sewer Overflows (‘CSO’) activations 
and reduction in Reasons for Not Achieving 
Good Status (‘RNAGS’) targets. 

LTIP vesting
The standard element of the 2020 LTIP 
award measures the Company’s performance 
against RoRE set by Ofwat’s Final 
Determination (‘FD’). Over the three-year 
performance period of the 2020 LTIP, the 
Company achieved a RoRE of 1.95x against the 
target of 1.39x the base RoRE return.

This results in full vesting of the standard 
element of the 2020 LTIP award, which is 
equivalent to 75% of maximum for the 
total 2020 LTIP award for the CEO, and 66.7% 
of maximum for the CFO. The Committee has 

reviewed the vesting of the award to consider 
potential windfall gains and concluded that, 
subject to final share price on vesting, there 
has not been any windfall gain. For more 
details on how the Committee assessed this, 
please see page 148.

Vesting under the UQ element of the 2019 LTIP 
award was only known at the end of July 2022 
when comparable statistics for the other WaSCs 
were published. This meant that the LTIP single 
figure value reported for 2021/22 did not include 
the UQ element of the 2019 LTIP award. We 
now know that Severn Trent achieved UQ 
performance, and therefore the UQ element of 
the 2019 LTIP award is included in the 2022/23 
single figure for the CEO and CFO. 

Assessment of performance 
in the round
In overseeing remuneration outcomes, the 
Committee ensures that performance is 
assessed in the round through a number of 
lenses, to incorporate a variety of stakeholder 
perspectives. This assessment examines 
whether formulaic incentive outcomes are 
appropriate in the context of overall business 
performance for customers, the environment 
and wider stakeholders. It also considers other 
factors, including regulatory investigations, 
environmental compliance beyond the 
measures contained in the incentive schemes, 
health and safety performance, treatment of 
the wider workforce and societal matters 
such as support for our local communities.

We have demonstrated again this year that we 
are one of the sector’s leading performers:

 – We are highly confident in achieving EPA 4* 

in the Environment Agency’s annual 
assessment for the fourth consecutive year. 

 – c.80% of our ODI measures are green, 
including those that measure leakage, 
pollutions and water quality complaints.

 – In November 2022 we launched our Societal 
Strategy, with the objective of helping up to 
100,000 people in our region, giving them 
improved chances in life and tackling the 
underlying causes of poverty.

Further detail on the Committee’s assessment 
of performance in the round is set out on page 
148.

Following the Committee’s assessment of 
these factors in the performance in the round, 
no discretion has been exercised to override 
the formulaic outturn of either the 2022/23 
annual bonus or the standard element of the 
2020 LTIP award.

The Committee believes that the outcomes 
of the annual bonus and LTIP are both 
appropriate and reflective of the Company’s 
broader performance over their respective 
performance periods, and that the Policy 
has operated as intended. 

Remuneration for the year ahead
The Committee considers all elements of 
Executive Director pay as well as reviewing 
wider workforce implications. Looking ahead 

to 2023/24, the Committee has made the 
following decisions for the coming year: 

Base salaries and fees
The Executive Director base salaries, Chair’s 
fee, and Non-Executive Director base fees will 
increase by 3.0% in July 2023. Although 
negotiations with our Trade Unions for the 
wider workforce pay increase are ongoing 
at the time of publication, these rises are 
less than half of the current offer that has 
been tabled.

2023/24 bonus
Over the last year the focus on environmental 
performance of water companies has 
intensified, particularly in relation to how it 
links to Executive pay outcomes. Whilst the 
Committee is confident that we already have 
strong links between environmental 
performance and pay, with 20% of the existing 
annual bonus linked to environmental 
measures, we believe it is appropriate to go 
further and make the link between 
environmental performance and remuneration 
even stronger and more direct. 

In April 2023, the Committee approved an 
increase to the weighting of the river health 
element from 8% to 12% and the creation of a 
specific section of the annual bonus for the 4* 
Environmental Performance Assessment 
(‘EPA’) rating equating to 5% of the total. This 
means that, from 2023/24, 30% of the annual 
bonus will be linked to measures relating 
specifically to environmental measures and 
river health. 

The Committee shared these proposals with 
30 of our largest shareholders, which are 
aligned with the Policy and will apply to our 
bonus structure from the 2023/24 financial 
year onwards. More detail can be found on 
page 157.

The maximum bonus opportunity will be 120% 
of salary for the Executive Directors, with 
performance conditions continuing to be 
consistent throughout the organisation. 

2023 LTIP grant
The Committee has determined to make the 
grant on the normal timetable and to retain the 
existing RoRE and sustainability performance 
elements, with updated measures and targets 
for the sustainability element (see box on the 
next page, and page 151). In April 2023, we 
shared these proposals with 30 of our largest 
shareholders to inform them of the evolution of 
the sustainability measures. These changes 
are within the remit of the current Policy, 
which will be reviewed and tabled for 
shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM.

The Committee will assess the value of the 
2023 LTIP award at vesting and will ensure that 
the final outturn reflects all relevant factors, 
including consideration of underlying 
performance and progress towards the 
achievement of our Triple Carbon Pledge.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED

Board changes
In February 2023, Severn Trent announced 
James Bowling’s intention to retire as CFO and 
Executive Director. James has been 
instrumental in driving the success of Severn 
Trent since his appointment in 2015, and I know 
how much the Board and wider Company have 
valued his experience and counsel over the 
last eight years. I’d like to thank James on 
behalf of the Committee, and I wish him well 
for the future.

It was also announced that, following a 
rigorous internal and external search and 
selection process, our Capital and Commercial 
Services Director Helen Miles would succeed 
James as CFO. Helen was appointed as 
Executive Director of the Company on 1 April 
2023, with the title of CFO Designate. James 
will remain an Executive Director and the CFO 
until the conclusion of the AGM on 6 July, at 
which point Helen, having completed a full 
handover process, will take on the 
responsibility. The Committee has determined 
that James will leave with ‘good leaver’ status, 
and is being treated in line with the Policy, as 
set out in more detail on page 151. The 
Committee considered the status of ongoing 
regulatory investigations and noted its ability 
to exercise its powers of malus and clawback if 
appropriate, once concluded.

Helen has been appointed on a salary of 
£480,000, and her wider remuneration package 
is in line with that of her predecessor, and the 
shareholder-approved Policy. Helen is a CFO 
of exceptional calibre, with a detailed 
understanding of the water sector, and I am 
delighted that she was appointed as James’ 
successor. 

Further detail on implementation of 
remuneration for all Executive Directors for 
2023/24 can be found on pages 149 to 150.

We remain committed to maintaining an 
ongoing and transparent dialogue with our 
major shareholders and we will actively 
engage with each of them individually as the 
formal Policy review commences later in 2023. 
I hope that we can rely on your vote in support 
of our approach to remuneration. If you would 
like to discuss any aspect of this Report, I 
would be happy to hear from you. You can 
contact me through our Group Company 
Secretary.

LTIP sustainability 
As part of the 2021 Policy, we introduced a 
sustainability-based performance measure 
within the LTIP, with a weighting of 20%. The 
first LTIP awards with this measure were 
granted in June 2021.

Our LTIP sustainability framework 
focuses on two equally weighted areas, 
‘Direct Contributors to Carbon Reduction’ 
and ‘Innovation and Engagement for Carbon 
Reduction’, and for the 2023 award each 
of these measures has two components, 
as follows:

Direct Contributors 
to Carbon Reduction

Scope 1 & 2 reduction
A Scope 1 & 2 reduction target is a 
natural evolution from measuring 
process emissions to delivering actual 
reduction. It continues the activity 
previously incentivised through the LTIP, 
including improving emissions 
measurement and electric or low-carbon 
vehicles. These actions and subsequent 
reductions will directly contribute 
towards our committed 46% reduction 
Science-Based Target (‘SBT’).

Self-generation of renewable energy
In light of the renewed ambition to push 
further on renewable energy investment 
for both economic, resilience and 
environmental purposes, this measure 
remains a fundamental driver of our 
credible carbon reduction journey. 

Innovation and Engagement 
for Carbon Reduction

Roll-out of Net Zero hub
Process emissions contribute 
significantly to our reduction challenge, 
accounting for around 80% of operational 
emissions. Our aim is to turn a large 
number of our sites into net zero works, 
which will require new technologies and 
alternative processes. 

We have made a commitment to deliver  
a Net Zero hub at one of our largest sites 
as a pilot project. The successful delivery 
of this will underpin the future roadmap 
to Net Zero by 2030 for the business and 
will lead the sector in delivery of scale 
improvements in process emissions in 
AMP8 and beyond.

Scope 3 supply chain engagement
Aligned to our own SBT, we have 
committed to engage a percentage of  
our suppliers to have set a SBT 
themselves by 2026. This engagement 
target for the supply chain is a key staging 
post on the journey to set that reduction 
pathway by 2026.

REMUNERATION AT A GLANCE

Strategic alignment of remuneration
The approach to remuneration across the 
Group is to ensure all our employees are 
rewarded and incentivised to deliver Severn 
Trent’s performance driven, sustainability-led 
strategy. Delivering against this Strategy is 
critical to the creation of long-term value for 
our stakeholders: customers, communities, 
employees, shareholders, suppliers and 
contractors, and our regulators.

In determining the right performance 
measures for our incentive plans, the 
Committee seeks to strike a balance between 
short- and long-term financial, operational 

and sustainability goals. As we are a long-term 
business, actions taken in a single year flow 
through to longer-term performance. We 
operate an Annual Bonus Scheme across the 
Group, which reflects our belief that all our 
employees play a part in the creation of value 
for our stakeholders.

The diagrams below illustrate the 
performance measures that we use within our 
incentives and explain how the measures, 
together with the overall structure of 
incentives, help deliver the Group’s financial, 
operational and sustainability goals.

A significant proportion of ODIs relates to the service 
we provide to our customers and supports alignment 
with customer focus. Our ODIs are grouped into three 
categories. To achieve the maximum outtum for this 
section of the bonus requires outperformance 
across all three categories, thereby ensuring 
strategic focus across all customer 
and environmental performance indicators.

Customer and  
Environment ODIs  
35%

Our five river pledges focus on what is most pertinent 
to stakeholders, namely reducing the impact of our 
operations on river health, helping others reduce 
their impact, and increasing opportunities for people 
in our region to enjoy our waterways.

We are committed to achieving the industry-leading  
4* EPA status.

River Health

EPA  5%

Health and Safety

Deferral into shares

We are committed to keeping our employees safe 
and well, and set stretching targets via our 
‘Lost Time Incidents’ measure.

For Executive Directors, 50% of the bonus is 
deferred into shares for three years to support 
long-term shareholder alignment.

RoRE  
80% 
(standard &  
UQ element)

RoRE is a financial Key Performance Indicator 
(‘KPI’) and is the core driver of overall Company 
performance, supporting the long-term 
sustainability of the Company. 
Components of RoRE are as follows:

– Wholesale totex

– Customer ODIs

– Retail operating costs

– Financing

As explained on page 146, the RoRE performance 
measure of the LTIP award comprises a standard 
element and a UQ element. The UQ element ensures 
that exceptional relative performance must be 
achieved to justify full vesting of the RoRE element.

Our sustainability measures are aligned with our 
environmental commitments to reach net zero 
carbon emissions by 2030.

Sustainability  
20%

Two-year holding 
period

For Executive Directors, the LTIP is fully delivered 
in Company shares subject to a two-year holding 
period, ensuring long-term alignment with 
shareholder interests and delivery for stakeholders, 
including customers and the environment.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED

REMUNERATION FOR THE YEAR IN REVIEW
The Committee believes it is important that, for Executive Directors and senior management,  
a significant proportion of the remuneration package should be performance-related and aligned 
to targets that deliver value for stakeholders. 

The following section highlights the performance and remuneration outcomes for our Executive 
Directors for the year ended 31 March 2023, starting with the total single figure outcomes. 

2022/23 single figure outcomes £’000
The graphs below show how the successful delivery of our Strategy has flowed through to the rewards provided to our Executive Directors.

The single figure amounts in 2022/23 are 18.7% and 18.5% lower than 2021/22 for the CEO and CFO respectively, mainly due to the lower bonus 
outcome in 2022/23.

As part of the 2018 Policy review, the maximum potential remuneration of the Executive Directors was increased through the introduction of 
a new stretch UQ element within the LTIP. This change, which received overwhelming support from shareholders, saw the maximum LTIP 
opportunity increase from 150% to 200% of salary for the CEO and 100% to 150% of salary for the CFO.

In order to determine if the Company has achieved the stretch LTIP target, comparative data for the other WaSCs needs to be collated, verified 
and published by Ofwat. This process concludes in July each year, which is after the publication date of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The outcome of the LTIP UQ element will therefore always be published one year in arrears.

Comparative data published by Ofwat in July 2022 confirmed that the Company achieved UQ status and therefore the UQ element of the 2019 
LTIP award vested, and is reported in the 2022/23 single figure as shown above.
For more detail on the single figure value, see page 160.

Bonus opportunity and outcome
Performance measures and weightings in the annual bonus arrangements at Severn Trent are consistent throughout the organisation. Following the 
Committee’s assessment of performance in the round, no discretion has been exercised by the Committee to override the formulaic outcomes of the 
2022/23 annual bonus, and therefore will pay out at 38.5% of maximum opportunity, compared to 81% in 2021/22. This is equivalent to 46.2% of salary 
for both the CEO and CFO, compared to 97.2% in 2021/22.

2019 and 2020 LTIP award vesting for performance levels (as a % of salary)
RoRE, which captures a range of measures such as totex, financing and Customer ODIs, continues to be our primary LTIP measure, with a 
weighting of 80%. RoRE is assessed over a three-year period so that the focus is on long-term performance.

The table below shows the 2019 and 2020 LTIP award vesting schedule for performance levels as a percentage of salary:

2020 LTIP standard element
The standard element of the 2020 LTIP award measures the Company’s performance against RoRE set by Ofwat’s FD. Over the three-year 
period of the 2020 LTIP, the Company achieved a RoRE of 1.95x against the target of 1.39x the base RoRE return.

Based on the performance levels set out above, this results in full vesting of the standard element of the 2020 LTIP award, which is equivalent 
to 75% of maximum for the total 2020 LTIP award for the CEO, and 66.7% of maximum for the CFO. 

The graph below sets out Severn Trent’s RoRE performance relative to the other WaSCs across the performance period of the 2019 LTIP, as well 
as Severn Trent’s 2022/23 performance.

2019 LTIP UQ element
Vesting under the UQ element of the 2019 LTIP award was only 
known at the end of July 2022 when comparable statistics for the 
other WaSCs were published and provided to Ofwat. We now know 
that Severn Trent achieved UQ performance, and therefore the UQ 
element of the 2019 LTIP award is included in the 2022/23 single 
figure for the CEO and CFO. 

No discretion has been exercised by the Committee to override the 
formulaic outturns of either the 2019 LTIP award, or the standard 
element of the 2020 LTIP award.

GOVERNANCE REPORTDIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED

Assessment of performance  
in the round
In overseeing remuneration outcomes, the 
Committee ensures that performance is 
assessed in the round and over time through a 
number of lenses, incorporating a variety of 
stakeholder perspectives. In reviewing the 
formulaic bonus and LTIP outcomes, the 
Committee took into account the following 
broader aspects of the Company’s performance:

 – Environmental performance – we are highly 

confident in achieving EPA 4* in the 
Environment Agency’s annual assessment, 
for the fourth consecutive year. We have also 
made excellent progress in the first year on 
our Get River Positive river pledges. 

 – Customer experience – there were two 

significant weather-related events, with the 
hot weather over the summer and the 
freeze-thaw event in December. Because of 
the learnings from events in 2018 and the 
proactive measures we put in place, we 
delivered a marked improvement in our 
performance.

 – Societal impact – In addition to the launch of 
our Societal Strategy, in 2022/23, the Severn 
Trent Community Fund has awarded over £2m 
to good causes across our region, benefiting 
over one million Severn Trent customers. As 
part of the #10000BlackInterns programme, 
we had 61 placements last year, with 44% of 
those gaining employment following their 
placement with us.

 – Wider workforce experience – Employee 

engagement increased to our highest ever 
score in November 2022, which now places us 
in the top 5% of energy and utilities companies 
globally. There have been no redundancy or 
furlough programmes in the year, and eligible 
employees will receive a bonus in 2022/23.

 – Windfall gains – At the time of the 2020 LTIP 

grant, the Committee reviewed the grant price 
of £23.97 compared to that of the 2019 LTIP of 
£20.40, and was satisfied that no adjustments 
were required on grant for windfall gains due to 
the increase in share price since the 2019 LTIP 
grant, noting that the Company’s share price 

had been less impacted by COVID-19 than many 
other companies. The Committee also noted 
that it would assess the value of the 2020 LTIP at 
vesting to ensure that the final outturn reflects 
all relevant factors, including consideration of 
any windfall gains. The Committee has reviewed 
the Company’s share price performance over 
the performance period and is satisfied that, 
subject to the final share price on vesting, no 
windfall gains have occurred.

The Committee considered the status of 
ongoing regulatory investigations and noted 
its ability to exercise its powers of malus and 
clawback if appropriate, once concluded.

The Committee further confirms that it has 
considered the Company’s wider performance in 
the round and has concluded that it would not be 
appropriate to override the formulaic outcomes of 
either the 2020 LTIP or the 2022/23 annual bonus.

Executive Director shareholdings
The CEO and CFO have exceeded the shareholding requirements applicable in 2022/23 of 300% and 200% of salary, respectively.

Shareholding requirement
The Executive Directors have built significant shareholdings during their employment with the Company and have retained (except in the case of 
statutory tax and National Insurance deductions) all Company shares acquired as a result of discretionary awards vesting or options being exercised 
under the Company’s share plans. The Executive Directors have also increased their shareholdings further through personal share purchases.

The minimum shareholding requirement for Executive Directors, and the current share interests of the Executive Directors, take into account 
shares which are owned outright or vested, shares which are unvested and shares which are subject to performance. The chart below sets out the 
minimum shareholding requirements and the shareholdings of the Executive Directors. The shareholding requirement must be built up over five 
years and then subsequently maintained.

All calculations in the chart below use a closing share price on 31 March 2023 of £28.79.

Further detail regarding the Executive Directors’ outstanding share awards can be found on page 163.

Overall link to remuneration and equity of the Executive Directors
As a Committee, we want to incentivise the Executive Directors to take a long-term, sustainable view of the performance of the Company. This is why, 
when we look at the remuneration paid in the year, we also look at the total equity they hold and its value based on the performance of the Company.

SUMMARY OF REMUNERATION POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION

The Company’s Policy remains to attract, retain and motivate its leaders and to ensure they are 
focused on delivering business priorities within a framework designed to promote the long-term 
success of Severn Trent, aligned with stakeholder interests.

The tables below illustrate the balance of pay and time period of each element of the Policy for Executive Directors. In addition, the table below 
sets out how the Policy elements are aligned with the factors set out in Provision 40 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the 2018 code’). 
Full details of the 2021 Policy can be found on the Severn Trent Plc website or on pages 145 to 153 of the 2021 Directors’ Remuneration Report.

of the 2018 Code

Proportionality
There is a reasonable balance between 
fixed pay and variable pay, and variable 
pay is weighted to long-term 
performance.
Clarity
Base salaries are competitive against 
companies of a similar size and 
complexity.
Alignment with culture
Base salary increases generally aligned 
to the average increase for the UK wider 
workforce. Pension rates for Executive 
Directors are aligned with the rate offered 
to the majority of the wider workforce.

A salary increase of 3.0% will be 
applied at the salary review date, 
with the exception of the CFO 
Designate whose salary was set 
on appointment on 1 April 2023.
From 1 July 2023, Executive 
Director salaries will be:
– £799,600
– CEO 
– £481,900
– CFO 
– CFO Designate – £480,000

Although negotiations with our 
Trade Unions for the wider 
workforce pay increase are 
ongoing at the time of 
publication, these rises are less 
than half of the current offer that 
has been tabled.

Normal Company 
benefit provision.

Executive Director pension 
arrangements are as follows:
– 15% of salary
- CEO 
- CFO 
– 15% of salary
- CFO Designate  – 15% of salary

To recruit and reward Executive Directors of a suitable 
calibre for the role and duties required.
Salaries are normally reviewed annually and increases 
normally take effect from 1 July. Set with reference to:
– 
individual performance;
–  experience and contribution;
–  developments in the relevant employment market;
–  company performance and affordability;
–  wider economic environment; and
– 
Any increase will generally be no higher than the average 
increase for the workforce. Higher increases may be 
proposed in the event of a role change or promotion, or in 
other exceptional circumstances.

internal relativities.

To provide competitive benefits in the market to enable 
the recruitment and retention of Executive Directors. 
Benefits typically include green travel allowance, family level 
private medical insurance, life assurance, personal accident 
insurance, health screening, an incapacity benefits scheme 
and other incidental benefits and expenses.
The value of benefits is based on the cost to the Company and 
there is no pre-determined maximum limit. The range and 
value of the benefits offered are reviewed periodically.

To provide pension arrangements comparable with 
similar companies in the market to enable the 
recruitment and retention of Executive Directors.
A defined contribution scheme and/or cash supplement in 
lieu of pension.
For current Executive Directors, the Company contribution 
and/or cash allowance is 15% of salary. This aligns pension 
contribution quantum for all Executive Directors with the 
maximum 15% contribution available to members of the 
Severn Trent Group Personal Pension (the majority of the 
wider workforce).
For any new recruit, the contribution will be up to a maximum 
of 15% of salary.

How we plan to implement  
the Policy in 2023/24

Alignment with Provision 40  
of the 2018 Code

To encourage improved financial and operational 
performance, and to align the interests of Executive 
Directors with shareholders through the partial deferral 
of payment into shares.
Bonuses are based on financial, operational, customer, and 
environmental performance. Performance measures and 
targets are selected annually and no more than 20% of the 
bonus will relate to personal contribution.
50% of the bonus is paid in cash and 50% is deferred into 
shares which vest after three years (with the value of any 
dividends to be rolled up and paid on vesting). There are no 
further performance targets on the deferred amount.
Malus and clawback mechanisms apply for three years 
from the payment of the cash bonus or the grant of 
deferred shares.
Maximum award of 120% of salary for the CEO, CFO and CFO 
Designate. The CFO’s 2022/23 annual bonus will be pro-rated 
for time in role.
For threshold performance, 0% of maximum opportunity 
will be paid. For target performance 50% of maximum 
opportunity will be paid.

To encourage strong and sustained improvements in financial 
performance, in line with the Company’s Strategy and 
long-term shareholder returns.
Awards are granted annually and are subject to one or more 
performance conditions assessed over a three-year 
performance period.
Awards made to Executive Directors are subject to a two-year 
holding period post-vesting which continues to operate 
post-cessation of employment.
Malus and clawback mechanisms apply within three years of 
vesting.
The value of dividends paid on the shares comprising the award 
will be rolled up and paid on vesting.
Maximum award opportunity up to 200% of salary. Up to 25% of 
the LTIP award may vest for threshold performance.

To encourage widespread employee share ownership 
to enable employees to share in the success of the business.
The Executive Directors are able to participate in HMRC 
tax advantaged all-employee share plans on the same terms as 
other eligible employees.
The maximum limits under the plans are as set by HMRC.

To encourage strong shareholder alignment both during and 
after employment with the Company.
The CEO is expected to build and maintain a holding of shares 
to the value of 300% of salary, and other Executive Directors 
200% of salary.
Executive Directors are expected to retain all of the net of tax 
number of shares they receive through the LTIP and deferred 
share bonus until the shareholding requirement has been met.
A post-employment shareholding requirement 
applies to Executive Directors who leave the Company. Leavers 
will have a requirement to maintain their in-employment 
shareholding requirement (or actual shareholding, if lower) for 
two years following cessation of employment. This 
requirement applies to shares acquired under share plan 
awards granted following approval of the 2021 Policy.

Performance measures  
(as a % of maximum):

Group PBIT – 40% 
Customer and Environment ODIs – 35%
River Health – 12%
Health and Safety – 8% 
EPA – 5%

The Committee considers the 
forward-looking targets to be 
commercially sensitive but full 
disclosure of the targets and 
performance outcome will be set out in 
next year’s Directors’ Remuneration 
Report.

Grant levels:
CEO – 200% of salary 
CFO Designate – 150% of salary
The 2023 LTIP awards will be based on the 
following performance measures:
–  80% of the maximum LTIP award 

based on RoRE and will require the 
Company’s RoRE to outperform the 
target set out in Ofwat’s FD and, for full 
vesting, to deliver upper quartile 
relative performance compared with 
other WaSCs.

–  20% of the maximum LTIP award 

based on measures relating to Severn 
Trent’s sustainability framework.

See page 151 for detail on LTIP awards to 
be granted.

In line with all employees.

Clarity 
Variable remuneration is based on 
supporting the successful 
implementation of the Company’s 
strategy measured through KPIs which 
are used for the annual bonus and LTIP. 
Simplicity
Defined limits on the maximum awards 
which can be earned. Variable 
remuneration focuses on long-term 
sustainable performance, including the 
Company’s environmental ambitions.
Risk
The Policy ensures there is sufficient 
flexibility to adjust bonus and LTIP 
payments through malus and clawback 
and an overriding discretion to depart 
from formulaic outcomes.
Predictability
Shareholders are given full information 
on the potential values which can be 
earned under the annual bonus and LTIP.
Proportionality
Incentive plans clearly reward the 
successful implementation of the 
Strategy and our environmental 
ambitions, and through deferral and 
measurement of performance over a 
number of years to ensure that the 
Executives have a strong drive to ensure 
that the performance is sustainable over 
the long term.
Alignment with culture
A key principle of the Company’s culture is 
a focus on customers and their 
experience; this is reflected directly in the 
type of performance conditions used for 
the bonus. The focus on ownership and 
long-term sustainable performance is 
also a key part of the Company’s culture.

Alignment with culture
All-employee share plans support a 
culture of share ownership and align 
employee interests with the long-term 
sustainable performance of the 
Company.

CEO – 300% of salary 
CFO – 200% of salary
CFO Designate – 200% of salary
Post-employment shareholding 
requirement applies.
See pages 148 and 163 for further details 
on shareholding requirements and 
outstanding share awards.

Risk
Incentives are primarily paid in shares 
which must be retained until minimum 
shareholding requirements have been 
met. Post-employment shareholding 
requirement further increases the 
exposure of Executive Directors to the 
share price after leaving the Company.

LTIP awards to be granted in 2023
The table below describes how the LTIP will be implemented in 2023. As per the 2022 award, 80% of the maximum LTIP opportunity will be based 
on RoRE and 20% will be based on sustainability measures. The awards will be 200% and 150% of salary respectively for the CEO and CFO 
Designate, in line with the awards made to the CEO and CFO in 2022. James Bowling will not be granted an LTIP award in 2023. Both the RoRE and 
sustainability performance conditions will be measured over three years, to 31 March 2026, and corresponding vesting (as a % of salary) will be:

by 31 March 2026.

Self-generation

Achieving an outturn of 137 GWh additional generation from the 2019/20 baseline of 486 GWh, enabling a minimum 
total renewable generation of 623 GWh by 31 March 2026.

Innovation and Engagement for Carbon Reduction (10%)

Roll-out of Net Zero hub

Achieving a cumulative reduction in Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 15 kT by 31 March 2026.

Scope 3 supply chain 
engagement

To have suppliers representing 70% of our Scope 3 emissions committed to a Science-Based Target at 31 March 2026.

The Committee will assess the value of the 2023 LTIP awards at vesting and will ensure that the final outturn reflects all relevant factors, 
including consideration of underlying performance and progress towards the achievement of our Triple Carbon Pledge.

Chair and Non-Executive Directors’ fees (audited)
The Chair, Senior Independent Director and Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year term, subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting following the annual Board Effectiveness evaluation process. The current Letters of Appointment are 
available on the Severn Trent Plc website.

From 1 July 2023, Non-Executive Director fees will be increased by 3.0% from £60,460 to £62,300, and the Chair’s fee will be increased by 3.0% from 
£314,000 to £323,500. Although negotiations with our Trade Unions for the wider workforce pay increase are ongoing at the time of publication, these rises 
are less than half of the current offer that has been tabled. The current fee levels, and those for the future financial year, are set out in the table below.

CFO leaver treatment
James Bowling will be retiring from the Company in December 2023, and his remuneration arrangements will be treated in line with the 
shareholder approved Policy. He will not receive any compensation for loss of office, but as a retiree he will be treated as a good leaver in relation 
to his outstanding incentive awards. His bonus for 2023/24 will be pro-rated and paid in cash and he will retain original vesting dates for ABS 
deferred awards. He will not be awarded an LTIP in 2023, and his in-flight LTIP awards will vest in line with the normal timeline, pro-rated to his 
termination date and maintaining the two-year holding period. His two-year Post Employment Shareholding Requirement (‘PESR’) period will 
commence in July 2023, once he steps down from the Severn Trent Plc Board.

GOVERNANCE REPORTCOMPANY REMUNERATION AT SEVERN TRENT CONTINUED

The relationship between the remuneration of the CEO and all employees
The Company’s approach to remuneration is consistent for all employees, as outlined on pages 152 and 153 and in our 2021 Policy, which can be 
found on the Severn Trent Plc website.

The table below shows how the CEO’s total single figure of remuneration compares with the equivalent figures for employees occupying the 25th, 
50th and 75th percentiles.

We have chosen Option A under the Regulations for the calculation, which takes into consideration the full-time equivalent basis of all employees 
and provides a representative result of employee pay conditions across the Company.

Total pay and benefits for all have been calculated as at 31 March 2023, in accordance with the single figure methodology, and are based on 
full-time equivalent pay and benefits. We have not omitted any pay elements from the calculation. The median CEO ratio is consistent with the pay 
and progression policies for the Company’s UK employees as a whole.

(i)  Figures for 2022 have been restated to reflect the updated 2019 LTIP values based on the share price at the date of vesting and include dividend equivalents in respect of vested shares.
(ii)  The value of the UQ element of the 2019 LTIP award for 2021/22 could not be measured until July 2022, and is therefore included in the total remuneration value for 2023. The value of the 

2020 LTIP award for 2022/23 is based on the Committee’s assessment of the standard element of the total potential LTIP vesting, as this measures the Company’s performance against the 
RoRE set by its FD, plus the UQ element of the 2019 LTIP. The UQ element of the 2020 LTIP cannot be measured until the end of July 2023; such vesting, if any, will therefore be disclosed in 
the 2023/24 Directors’ Remuneration Report.

(iii)  The 2023 total remuneration figure includes £559.8k in respect of UQ performance for the 2019 LTIP, which is published one year in arrears as explained on page 147 and relates therefore 

to the 2022 remuneration figure.

The median CEO pay ratio has decreased from 90.8 to 73.1 year-on- year, mainly due to the lower bonus award in 2022/23, as well as a higher 
share price appreciation impact in 2021/22. More detail on the single figure amount is included on page 160.

The Committee is satisfied that the individuals identified within each relevant percentile appropriately reflect the employee pay profiles at those 
quartiles and that the overall picture presented by the ratios is consistent with our pay, reward and progression policies. Over the long term, it is 
reasonable to expect there to be a degree of volatility year-on-year in the CEO pay ratio given that the CEO’s single figure is made up of a higher 
proportion of performance-related pay than that of our employees, in line with the expectations of our shareholders and the Company’s 
remuneration approach. This introduces a higher degree of variability each year which affects the ratio. It should be noted that all employees in 
the Company who meet the service requirement are eligible to receive a bonus based on the same broad Company performance conditions. This 
ensures all employees share in the success of the Company.

The key factors to note for this year’s CEO pay ratio are as follows:

 – For 2022/23, the single figure includes the standard element of the 2020 LTIP award plus the UQ element of the 2019 LTIP award.

 – Long-term incentives are provided in shares, and therefore any increase in share price over the three years, as has been observed when 

previous LTIP awards have vested, can magnify the impact of a long-term incentive award vesting in a year.

 – None of the lower quartile, median or upper quartile employees identified this year are participants in the LTIP. If the value of the LTIP is 

excluded from the CEO total remuneration pay ratio calculation, the ratios would be as follows:

 – To employee at the 25th percentile: 36.9

 – To employee at the 50th percentile: 28.8

 – To employee at the 75th percentile: 23.9

The table sets out the base salary and total pay benefits details for the CEO and employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles.

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

Percentage change in the remuneration of the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors
The Committee looks to ensure that the approach to fair pay is implemented in practice throughout the Group, and monitors year-on-year changes 
between the movement in salary, benefits and annual bonus for the CEO between the current and previous financial year compared with that of the 
average employee.

The Committee has elected to use the average earnings per employee as this avoids the distortions that can occur to the Group’s total wage bill as 
a result of the movements in the number of employees.

The Committee monitors this information carefully to ensure that there is consistency in the fixed pay of the Executive Directors and Non-
Executive Directors compared with the wider workforce. Also, this information demonstrates the Company’s approach to having an all-employee 
bonus throughout the organisation with employees and the CEO benefiting when the Company does well.

GOVERNANCE REPORTCOMPANY REMUNERATION AT SEVERN TRENT CONTINUED

GENDER AND ETHNICITY PAY GAP REPORTING

After five years of publishing our gender pay gap data, we are delighted to have published 
our first combined gender and ethnicity pay gap report.

Gender pay gap
Gender pay gap reporting legislation came into force in April 2017 
and requires all UK employers with 250 or more employees to 
publish annual information illustrating pay differences between male 
and female employees. We reported our gender pay gap in November 
2022 in line with statutory requirements. 

The data was based on figures from 5 April 2022 and showed a 
median gap of 9.4% (last year: 9.1%) and a mean gap of 2.9% (last 
year: 3.8%). Whilst the hourly rates for both male and female 
employees have increased, this year there has been a slight increase 
in the median gender pay gap due to a number of small fluctuations in 
the overall population. At the same time, there has been a decrease 
in the mean gender pay gap, mainly due to small changes within our 
executive population. These changes have a larger effect on the 
mean bonus gap, and so this, along with the effect of the UQ element 
of the LTIP, has increased the mean bonus gap even further in favour 
of females at -77%. Our mean gender bonus gap is as a result of the 
high percentage of women in our Executive and senior management 
population.

GOVERNANCE REPORTCOMMITTEE GOVERNANCE

The Committee’s process
Each year, the Committee is presented with interim and annual updates that set out developments in Severn Trent’s wider workforce pay policies 
and practices. The provision of these reports meets the requirements of the 2018 Code. The Committee continues to be engaged on the 
mechanisms for how the reward framework is applied across different levels within the organisation, which in turn has been shared with 
shareholders in this report.

How does the Committee set performance targets? 
The Committee has a well-established process for setting stretching targets to ensure that incentives drive our strategic outcomes and 
deliver value for our stakeholders.

1. Review and approve targets
Management proposes targets for the 
bonus and the LTIP, taking into 
consideration the AMP7 Business Plan, 
long-term strategy (including our 
sustainability framework), the Board-
approved budget, historical performance, 
consensus forecasts, stakeholder 
expectations and wider market/economic 
conditions. The Committee reviews the 
proposed targets (including the underlying 
assumptions) to ensure they are suitably 
stretching but also realistic. Following this 
review, the Committee approves the 
targets. 

2. Assess performance 
At the end of the performance period (one 
year for the bonus and three years for the 
LTIP), the formulaic outcomes of each 
performance measure are assessed on a 
standalone basis, including those that are 
independently verified by our external 
regulator, Ofwat. As stated on page 146, 
the UQ element for LTIP awards can only 
be measured once data for all WaSCs is 
available. A specific Committee meeting is 
scheduled for this purpose.

3. Determining final outcomes
The Committee assesses whether 
formulaic outcomes are fair in the context 
of overall business performance and 
service delivery for customers and the 
environment. The Committee has a well-
established process to review formulaic 
outcomes and, as part of this process, 
independent external advice is sought 
whereby the Committee looks at 
‘performance in the round.’ The 
Committee has the ability to exercise 
discretion to adjust formulaic incentive 
outcomes. 

What the Committee has looked at in the past 12 months
The Committee carries out an annual review of remuneration elements, policies and processes. This process was introduced in 2019 for the 
Committee to expand its responsibility to oversee and review wider workforce pay and policies, and to ensure they are designed to support the 
Company’s desired culture and Values.

The Committee believes that the context and knowledge shared is a useful underpin to ensure that our future decision making around Executive 
and senior management pay supports fair and equal remuneration throughout the entire workforce.

Purpose and 
Values

Reflection on wider 
workforce policies and 
practices

 – We are a real Living Wage employer, which means we are committed to paying all of our direct 

employees and our supply chain a wage based on the cost of living today. In 2022/23, we implemented 
the increase early with effect from 1 October 2022, resulting in an uplift in salary for a number of our 
colleagues. 

 – We launched two new employee benefits that help our colleagues care for their families, and assist with 

the cost of living: Seniorcare, and a discount with one of the UK’s largest nursery companies.
 – This year we have continued to expand and develop our Academy, offering courses covering 

professional, technical and personal development.

 – We have introduced new supportive guides and training aiming to help both employees and managers to 

talk about difficult topics, such as bereavement.

Engagement

Sharing our guiding 
remuneration principles with 
the Company Forum

 – In December 2022, Christine Hodgson and Sharmila Nebhrajani attended the Company Forum, with 

Gillian Sheldon also attending in March 2023.

 – Topics discussed included the 2022 Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gap Report, Executive remuneration, our 

Societal Strategy, and employee engagement.

Focus on ESG 
measures

Bringing to life how 
sustainability is embedded in 
our remuneration framework

 – Review of carbon reduction measures in LTIP, with input from the Corporate Sustainability Committee.
 – Review of River Health measures in the bonus.
 – Review of environmental measures within the bonus structure, with the introduction of the EPA rating 

measure.

REMUNERATION 
POLICY REVIEW 

Work on the Remuneration Policy review 
will commence later in 2023 and will 
incorporate any changes arising as part of 
the Price Review. We will maintain an 
ongoing and transparent dialogue with 
our major shareholders and actively 
engage with each of them individually.

FAIR AND 
TRANSPARENT  
PAY

We will continue to monitor and evaluate 
developments in our pay framework and 
review Executive pay with respect to the 
wider workforce. We will continue to 
clarify the contribution of unique role 
types to ensure an equal and fair reward 
package that is representative of roles 
with similar skill types.

COST OF LIVING  

As the external economic environment is 
expected to be challenging for some time, 
we will continue to review the support we 
provide to employees across all three 
pillars of wellbeing – physical, mental and 
financial. 

Governance matters
The Committee’s performance was assessed as part of the annual 
Board Effectiveness evaluation. I am pleased to report that the 
Committee is regarded as operating effectively and that the Board 
takes assurance from the quality of the Committee’s work.

Committee advisers
To ensure that the Company’s remuneration practices are in line with 
best practice, the Committee has appointed independent external 
remuneration advisers, PwC. This appointment in 2017 followed a 
formal selection process. PwC attends meetings of the Committee.

PwC is one of the founding members of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group Code of Conduct and adheres to this Code in its dealings with the 
Committee. The Committee reviews the appointment of its advisers 
annually and is satisfied that the advice it receives is objective and 
independent. Fees, on a time-spent basis, for the advice provided by 
PwC to the Committee during the year were £92,985 excluding VAT 
(2021/22: £75,250). Separate teams within PwC also provided unrelated 
tax consulting, pensions, and other assurance and advisory services 
during the year. There are no connections between PwC and individual 
Directors to be disclosed.

The CEO, CFO, Director of Human Resources and the Head of Reward 
and HR Operations also attend meetings, by invitation, to provide advice 
and respond to specific questions. Such attendances specifically 
excluded any matter concerning their own remuneration. The Group 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.

(vi)  For 2022/23 the value of the LTIP is based on the outcome of the standard element of the 

total potential 2020 LTIP vesting, plus the UQ element of the 2019 LTIP. For 2021/22 the 
value of the LTIP is based on the standard element of the total 2019 LTIP vesting, plus the 
UQ element of the 2018 LTIP. The prior year LTIP figure has been restated using the share 
price at the date of vesting and includes dividend equivalents in respect of vested shares.

(vii)  The 2022/23 total remuneration figures include £559.8k for the CEO and £336.9k for  
the CFO in respect of UQ performance for the 2019 LTIP, which is published one year  
in arrears as explained on page 146 and relates therefore to the 2021/22 remuneration figure.

(ii)  The vesting of the 2019 LTIP award was reported in the 2021/22 Directors’ Remuneration 
Report as 75% of maximum. In light of UQ performance being achieved, the UQ element of 
the 2019 LTIP award has since vested in full. To reflect this, the LTIP vesting percentage 
for 2022 has been restated. The additional LTIP value arising from the full vesting of the 
UQ element (£559.8k) is included in the total remuneration value for 2022/23.

(iii)  The value of the 2020 LTIP award for 2022/23 is based on the Committee’s assessment of 
the vesting of the standard element of the LTIP. The UQ element cannot be measured until 
the end of July 2023; such vesting, if any, will form part of the total remuneration value for 
2023/24.

CEO remuneration vs returns to shareholders
The graph below shows the value at 31 March 2023 of £100 invested in Severn Trent Plc on 1 April 2013 compared with the value of  
£100 invested in the FTSE100. The FTSE100 was chosen as the comparator index because the Company is a constituent of that index. The 
intermediate points show the value of the intervening financial year ends.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED

LTIP awards vesting in relation to performance in 2022/23 (audited)
Under the 2018 Policy, which received very strong shareholder support, we implemented a UQ comparison against other WaSCs under the RoRE 
performance measure for all future LTIP awards made to the Executive Directors. This ensures full vesting is only achieved for UQ comparative 
performance and it aligns with the Company’s aspirations to be an upper quartile performer.

The outcome of the 2020 LTIP is based on performance over the three-year period from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2023. This is the third LTIP award 
vesting that includes a stretch measure relative to the UQ performance of the other WaSCs. The value set out below is based on achievement of 
the standard element against the total potential LTIP vesting, as this measures the Company’s performance against the RoRE set by its FD. 
Achievement under the standard element was 1.95x and this was measured against the target that we set of 1.39x the base RoRE return. This 
results in a vesting equivalent to 150% of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO. Full details are set out in the table below.

The UQ element of the 2020 LTIP award cannot be measured, and so the associated vesting will not be known, until the end of July 2023 when comparable 
statistics for the other WaSCs are published and provided to Ofwat; such vesting, if any, will therefore be disclosed in the 2023/24 Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. The LTIP value in the 2023/24 single figure table will comprise the UQ element of the 2020 LTIP award (if any) plus the standard element of the 2021 LTIP 
award. For full transparency, we set out below the maximum number of additional shares that could vest if UQ performance relative to other WaSCs is achieved.

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

Directors’ shareholdings and summary of outstanding share interests (audited)
Page 148 in the Remuneration for the Year in Review section summarises the shareholding requirements under which Executive Directors 
are expected to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company, and whether Executive Directors have met the shareholding requirements. 
The shareholding requirements for the CEO and CFO remained unchanged in 2022/23.

The Committee believes that it is an essential part of the Policy that Executive Directors become material shareholders, and this is evidenced by 
the number of shares held by both Executive Directors. The retention and build-up of equity is important in a long-term business such as Severn 
Trent as it encourages decisions to be made on a long-term, sustainable basis for the benefit of all stakeholders.

There has been no change in the Directors’ interests in the ordinary share capital of the Company between those set out below and 23 May 2023.

action that might be brought against its 
Directors and Officers. As permitted by the 
Company’s Articles of Association (the 
‘Articles’), and to the extent permitted by law, 
the Company indemnifies each of its Directors 
and other Officers of the Group against certain 
liabilities that may be incurred as a result of 
their positions with the Group. The indemnities 
were in force throughout the tenure of each 
Director during the last financial year and 
are currently in force.

 – information on the Group’s greenhouse gas 

(‘GHG’) emissions for the year ended 
31 March 2023 on page 61;

Severn Trent Plc does not have in place 
any indemnities for the benefit of the 
External Auditor.

provide water and remove waste water in the 
UK. Details of the principal joint venture, 
associated and subsidiary undertakings of the 
Group as at 31 March 2023 are shown in note 43 
to the Group financial statements.

Areas of operation
During the course of 2022/23, the Group had

on the Board are set out on pages 104 to 105.

As set out in the Notice of Meeting, all the 
Directors, with the exception of James Bowling, 
will retire at this year’s AGM and submit 
themselves for reappointment or, in the case of 
Sarah Legg and Helen Miles, appointment, by 
shareholders. All Directors seeking 
reappointment were subject to a formal and 
rigorous performance evaluation, further details 
of which can be found on pages 118 to 120.

Details of Directors’ service contracts are set out 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 
163. The interests of the Directors in the shares of 
the Company are also shown on page 163 of that 
report. The Board has a documented process in 
place in respect of conflicts.

Employees
The average number of employees within the 
Group is shown in note 8 to the Group financial 
statements.

Severn Trent Plc believes a diverse and 
inclusive workforce is a key factor in being a 
successful business. Through our diversity and 
equal opportunities policy, the Company seeks 
to ensure that every employee, without 
exception, is treated equally and fairly and that 
all employees are aware of their 
responsibilities. This means more than 
ensuring that we do not discriminate in any 
way – we want to create and maintain an 
inclusive culture which reflects a diverse 
population. Severn Trent believes that no one 
should be hurt or made unwell by what we do. 
We did not experience any major safety 
incidents and there were no fatalities during 
the year.

We are an equal opportunities employer and 
welcome applications from all individuals, 
including those with a disability. We are fully 
committed to supporting applications made by 
disabled persons and make reasonable 
adjustments to their environment where 
possible (having regard to their particular 
aptitudes and abilities). We are also responsive 
to the needs of our employees. As such, should 
any employee become disabled during their 
time with us, we will actively re-train that 
employee and make reasonable adjustments 
to their environment where possible, in order 
to keep them in employment with us.

SEVERN TRENT PLC  

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

All our training, promotion and career 
development processes are in place for all our 
employees to access, regardless of their 
gender, ethnicity, age or disability. The 
provision of occupational health programmes 
is of crucial importance to Severn Trent with 
the aim of keeping our employees fit, healthy 
and well. We also provide expert counselling 
support across a wide range of issues through 
our employee assistance programme.

Additional information on our diversity aims 
and progress can be found on page 126.

Employee engagement
Due to our commitment to transparent and 
best practice reporting, we have included the 
sections on our people on pages 22 to 28 of the 
Strategic Report, as the Board considers these 
disclosures to be of strategic importance and 
they are therefore incorporated into the 
Directors’ Report by cross reference. Pages 84 
to 85 and 89 to 90 demonstrate how the 
Directors have engaged with employees and 
how they have had regard to employee 
interests and the effect of that regard including 
the principal decisions taken by the Company 
during the financial year.

The Company is also keen to encourage 
greater employee involvement in the Group’s 
performance through share ownership. To 
help align employees’ interests with the 
success of the Company’s performance, we 
operate an HMRC approved all-employee plan, 
the Severn Trent Sharesave Scheme 
(‘Sharesave’), which is offered to UK 
employees on an annual basis.

73% of Severn Trent’s employees now 
participate in Sharesave, with 26% of 
participants saving the maximum of £500 per 
month.

During the year, the Company has remained 
within its headroom limits for the issue of new 
shares for share plans as set out in the rules of 
the above plan.

Business relationships

Pages 95 and 97 demonstrate how the 
Directors have had regard to key stakeholders 
and how the effect of that regard had 
influenced the principal decisions taken by the 
Company during the financial year. The Board 
considers its Section 172 Statement to be of 
strategic importance and is therefore 
incorporated into the Directors’ Report by 
cross reference.

Research and development
Innovative use of existing and emerging 
technologies will continue to be crucial to the 
successful development of new products and 
processes for the Group and our products 
must continue to deliver value for customers.

Expenditure on research and development for 
the year totalled £3.0 million.

Internal controls
Further details of our internal control 
framework can be found in the Audit and Risk 
Committee Report on page 130 to 131.

Treasury management
Details on our Treasury Policy and 
management are set out in the Chief Financial 
Officer’s Review on pages 66 to 72.

Post balance sheet events
Details of post balance sheet events are set out 
in note 40 to the Group financial statements.

Dividends
An interim dividend of 42.73 pence per ordinary 
share was paid on 11 January 2023. The 
Directors recommend a final dividend of 64.09 
pence per ordinary share to be paid on 14 July 
2023 to shareholders on the register on 2 June 
2023. This would bring the total dividend for 
2022/23 to 106.82 pence per ordinary share 
(2021/22: 102.14 pence). The payment of the 
final dividend is subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2023 AGM.

Dividend Policy
Following publication of the Final 
Determination by Ofwat, in 2019/20 the Board 
approved its Dividend Policy for the period 
2020-25. Dividends during the AMP7 period 
will increase by at least CPIH. 

The Dividend Policy reflects our strong 
operational delivery and financial 
performance, the Final Determination and our 
robust balance sheet and financial resilience. 
When determining the Dividend Policy, the 
Board considered various scenarios and 
sensitivities, and reviewed the impact of 
adverse changes in inflation and interest rates 
on key metrics. The Board believes that the 
Dividend Policy is commensurate with a 
sustainable investment-grade credit rating.

Capital structure
Details of the Company’s issued share capital 
and of the movements during the year are 
shown in note 8 to the Company financial 
statements. The Company has one class of 
ordinary shares which carries no right to fixed 
income. Each share carries the right to one 
vote at General Meetings of the Company. The 
issued nominal value of the ordinary shares is 
100% of the total issued nominal value of all 
share capital.

There are no specific restrictions on the size of 
a holding or on the transfer of shares, which 
are both governed by the general provisions of 
the Articles and prevailing legislation. The 
Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the Company’s shares that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights.

Details of employee share schemes are set out 
in note 36 to the Group financial statements. 
For shares held by the Severn Trent Employee 
Share Ownership Trust, the Trustee abstains 
from voting.

No person has any special rights of control 
over the Company’s share capital and all 
issued shares are fully paid.

With regard to the appointment and 
replacement of Directors, the Company is 
governed by its Articles, the 2018 Code, the 
Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. 
The Articles may be amended by Special 
Resolution of the shareholders. The powers 
of Directors are described in the Severn Trent 
Plc Matters Reserved to the Board document 
and the Articles, both of which can be found 
on our website.

Under the Articles, the Directors have 
authority to allot ordinary shares, subject to 
the aggregate nominal amount limit set at the 
2022 AGM.

Change of control
There are a number of agreements that take 
effect after, or terminate upon, a change of 
control of the Company, such as commercial 
contracts, bank loan agreements, property 
lease arrangements and employee share 
plans. None of these are considered to be 
significant in terms of their likely impact on the 
business of the Group as a whole. There are no 
agreements between the Company and its 
Directors or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment 
because of a takeover bid.

Authority to purchase shares
The Company was given authority at its AGM in 
2022 to make market purchases of ordinary 
shares up to a maximum number of 25,112,416 
ordinary shares. During the year, no ordinary 
shares have been repurchased.

Authority will again be sought from 
shareholders at this year’s AGM to purchase 
up to a maximum of 24,690,396 ordinary 
shares. The Directors believe that it is 
desirable to have the general authority to buy 
back the Company’s ordinary shares in order 
to provide maximum flexibility in the 
management of the Group’s capital resources. 
However, the authority would only be used if 
the Board was satisfied at the time that to do 
so would be in the best interests of 
shareholders.

GOVERNANCE REPORTDIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED

Contributions for political 
and charitable purposes
Donations to charitable organisations during 
the year amounted to £5,662,557 
(2022: £5,594,954). Donations are principally 
given to charities whose projects align closely 
with our aim to promote the responsible use of 
water resources and waste water services 
which provide the opportunity for longer-term 
partnerships. In addition, we provide donations 
to employee nominated charities through a 
matched funding scheme and health and safety 
reward schemes.

We are also committed to supporting 
WaterAid, the UK’s only major charity 
dedicated to improving access to safe water, 
hygiene and sanitation in the world’s poorest 
countries. You can read more about the work 
of our Community Fund in our dedicated 
Community Fund Report, which can be found 
on our website.

Severn Trent’s policy is not to make any 
donations for political purposes in the UK, or 
to donate to EU political parties or incur EU 
political expenditure. Accordingly, neither 
Severn Trent Plc nor its subsidiaries made 
any political donations or incurred political 
expenditure in the financial year under review.

Supplier payment policy
Individual operating companies within the 
Group are responsible for establishing 
appropriate policies with regard to the 
payment of their suppliers, in accordance with 
the Prompt Payment Code (‘PPC’) and, as 
such, prompt payment policies are reviewed 
on a regular basis.

The companies agree terms and conditions 
under which business transactions with 
suppliers are conducted. It is Group policy that 
provided a supplier is complying with the 
relevant terms and conditions, including the 

prompt and complete submission of all 
specified documentation, payment will be 
made in accordance with agreed terms. It is 
also Group policy to ensure that suppliers 
know the terms on which payment will take 
place when business is agreed.

You can read more about how we have worked 
with our suppliers and contractors on page 33.

For the payment practices reporting period 
ended 31 March 2023, the average time to pay 
for Severn Trent Water Limited was 31 days.

Relevant audit information
The Directors confirm that:

 – so far as each of them is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s Auditor is unaware; and

 – each of them has taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken as a Director to 
make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s Auditor is aware of 
that information.

This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

External Auditor
Having carried out a review of its effectiveness 
during the year, details of which can be found 
in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on 
pages 132 and 134, the Audit and Risk 
Committee has recommended to the Board the 
reappointment of Deloitte LLP. The 
reappointment and a resolution to that effect 
will be on the agenda at the 2023 AGM. Deloitte 
LLP indicated its willingness to continue as 
Auditor. The Audit and Risk Committee will 
also be responsible for determining the audit 
fee on behalf of the Board.

Carbon footprint
We have committed to achieving net zero 
operational carbon emissions by 2030, building 
on our long track record of making year-on-
year reductions in our emissions. We also 
committed to generating or procuring 100% 
renewable energy and moving our fleet to 
100% electric vehicles by 2030, where 
available.

The Board considers environmental matters to 
be of strategic importance and therefore 
relevant information contained in our Net Zero 
Transition Plan and TCFD disclosure on pages 
39 to 63 of the Strategic Report is incorporated 
into the Directors’ Report by cross reference. 
Our TCFD disclosure includes our annual 
report on GHG emissions along with details of 
our energy consumption across the Group and 
how we manage energy use.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT

The Directors are responsible 
for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. Company 
law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements 
for each financial year.

The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Each of the Directors confirm that to the 
best of their knowledge:

 – the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;

 – the Strategic Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the Principal Risks 
and uncertainties that they face; and

 – the Annual Report and financial statements, 

taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

This responsibility statement was approved by 
the Board of Directors on 23 May 2023 and is 
signed on its behalf by order of the Board:

Liv Garfield
Chief Executive

23 May 2023

James Bowling
Chief Financial Officer

23 May 2023

The Directors are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom adopted International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’), and 
have elected to prepare the Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law) 
including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’.

Under company law, the Directors must not 
approve the Annual Report and financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for the year.

In preparing the parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:

 – select suitable accounting policies and then 

apply them consistently;

 – make judgments and accounting estimates 

that are reasonable and prudent;

 – state whether applicable UK Accounting 

Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and

 – prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Company will continue 
in business.

In preparing the Group financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that Directors:

 – properly select and apply accounting policies;

 – present information, including accounting 

policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;

 – provide additional disclosures when 

compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and

 – make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.

The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.

GOVERNANCE REPORTINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO 
THE MEMBERS OF SEVERN TRENT PLC

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Opinion

In our opinion:

 – the financial statements of Severn Trent Plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) give a true and fair view of the state of 

the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2023 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;

 – the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting 

standards;

 – the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 

Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and

 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise:

 – the consolidated income statement;

 – the consolidated and parent company statements of comprehensive income;

 – the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;

 – the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;

 – the consolidated cash flow statement; and

 – the related notes 1 to 43 of the consolidated financial statements and notes 1 to 16 of the parent company financial statements.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom adopted international accounting standards. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

2.  Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the group and parent 
company for the year are disclosed in note 7 to the financial statements. We confirm that we have not provided any non-audit services prohibited 
by the FRC’s Ethical Standard to the group or the parent company.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

3.  Summary of our audit approach

Key audit matters

The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:

 – valuation of the provision for household trade receivables in Severn Trent Water Limited; and

 – classification of capital programme expenditure in Severn Trent Water Limited.

Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows: 

 Similar level of risk

Materiality

Scoping

The materiality that we used for the audit of the group financial statements is £18.5m (2022: £13.9m). This materiality has 
been established with regards to a number of metrics and equates to 3.6% (2022: 2.7%) of profit before interest and tax.

Our scoping has resulted in over 95% (2022: over 95%) of the group’s net operating assets, 96% (2022: 97%) of revenue 
and 96% (2022: 100%) of profit before interest and tax, being subject to audit testing.

Significant changes 
in our approach

The materiality benchmark has been updated in the current year from profit before tax adjusted for gains/(losses) from 
financial instruments and exceptional items, used in the prior year. The change in the benchmark is reflective of the size 
and scale of the business.

4.  Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 
financial statements is appropriate.

168

SEVERN TRENT PLC  

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
included:

 – reviewing the group’s borrowing arrangements, in particular the assessment of level of committed undrawn facilities including the £1.3 billion 

revolving credit and bilateral facilities and the sufficiency of headroom available in the forecasts (cash and covenants);

 – assessing the assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts for consistency with Board approved budgets and future plans for AMP (Asset 

Management Plan) 7 and performing a sensitivity analysis relating to these assumptions;

 – testing the arithmetic accuracy of the model used to prepare the cash flow forecasts and assessing the sophistication of the model used to 

prepare the forecasts;

 – assessing the impact of risks and uncertainties on the business model and medium-term risks; and

 – assessing the appropriateness of management’s going concern disclosures in light of the above assessment.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or 
collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve 
months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.

5.  Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

5.1. Valuation of the provision of household trade receivables in Severn Trent Water Limited 

Key audit matter 
description

Severn Trent Water supplies water to residential customers in the UK and the provision represents the portion of household 
customers who do not, or cannot, pay their bills. Management makes estimates regarding the expected future loss rate for 
current receivables when calculating the appropriate level of bad debt provision.

As at 31 March 2023, the provision recorded was £127.5m (2022: £128.2m) which incorporates management’s estimate of the 
future impact of external economic factors on customers’ ability to pay their outstanding bills to Severn Trent Water Limited.

Provisions are made against Severn Trent Water Limited’s trade receivables balance based on the historical cash collection of 
debt invoiced seven to nine years ago, which is considered by management to be representative of collection risk on whole 
population of household debtors. This historical collection performance is then adjusted for actual current cash collection. 
The final step is to adjust the provision for future economic conditions, for which management has considered the correlation 
between forecast cash collection and gross disposable household income (GDHI).

The key audit matter is focussed on the appropriateness of the assumption that the experience of debt invoiced seven to nine 
years ago is a reasonable expectation for the determination of lifetime expected credit losses under IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments, and whether the assumptions used in determining the impact of forecast decreases in GDHI on the expected 
credit loss are appropriate. Due to the high degree of estimation uncertainty associated with the recoverability of household 
trade receivables, we have determined that there was a potential for fraud through possible manipulation of this balance.

The Audit and Risk committee also considered this as a significant issue as discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee Report 
on page 134. The bad debt provision is discussed in note 2 p) and note 21 to the financial statements. Management has included 
this as a source of estimation uncertainty in note 4 to the financial statements.

Our procedures to address the key audit matter included the following:

 – obtaining an understanding of relevant controls over the determination of the bad debt provision, including over the 

supporting data and assumptions;

 – testing the completeness and accuracy of the data included within the bad debt provision calculation; 

 – testing the allocation of cash received in the current year to debt aged between seven and nine years;

 – use of data analytics to reconcile the debtor ageing for each debt category used in the bad debt provision model using 

source data from the billing system;

 – evaluating the reasonableness of economic data (both forecast and historical) used within the calculation, and 

performed a sensitivity analysis;

 – evaluating management’s assumptions used in the calculation of the bad debt provision and challenged whether this 

represents lifetime expected credit loss, including review of cash collection data and historical trends; and

 – assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures provided relating to the key assumptions, and the range of 

sensitivities disclosed.

How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter

Key observations

We are satisfied that the assumptions applied in assessing the expected credit losses, are reasonable and that Severn Trent 
Water Limited’s bad debt provision has been appropriately calculated using relevant data, in accordance with IFRS 9.

5.2. Classification of capital programme expenditure in Severn Trent Water Limited 

Key audit matter 
description

Severn Trent Water has a substantial capital programme which was agreed with the regulator (‘Ofwat’) and therefore 
incurs significant expenditure in relation to the development and maintenance of both infrastructure and non-
infrastructure assets.

As the determination of whether expenditure is capitalised or expensed in the period directly affects the group’s 
reported financial performance, we identified a key audit matter relating to the overstatement of capital expenditure, 
whether caused by changes to the group’s capitalisation policy implementation guidance or by incorrect application of 
this guidance. Due to the level of judgement involved, we have determined that there was a potential for fraud through 
possible manipulation of this balance.

During the year, Severn Trent Water Limited has invested £868.2 million (2022:£689.3 million) in capital expenditure 
projects out of the total group additions of £898.9 million (2022: £714.3 million) disclosed in note 17. Severn Trent Water 
Limited spent a further £223.2 million (2022: £194.1 million) on infrastructure maintenance expenditure out of the total 
group expenditure of £238.4 million (2022: £198.2 million) disclosed in note 7.

The Audit and Risk Committee also considered this as a significant issue as discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee 
report on page 134. Further details are included within the critical accounting judgements note in note 4 to the financial 
statements.

Our procedures to address the key audit matter included the following:

 – assessing management’s capitalisation and implementation guidance to understand any changes in the current year 

and to determine compliance with the relevant accounting standards;

 – testing the relevant controls related to classification of capital programme expenditure;

 – obtaining an understanding of, and testing, relevant controls over the application of the policy regarding expenditure 

incurred on projects within the capital programme during the year; and

 – for a sample of projects, assessing whether the capitalisation policy has been applied to the costs incurred by 

reviewing the business cases, making direct enquiries of project managers, and inspecting invoices.

How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter

Key observations

Management’s capitalisation policy and implementation guidance is consistent with the prior financial year. We are 
satisfied that management has applied its capitalisation policy and implementation guidance appropriately in 
determining the expenditure to be capitalised.

6.  Our application of materiality

6.1. Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined the materiality of the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Materiality

Basis for 
determining 
materiality

Rationale for 
the benchmark 
applied

Group financial statements

Parent Company financial statements

£18.5 million (2022: £13.9 million)

£17.6 million (2022: £13.2 million)

The current year materiality has been established with 
regards to a number of metrics and equates to 3.6% 
(2022: 2.7%) of Profit before interest and tax.

We determined parent company materiality based on 3.0% 
(2022: 3.0%) of net assets and capped materiality at 95% 
(2022: 95%) of group materiality.

We consider Profit before interest and tax to be the 
most relevant benchmark to measure the performance 
of the group.

The parent company does not trade or exist for profit 
generating purposes, so materiality has been determined 
using net assets.

The increase in materiality in 2023 represents a change 
from the 2022 benchmark to a measure which is reflective 
of the size and scale of the business.

6.2. Performance materiality
We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole.

Performance

Basis and rationale 
for determining 
performance 
materiality

Group financial statements

Parent Company financial statements

70% (2022: 70%) of group materiality

70% (2022: 70%) of parent company materiality

The factors we considered in setting performance materiality at 70% of group and parent company materiality included:

 – The overall quality of the control environment and that we were able to rely on controls in certain of the group’s 

businesses.

 – The small number and low value of uncorrected misstatements identified in previous audits.

6.3. Error reporting threshold
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee, all audit differences in excess of £0.9 million 
(2022: £0.7 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also reported to 
the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

7.  An overview of the scope of our audit

7.1. Identification and scoping of components
Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of 
material misstatement at the group level.

The Regulated Water and Waste Water segment is primarily comprised of Severn Trent Water Limited which was subject to a full scope audit using 
materiality of £17.6 million (2022: £12.9 million). We have audited a further seven components using component materiality which range from 
£9.3 million to £17.6 million (2022: nine components using statutory materiality which range from £0.1 million to £13.2 million). Audit work to 
respond to the risks of material misstatement was performed directly by the group audit engagement team.

This represented over 95% (2022: over 95%) of the group’s net operating assets, 96% (2022: 97%) of revenue and 96% (2022: 100%) of profit before 
interest and tax, being subject to audit testing.

At the group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to full scope audit 
procedures.

7.2. Our consideration of the control environment
The group uses SAP, a financial accounting software platform, in all the eight components where we have performed a full scope audit.

With the involvement of our Information Technology specialists, we obtained an understanding of, and relied on, relevant General Information 
Technology Controls within the group’s financial accounting software platform, including access controls, change management controls and 
controls around segregation of duties.

We also tested and relied on the relevant controls in respect of household and non-household revenue and classification of capital programme 
expenditure which are supported by the group’s financial accounting software platform. We tested the relevant controls on a sample basis by 
either observing or reperforming each step of the control and obtaining the relevant supporting evidence.

7.3. Our consideration of climate-related risks
The group has assessed the risk and opportunities relevant to climate change and has included the risk as a principal risk as set out on page 78, 
consistent with previous years. This included assessing the potential impact of the material risks and opportunities and its Net Zero Transition 
Plan on both the current balance sheet position and its accounting policies.

We reviewed management’s climate change risk assessment and evaluated the completeness of the identified risks and impact on the financial 
statements. We also considered climate change within our audit risk assessment process in conjunction with our assessment of the balances and 
did not identify any additional risks of material misstatement.

With the involvement of our Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) specialists, we:

 – evaluated the financial statement disclosures to assess whether climate risk assumptions underpinning specific account balances were 

appropriately disclosed; and

 – read the climate change-related statements (as disclosed in the Strategic Report) and considered whether the information included in the 

narrative reporting is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained in the audit.

8.  Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we 
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a 
material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

9.  Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

10.  Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, 
outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of 
detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.

Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities

11.1. 
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and 
regulations, we considered the following:

 – the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the group’s remuneration policies, 

key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;

 – the group’s own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error that was approved by the board on 

20 February 2023;

 – results of our enquiries of management, internal audit, the directors and the Audit and Risk Committee about their own identification and 

assessment of the risks of irregularities, including those that are specific to the group’s sector;

 – any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the group’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:

 – identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;

 – detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and

 – the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations.

 – the matters discussed among the audit engagement team and relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, pensions, treasury and IT, 

regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.

As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and identified the 
greatest potential for fraud in the following areas:

 – valuation of the provision of trade receivables in Severn Trent Water Limited; and

 – classification of capital programme expenditure in Severn Trent Water Limited.

In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.

We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and 
regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and 
regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, pensions and tax legislation.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with 
which may be fundamental to the group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the licence conditions imposed by The 
Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat).

Audit response to risks identified

11.2. 
We identified the valuation of the provision of trade receivables in Severn Trent Water Limited and the classification of capital programme 
expenditure in Severn Trent Water Limited as key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report 
explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters.

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:

 – reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws 

and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;

 – enquiring of management, the Audit and Risk Committee, in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;

 – performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to 

fraud;

 – reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with HMRC, 

Ofwat, and other regulatory authorities;

 – in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; 
assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale 
of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal 
specialists, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.

REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

12.  Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 

is consistent with the financial statements; and

 – the Strategic report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.

13.  Corporate Governance Statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the group’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance 
Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

 – the directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 

uncertainties identified set out on page 83;

 – the directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the group’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is 

appropriate set out on page 80;

 – the directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 167;

 – the Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 75;

 – the section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on 

pages 130 to 131; and

 – the section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee set out on pages 127 to 134.

14.  Matters on which we are required to report by exception

14.1. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records

 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 

not visited by us; or

 – the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

14.2.  Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made 
or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

SEVERN TRENT PLC  

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1  General information
The Severn Trent Group’s operations are described in the segmental 
analysis in note 5.

Severn Trent Plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United 
Kingdom. The address of its registered office is shown on the back of 
the cover of the Annual Report and Accounts.

Severn Trent Plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange.

2  Accounting policies

a)  Basis of preparation
The financial statements for the Group and the parent company have 
been prepared on the going concern basis (see strategic report on 
page 83 which sets out the Group’s considerations relating to viability 
and going concern) under the historical cost convention, except for the 
revaluation of financial instruments including derivatives (refer to 
accounting policy notes t and u), and accounting for the transfer of 
assets from customers (refer to accounting policy note i).

b)  Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Severn 
Trent Plc and its subsidiaries and joint ventures. Results are included 
from the date of acquisition or incorporation and excluded from the date 
of disposal.

Subsidiaries are consolidated where the Group has the power to control 
a subsidiary.

Joint venture undertakings are accounted for on an equity basis where 
the Group exercised joint control under a contractual arrangement.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of subsidiaries are identified 
separately from the Group’s equity. Non-controlling interests consist 
of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business 
combination and the non-controlling interests’ share of changes in 
equity since that date. 

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been 
eliminated on consolidation and are not included within the Group 
financial statements.

(i) Consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and United Kingdom 
adopted International Financial Reporting Standards. 

Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of the Company 
and its subsidiary undertakings are translated into the relevant 
functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end. 
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the 
income statement. 

(ii) Parent company financial statements
The parent company financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards and comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. The Company meets the definition of 
a qualifying entity as defined in FRS 100 ‘Application of Financial 
Reporting Requirements’, accordingly the Company has elected to 
apply FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.

Therefore the recognition and measurement requirements of United 
Kingdom adopted International Financial Reporting Standards have 
been applied, with amendments where necessary in order to comply 
with Companies Act 2006 and The Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/410) 
as the parent company financial statements are Companies Act 2006 
accounts.

As permitted by FRS 101, the parent company has taken advantage of 
the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
statement of cash flows, share based payment, financial instruments, 
capital management, presentation of comparative information in 
respect of certain assets, standards not yet effective and related party 
transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the 
consolidated financial statements.

As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no profit or 
loss account is presented for the parent company. The profit for the 
year is disclosed in the Company statement of comprehensive income, 
the Company statement of changes in equity and the Company balance 
sheet.

Severn Trent Plc is a partner in Severn Trent Limited Partnership 
and Severn Trent 2017 Limited Partnership (‘the partnerships’), which 
are registered in Scotland. As the partnerships are included in the 
consolidated accounts, the parent company has taken advantage of the 
exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of The Partnership (Accounts) 
Regulations 2008 from the requirements of Regulations 4 to 6.

The key accounting policies for the Group and the parent company 
are set out below and have been applied consistently except where 
indicated. Where policies are specific to the Group or to the Company 
this is set out in the relevant policy.

Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated 
into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the 
transaction. All gains and losses on exchange arising during the 
year are dealt with through the income statement.

c)  Revenue recognition
Revenue includes turnover and interest income.

Turnover represents the fair value of consideration receivable, 
excluding value added tax, trade discounts and intercompany sales, 
in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.

Turnover is not recognised until the service has been provided to the 
customer.

Water and waste water revenue is recognised when the service is 
provided and includes an estimate of the amount of water and waste 
water charges unbilled at the year end. The accrual is estimated using 
a defined methodology based upon a measure of unbilled water 
consumed by tariff, which is calculated from historical billing 
information.

Amounts received from developers for diversions activity is recognised 
as turnover when the service to divert the infrastructure has been 
completed. 

Operating services revenue is recognised in line with the delivery of 
each performance obligation. Further details of the performance 
obligations are detailed in note 6. The expected turnover over the life 
of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on the 
stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation, which is 
based on the forecast costs incurred and expected margin for each 
obligation. Any changes to the revenue relating to performance 
obligations already delivered are recognised in the period in which 
they are identified. Differences between amounts recognised as 
revenue and amounts billed are recognised as contract assets 
or liabilities.

Renewable energy revenue includes sales of electricity and gas and 
the related green energy incentives. Revenue from energy sales is 
recognised when the electricity or gas is delivered to the national grid. 
Green energy incentives are recognised when the Group becomes 
entitled to them. 

Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal 
outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.

GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS2  Accounting policies (continued)

d)  Exceptional items
Exceptional items are income or expenditure, which individually or in 
aggregate, if of a similar type, should, in the opinion of the directors, 
be disclosed by virtue of their size or nature if the financial statements 
are to give a true and fair view. In this context, materiality is assessed 
at the segment level.

e)  Taxation
Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year and is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred taxation is provided in full on taxable temporary differences 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. Deferred taxation is measured 
on a non-discounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 

Where there is a change in the tax rate enacted or substantively 
enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities in the opening balance sheet 
are remeasured at the new rate. The resulting charge/credit to income 
statement and reserves is recognised in the year that the rate change 
occurs. 

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except where 
they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are 
also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, 
respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial 
accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the 
accounting for the business combination.

A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent it is probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to utilise it.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities.

f)  Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase 
consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill 
arising on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets, 
whilst goodwill arising on acquisition of associates or joint ventures 
is included in interests in associates or joint ventures respectively. 
If an acquisition gives rise to negative goodwill this is credited directly 
to the income statement. Fair value adjustments based on provisional 
estimates are amended within one year of the acquisition, if required, 
with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.

Goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are tested for impairment in 
accordance with the policy set out in note 2 l) below and carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to 
the cash-generating unit that derives benefit from the goodwill for 
impairment testing purposes.

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and all or part 
of that unit is disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the 
carrying amount of that operation when determining the gain or loss 
on disposal of the operation.

g)  Other intangible non-current assets
Intangible assets acquired separately, or internally generated where 
a separate resource that is controlled by the Group is created, are 
capitalised at cost. Following initial recognition, finite life intangible 
assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful economic lives as follows:

Software

Other intangible assets

Years

3-10

15-25

Amortisation charged on intangible assets is taken to the income 
statement through operating costs.

Finite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment where 
indicators of impairment exist (see 2 l).

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. Such assets are reviewed for 
impairment at least annually and where indications of impairment exist.

Development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset and 
written off over its expected useful economic life where the following 
criteria are met:

 – it is technically feasible to create and make the asset available for use 

or sale; 

 – there are adequate resources available to complete the development 

and to use or sell the asset;

 – there is the intention and ability to use or sell the asset;

 – it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic 

benefits; and

 – the development costs can be measured reliably.

Research expenditure is expensed when it is incurred.

h)  Pre-contract costs
Incremental costs incurred in obtaining contracts with customers are 
recognised as a prepayment and written off to the income statement 
over the life of the contract where it is expected that the costs will be 
recovered.

All other costs of obtaining contracts are written off to the income 
statement as incurred. 

i)  Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is held at cost (or at deemed cost 
for infrastructure assets on transition to IFRS) less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment. Expenditure on development projects is 
capitalised and depreciated over the expected useful life of those 
assets. 

The costs of like-for-like replacement of infrastructure components 
are recognised in the income statement as they arise. Expenditure 
which results in enhancements to the operating capability of the 
infrastructure networks is capitalised.

Where items of property, plant and equipment are transferred to 
the Group from customers or developers, the fair value of the asset 
transferred is recognised in the balance sheet. Fair value is determined 
based on estimated depreciated replacement cost. The transfer is 
considered to be linked to the provision of ongoing services therefore 
the corresponding credit is recorded in deferred income and released 
to turnover over the expected useful lives of the related assets. Further 
details regarding the judgment applied is detailed in note 4.

Where assets take a substantial period to get ready for their intended 
use, the borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of these assets are added to their cost.

i)  Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated, using the straight-line 
method, to its estimated residual value over its estimated useful life, 
with the exception of freehold land, which is not depreciated. Assets in 
the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.

2-15

j)  Leased assets
Where the Group enters a contract that contains a lease, it recognises 
a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is 
measured at cost, which includes: the amount of the initial 
measurement of the lease liability (see below); any lease payments 
made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives 
received; any initial direct costs incurred by the Group; and an estimate 
of any remediation or similar costs required by the lease contract.

At the commencement date, the lease liability is measured at the 
present value of the future lease payments discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that cannot be readily 
determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities 
are included in borrowings.

Lease payments are treated as consisting of a capital element and a 
finance charge; the capital element reduces the lease liability and the 
finance charge is written off to the income statement at a constant 
rate over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount 
outstanding. Depreciation of the right-of-use asset is charged over 
the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease period unless 
ownership is expected to transfer to the Group at the end of the lease, 
in which case the right-of-use asset is depreciated to the end of the 
useful life of the underlying asset.

Extension and termination options are included in a number of property 
and equipment leases across the Group. These terms are used to 
maximise operational flexibility in managing contracts.

Most extension and termination options held are exercisable only by 
the Group and not by the respective lessor. In determining the lease 
term, the Group considers all facts and circumstances that create an 
economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise 
a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination 
options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably 
certain to be extended (or not terminated). The assessment is reviewed 
if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs 
which affects this assessment and is within the control of the Group.

Where the lease term is less than one year or the underlying asset is 
low value, the Group does not recognise a right-of-use asset or lease 
liability. Payments under such leases are charged to operating costs. 

k)  Grants and contributions
Grants and contributions received in respect of non-current assets, 
including certain charges made for new connections to the water and 
sewerage networks, are treated as deferred income and released to 
turnover over the useful economic life of those non-current assets.

Grants and contributions which are given in compensation for expenses 
incurred with no future related costs are recognised in turnover in the 
period that they become receivable.

Impairment of non-current assets

l) 
If the recoverable amount of goodwill, an item of property, plant and 
equipment, or any other non-current asset is estimated to be less than 
its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to 
sell or estimated value in use at the date the impairment review is 
undertaken. Fair value less costs to sell represents the amount 
obtainable from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction 
between knowledgeable and willing third parties, less costs of disposal. 
Value in use represents the present value of future cash flows expected 
to be derived from a cash-generating unit, discounted using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the cost of 
capital of the cash-generating unit or asset.

The discount rate used is based on the Group’s cost of capital adjusted 
for the risk profiles of individual businesses. For regulated businesses 
we use the WACC from Ofwat’s latest price review adjusted for market 
changes since this date where appropriate.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Impairment reviews are 
also carried out if there is an indication that an impairment may have 
occurred, or, where otherwise required, to ensure that non-current 
assets are not carried above their estimated recoverable amounts.

Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.

m)  Parent company investments
The parent company recognises investments in subsidiary undertakings 
at historical cost. Impairment losses are recognised in line with the 
policy set out in l) above.

Inventory

n) 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
For properties held for resale, the cost includes the cost of acquiring 
and developing the sites.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in selling and distribution.

o)  Loans receivable
Loans receivable are measured at fair value on initial recognition, less 
issue fee income received where the fee is integral to the yield on the 
loan. All loan receivables are held for collection of contractual cash 
flows, which represent solely payments of principal and interest. After 
initial recognition, loans receivable are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method whereby 
interest and issue fee income are credited to the income statement 
and added to the carrying value of loans receivable at a constant rate 
in proportion to the loan amount outstanding. 

The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) 
on its loans receivable from joint ventures. The amount of expected 
credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in 
credit risk since initial recognition.

The Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If the credit risk has 
not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures 
the loss allowance at an amount equal to the 12 month ECL.

GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTSGROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
2  Accounting policies (continued)

Changes in the retirement benefit obligation that arise from:

o)  Loans receivable (continued)
Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result 
from all possible default events over the expected life of the loans. 
In contrast, 12 month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that 
is expected to result from default events that are possible within 
12 months after the reporting date.

Significant increase in credit risk
In assessing whether the credit risk has increased significantly since 
initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of default over the 
remaining life of the asset at the reporting date with the risk of default 
for the same period at initial recognition. In making this assessment, 
the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information about 
the risk of default that is reasonable and supportable, including 
forward-looking information that is available. This includes assessment 
of a deterioration in: actual or expected business; financial or economic 
conditions of the borrower; actual or expected operating results, cash 
flows and financial position of the borrower; and the regulatory, 
economic, or technological environment faced by the borrower. 

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group 
presumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased 
significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments 
are more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable 
and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise.

Definition of default
The Group considers that a default has taken place where information 
developed internally indicates that the borrower is unlikely to pay its 
creditors, including the Group, in full.

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has 
occurred when a loan receivable is more than 90 days past due unless 
the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate 
that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.

p)  Trade receivables and accrued income
Trade receivables and accrued income are measured at fair value on 
initial recognition, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method, less loss allowance. If there is 
objective evidence that the asset is impaired, it is written down to its 
recoverable amount and the irrecoverable amount is recognised as 
an expense in operating costs.

The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 for 
estimating expected credit losses on trade and other receivables. 
For trade receivables that are assessed not to be impaired individually, 
expected credit losses are estimated based on the Group’s historical 
experience of trade receivable write-offs and reasonable, supportable 
forward-looking information which is available without undue cost 
or effort.

q)  Retirement benefits

(i) Defined benefit schemes
The difference between the value of defined benefit pension scheme 
assets and defined benefit pension scheme liabilities is recorded on 
the balance sheet as a retirement benefit asset or obligation.

Defined benefit pension scheme assets are measured at fair value 
using bid price for assets with quoted prices. For scheme assets with 
no quoted price, the fair value is derived by using quotations from 
independent third parties or by using applicable valuation techniques 
at the end of each reporting period. Defined benefit pension scheme 
liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date by an independent 
actuary using the projected unit method and discounted at the current 
rate of return on high-quality corporate bonds of equivalent term and 
currency to the liability. 

Service cost, representing the cost of employee service in the year, is 
included in operating costs. Net finance cost is calculated by applying 
the discount rate used for the scheme liabilities to the net obligation.

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

 – differences between the return on scheme assets and interest 

income included in the income statement;

 – actuarial gains and losses from experience adjustments; and

 – changes in demographic or financial assumptions,

are classified as remeasurements, charged or credited to other 
comprehensive income and recorded in the statement of 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

There is no contractual agreement, or stated policy, for charging the net 
defined benefit cost to participating Group companies. Therefore, the 
parent recognises a charge in the income statement which is equal to 
the contributions payable in the year. The net defined benefit cost for 
these schemes is recognised by the sponsoring employers, Severn 
Trent Water Limited and Hafren Dyfrdwy Cyfyngedig.

(ii) Defined contribution schemes
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to 
the income statement in the period in which they fall due.

r)  Provisions
Provisions are recognised where:

 – there is a present obligation as a result of a past event;

 – it is probable that there will be an outflow of economic benefits to 

settle this obligation; and

 – a reliable estimate of this amount can be made.

Insurance provisions are recognised for claims notified and for claims 
incurred but which have not yet been notified, based on advice from 
the Group’s independent insurance advisers.

Provisions are discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability where the effect 
is material.

s)  Purchase of own shares
Where market purchases of Severn Trent ordinary shares are made 
through an obligating contract, a liability for the present value of the 
redemption amount is recognised and charged to retained earnings. 
Payments for the purchase of shares are charged to the liability 
when made. 

Shares held by the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust that 
have not vested unconditionally by the balance sheet date are deducted 
from shareholders’ funds until such time as they vest.

t)  Borrowings
The accounting policy for borrowings that are the hedged item in a fair 
value hedge is set out in note 2 u) and the accounting policy for lease 
liabilities is set out in note 2 j).

All other borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less issue 
costs. After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method whereby 
interest and issue costs are charged to the income statement and 
added to the carrying value of borrowings at a constant rate in 
proportion to the capital amount outstanding.

Index-linked debt is adjusted for changes in the relevant inflation 
index and changes in value are charged to finance costs in the 
income statement. 

Borrowings denominated in foreign currency are translated to sterling 
at the spot rate on the balance sheet date. Exchange gains or losses 
resulting from this are credited or charged to gains/losses on financial 
instruments in the income statement.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUEDEmbedded derivatives
Where a contract includes terms that cause some of its cash flows to 
vary in a similar way to a derivative financial instrument, that part of the 
contract is considered to be an embedded derivative. 

Embedded derivatives are separated from the contract and measured 
at fair value with gains and losses taken to the income statement if the 
host contract is not an asset within the scope of IFRS 9 and:

 – the risks and characteristics of the embedded derivative are not 

closely related to those of the contract;

 – a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded 

derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and

 – the contract is not carried at fair value with gains and losses reported 

in the income statement.

In all other cases embedded derivatives are accounted for in line with 
the accounting policy for the contract as a whole.

v)  Share based payment
The Group operates a number of equity settled share based 
compensation plans for employees. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense 
over the vesting period of the grant.

The fair value of employee services is determined by reference to the 
fair value of the awards granted, calculated using an appropriate pricing 
model, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. 
The number of awards that are expected to vest takes into account 
non-market vesting conditions including, where appropriate, continuing 
employment by the Group. The charge is adjusted to reflect shares that 
do not vest as a result of failing to meet a non-market condition.

Share based compensation plans are satisfied in shares of the parent 
company. Where the fair value of the awards is not recharged to 
participating Group companies, the parent company records the fair 
value of the awards as an increase in its investment in the subsidiary. 
The investment is adjusted to reflect shares that do not vest as a result 
of failing to meet a non-market based condition.

w)  Cash flow statement
For the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of 
cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. 
Such investments are normally those with less than three months 
maturity from the date of acquisition and include cash and bank 
balances and investments in liquid funds. 

Net cash and cash equivalents include overdrafts repayable on demand 
and amounts drawn under the Group’s revolving credit facility. 

Interest paid in the cash flow statement includes amounts charged to 
the income statement and amounts included in the cost of property, 
plant and equipment.

2  Accounting policies (continued)

u)  Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, including 
accrued interest. Fair value is determined using the methodology 
described in note 34 a). The accounting policy for changes in fair 
value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument. The various accounting policies are described below. 

Interest receivable or payable in respect of derivative financial 
instruments is included in finance income or costs in the 
income statement.

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
Gains or losses arising on remeasurement of derivative financial 
instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are 
recognised in gains/losses on financial instruments in the 
income statement. 

Derivatives designated as hedging instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as cross currency 
swaps, forward currency contracts, energy swaps and interest rate 
swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency, interest rate 
and energy price fluctuations. 

At the inception of each hedge relationship, the Group documents:

 – the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the 

hedged item;

 – its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the 

hedge transaction; and

 – whether changes in fair value or the cash flows of the hedging 

instrument are expected to offset changes in fair values or cash flows 
(as appropriate) of the hedged item. 

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting.

Fair value hedges
Where a loan or borrowing is in a fair value hedging relationship it is 
remeasured for changes in fair value of the hedged risk at the balance 
sheet date, with gains or losses being recognised in gains/losses on 
financial instruments in the income statement. The gain or loss on the 
corresponding hedging instrument is also taken to gains/losses on 
financial instruments in the income statement so that the effective 
portion of the hedge will offset the gain or loss on the hedged item.

If hedge accounting is discontinued, the fair value adjustment arising 
from the hedged risk on the hedged item is amortised to the income 
statement over the anticipated remaining life of the hedged item.

Cash flow hedges
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is 
determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and the 
ineffective portion is charged to gains/losses on financial instruments 
in the income statement. When the gain or loss from the hedged 
underlying transaction is recognised in the income statement, the 
gains or losses on the hedging instrument that have previously been 
recognised in equity are recycled through gains/losses on financial 
instruments in the income statement. 

If hedge accounting is discontinued, any cumulative gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is held in equity 
until the forecast transaction occurs, or transferred to gains/losses 
on financial instruments in the income statement if the forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur. From this point the 
derivative is accounted for in the same way as derivatives not 
designated as hedging instruments. If the hedging instrument is 
terminated, the gains and losses previously recognised in equity 
are held in equity until either the forecast transaction occurs or 
the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.

GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTSGROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS2  Accounting policies (continued)

x)  Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using 
the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business 
combination is measured at fair value. The identifiable assets acquired 
and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the 
acquisition date except that:

 – deferred tax assets or liabilities and retirement benefit assets or 
obligations are recognised and measured in accordance with the 
policies set out under notes 2 e) and 2 q) above; and

 – assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale are 

measured in accordance with the policy set out below.

Where an asset or group of assets (a disposal group) is available for 
immediate sale and the sale is highly probable and expected to occur 
within one year, then the disposal group is classified as held for sale. 
The disposal group is measured at the lower of the carrying amount 
and the fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation is not charged on 
such assets.

Where the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete 
at the end of the reporting period, the Group reports provisional 
amounts and finalises these within one year of the acquisition date 
(the ‘measurement period’). 

Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the 
acquisition date.

During the measurement period, changes in provisional fair values 
of assets and liabilities acquired, or of contingent consideration, 
are recognised as adjustments to goodwill or bargain purchase gain. 
Outside the measurement period, changes in fair value of contingent 
consideration that is not classified as equity are recognised in profit 
or loss. 

3  New accounting policies and future requirements
At the balance sheet date, no Standards or Interpretations were in 
issue but not yet effective that are expected to have a material impact 
on the Group’s financial position.

 Critical accounting judgments and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the Group is 
required to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that it 
believes are reasonable based on the information available. Although 
these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the 
amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from 
those estimates. 

a)  Critical accounting judgments

(i) 

 Classification of costs between operating expenditure and 
capital expenditure

Severn Trent Water’s business involves significant construction and 
engineering projects. Assessing the classification of costs incurred on 
such projects between capital expenditure and operating expenditure 
requires judgments to be made. The judgments are made based on 
objective criteria that the Group has developed to facilitate the 
consistent application of its accounting policies. The costs of like-for-
like replacement of infrastructure components are recognised in the 
income statement as they arise. Total infrastructure renewal 
expenditure during the year was £238.4 million (2022: £198.2 million). 
Expenditure which results in quality or capacity enhancements to the 
operating capability of the infrastructure networks is capitalised and 
amounted to £898.9 million (2022: £714.3 million).

(ii) 

 Income from connections to the water and waste 
water networks

The Group receives income from developers and domestic customers 
for new connections to the water and waste water networks either in 
the form of infrastructure assets or cash. The more significant 
examples of these transactions are:

 – Developers transfer to the Group infrastructure assets that 

they have installed in a new development. Usually there is no 
monetary consideration exchanged when the Group adopts assets 
in this manner.

 – When new properties are connected to the network, the Group is 

permitted, under the Water Industry Act, to obtain a contribution from 
the developer towards the cost of reinforcing its network to meet 
the additional demands arising from the new connections. These 
are referred to as Infrastructure charges. The charges are a 
standard amount per property and are not linked to specific 
reinforcement expenditure.

 – When developers require properties to be connected to the 

Group’s network, the Group installs a meter and connection to each 
property but retains ownership of the assets and responsibility for 
their maintenance.

Assessing whether this income is received in relation to the provision 
of the connection to the Group’s infrastructure networks or is to 
facilitate the ongoing provision of water and waste water services to 
the properties in question requires judgment about the nature of the 
ongoing relationship between the Group and the customer. During the 
period the Group received infrastructure assets with a fair value of 
£105.0 million (2022: £69.0 million), infrastructure charges amounting 
to £21.8 million (2022: £25.0 million) and other charges relating to 
the provision of infrastructure amounting to £20.2 million 
(2022: £17.0 million). 

The Group considers that the purpose of these transactions is to 
facilitate the ongoing provision of water and waste water services to the 
properties in question and they are inextricably linked to that ongoing 
service. There is a transferable right to receive an ongoing water and 
waste water service that passes from customer to customer when the 
property is bought and sold during the life of the property and, without 
the ongoing water and waste water service, the transactions have no 
value. Therefore, in line with our accounting policies the amounts 
received are held on the balance sheet and released to turnover in 
the income statement over the life of the related assets.

 Critical accounting judgments and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty (continued)

a)  Critical accounting judgments (continued)

(iii)  Climate change
The Group continues to develop its assessment of the impact that 
climate change may have on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements. The natural environment in which the Group operates is 
continually changing, and the expected impact on the Group from 
climate change is set out within the ‘Our approach to climate change’ 
section of the Strategic Report on page 39. 

We have considered the impact of the climate change related risks 
to which the Group is exposed in the preparation of these financial 
statements. The risks are long term in nature, and whilst they will 
provide a need for investment in the future, we conclude that there 
is no material impact on the carrying amount of assets or liabilities 
recognised in the financial statements, nor do they lead to any 
additional key sources of estimation or judgment.

b)  Sources of estimation uncertainty 

(i) 

 Depreciation and carrying amounts of property, plant 
and equipment

Calculating the depreciation charge and hence the carrying value for 
property, plant and equipment requires estimates to be made of the 
useful lives of the assets. The estimates are based on engineering data 
and the Group’s experience of similar assets. Details are set out in note 
2 i). The average useful life of property, plant and equipment by asset 
category is detailed as follows:

Land and buildings

Infrastructure assets

Fixed plant and equipment

Moveable plant

The impact on the annual depreciation expense of a 10 per cent increase 
and decrease in useful economic life (‘UEL’) of property, plant and 
equipment by asset category is detailed as follows:

(ii)  Retirement benefit obligations
Determining the amount of the Group’s retirement benefit obligations 
and the net costs of providing such benefits requires assumptions to be 
made concerning long-term interest rates, inflation and longevity of 
current and future pensioners. Changes in these assumptions could 
significantly impact the amount of the obligations or the cost of 
providing such benefits. The Group makes assumptions concerning 
these matters with the assistance of advice from independent qualified 
actuaries. Details of the assumptions made and associated sensitivities 
are set out in note 28 to the financial statements.

(iii)  Expected credit losses on trade receivables
Expected credit losses for trade receivables are based on the historical 
credit losses experienced over the last nine years and reasonable 
forecasts of the future impact of external economic factors on the 
Group’s collection of trade receivables. A number of economic factors 
such as high inflation, rising interest rates and reduction of Government 
support for domestic energy bills might impact household disposable 
income and therefore the expected credit losses on trade receivables. 

The gross carrying amounts and expected credit loss allowances for 
trade receivables and accrued income were as follows:

Gross carrying amount

Provision for bad and doubtful debts

Net carrying amount

The average expected credit loss for the outstanding trade receivables 
and accrued income was 2.25% at 31 March 2023. A change of 10bps in 
the expected credit loss would increase the charge and provision for 
bad and doubtful debts by £10.3 million.

5  Segmental analysis

a)  Background
The Group is organised into two main business segments:

Regulated Water and Waste Water includes the activities of Severn 
Trent Water Limited, except hydro-electric generation and property 
sales, and Hafren Dyfrdwy Cyfyngedig.

Business Services includes the Group’s Operating Services businesses, 
the Green Power business including Severn Trent Water’s hydro-
electric generation, the Property Development business and our other 
non-regulated businesses including affinity products and searches.

The Severn Trent Executive Committee (‘STEC’) is the Group’s chief 
operating decision maker. The reports provided to STEC include 
segmental information prepared on the basis described above. 

Results from interests in our joint venture are not included in the 
segmental reports reviewed by STEC. 

Goodwill is allocated and monitored at the segment level. 

Transactions between reportable segments are included within 
segmental results, assets and liabilities in accordance with Group 
accounting policies. These are eliminated on consolidation. 

The measure of profit or loss that is reported to STEC for the segments 
is PBIT. A segmental analysis of turnover and PBIT is presented below.

Revenue from water and waste water services provided to customers with meters is recognised when the service is provided and is measured 
based on actual meter readings and estimated consumption for the period between the last meter reading and the year end. For customers who 
are not metered, the performance obligation is to stand ready to provide water and waste water services throughout the period. Such customers 
are charged on an annual basis, coterminous with the financial year and revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the financial year. 

Deferred income arising from connections to the Group’s water and waste water networks represents a contract liability and is recognised in line 
with the Group’s accounting policy set out in note 2 and the judgment described in note 4. Changes in the Group’s contract liabilities from deferred 
income in relation to connections were as follows:

water and waste water networks that were satisfied or partially satisfied in previous years (2022: nil). 

Payments for infrastructure charges and other charges relating to connection to the networks occur when the connections are made. The 
performance obligations, including provision of an ongoing water and waste water service, are provided over the life of the relevant property.

The Operating Services business includes a material 25-year contract with multiple performance obligations. Under this contract with the 
Ministry of Defence (‘MoD’), the Group bills the customer based on an inflation-linked volumetric tariff and invoices are payable on normal 
commercial terms. The performance obligations, which are satisfied as the services are performed, are: 

 – operating and maintaining the customer’s infrastructure assets; 

 – upgrading the customer’s infrastructure assets; 

 – administrating the services received from statutory water and sewerage undertakers; and 

 – administrating billing services of the customer’s commercial and Non Base Dependent customers. 

Revenue has been allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation, which is based 
on the forecast costs incurred and expected margin for each obligation. Changes to projected margins are adjusted on a cumulative basis in the 
period that they are identified.

Other than the provision of water and waste water services, there is no direct correlation between the satisfaction of the performance obligations 
and the timing of billing and customer payments. The estimated transaction price for the contract is derived from estimates of the customer’s 
consumption at the contract tariff rate, adjusted for inflation. This estimate is updated on an annual basis. The estimated transaction price has 
increased from 31 March 2022 as a result of increased inflation and consumption. At 31 March 2023 the aggregate amount of the estimated 
transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were not satisfied was £372.5 million (2022: £396.3 million). This amount is expected 
to be recognised as revenue as follows:

Borrowing costs of £56.6 million (2022: £34.5 million) incurred on funding eligible capital projects have been capitalised at an interest rate of 5.4% 
(2022: 4.11%). Tax relief of £10.7 million (2022: £6.5 million) was claimed on these costs which has created tax losses carried forward, offset by a 
related deferred tax asset of £14.1 million (2022: £8.6 million).

The most significant factor impacting the Group’s current tax charge is the difference between the depreciation charged on property, plant and 
equipment in the financial statements and the amount deductible from taxable profits in the form of capital allowances. Where the assets qualify 
for capital allowances this creates a temporary difference and deferred tax is recognised on the difference between the carrying amount of the 
asset and the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes in future years. Changes in the amount of deferred tax recognised on these assets 
are charged or credited to deferred tax in the income statement. Where the amount of the capital allowances received is greater than the 
depreciation charged this is referred to as accelerated capital allowances.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED12  Taxation (continued)

b)  Factors affecting the tax charge in the year (continued)
On 3 March 2021, the UK Government announced the introduction of a capital allowance ‘super deduction’ which gave an in-year capital allowance 
of 130% on the cost of plant and machinery qualifying for the relief between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2023 and an acceleration of capital 
allowances on the cost of assets qualifying for special rate allowances. The introduction of these changes meant the Group was eligible to claim 
more capital allowances in the last two years to the extent that the Group was not liable to pay corporation tax for those years. 

Certain of the Group’s property, plant and equipment assets are not eligible for capital allowances under current legislation. Therefore there is 
no tax deduction that corresponds to the depreciation charged on these assets and deferred tax is not recognised in respect of this permanent 
difference.

The 30% allowance in excess of the cost of assets qualifying for the super deduction will never be charged as depreciation in the financial 
statements and therefore this represents a permanent difference between profits recognised in the income statement and taxable profits.

Other permanent differences comprise expenditure that is not deductible for tax purposes or income that is not taxable.

Other temporary differences comprise items other than depreciation of property, plant and equipment where the amount is included in the 
tax computation in a different period from when it is recognised in the income statement. Deferred tax is provided on these items.

The amounts included for tax assets in the financial statements include estimates and judgments relating to uncertain tax positions. If the 
computations subsequently submitted to HMRC include different amounts then these differences are reflected as an adjustment in respect 
of prior years in the subsequent financial statements.

Deferred tax is provided at 25%, the rate that is expected to apply when the asset or liability is expected to be settled. Further details are 
provided in note 26.

c)  Tax (credited)/charged directly to other comprehensive income or equity
No current tax has been charged or credited to other comprehensive income or equity. The following amounts of deferred tax have been (credited)/

14  Earnings/(loss) per share

a)  Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year, excluding treasury shares and those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust, which are treated 
as cancelled.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the 
Company’s shares during the period. Potential ordinary shares are not treated as dilutive if their conversion does not decrease earnings per share 
or increase loss per share.

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated on the basis of profit attributable to the owners of the Company.

The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following:

i)  Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share

Profit/(loss) for the period

ii)  Number of shares

Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share

Adjusted earnings per share figures are presented for continuing operations. These exclude the effects of net gains/losses on financial 
instruments, current tax on net gains/losses on financial instruments, and deferred tax in both 2023 and 2022. The Directors consider that the 
adjusted figures provide a useful additional indicator of performance. The denominators used in the calculations of adjusted basic and diluted 
earnings per share are the same as those used in the unadjusted figures set out above except that the number of ordinary shares for the purpose 
of the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 March 2022 is 249.3 million as this includes 1.4 million dilutive potential ordinary 
shares from share options and LTIPs.

The adjustments to earnings that are made in calculating adjusted earnings per share are as follows: 

Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share

On 8 February 2023, Severn Trent Services Operations UK Limited acquired 100% of the issued share capital of M A solutions (Lindum) Ltd for a 
total consideration of £1.6 million, of which £0.8 million is cash consideration and the remainder deferred consideration.

The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method. Goodwill of £1.3 million was recognised, attributable to the anticipated future 
opportunities and outperformance arising as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill valuation was based on management’s best estimates of the 
fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, which was estimated at £0.3m. 

Goodwill relates to specific cash-generating units (CGUs) hence no allocation of goodwill is required. A summary of the carrying amount of 
goodwill by CGU is presented below.

Regulated Water and Waste Water also has an intangible asset with indefinite useful life amounting to £4.3 million (2022: £4.3 million). This is 
reviewed for impairment as part of the Regulated Water and Waste Water impairment review, set out in note 15 a) below.

a) Regulated Water and Waste Water
On 1 July 2018 Instruments of appointments of Severn Trent Water Limited and Hafren Dyfrdwy Cyfyngedig (formerly Dee Valley Water Limited) 
were amended to align the areas for which the appointments were made with the national border of England and Wales. As a result, the business 
that the goodwill relates to is now partly in Severn Trent Water and partly Hafren Dyfrdwy consequently this goodwill is allocated to the Regulated 
Water and Waste Water cash-generating unit.

The Group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill for impairment in accordance with the policy stated in note 2. The carrying value of the 
Regulated Water and Waste Water CGU was determined on the basis of fair value, through a level 3 valuation, less costs to sell. 

The fair value, determined using a discounted cash flow calculation for the Regulated Water and Waste Water segment is based on the most recent 
financial projections available for the business, which cover the five-year period to 31 March 2028. 

The key assumptions underlying these projections are the cash flows in the projections and the following:

Discount rate

RPI long-term inflation

CPI long-term inflation

Growth rate in the period beyond the detailed projections

%

6.5

3.0

2.0

1.5

The discount rate is an estimate for the weighted average cost of capital at the year end date based on the post-tax WACC detailed in the Ofwat 
PR19 final determination adjusted for market changes. The rate disclosed above is the equivalent pre-tax nominal rate.

Inflation has been included in the detailed projections at 3.0% and 2.0% for RPI and CPI respectively, based on the Bank of England’s target rate 
for CPI.

Cash flows beyond the end of the five-year period are extrapolated using an assumed real growth rate of 1.5% in the Group’s regulatory capital 
base, based on past experience and external factors likely to drive long-term growth in the regulatory capital base.

The fair value less costs to sell for the CGU exceeded its carrying value by £2,534.4 million. An increase in the discount rate to 7.1% or a reduction 
in the growth rate in the period beyond the detailed projections to 0.7% would reduce the recoverable amount to the carrying amount of the CGU.

b) Green Power
On 30 November 2018, the Group acquired Agrivert Holdings and its subsidiary undertakings resulting in goodwill of £29.2 million. This goodwill 
has been allocated to the Green Power South cash-generating unit which is determined to be the lowest level of independent cash flows relating to 
the goodwill. Green Power South is included within the Green Power part of the Business Services segment. 

The Group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill for impairment in accordance with the policy stated in note 2. The carrying value of the 
Green Power South CGU was determined on the basis of a value in use calculation. 

The value in use determined using a discounted cash flow calculation for the Green Power South CGU is based on the most recent financial 
projections available for the business to 2028. 

The key assumptions underlying these projections are the cash flows in the projections and:

Key assumption

Discount rate

Growth rate in the period beyond the detailed projections

%

7.8

2.0

The discount rate was based on a review of a range of external sources of information about the cost of capital for the Severn Trent energy 
business. This rate was then converted to the equivalent pre-tax discount rate disclosed above.

Cash flows beyond the end of the five-year period are extrapolated using assumed growth of 2.0% in the Group’s free cash flows, informed 
through external market trends.

The value in use for the CGU exceeded its carrying value by £19.2 million. An increase in the discount rate to 9.0% or reduction in the growth rate in 
the period beyond the detailed projections to 1.2% would reduce the recoverable amount to the carrying amount of the CGU.

a)  The Group’s leasing activities
The Group leases various properties, equipment and vehicles. Lease agreements are typically made for fixed periods of up to 999 years but may

On 23 April 2021, the Group extinguished the £32.5 million Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’) previously extended to Water Plus, and replaced this 
with a subscription for £32.5 million of equity shares in Water Plus Group Limited at par. The carrying value of the loan receivable was reclassified 
to investment in joint venture. 

During the current year, Water Plus broke even (2022: loss of £4.4m).

As at 31 March 2023 and 2022 the joint venture did not have any significant contingent liabilities to which the Group was exposed and, other than 
those set out below, the Group did not have any significant contingent liabilities in relation to its interests in the joint venture. The Group had no

Prepayments include unamortised success fees paid as a result of winning the MoD contract (see note 6) amounting to £4.3 million 
(2022: £4.8 million). The costs are being amortised on a straight line basis over the life of the contract. 

The carrying values of trade and other receivables are reasonable approximations of their fair values.

a)  Credit risk

(i)  Trade receivables and accrued income
Credit control policies and procedures are determined at the individual business unit level. By far the most significant business unit of the Group is 
Severn Trent Water Limited, which represents 91% of Group turnover and 89% of net trade receivables. Severn Trent Water has a statutory 
obligation to provide water and waste water services to domestic customers within its region. Therefore there is no concentration of credit risk 
with respect to its trade receivables from these services and the credit quality of its customer base reflects the wealth and prosperity of all of the 
domestic households within its region.

In the current and prior year, the Group’s joint venture, Water Plus, was the largest retailer for non-domestic customers in the Severn Trent 
region. The trade receivables and amounts shown as loans receivable from joint ventures are disclosed within note 41, Related party transactions. 
Credit risk is considered separately for trade receivables due from Water Plus and is considered immaterial as amounts outstanding are paid 
within 30 days.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected credit loss allowance for all 
trade receivables, contract assets and accrued income.

A collective provision is recorded for expected credit losses against assets for which no specific provision has been made. Expected credit losses 
for trade receivables are based on the historical credit losses experienced over the last nine years and reasonable forecasts of the future impact 
of external economic factors on the Group’s collection of trade receivables.

Debts are written off when there is no realistic expectation of further collection and enforcement activity has ceased. There were no amounts 
outstanding on receivables written off and still subject to enforcement activity (2022: nil). 

(ii)  Contract assets
The contract assets represent the Group’s right to receive consideration from the MoD for services provided. On that basis the Group considers 
that the credit risk in relation to these assets is immaterial and therefore no provision for expected credit losses has been recognised (2022: nil).

(iii)  Loan receivable from joint venture
As well as trade receivables from Water Plus the Group has advanced loans to its joint venture. These loans are assessed for impairment under 
the two stage impairment model in IFRS 9.

b)  Expected credit loss allowance

(i)  Trade receivables and accrued income
The expected credit loss at 31 March 2023 and 2022 was as set out below. The loss allowance is based on historical credit losses adjusted for 
expected changes in cash collection. The loss rate disclosed is calculated by applying the loss allowance to the gross carrying amount for each 
age category.

(ii)  Loan receivable from joint venture
In previous years, the Group has determined that there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since inception relating to its loans 
receivable of £76.4 million (2022: £80.7 million) from Water Plus, in the light of significant losses incurred by Water Plus. Following a breakeven 
position from Water Plus in the current year, the Group determines that there continues to be credit risk since inception on the loan receivable 
balance from Water Plus. The Group has therefore assessed the lifetime expected credit loss of its loans to Water Plus at 31 March 2023 based on 
Water Plus’s financial projections. The Group has maintained the expected credit loss provision at £1.1 million (2022: £1.1 million) resulting in a net 
loan receivable of £75.3 million (2022: £79.6 million).

Deferred tax is provided at the rate that is expected to apply when the asset or liability is expected to be settled. On 3 March 2021, the UK 
Government announced an increase in the rate of corporation tax from 19% to 25%, effective 1 April 2023. Deferred tax assets and liabilities were 
therefore remeasured at 1 April 2021 at the new rate of 25%. This resulted in an exceptional deferred tax charge in the income statement for 2022 
of £294.4 million and a credit to reserves amounting to £8.4 million.

27  Retirement benefit schemes

a)  Defined benefit pension schemes

(i)  Background
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes. The Severn Trent Pension Scheme and the Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension 
Scheme closed to future accrual on 31 March 2015, while the Dee Valley Water Limited Section of the Water Companies Pension Scheme, which is 
a sectionalised scheme, currently remains open to accrual. 

The defined benefit pension schemes cover increases in accrued benefits arising from inflation and pension increases. Their assets are held in 
separate funds administered by Trustees. The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes’ beneficiaries. A formal actuarial 
valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the Trustees at triennial intervals by an independent professionally qualified actuary. Under 
the defined benefit pension schemes, members are entitled to retirement benefits calculated by reference to their pensionable service and 
pensionable salary history, with inflationary pension increases applying in line with the scheme rules. The defined benefit pension schemes and 
the dates of their last completed formal actuarial valuations as at the accounting date are as follows:

Severn Trent Pension Scheme (STPS)*

Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension Scheme (STMIPS)

Water Companies Pension Scheme – Dee Valley Water Limited Section (DVWS)

* 

The STPS is by far the largest of the Group’s UK defined benefit schemes, comprising over 90% of the Group’s overall defined benefit obligations.

Date of last formal 
actuarial valuation

31 March 2022

31 March 2022

The defined benefit scheme assets have been updated to reflect their market value at 31 March 2023. Actuarial gains and losses on the scheme 
assets and defined benefit obligations have been reported in the statement of comprehensive income. Service cost, and the costs of administrating 
the scheme, are recognised in operating costs and interest cost is recognised in net finance costs.

In June 2021, the STMIPS Trustees completed the purchase of a bulk annuity contract with JUST, an insurance company, to secure the benefits of all members of the STMIPS. The Trustees 
continue to pay benefits to members as before the transaction, but these cashflows are now matched exactly by income from JUST. In March 2023, the DVWS also entered into a bulk 
annuity buy-in investment policy with JUST that covers the majority of the scheme obligations.

Most of the assets have quoted prices in active markets, but there are equities, annuity policies, corporate bonds and LDI investments which are 
unquoted amounting to £419.0 million (2022: £496.0 million).

The Group has an obligation to pay pensions to a number of former employees, whose benefits would otherwise have been restricted by the 
Finance Act 1989 earnings cap. Provision for such benefits amounting to £6.5 million (2022: £7.9 million) is included as an unfunded scheme within 
the retirement benefit obligation.

The Group has assessed that it has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus assets in each of the Schemes following settlement of all 
obligations to Scheme members and therefore the surplus in the DVWS has been recognised in full.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED27  Retirement benefit schemes (continued)

a)  Defined benefit pension schemes (continued)

(iv)   Actuarial risk factors
The schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, inflation risk and longevity risk for so long as the benefits are 
not insured.

Investment risk
The Group’s contributions to the schemes are based on actuarial calculations which make assumptions about the returns expected from the 
schemes’ investments. If the investments underperform these assumptions in the long term then the Group may need to make additional 
contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benefits. 

Each scheme’s investment strategy seeks to balance the level of investment return sought with the aim of reducing volatility and risk. In 
undertaking this approach, reference is made to both the maturity of the liabilities and the funding level of that scheme. A number of further 
strategies are employed to manage underlying risks, including liability-matching asset strategies, diversification of asset portfolios and interest 
rate hedging. 

Currently the STPS has a balanced approach to investment in equity securities, debt instruments and real estates. Due to the long-term nature of 
the scheme liabilities, the Group and the STPS Trustees consider it appropriate to invest a portion of the scheme assets in equity securities and in 
real estate to leverage the return generated by the fund. The STMIPS and DVWS are now primarily invested in bulk annuity insurance contracts 
with JUST, with a small residual amount of invested assets remaining.

Inflation risk
The benefits payable to members of the schemes are linked to inflation measured by the RPI or CPI, subject to caps. The Group’s contributions to 
the schemes are based on assumptions about the future level of inflation. If inflation is higher than the levels assumed in the actuarial calculations 
then the Group may need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benefits. 

The schemes use LDIs within the asset portfolios to hedge against the value of liabilities changing as a result of movements in long-term interest 
rate and inflation expectations. This structure allows the schemes to both hedge against these risks and retain capital investment in assets that 
are expected to generate higher returns. 

Longevity risk
The Group’s contributions to the schemes are based on assumptions about the life expectancy of scheme members after retirement. If scheme 
members live longer than assumed in the actuarial calculations then the Group may need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order 
to fund the payment of accrued benefits.

(v)  Actuarial assumptions
The major financial assumptions used in the accounting valuation of the obligations for the STPS which represents by far the largest defined 
benefit obligation for the Group were as follows: 

Price inflation – RPI

Price inflation – CPI

Discount rate

Pension increases in payment

Pension increases in deferment

The assumption for RPI inflation is derived with reference to the difference between the yields on longer-term fixed rate gilts and on index-linked 
gilts. RPI is expected to be more closely aligned with CPI from 2030 onwards, which is reflected in the corresponding assumption for CPI inflation.

In setting the discount rate, we construct a yield curve. Short dated yields are taken from market rates for AA corporate bonds. Long-dated yields 
for the curve are based on the average yield available on all long-dated AA corporate bonds. We project the expected cash flows of the schemes 
and adopt a single equivalent cash flow weighted discount rate taking account of this constructed yield curve.

(v)  Actuarial assumptions (continued)
The mortality base table assumptions are based on those used in the latest triennial funding valuation of the STPS. The mortality assumptions 
adopted at the year end for accounting purposes and the life expectancies at age 60 implied by the assumptions are as follows:

The calculation of the scheme obligations is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions and in particular to the assumptions relating to discount rate, 
price inflation (capped, where relevant) and mortality. The following table summarises the estimated impact on the Group’s obligations from 
changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.

Assumption

Discount rate1 

Price inflation2

Mortality3

Change in assumption

Impact on disclosed obligations

Increase/decrease by 0.1% pa

Decrease/increase by £26 million

Increase/decrease by 0.1% pa

Increase/decrease by £21 million

Increase in life expectancy by 1 year

Increase by £72 million

1  A change in discount rate is likely to occur as a result of changes in bond yields and as such would be expected to be offset to a significant degree by a change in the value of the bond assets 

held by the schemes.
The projected impact resulting from a change in RPI reflects the underlying effect on pensions in payment, pensions in deferment and resultant pension increases. This would be expected 
to be offset by returns on LDI assets within the asset portfolios used to hedge against the value of liabilities, as set out in the inflation risk section of note 34(d). 
The change in this assumption reflects the risk that life expectancy rates might increase.

2 

3 

In reality inter-relationships exist between the assumptions, particularly between the discount rate and price inflation. The above analysis does 
not take into account the effect of these inter-relationships. Also, in practice any movement in obligations arising from assumption changes are 
likely to be accompanied by movements in asset values – and so the impact on the accounting deficit may be lower than the impact on the 
obligations shown above.

In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit 
method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the 
balance sheet. 

(vi)   Effect on future cash flows
Contribution rates are set in consultation with the Trustees for each Scheme and each participating employer. 

The average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the year is 13 years for STPS, 10 years for STMIPS and 12 years for DVWS. 

The most recently completed formal triennial actuarial valuations and funding agreements were carried out as at 31 March 2022 for the STPS and 
STMIPS and 31 March 2020 for DVWS. As a result of the STPS actuarial valuation, annual deficit reduction contributions of £34.2 million were 
agreed, with the March 2023 payment having been increased in line with the annual increase in CPI to November 2022. Thereafter, future 
contributions for the STPS will also increase in line with CPI inflation until March 2027. The first two contributions in March 2023 and March 2024 
are payable directly into the STPS and it is expected that payments in future years will be payable to a limited liability partnership that the Group 
and Trustee are in the process of setting up. 

Payments of £8.2 million per annum through an asset backed funding arrangement will also continue to 31 March 2032 for the STPS. Further 
inflation linked payments of £15.0 million per annum are being made through an additional asset backed funding arrangement, with payments 
having started in the financial year ending 31 March 2018 and continuing to 31 March 2031. These contributions will cease earlier should a 
subsequent valuation of the STPS show that they are no longer needed. There are no deficit reduction contributions payable by the Group for 
STMIPS and DVWS. 

b)  Defined contribution pension schemes
The Group also operates the Severn Trent Group Personal Pension, a defined contribution scheme, for its UK employees. 

The total cost charged to operating costs of £22.4 million (2022: £28.1 million) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at 
rates specified in the rules of the scheme. As at 31 March 2023, no contributions (2022: nil) in respect of the current reporting period were owed to 
the schemes.

Hafren Dyfrdwy operates two defined contribution pension schemes, neither of which were material in either the current or prior year.

32  Capital management
The Group’s principal objectives in managing capital are:

 – to maintain a flexible and sustainable balance sheet structure;

 – to maintain an investment grade credit rating;

 – to access a broad range of sources of finance to obtain both the quantum required and lowest cost compatible with the need for continued 

availability;

 – to manage exposure to movements in interest rates to provide an appropriate degree of certainty as to its cost of funds; 

 – to minimise exposure to counterparty credit risk; and

 – to provide the Group with an appropriate degree of certainty as to its foreign exchange exposure.

The Group seeks to achieve a balance of long-term funding or commitment of funds across a range of funding sources at the best possible 
economic cost. The Group monitors future funding requirements and credit market conditions to ensure continued availability of funds.

The Group has continued to monitor market conditions and limit its exposure to floating interest rate debt, which comprises 5% (2022: 4%) of 
our gross debt portfolio at the balance sheet date, with a further 28% (2022: 27%) of index-linked debt and 67% (2022: 69%) of fixed rate debt.

Exposure to credit risk (excluding credit risk relating to amounts receivable from contracts with customers) is set out in note 34 b).

Foreign exchange risk is set out in note 34 a) (ii).

The Group has the following credit ratings:

A key metric in measuring financial sustainability and capital efficiency for companies in the water sector is RCV gearing. This is measured as 
Severn Trent Water Group’s net debt plus Hafren Dyfrdwy Cyfyngedig’s net debt divided by their combined RCV. Amongst other considerations, the 
Group takes into account Ofwat assumption at the Price Review (60% for AMP 7). At 31 March 2023 the Group’s RCV gearing ratio based on the RCV 
in the Final Determination for AMP7 (FD RCV) was 60.7% (2022: 59.5%). The FD RCV excludes expenditure that was not in the PR19 Business Plan 
such as our Green Recovery Programme. This expenditure will be included in the opening RCV for AMP8. Where the expenditure has been 
incurred but is not yet included in the RCV, there is a mismatch in the RCV gearing ratio. We therefore also monitor our shadow RCV gearing ratio 
which adjusts the RCV for expenditure already incurred but not yet included in the RCV. The shadow RCV gearing ratio at 31 March 2023 was 60.0% 
(2022: 59.2%). 

The Group’s dividend policy is a key tool in achieving its capital management objectives. This policy is reviewed and updated in line with Severn 
Trent Water’s five year price control cycle and takes into account, inter alia, the planned investment programme, the appropriate gearing level 
achieving a balance between an efficient cost of capital and retaining an investment grade credit rating and delivering an attractive and 
sustainable return to shareholders. The Board has decided to set the 2022/23 dividend at 106.82 pence, an increase of 4.6% compared to the 
total dividend for 2021/22 of 102.14 pence. Our policy is to grow the dividend annually at no less than CPIH until March 2025.

Future cash flows on the RPI leg of the instrument are estimated based on

Both legs are discounted using observable swap rates at the period end, at a

Index-linked loans are rarely traded and quoted prices are not considered a reliable indicator of fair value. Therefore, these loans are valued using 
discounted cash flow models with discount rates derived from observed market prices for a sample of bonds, which is a Level 2 valuation 
technique.

Fair values of the other debt instruments are also calculated using discounted cash flow models with discount rates derived from observed 
market prices, which is a Level 2 valuation technique. 

34  Risks arising from financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: 

 – market risk (including interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and other price risk);

 – credit risk;

 – liquidity risk; and

 – inflation risk. 

The Group’s overall risk management programme addresses the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance or position.

Financial risks are managed by a central treasury department (‘Group Treasury’) under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board 
has established a Treasury Committee to monitor treasury activities and to facilitate timely responses to changes in market conditions when 
necessary. Group Treasury operates under the Group’s Treasury Procedures Manual and Policy Statement and identifies, evaluates and hedges 
financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. The Board defines written principles for overall risk management, as well as 
written policies covering specific areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of derivative and non-derivative 
financial instruments. The Group’s policy is that derivative financial instruments are not held for trading but may be used to mitigate the Group’s 
exposure to financial risk. The types of derivative instruments held and the related risks are described below.

Interest rate swaps are held to mitigate the Group’s exposure to changes in market interest rates. Further details are set out in section a) (i) and 
note 35 b) (i).

Cross currency swaps are held to mitigate the Group’s exposure to exchange rate movements on amounts borrowed in foreign currencies. 
Further details are set out in section a) (ii) and note 35 a) (i).

Energy swaps are held to mitigate the Group’s exposure to changes in wholesale energy prices. Further details are provided in note 35 b) (ii).

Severn Trent Water, the Group’s most significant business unit, operates under a regulatory environment where its prices are linked to inflation 
measured by CPIH. In order to mitigate the risks to cash flow and earnings arising from fluctuations in CPIH, the Group holds debt instruments 
where the principal repayable and interest cost is linked to RPI/CPI/CPIH and the Group holds RPI/CPI swaps to mitigate the risk of divergence 
between RPI and CPIH.

a)  Market risk
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, exchange rates. The nature of these risks and the steps that the 
Group has taken to manage them are described below. 

Interest rate risk

(i) 
The Group’s annual income and its operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s interest 
rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. 

Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to the risk of adverse cash flow impacts from increases in interest rates. 

Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to the risk of interest costs above the market rate when interest rates decrease. 

The Group’s policy is to maintain 40% to 70% of its interest-bearing liabilities in fixed rate instruments during AMP7. In measuring this metric, 
management makes adjustments to the carrying value of debt to better reflect the amount that interest is calculated on. Details of the 
adjustments made are set out below:

Net debt (note 37)

Cash and cash equivalents

Loans receivable from joint venture

Cross currency swaps included in net debt at fair value

Fair value hedge accounting adjustments

Exchange on currency debt not hedge accounted

The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by borrowing at fixed or index-linked rates or by using interest rate swaps. Under these swaps 
the Group receives variable rate interest and pays fixed rate interest calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts. In practice 
the swaps are settled by transferring the net amount. These swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from variable rates to fixed 
rates. The Group has entered into a series of these interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments beyond 2030.

a)  Market risk (continued)

 (i)  Interest rate risk (continued)
The following tables show analyses of the Group’s interest bearing financial liabilities by type of interest. Debt which is hedged by interest rate 
swaps or cross currency swaps is included in the category after taking account of the impact of the swap. Debt raised in foreign currencies has 
been included at the notional sterling value of the payable leg of the corresponding cross currency swap since this is the amount that is exposed to 
changes in interest rates. 

Valuation adjustments that do not impact the amount on which interest is calculated, such as fair value hedge accounting adjustments, are 
excluded from this analysis. 

The net principal amount of unhedged swaps is shown as an adjustment to floating rate and fixed rate debt to demonstrate the impact of the swaps 
on the amount of liabilities bearing fixed interest.

(ii)  Exchange rate risk
Except for debt raised in foreign currency, which is hedged, the Group’s business does not involve significant exposure to foreign exchange 
transactions. Substantially all of the Group’s profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to 
changes in exchange rates, and therefore the sensitivity of the Group’s results to changes in exchange rates is not material.

Certain of the Group’s subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation. Exchange risks 
relating to such operations are not material but are managed centrally by Group Treasury through forward exchange contracts to buy or sell 
currency. These contracts led to nil charge (2022: nil) in the income statement.

The Group has raised debt denominated in currencies other than sterling to meet its objective of accessing a broad range of sources of finance. 
The Group mitigated its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by entering into cross currency swaps at the time that the debt was drawn down to 
swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on SONIA. 

Where the terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt, the swaps are expected to be effective hedges, 
hence the swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges. The notional value and fair value of these swaps is shown in note 35 a) (i).

The Group also has cross currency swaps with a sterling notional value of £98.3 million (2022: £98.3 million) which are not accounted for as fair 
value hedges. Economically these swaps act to mitigate the exchange rate risk of debt within the Group which is denominated in foreign currency 
and also swap the interest from fixed rate to floating, but they are not designated hedges under IFRS 9. This has led to income of £7.1 million 
(2022: charge of £2.3 million) in the income statement, as well as an exchange loss of £7.4 million (2022: loss of £6.6 million) on the underlying 
debt.

The Group’s gross and net currency exposures arising from currency borrowings are summarised in the tables below. These show, in the relevant 
currency, the amount borrowed and the notional principal of the related swap or forward contract. The net position shows the Group’s exposure to 
exchange rate risk in relation to its currency borrowings.

b)  Credit risk
Operationally the Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to 
customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited and Hafren Dyfrdwy Cyfyngedig, whose operating licences 
oblige them to supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid. Amounts provided against accounts receivable and movements 
on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 21. 

Cash deposits and derivative contracts are only placed with high credit quality financial institutions, which have been approved by the Board. 
Group Treasury monitors the credit quality of the approved financial institutions and the list of financial institutions that may be used is approved 
annually by the Board. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. 

Credit risk analysis
At 31 March the aggregate credit limits of authorised counterparties and the amounts held on short term deposits were as follows:

GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTSGROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS34  Risks arising from financial instruments (continued)

c)  Liquidity risk (continued)
Index-linked debt includes loans with maturities up to 50 years. The principal is revalued at fixed intervals and is linked to movements in the RPI, 
CPI or CPIH. Interest payments are made biannually based on the revalued principal. The principal repayment equals the revalued amount at 
maturity. The payments included in the table above are estimates based on the forward inflation rates published by the Bank of England at the 
balance sheet date.

(iii)  Cash flows from derivative financial instruments
The following tables show the estimated cash flows that will arise from the Group’s derivative financial instruments. The tables are based on the 
undiscounted net cash inflows/(outflows) on the derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows/
(outflows) on those derivatives that require gross settlement. When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been 
determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates derived from the forward curves existing at the balance sheet date. 
Actual amounts may be significantly different from those indicated below.

Inflation risk

d) 
The Group’s principal operating subsidiary, Severn Trent Water, operates under a regulatory environment where its prices are linked to inflation 
as measured by CPIH. Its operating profits and cash flows are therefore exposed to changes in inflation. In order to mitigate and partially offset 
this risk, Severn Trent Water has raised debt that pays interest at a fixed coupon based on a principal amount that is adjusted for the change in 
inflation during the life of the debt instrument (‘index-linked debt’). The amount of index-linked debt at the balance sheet date is shown in section 
a) (i) Interest rate risk, and the estimated future cash flows relating to this debt are shown in section c) (ii) Cash flows from non-derivative 
financial instruments.

Ofwat is moving the measure of inflation used in the economic regulatory model from RPI to CPIH over a period of time. In anticipation of this the 
Group has entered into CPI/RPI swaps with a notional value of £350 million (2022: £350 million) in order to mitigate the risk of divergence between 
inflation measured by CPIH and that measured by RPI.

Inflation rate sensitivity analysis
The finance cost of the Group’s index-linked debt instruments varies with changes in CPI/CPIH/RPI rather than interest rates. The sensitivity at 
31 March of the Group’s profit and equity to changes in CPI/CPIH/RPI is set out in the following table. This analysis relates to financial instruments 
only and excludes any CPI/CPIH/RPI impact on Severn Trent Water’s revenues and Regulatory Capital Value, or accounting for defined benefit 
pension schemes.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
35  Hedge accounting 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates. Hedge accounting is adopted 
for such instruments where the criteria set out in IFRS 9 are met. Hedge ineffectiveness arises from credit risk, which is not hedged.

a)  Fair value hedges

(i)  Cross currency swaps
The Group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling. Cross currency swaps are entered into at the time that the debt is drawn 
down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing in order to mitigate the Group’s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. Where the terms of 
the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt, the swaps are expected to be effective hedges. 

At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges were as follows:

Euro

US dollar

Yen

(i) Interest rate swaps
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate 
amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on 
future cash flow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt. Where the hedge is expected to be highly effective these interest rate swaps are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges.

The Group recognised a loss on hedge ineffectiveness of £1.3 million (2022: loss of £0.6 million) in gains/losses on financial instruments in the 
income statement in relation to interest rate swaps.

(ii) Energy swaps
The Group enters into a series of energy swaps under which it agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and market prices of electricity at 
six-monthly intervals. No such energy swaps are currently active and the risk of changes in wholesale energy prices in the next year is managed 
through physical contracts.

36  Share based payment
The Group operates a number of share based remuneration schemes for employees. During the year, the Group recognised total expenses of 
£9.5 million (2022: £8.3 million) related to equity settled share based payment transactions.

The weighted average share price during the period was £27.65 (2022: £27.30).

At 31 March 2023, there were no options exercisable (2022: none) under any of the share based remuneration schemes.

a)  Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Under the LTIP, conditional awards of shares may be made to executive directors and senior staff. Awards are subject to performance conditions 
and continued employment throughout the vesting period. 

(i)  Awards made under the LTIP
The 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 LTIP awards are subject to Severn Trent Water’s achievement of Return on Regulatory Equity in excess of the base 
return included within the Final Determinations over a three year vesting period. It has been assumed that performance against the LTIP 
non-market conditions will be 100% (2022: 100%).

Expected volatility is measured over the three years prior to the date of grant of the awards or share options. 

Volatility has been calculated based on historical share price movements.

The risk free rate is derived from yields at the grant date of gilts of similar duration to the awards or share options.

The dividend yield is calculated using the expected dividend for the year divided by the share price at the date of grant.

a)  Bonds and guarantees
Group undertakings have entered into bonds and guarantees in the normal course of business. No liability (2022: nil) is expected to arise in 
respect of either bonds or guarantees.

b)  Claims under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 regarding property searches
Since 2016, the Group has received letters of claim from a number of groups of personal search companies (PSCs) which allege that the 
information held by Severn Trent Water Limited (STW) used to produce the CON29DW residential and also the commercial water and drainage 
search reports sold by Severn Trent Property Solutions Limited (STPS), is disclosable under the Environmental Information Regulations. In April 
2020, a group of over 100 PSCs commenced litigation against all water and sewerage undertakers in England and Wales, including STW and STPS. 
The claimants are seeking damages, on the basis that STW and STPS charged for information which should have been made available either free, 
or for a limited charge, under the Environmental Information Regulations. STW and STPS are defending this claim. This is an industry-wide issue 
and the litigation is in progress. A timetable for the claim has recently been set by the court leading up to a stage 1 trial on the EIR legal issues only 
(not the other issues or amount of damages) which is scheduled to be held in November 2023. 

c)  Ongoing combined sewer overflow investigations
Ofwat and the Environment Agency are each conducting their own investigations into the waste water industry, to investigate compliance with the 
conditions of environmental permits. Ofwat has launched specific enforcement investigations against six sewerage companies, but Severn Trent is 
not included in those cases. The Environment Agency’s investigation of all English sewerage companies is continuing and it is not yet clear what 
the outcome of those investigations will be. We have responded quickly and comprehensively to all questions from the regulators and have had 
open conversations with them on the issues under investigation.

42  Alternative performance measures (APMs)
Financial measures or metrics used in this report that are not defined by IFRS are alternative performance measures (‘APM’s). The Group uses 
such measures for performance analysis because they provide additional useful information on the performance and position of the Group. Since 
the Group defines its own APMs, these might not be directly comparable with other companies’ APMs. These measures are not intended to be a 
substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements.

a)  Exceptional items
Exceptional items are income or expenditure which individually or, in aggregate if of a similar type, should, in the opinion of the Directors, be 
disclosed by virtue of their size or nature if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view. In this context, materiality is assessed at the 
segment level. There were no exceptional items in the years ended 31 March 2023 and 2022.

b)  Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share figures exclude the effects of net gains/losses on financial instruments, current tax on net gains/losses on financial 
instruments and deferred tax. The Directors consider that the adjusted figures provide a useful additional indicator of performance and remove 
non-performance related distortions. See note 14.

c)  Net debt
Net debt comprises borrowings including remeasurements for changes in fair value of amounts in fair value hedging relationships, cross 
currency swaps that are used to fix the sterling liability of foreign currency borrowings (whether hedge accounted or not), net cash and cash 
equivalents, and loans to joint ventures. See note 37.

This APM is used to remove distortions in the tax charge and create a metric consistent with the calculation of adjusted earnings per share in 
note 14. Share of net (profit)/loss of joint ventures is excluded from the calculation because the (profit)/loss is included after tax and so the tax on 
joint venture profits is not included in the current tax charge.

For details of employee share schemes and options granted over the shares of the Company, see note 36 of the Group financial statements. Details 
of options exercised and awards vesting during the year and of the weighted average share price of the Company during the year are also disclosed 
in that note.

12  Pensions

Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes, of which some employees of the Company are members. There is no contractual agreement 
for charging the net defined benefit cost of these schemes between the companies that participate in the schemes. As a result, the net defined 
benefit cost of the scheme is recognised in the financial statements of the sponsoring employer, Severn Trent Water Limited. The scheme closed 
to future accrual on 31 March 2015. The cost of contributions to the Group schemes amount to £0.5 million (2022: £0.5 million). There were no 
amounts outstanding for contributions to the defined benefit schemes (2022: nil).

The Company has an obligation to pay pensions to a number of former employees, whose benefits would otherwise have been restricted by the 
Finance Act 1989 earnings cap. This unfunded scheme is part of the Severn Trent Pension Scheme. 

Information about the schemes as a whole is disclosed in note 27 to the Group financial statements.

13  Related party transactions
The retirement benefit schemes operated by the Group are considered to be related parties. Details of transactions and balances with the 
retirement benefit schemes are disclosed in note 27 to the Group financial statements.

Information about Directors’ remuneration is provided in the audited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 

The Company has given guarantees in favour of Water Plus Limited in respect of the joint venture’s liabilities to wholesalers in the Open Water 
market. The guarantee in respect of liabilities to wholesalers is capped at £43.5 million (2022: £54.1 million). 

The Company has a revolving credit facility available to Water Plus totalling £95 million. At 31 March 2023 the amount drawn was £76.4 million 
(2022: £80.5 million).

14  Contingent liabilities

a)  Bonds and guarantees
The Company has entered into bonds and guarantees in the normal course of business. No liabilities are expected to arise in respect of either the 
bonds or guarantees.

b)  Bank offset arrangements
The banking arrangements of the Company operate on a pooled basis with certain of its subsidiary undertakings. Under these arrangements 
participating companies guarantee each other’s overdrawn balances to the extent of their credit balances, which can be offset against balances of 
participating companies. As at 31 March 2023, the Company had no contingent liabilities (2022: nil).

15  Post balance sheet events
Following the year end the Board of Directors has proposed a final dividend of 64.09 pence per share.  

16  Dividends
For details of the dividends paid in the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 see note 13 in the Group financial statements.

UK. Lines are open from 8.30am to 17.30pm (UK time), 
Mon-Fri (excluding public holidays in England and Wales).

Other information
Buying and selling shares in the UK
If you wish to buy or sell certificated Severn 
Trent Plc shares, you may need to use a 
stockbroker or high street bank which trades 
on the London Stock Exchange. There are 
also many telephone and online services 
available to you.

If you are selling, you will need to present your 
share certificate at the time of sale. Details of 
dealing services offered by Equiniti Financial 
Services Limited may be obtained from 
www.shareview.co.uk or contact 03456 037 037* 
for assistance.

Share price information
Shareholders can find share price information 
on our website and in most national 
newspapers. For a real-time buying or selling 
price, you should contact a stockbroker.

Shareholder security
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure 
tactics to lure investors into scams. They may 
offer to sell shares that turn out to be 
worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at 
an inflated price in return for an upfront 
payment. While high profits are promised, if 
you buy or sell shares in this way you will 
probably lose your money.

Please be aware that scams are becoming 
ever-more sophisticated with fraudsters often 
claiming or implying that they have some 
connection with Severn Trent, and possibly 
offering an attractive investment opportunity. 
Beware, they may simply be trying to obtain 
your personal data.

OTHER INFORMATION

Cautionary Forward-Looking Statement 
This document contains statements that are, 
or may be deemed to be, ‘forward-looking 
statements’ with respect to Severn Trent’s 
financial condition, results of operations and 
business and certain of Severn Trent’s plans and 
objectives with respect to these items. 
Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but 
not always, identified by their use of a date in the 
future or such words as ‘anticipates’, ‘aims’, ‘due’, 
‘could’, ‘may’, ‘will’, ‘would’, ‘should’, ‘expects’, 
‘believes’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘projects’, ‘potential’, 
‘reasonably possible’, ‘targets’, ‘goal’ or 
‘estimates’ or words with a similar meaning, and, 
in each case, their negative or other variations or 
comparable terminology. Any forward-looking 
statements in this document are based on Severn 
Trent’s current expectations and, by their very 
nature, forward-looking statements are 
inherently unpredictable, speculative and involve 
risk and uncertainty because they relate to events 
and depend on circumstances that may or may 
not occur in the future. Forward-looking 
statements are not guarantees of future 
performance and no assurances can be given that 
the forward-looking statements in this document 
will be realised. There are a number of factors, 
many of which are beyond Severn Trent’s control, 
that could cause actual results, performance and 
developments to differ materially from those 
expressed or implied by these forward-looking 
statements. These factors include, but are not 
limited to, changes in the economies and markets 
in which the Group operates; changes in the 
regulatory and competition frameworks in which 
the Group operates; the impact of legal or other 
proceedings against or which affect the Group; 
and changes in interest and exchange rates. All 
written or verbal forward-looking statements, 
made in this document or made subsequently, 
which are attributable to Severn Trent or any 
other member of the Group or persons acting on 
their behalf are expressly qualified in their 
entirety by the factors referred to above. This 
document speaks as at the date of the report. 

Save as required by applicable laws and 
regulations, Severn Trent does not intend to 
update these forward-looking statements and 
does not undertake any obligation to do so. Past 
performance of securities of Severn Trent Plc 
cannot be relied upon as a guide to the future 
performance of securities of Severn Trent Plc. 
Nothing in this document should be regarded as 
a profits forecast. 

This document is not an offer to sell, exchange or 
transfer any securities of Severn Trent Plc or any 
of its subsidiaries and is not soliciting an offer to 
purchase, exchange or transfer such securities in 
any jurisdiction. Securities may not be offered, 
sold or transferred in the United States, absent 
registration or an applicable exemption from the 
registration requirements of the United States 
Securities Act of 1933 (as amended).

Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) are 
unlikely to contact you out of the blue with 
an offer to buy or sell shares;

 – Do not get into a conversation, note the name 
of the person and firm contacting you and 
then end the call;

Unsolicited mail
The Company is legally obliged to make its 
share register available to the general public. 
Consequently some shareholders may receive 
unsolicited mail. If you wish to limit the amount 
of unsolicited mail you receive, please contact:

The Mailing Preference Service (‘MPS’), DMA 
House, 70 Margaret Street, London, W1W SS.

programme, for which The Bank of New York 
Mellon acts as Depositary.

premier tier of the US over-the-counter (‘OTC’) 
market under the symbol STRNY (it is not 
listed on a US stock exchange). Each ADR 
represents one Severn Trent ordinary share.
