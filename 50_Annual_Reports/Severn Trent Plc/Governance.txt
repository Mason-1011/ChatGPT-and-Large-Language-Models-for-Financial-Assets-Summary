CULTURE

Christine on a water bar shop at the Commonwealth Games

The Board places great importance on 
ensuring that the Group’s culture and Values 
are established throughout the organisation, 
aligned across directorates and demonstrated 
consistently by everyone who works with us. 
As such, the Board spends a significant 
amount of time, both inside and outside of 
Board meetings, engaging with our people 
through a variety of mechanisms. The Board’s 
participation in the Company Forum (our 
workforce engagement mechanism), review 
of QUEST engagement results, attendance 
at our engaging ‘Ask Our Board’ session, 
complemented by a range of site visits 
throughout the year, are all crucial to 
informing the Board’s understanding of our 
culture. In addition, the Board recognises the 
need to foster an inclusive culture where all 
colleagues are able to bring their whole selves 
to work, fulfil their potential and perform at 
their best. 

Our people are fundamental to our success 
and form a critical part of us being a trusted 
company. Our people tell us that they work 
best together, in an environment of 
collaboration and innovation. Our culture of 
empowerment and accountability, with a focus 
on skills, talent and career development, not 
only ensures we continue to deliver great 
performance but also that we continue to make 
Severn Trent a wonderful place to work. This is 
borne out by our excellent QUEST employee 
engagement score of 8.4 out of 10, putting us in 
the top 5% of utility companies globally.

Our Values of Having Courage, Embracing 
Curiosity, Taking Pride and Showing Care are 
brought to life in our culture and are integral to 
the way we behave and the way we do business. 
Our Values are demonstrated by our people 
every day as they work tirelessly to deliver our 
essential service. Their commitment is evident 
in the dedication they show in delivering for our 
customers and communities – 24 hours a day, 
365 days a year. Our people are also supported 
by the systems and processes we have in place 
that enable us to deliver consistent operational 
performance. This consistency has created 
capacity for our talented people to do even 
more to make a positive difference for all 
of our stakeholders.

How the Board monitors and 
assesses culture
The Board understands the importance of 
setting the right tone from the top, with each 
Director leading by example to promote a 
culture of inclusivity. Great emphasis is placed 
by the Board on ensuring that the Group’s 
culture is aligned to our Strategy, Purpose and 
Values. As such, one of the Board’s key focus 
areas is to monitor and assess the culture 
across the Group.

The Board recognises the importance 
of ensuring that the Severn Trent culture 
celebrates diversity and inclusion in all 
its forms, and embraces individuals’ 
contributions, no matter what their age, 
gender, race, ethnicity, disability, sexual 
orientation, social background, religion or 
belief. The Board was pleased that Severn 
Trent was recognised as a Top 3 FTSE100 
company for representation of women on the 
Board in the FTSE Women Leaders Review 
2023, in addition to being named a Top 25 
employer by Stonewall.

The Board monitors and assesses the culture 
of the Group by regularly meeting with the 
Executive Committee and management, 
reviewing the outcomes of employee surveys, 
engaging directly with individual employees 
throughout the Group, and listening to 
feedback from our stakeholders. We believe 
that our culture is a unique strength and we 
see the benefits of this flow through into 
employee engagement, retention and 
productivity. The Board places great 
importance on employee engagement and 
regularly reviews its approach, taking into 
account the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018. All of these 
touchpoints with colleagues and other 
stakeholders provide cultural insight that the 
Board can act upon and factor into its decision 
making. The table on the next page provides 
further detail on the activity undertaken during 
the year to assess the Group’s culture.

CULTURE ASSESSMENT MECHANISM

CULTURAL INSIGHT

OUTCOME/ACTIONS

Review results of the annual QUEST survey, 
particularly around employee engagement levels 
benchmarked against peers, and how Severn Trent’s 
Values link to its Purpose and behaviour.

Understanding strengths and opportunities as 
identified by employees, and that our Purpose 
and Values reflect the Company’s culture 
and behaviours.

The Company Forum provides an opportunity for 
employee and Trade Union employee representatives 
to meet with Board members on a regular basis. 
Members of the Board and Executive Committee 
attend the Severn Trent Company Forum on a 
rotational basis, so each Director receives 
the opportunity to listen directly to what employees 
have to say and for our employees to hear about 
matters that the Board is reviewing and considering. 

The ‘Ask Our Board’ event ensures a direct dialogue 
with the workforce across the Group. The most 
recent event in May 2023 saw 110 colleagues join, and 
feedback from the Board and employees was very 
positive.

A better understanding of day-to-day 
operations, the practical execution of 
strategy and the cultural context in which 
employees work. 

Provides the Board with insight into colleague 
sentiment and topics of importance to 
colleagues, including diversity and inclusion 
and our societal contribution.

Actions taken to address the insights gained 
from the QUEST survey are continuously 
monitored by the Board through regular 
agenda topics structured around our people. 
The Board also received assurance that our 
culture is aligned to our Purpose and Values.

It ensures that views from a diverse cross 
section of the workforce – in terms of 
seniority, gender, ethnicity, tenure of 
employment and job types – are considered 
in Board discussions and decision making, 
and each meeting generates wide-ranging 
exchanges of opinion and insights. 

Outputs from employee engagement 
sessions are used to shape future Board 
agenda topics and employee updates. 
Questions at the event in May 2023 included 
performance highlights over the year, the 
Group’s Societal Strategy, River Quality and 
affordability initiatives.

Board members attend meetings of the four active 
employee advisory groups – LQBTQ+, Ethnicity, 
Disability and Women in STEM and Ops.

Ability to hear directly about the progress made 
against the diversity and inclusion action plans 
across the business.

Outputs from employee engagement 
sessions are used to shape future Board 
agenda topics and employee updates.

Annual review and monitoring by the Audit and Risk 
Committee of the effectiveness of the Group Speak 
Up Policy, processes and framework. Speak Up 
reports are considered at every Audit and Risk 
Committee meeting, with onward reporting to 
the Board.

Review by the Remuneration Committee of the wider 
workforce policies and practices, including gender 
and ethnicity pay gaps, CEO pay ratios and alignment 
of Directors’ pension contributions to the workforce. 
Integration of sustainability measures into short- and 
long-term incentive targets. Remuneration is an 
annual agenda item at the Company Forum and 
outputs are reported to the Board.

Regular reviews by the Nominations Committee of 
senior management talent and succession planning.

A perspective on the nature of colleague 
concerns and trends in the behaviours of 
colleagues generally. Insight into how concerns 
are escalated and resolved by Severn Trent.

The Audit and Risk Committee will continue 
to monitor the effectiveness of the Speak Up 
Policy, and report to the Board the extent to 
which this has supported the openness of 
Severn Trent’s culture.

Insight into the role that remuneration, and 
remuneration targets, have in promoting the 
right performance and behaviours, and the 
extent to which incentives and rewards are 
aligned with the Group’s culture.

The Remuneration Committee will continue 
to report to the Board on colleague 
sentiment in relation to workforce policies 
and practices.

The importance of organisational culture in 
determining the Company’s strategic priorities 
and reviewing senior succession plans.

Regular Board updates and relevant Committee 
updates on a broad range of risk and business integrity 
matters, including fraud, compliance, bribery, 
corruption and modern slavery, and standard supplier 
protocols and procedures. This is done through review 
of Internal Audit reports, compliance reports, risk 
deep dives, incident reports and policies and training.

A broad understanding of practices and 
behaviours, and how these align with the 
Purpose, Values and Strategy of the Group, 
including an understanding of the Group’s 
supply chain partners and alignment to the 
culture of the Group.

Completion of mandatory training modules for 
colleagues by all Board members on the Group’s 
Code of Conduct, Doing the Right Thing.

A deeper understanding of Severn Trent’s 
Values and standards to inform future 
employee engagement.

The Board, Nominations Committee and 
Executive Committee were engaged 
throughout the rigorous Executive Committee 
recruitment and selection process.

The Board and its Committees provide 
appropriate scrutiny and challenge of 
management, and receive assurance over 
the Company’s approach to managing risk 
and business integrity matters.

All members of the Board will continue to 
undertake training on an annual basis, to 
ensure their knowledge and understanding 
is up to date.

GOVERNANCE REPORTBOARD SKILLS

An effective Board requires the right mix of 
skills and experience, reflective of 
individuals from varied backgrounds. As 
demonstrated by their individual biographies 
on pages 104 to 105, our Board members 
together form a diverse and effective team 
focused on promoting the long-term success 
of the Group.

The skills matrix below details some of the 
key skills and experience that our Board 
has identified as particularly valuable for 
the effective oversight of the Company and 
execution of our Strategy, and indicates which 
Directors bring those particular skills to 
the boardroom.

BOARD SKILLS MATRIX
STRATEGIC OUTCOMES

The skills matrix is reviewed at least annually 
to make sure it meets current business needs, 
today and in the future, and is aligned with our 
strategic priorities, to ensure the Board 
remains fully equipped to deliver our Strategy 
and Purpose, and provide challenge to the 
experienced and knowledgeable Executive 
Team. This year’s review was undertaken as 
part of the Board Effectiveness evaluation, 
which you can read more about on pages  
118 to 119.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 2018

The Group’s long-term success depends on 
our commitment to exceptional corporate 
governance standards and the Board continues 
to be guided in its approach through the 
application of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2018 (the ‘2018 Code’).

We believe good corporate governance is about 
how we provide confidence in the delivery of 
our performance to our stakeholders and is 
essential for the long-term sustainable 
success of our business.

With this in mind, we welcome the proposed 
enhancements to the future corporate 
governance regime, including the 
recommendations from BEIS (now the 
Department for Business and Trade).

During the year ended 31 March 2023, we have 
fully applied the principles of good governance 
and have been compliant with the provisions 
contained in the 2018 Code.

The Board remains dedicated to open and 
transparent reporting, and the table below 
shows where shareholders can evaluate how 
the Company has applied the principles of the 
2018 Code and where key content can be found 
in this report.

The full wording of the 2018 Code is available 
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website.

DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES

As at the date of this report, our Board 
comprised the Chair, six Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and three Executive 
Directors. There are clear divisions between 
Executive and Non-Executive responsibilities, 
which ensure accountability and oversight. The 
roles of Chair and Chief Executive are 
separately held and their responsibilities are 
well defined, set out in writing in the Charter of 

Expectations, and regularly reviewed by the 
Board. The Chair and the other Non-Executive 
Directors meet routinely without the Executive 
Directors, and individual Directors meet 
outside formal Board meetings in order to gain 
first-hand experience of our operations and 
engage with our workforce. The Executive 
Directors meet weekly as part of the Executive 
Committee to attend to the ongoing 

management of the Group. Any significant 
operational and market matters are 
communicated to the Non-Executive Directors 
on a timely basis outside of Board meetings. 
The Board is supported by the Group Company 
Secretary, to whom all Directors have access 
for advice and corporate governance services.

GOVERNANCE REPORTBOARD ACTIVITIES

BOARD MEETINGS
The Board is committed to maintaining a 
comprehensive schedule of meetings and a 
forward agenda to ensure its time is used 
most effectively and efficiently, and it is 
supported by the Group Company Secretary 
to facilitate this. Flexibility in the 
programme is important to permit key 
items to be added to any agenda, so that the 
Board can focus on evolving and important 
matters at the most appropriate time.

Board meeting discussions are structured 
using a carefully tailored agenda that is 
agreed in advance by the Chair, in conjunction 
with the CEO and Group Company Secretary.

A typical Board meeting will comprise the 
following elements:

 – Written reports from the Chairs of our 
Board Committees on the proceedings 
of those meetings, including the key 
discussion points and particular matters 
to bring to the Board’s attention.

 – Following every Company Forum, a 
report on the topics discussed at the 
Forum is circulated and the Directors 
who attended that particular Forum add 
further context at the Board meeting.

 – Performance reports, including: CEO 

Overview; CFO Review; and Operational 
Performance Reports.

 – Deep dive reports into areas of 

particular strategic importance, 
opportunities and risks, to evaluate 
progress, provide insight and, where 
necessary, decide on appropriate 
action. Read more about some of the 
topics covered during the year opposite.

 – Legal and governance updates, including:
 – Approval of arrangements for delegated 
financial authority across the Group; 
 – Review of adequacy of Whistleblowing 

Procedures; and 

 – Approval of the Anti-Slavery and 
Human Trafficking Statement.

Time is set aside at the end of every Board 
meeting for the Chair to hold an 
Independent Non-Executive Director only 
meeting, where it is considered appropriate, 
which provides the opportunity for 
discussion on key agenda items and other 
matters without the Executive Directors and 
management present.

On the evening before most scheduled 
Board meetings, all the Non-Executive 
Directors meet either by themselves, or 
together with just the CEO, or with the entire 
Board and the Group Company Secretary. 
This time is usefully spent enabling Board 
members to build a rapport with each other 
and a relationship on a personal level, share 
external views and consider issues 
impacting the Company, resulting in better 
Board dynamics and decision making.

The following schematic aims to bring the 
Board’s rich programme to life.

GOVERNANCE REPORTKEY TOPICS CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD IN 2022/23

The Board’s 2022/23 agenda was wide-ranging, with a variety of topics drawn from the 
Schedule of Matters Reserved to the Board, including those related to our Strategy and culture, 
and overall oversight of management and operations. Set out below are examples of topics 
considered by the Board during the year.

APPROVAL OF THE SEVERN TRENT SOCIETAL STRATEGY

NET ZERO TRANSITION PLAN UPDATES

Our customers are facing a sustained increase in financial pressures – driven 
by rising inflation and energy costs. As a socially responsible company, that 
genuinely cares about its customers and the communities it serves, the Board 
reviewed and approved the Group’s Societal Strategy, which focuses on the 
underlying causes of water poverty to reduce long-term affordability issues 
and contribute to the wider levelling-up agenda. The Board considered that the 
best way in the longer term to help households experiencing water poverty 
was to give them the tools to improve job prospects and life chances, with 
much of the support being delivered by the Severn Trent Academy.

Stakeholders / Considerations:

  Customers – our Societal Strategy focuses on careers and employment-

related skills and training to support customers and others in our 
communities in securing employment and helping to address a key 
driver of financial hardship.

  Communities – helping customers and households will also help the 
wider community. Interventions are targeted through school work 
experience programmes, mentoring young offenders and establishing 
pop-up Academy Hubs in the areas that need them the most.

  Employees – as a large regional employer, we can have a positive impact 
on our local communities and we know colleagues are very supportive of 
the work we are doing in this area. Programmes are being delivered by 
our Academy Team with support from Community Champion volunteers 
across the workforce.

Climate change remains a crucial focus for Severn Trent. As such, the Board 
receives regular updates on the progress made in delivering the Group’s 
commitments to transition to net zero. Through these updates, the Board 
received assurance that the activities and investments required to meet the 
Group’s commitments were meeting their Key Performance Indicators and 
timescales, and that external reporting, including the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’), was comprehensive, 
transparent and understood by investors. The Board also considered the risks 
and opportunities associated with the plan, and how these could be mitigated 
and explored. 

Stakeholders / Considerations:

  Suppliers and Contractors – Scope 3 emissions arising from Severn 
Trent’s supply chain are discussed regularly with suppliers and we 
encourage completion of sustainability assessments ahead of agreeing 
Science-Based Targets.

  Sustainability and ESG – the UK water and waste water industry is 

responsible for c.1% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. As such, the 
Board supports the Company’s leading role both within the sector and in 
the wider economy to drive down these emissions.

  Regulators and Government – we engaged with Ofwat around 

incorporating net zero investment and targets into its PR24 methodology 
and the Board welcomed the addition of environmental performance 
commitments, including in relation to the reduction of emissions.

  Suppliers and Contractors – our supply chain is an extension of our 
business and, as such, we have encouraged and challenged our 
suppliers to join us on this journey, and many have already offered their 
support to the initiatives being delivered through our Societal Strategy.

  Shareholders and Investors – investors continue to place increasing 

focus on financial grade reporting, such as TCFD, and this is seen as a 
further opportunity to engage with investors on the proactive approach 
taken by the Company.

Read more about how we engaged with stakeholders throughout the 
development of our Societal Strategy in our Section 172 Statement on 
pages 95 to 97

FINANCIAL MATTERS

RESILIENCE IN THE ROUND

Resilience is our ability to cope with and recover from disruption, and 
anticipate emerging trends and variability in order to maintain service delivery 
for our customers and the environment, both today and over time. The Board is 
supportive of Ofwat’s core concept of ‘Resilience in the Round’ – comprising 
operational, financial and corporate resilience – recognising its importance 
for customers and broader stakeholders. It is vital that our services remain 
resilient over the long term. As such, the Board discusses a deep dive on 
Resilience in the Round on an annual basis, which provides an overview 
of future plans to grow our resilience and shape our long-term 
planning approach.

Topics featured within the deep dive included: climate change and the resulting 
impact on resource availability, carbon and environmental sustainability; 
extreme weather events, high-impact operational events; cyber security and 
the pace at which technology continues to evolve; attracting and retaining 
people with the skills and experience the business needs; and economic and 
social changes, such as population growth, urbanisation, consumer habits and 
perceptions, future financing and regulation.

The Board discussed the innovative approach being taken in consideration 
of the Company’s suite of regulatory plans for our medium- and longer-term 
future to bolster the Group’s resilience and mitigate the impact on services 
for customers, the environment, the economy and communities.

 – Group Budget – the Board reviewed the Group’s performance versus the 

2022/23 Group budget and agreed the 2023/24 Group budget.

 – Viability Statement – on the recommendation of the Audit and Risk Committee, 
the Board reviewed and approved the Viability Statement to be reported in the 
Annual Report and Accounts. Read more on pages 80 to 83.

 – Results and Regulatory Reporting – on the recommendation of the Audit and 

Risk Committee, the Board reviewed and approved the half and full year results 
announcements, Annual Report and Accounts, and Annual Performance Report.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

 – Enterprise Risk Management (‘ERM’) – the Board, in conjunction with the Audit 

and Risk Committee, conducts regular reviews of the Group’s ERM Risk Register. 
Enhancements continue to be made to risk management processes, including 
the identification, assessment, response and monitoring of all existing and 
emerging risks. Read more on pages 73 to 79.

 – Review of Effectiveness of Risk Management and Internal Controls – the 
Board, in conjunction with the Audit and Risk Committee, assessed the 
effectiveness of the risk management and internal controls in place across 
the Group, including in relation to whistleblowing procedures, and 
determined that the Group’s systems had operated effectively throughout 
the year. Read more on pages 130 to 131.

 – Deep Dives – the Board received dedicated sessions on cyber risk, our 

compliance with statutory requirements relating to reservoirs, and health, 
safety and wellbeing to scrutinise the internal controls in place and review 
the external assurance undertaken.

The Board is responsible for assessing and monitoring the Group’s culture, 
and regularly considers items relating to the workforce as part of its 
responsibilities. The Board is satisfied that the Group’s culture remains 
aligned to the Company’s Strategy, Purpose and Values, and did not identify 
any corrective action required to be taken by management.

During the year, the Board considered updates on the following workforce-
related topics:

 – Company Forum – Directors attend the Company Forum, which is the 

Board’s selected workforce engagement mechanism, on a rotation basis 
and report back on proceedings to the rest of the Board.

 – Employee Voice – the Board reviews the results and feedback from the 

annual employee engagement survey, QUEST, and monitors how the areas 
of employee focus are being addressed. The Board determined that 
appropriate interventions were made in a timely manner. 

 – Succession Planning and Talent Management – in order to deliver for its 

stakeholders, it is vital that the Group maintains a skilled workforce today 
and into the future. As such, succession planning and talent management at 
all levels remains a key topic for the Board, with discussion focused on 
building technical and leadership capability while creating diverse talent 
pipelines for the future.

 – Diversity and Inclusion (‘D&I’) – significant progress has been made in 
advancing the Group’s D&I ambitions, to ensure that our workforce 
increasingly reflects the communities we serve. The Group’s four D&I 
Advisory Groups and initiatives such as the 10,000 Black Interns 
programme continue to play an important role. This is evident in the QUEST 
survey results on engagement and equality, both of which remain ahead of 
global benchmarks.

 – Employee Relations – the Board maintains a strong and open relationship 
with employees throughout the Group, through a combination of dedicated 
engagement events such as ‘Ask Our Board’, site visits and informal 
meetings. These are all key components of the Group’s approach to 
workforce engagement.

 – Workforce Policies and Practices – the Board formally reviews the Group’s 
workforce policies and practices to ensure these remain consistent with the 
Company’s Purpose and Values and support the Group’s long-term 
sustainable success.

A key focus for the Board this year has been reviewing the Group’s Strategy 
to reflect where the business is today and outline its ambitions for the future, in 
consideration of the changing environment within which the Company operates. 
Central to the Group’s Strategy is a desire to be performance driven and 
sustainability led – positioning the Group to deliver consistently outstanding 
operational and financial performance in a manner that has a positive sustainable 
impact for all stakeholders. The Board determined that this is best achieved 
through balancing the long-term interests of all stakeholders. Read more about 
our Strategy on pages 2 to 3.

The Board also spent a significant amount of time considering key long-term 
programmes that are inextricably linked to our environment, such as our 
Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan (‘DWMP’), Water Resources 
Management Plan (‘WRMP’), the Water Industry National Environment 
Programme (‘WINEP’) and our PR24 submission, including our Long-Term 
Delivery Strategy. Through these interrelated plans, the Board has ensured that 
we have appropriate, and aligned, plans in place to consider the impacts of 
population growth, drought, environmental obligations and climate change 
uncertainty so that we can continue to deliver our essential services for 
customers now and in the future whilst also transitioning to a net zero world.

 – DWMP – the Board reviewed the draft and final DWMP proposals detailing the 

Company’s plans to extend, improve and maintain a robust and resilient 
drainage and waste water system over the next 25 years, in consideration of 
challenges posed by factors such as population growth, drought, 
environmental obligations and climate change uncertainty. 

 – WRMP – the Board reviewed the draft WRMP proposals detailing the 

Company’s plans in relation to our water system today and in the future, in 
consideration of challenges posed by factors such as population growth, 
drought, environmental obligations and climate change uncertainty. The final 
WRMP is due to be published in Autumn 2023.

 – WINEP – the Board reviewed and considered the impact of our proposed 

environmental programme for PR24, which is aimed at driving positive change 
in environmental performance across both water and waste. The Company 
continues to make significant investment in this important area and, as such, 
the Board agreed a programme that is approximately three and a half times 
bigger than that submitted for AMP7, comprising proposed improvements, 
investigations and monitoring to deliver against a range of statutory drivers.

 – PR24 – the Board continues to shape the business plan for the next AMP, due to 
be submitted to Ofwat in October 2023, and PR24 continues to be tabled as a 
standing agenda item at all Board meetings. The Board considers, reviews and 
discusses detailed updates at each meeting and provides management with the 
challenge and scrutiny required to develop our proposals. Engagement with 
stakeholders is an essential input to progressing the plan, and individual Board 
members attended customer research groups to listen to, and understand, 
customers’ views first hand. Similarly, individual Board members, and the 
Board as a whole, have taken part in informed discussions with Ofwat.

GOVERNANCE

 – Governance Strategy – the Board considered the proposed Governance 
Strategy, which sets out our governance approach in the context of the 
Group’s Purpose and Values, prior to its publication for consultation. The 
Governance Strategy can be found on the Severn Trent Plc website.

 – Board Succession Planning – on the recommendation of the Nominations 
Committee, the Board oversaw the arrangements for Board succession 
planning and, in consideration of maintaining a diverse, experienced and 
appropriately skilled Board, approved the appointment of Sarah Legg as 
an Independent Non-Executive Director and Helen Miles as an Executive 
Director and the Chief Financial Officer Designate. Read more on pages 
123 to 124.

 – Board Effectiveness Evaluation – the Board reviewed the progress made 
against the action plan for 2022/23 and, having considered the feedback 
from the 2023 evaluation, set the action plan for 2023/24. Read more on 
pages 118 to 119.

GOVERNANCE REPORTBOARD LEADERSHIP AND COMPANY PURPOSE

The Board’s role is to be 
effective in securing the 
long-term success of 
Severn Trent by ensuring 
the delivery of our Strategy 
and that its overarching 
objectives remain aligned 
with the Company’s Purpose 
and Values. Maintaining 
the highest standards of 
governance is integral to this, 
together with ensuring that 
the Board takes decisions 
that create sustainable 
long-term value for the mutual 
benefit of our shareholders, 
customers, employees and 
the communities we serve.

BOARD GOVERNANCE

The requirements of the Board are clearly 
documented in the Severn Trent Plc Articles  
of Association, Charter of Expectations and 
Schedule of Matters Reserved to the Board. 
All of these documents are available on the 
Severn Trent Plc website.

An effective Board
The operation of our Board is supported by the 
collective experience of the Directors and the 
diverse skills and experience they possess. This 
enables the Board to reach decisions in a 
focused and balanced way, supported by 
independent thought and constructive debate 
between the Directors. Trust and mutual 
respect are the cornerstones of relationships 
between our Directors, with a Board dynamic 
that supports open and honest conversations to 
ensure decisions are taken for the long-term 
success of Severn Trent in full consideration of 
the impact upon all stakeholders.

As outlined on page 109, there is a clear 
division of responsibilities between the roles of 
Chair and Chief Executive. To allow these 
responsibilities to be discharged effectively, 
the Chair and Chief Executive maintain regular 
dialogue outside the boardroom, to ensure an 
effective flow of information.

The Non-Executive Directors have direct access 
to senior management at all times. Informal as 
well as formal contact with the wider business 
is encouraged to develop a deeper 
understanding of Severn Trent’s operations and 
this engagement is welcomed. This broadens 
the Non-Executive Directors’ sources of 
information and enables them to consider the 
wider impact of any Board decisions on 
stakeholders more broadly. The effectiveness 
of the Board is reviewed at least annually and 
conducted according to the guidance set out in 
the 2018 Code and Financial Reporting Council 
(‘FRC’) Guidance on Board Effectiveness. You 
can read more about this year’s internally-
facilitated Board Effectiveness evaluation on 
pages 118 to 120.

Board independence
The independence of the Board is a matter of 
utmost importance given the vital role 
Non-Executive Directors play in scrutinising 
the performance of management and holding 
individual Executive Directors to account 
against agreed performance objectives. The 
Chair regularly holds meetings with Non-
Executive Directors without the Executive 
Directors or any management present, and 
Non-Executive Directors can obtain 
independent professional advice, at the 
Company’s expense, in the performance of 
their duties. All Directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Group Company 
Secretary, whose appointment and removal is 
a matter reserved for the Board.

The independence of our Non-Executive 
Directors is formally reviewed annually by the 
Nominations Committee, and as part of the 
Board Effectiveness evaluation. Particular 
focus is applied to Directors who have served 
over six years on the Board and John Coghlan, 
has been subject to a particularly stringent 
independence assessment, as detailed on 
page 120. The Nominations Committee and 
Board consider that there are no business or 
other circumstances that are likely to affect 
the independence of any Non-Executive 
Director and that all Non-Executive Directors 

continue to demonstrate independence. Read 
more in the Nominations Committee Report on 
pages 121 to 126.

All of the Non-Executive Directors who served 
during 2022/23 were considered by the Board 
to be independent for the purposes of the 2018 
Code and the Chair was considered to be 
independent upon her appointment. 

In accordance with the 2018 Code, all Directors 
will retire at this year’s AGM and, with the 
exception of James Bowling, submit 
themselves for appointment or reappointment 
by shareholders. Each of the Non-Executive 
Directors seeking appointment or 
reappointment are considered to be 
independent in judgment and character.

Conflicts of interest
Severn Trent Plc has a Conflicts of Interest 
Policy in place for all Group companies. Our 
Board and its Committees consider potential 
conflicts at the outset of every meeting and the 
Board formally reviews the authorisation of 
any potential conflicts of interest every six 
months, with any conflicts being recorded in 
the Conflicts of Interest Register. The Conflicts 
of Interest Register sets out any actual or 
potential conflict of interest situations which a 
Director has disclosed to the Board in line with 
their statutory duties and the practical steps 
that are to be taken to avoid conflict situations. 
When reviewing conflict authorisations, the 
Board considers any other appointments held 
by the Director as well as the findings of the 
Board Effectiveness evaluation.

Board members hold external directorships and 
other outside business interests and we 
recognise the significant benefits that greater 
boardroom exposure provides for our Directors. 
However, we closely monitor the nature and 
number of external directorships our Directors 
hold in order to satisfy ourselves that any 
additional appointments will not adversely 
impact their time commitment to their role at 
Severn Trent, and to ensure that all of our Board 
members remain compliant with applicable 
shareholder advisory groups’ individual guidance 
on ‘overboarding’. These requirements specify a 
limit on the number of directorships both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors are 
permitted to hold and no Directors exceed these 
guidelines, as outlined in the AGM Notice of 
Meeting. Our Non-Executive Directors commit 
sufficient time to discharging their 
responsibilities as Directors of Severn Trent in 
line with the requirements set out in our Charter 
of Expectations. Details of the Directors’ external 
directorships can be found in their biographies 
on pages 104 to 105.

Before committing to an additional 
appointment, Directors confirm the existence 
of any potential or actual conflicts; that the role 
will not breach the Company’s overboarding 
limit; and provide the necessary assurance 
that the appointment will not adversely impact 
their ability to continue to fulfil their role as a 
Director. Directors are required to obtain 
formal approval from the Board ahead of

Stakeholder engagement
Stakeholder engagement is central to our 
Strategy and, as such, a detailed disclosure 
setting out stakeholder engagement activity 
conducted during the year is included in our 
Strategic Report. The Board ensures that the 
Company engages effectively with its 
stakeholders and encourages a two-way 
dialogue in order that the decisions made by 
the Board take into account the views of, and 
potential impacts on, stakeholders. Our 
dedicated Stakeholder Engagement section 
and Section 172 Statement on pages 84 to 94 
and 95 to 97 respectively set out how the Board 
has considered and contemplated the interests 
of stakeholders. A detailed overview of the 
Board’s engagement with our workforce is set 
out on pages 89 and 90.

Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’)
Our 2022 AGM was held on 7 July 2022, at 
which 78.05% of our shareholders (by voting 
capital) voted in person, through the Chair of 
the AGM as their proxy or by submitting their 
proxy forms either electronically or by post. 
We were delighted to receive in excess of 95% 
votes in favour for all of our resolutions, 
including in relation to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. Shareholders were 
invited to submit questions to a dedicated AGM 
mailbox in advance of the AGM and 
shareholders could also raise questions 
during the AGM via the virtual platform, or in 
the room if attending in person. No questions 
were posed to the Board in advance of the 
AGM, but one question was asked and 
responded to during the AGM.

This year’s AGM is to be held on Thursday, 
6 July 2023 at 10.00am. The AGM will be 
convened as a physical meeting, with an option 
for shareholders to follow the business of the 
meeting by virtual means as well as attend in 
person. Those joining virtually will be able to 
log into a live webcast and pose questions to 
the Board in real time, in accordance with the 
2018 Code and the Annual General Meeting 
Guidance published by the FRC in October 
2020. Shareholders are also able to submit 
questions in writing through our website in 
advance of the AGM. The physical location of 
the AGM will be the Severn Trent Academy, 
Hawksley Park, St. Martins Road, Finham, 
Coventry, CV3 6PR.

Full details of the resolutions being tabled for 
shareholder approval can be found in the 
Notice of Meeting on our website.

undertaking any new external appointments 
and approval was sought during the year in 
relation to external appointments for both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. In 
each case, the Board determined that there 
would be no impact on the time commitment 
required for each Director, nor on the 
independence and objectivity required to 
discharge the agreed responsibilities of each 
role. The resultant position is believed to be 
consistent with applicable shareholder 
advisory groups’ guidelines on overboarding.

The Conflicts of Interest Policy continues to  
be applied practically throughout the year, 
such as considering the potential conflict 
presented by Directors having roles on  
other Group companies.

Schedule of Matters 
Reserved to the Board
To ensure the Board maintains oversight of the 
areas material to the delivery of the Group’s 
Strategy and Purpose, the Board undertakes 
an annual review of the Matters Reserved to 
the Board. The latest review took place in 
March 2023 and the Board agreed that the 
Schedule contained areas appropriate to 
require Board involvement, including in 
relation to strategy, structure and capital, 
financial reporting, controls and 
communication with stakeholders. The Board 
also reviewed its skills matrix to determine 
whether any additional skills or development 
opportunities were needed in order for the 
Board to discharge its duties effectively. The 
Schedule of Matters Reserved to the Board is 
available on the Severn Trent Plc website. 

Strategy
Appropriately evaluated strategic decisions are 
crucial to help us to deliver our Strategy and 
achieve our Purpose of ‘taking care of one of 
life’s essentials’. Responsibility to all of our 
stakeholders for the approval and delivery of 
the Group’s Strategy and for creating and 
overseeing the framework to support its 
delivery sits with the Board. During the year, the 
Board considered and approved the Group’s 
new Corporate Strategy, further details of 
which can be found within the Strategic Report 
on pages 2 to 99. As well as standing strategic 
items at every Board meeting, the Board also 
holds a dedicated Strategy Day with the 
Executive Committee to help consider the 
strategic direction of the Company for the short, 
medium and long term.

Responsibility for the development and 
implementation of the Group’s Strategy and 
overall commercial objectives rests with the 
Chief Executive who is supported by the 
Executive Committee.

The Directors present their report and the 
audited Group financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2023. The performance review 
of the Company can be found within the 
Strategic Report. This provides detailed 
information relating to the Group, its Business 
Model and Strategy, the operation of its

GOVERNANCE REPORTCOMPOSITION, SUCCESSION AND EVALUATION

As at the date of this report, 
our Board comprised the 
Chair (who was independent 
on appointment), six 
Independent Non-Executive 
Directors and three Executive 
Directors. The details of 
their career backgrounds, 
relevant skills, Committee 
membership, tenure and 
external appointments can be 
found within their individual 
biographies on pages 104 to 
105. Further detail on the role 
of the Chair and members of 
the Board can be found on 
page 109.

Board composition
The Chair, Senior Independent Director and 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a 
three-year term, subject to annual re-election 
by shareholders following consideration of the 
annual Board Effectiveness evaluation 
outputs. Directors serving over six years on 
the Board are subject to a particularly rigorous 
review. The current Letters of Appointment are 
available on the Severn Trent Plc website. 

The composition and effectiveness of the Board 
is subject to regular review by the Nominations 
Committee which, in particular, considers the 
balance of skills, tenure, experience and 
independence of the Board, in accordance with 
the Board Diversity Policy, which is available on 
the Severn Trent Plc website. 

Any new appointments to the Board result 
from a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure, responsibility for which is 
delegated to the Nominations Committee 
(although decisions on appointments are a 
matter reserved for the Board).

The Board and the Nominations Committee 
have spent a significant amount of time 
considering Board composition during the 
course of the year to ensure that the Board has 
the right mix of skills and experience, as well 
as the capability to provide effective challenge 
and promote diversity.

Further information on the work of the 
Nominations Committee can be found on 
pages 121 to 126.

Directors’ skills and experiences
An effective Board requires the right mix of 
skills and experience and, as can be seen from 
the individual biographies on pages 104 to 105 
and the Board skills matrix on page 106, our 
Board members contribute a diverse range of 
backgrounds, skill sets and experiences that, 
combined together, produce an effective team, 
focused on promoting the long-term success of 
the Group. 

The skills matrix is reviewed at least annually 
to ensure that the right balance of skills and 
experience are in place to enable the effective 
oversight of the Company and execution of  
our Strategy.

Diversity
A diverse organisation benefits from 
differences in skills, regional and industry 
experience, background, ethnicity, gender, 
sexual orientation, religion, belief and age, as 
well as culture and personality. The Board is 
pleased that Severn Trent is recognised as a 
leader in this area and remains focused on 
promoting broader diversity and creating an 
inclusive culture across the organisation and 
including on the Board itself. More details 
about the Board Diversity Policy and how the 
Company has performed against its Board 

Diversity Targets in relation to membership of 
the Board and Executive Committee can be 
found in the Nominations Committee Report, 
from page 121. 

Development, training and resources
The environment in which we operate is 
continually changing. It is therefore important 
for our Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
to remain aware of recent, and upcoming, 
developments and keep their knowledge and 
skills up to date, so the composition of the 
Board continues to operate effectively and 
support delivery of our long-term Strategy.

Our Board Effectiveness evaluation process 
includes training discussions with the Group 
Company Secretary and, as required, we invite 
professional advisers and subject matter 
experts to provide in-depth updates. These 
updates are not solely reserved for legislative 
developments but aim to cover a range of 
strategic issues including, but not limited to, 
the economic and political environment, and 
environmental, sustainability, technological 
and social considerations. Our Group Company 
Secretary also provides regular updates to the 
Board and its Committees on regulatory and 
corporate governance matters.

The aim of the training sessions is to refresh 
and expand the Board’s knowledge and skills. 
In doing so, the Directors can contribute to 
discussions on technical and regulatory 
matters more effectively. The sessions also 
serve as an opportunity for the Board to 
discuss strategy and risks with management 
below Executive Committee level and gain 
further direct insight into our businesses and 
management capability.

During the year, the Board took part in a 
number of training and deep dive sessions 
including in relation to PR24, river quality, 
innovation, resilience in the round and talent 
management. Further details can be found 
on pages 112 to 113.

Directors also have access to our online 
resource library, which is continually reviewed 
and updated. The library includes a Corporate 
Governance Manual, tailored training and 
development content, a Results Centre and 
Investor Relations section, and briefings on 
regulatory topics. It also contains a further 
reading section which covers updates and 
guidance on changes to legislation and 
corporate governance best practice.

Board succession
Along with ensuring an appropriate mix of skills 
and experiences on the Board as a whole for the 
effective oversight of the Company’s Strategy 
and operations, the composition of the Board is 
also informed by the need for orderly succession 
across key Board and Committee roles.

SARAH LEGG’S INDUCTION

MEMBER OF:

 – Audit and Risk Committee
 – Corporate Sustainability Committee
 – Nominations Committee
 – Treasury Committee

The Board welcomed Sarah Legg during  
the year, and her extensive induction 
programme covered a range of areas across 
the business. Along with a detailed overview 
of the water sector and the regulatory 
requirements we operate under, Sarah 
attended a number of sessions covering 
topics including governance, stakeholder 
engagement and the environment. The 
sessions were a mix of virtual and physical 
meetings, including visits to a range of 
operational sites.

Additional areas of focus for Sarah’s 
induction were matters pertinent to her role 
on the Board Committees. For her role on 
the Audit and Risk Committee, this included 
receiving an overview of the current risks 
faced by the Group, regulatory finance 
model, risk management framework, 
Internal Audit programme and internal 
control processes, and an overview of the 
Group’s AMP7 funding strategy in relation to 
her role on the Treasury Committee. In 
relation to her membership of the Corporate 
Sustainability Committee, Sarah undertook 
a series of deep dives in relation to the 
Group’s Sustainability Strategy and net zero 
commitments. A high-level overview of the 
induction process is set out below.

The Nominations Committee and Board have 
applied particular focus to this important area 
over the last 18 months and further detail can 
be found in the Nominations Committee Report 
on page 122.

Induction
We develop a detailed, tailored induction for 
each new Non-Executive Director. This 
includes one-to-one meetings with the Chair 
and each of the existing Non-Executive 
Directors. One-to-one meetings are also 
arranged with the CEO, CFO and the Group 
Company Secretary, along with other 
members of the Executive Committee and 
Senior Management Team. New Directors also 
meet members of the operational teams and 
visit our key sites and capital projects to 
ensure they gain a detailed understanding of 
the water and waste water businesses, and 
have a chance to experience our unique culture 
first hand. We provide briefings on the key 
duties of being a Director of a regulated water 
company and proposed appointees meet with 
Ofwat ahead of their formal appointment.

We enhance the Board’s induction 
programme in light of feedback from new 
Directors and the Board Effectiveness 
evaluation, for example, the introduction of 
the Board buddy scheme.

My Severn Trent Board 
induction has been an 
incredibly thorough and 
well thought-out journey. 
I have experienced both 
the Group’s operations and 
its culture, and have met 
some wonderful people 
along the way.

GOVERNANCE REPORTCOMPOSITION, SUCCESSION AND EVALUATION CONTINUED

EVALUATION

Our annual Board evaluation provides the Board, 
and its Committees, with an opportunity to 
consider and reflect on the quality and 
effectiveness of its decision making, the range 
and level of discussion, and for each member to 
consider their own contribution and performance.

This year, the review was facilitated internally 
by the Group Company Secretary, who is well 
placed as an independent sounding board to 
the process. Meetings took place during 
February and March 2023, and key themes 
were shared with the Board and Nominations 
Committee along with a 2023 action plan.

An externally-facilitated evaluation was 
conducted by Independent Board Evaluation in 
2020/21 and the next externally-facilitated 
evaluation will be scheduled for 2023/24 in 
accordance with the 2018 Code provision that 
the Company should undertake an externally-
facilitated Board Effectiveness evaluation at 
least every three years.

BOARD EVALUATION 
REVIEW CYCLE

During the year, the Board reviewed the 
nature of its evaluation process and 
agreed to adopt a three-year assessment 
cycle moving forward, to build on 
momentum in prior years, whilst also 
ensuring a rigorous and balanced 
approach to implementing incremental 
improvements. 

The cycle is set out below and 2023/24 
will be the first year of a new three-year 
cycle, and therefore will involve an 
externally-facilitated evaluation exercise. 
The Nominations Committee has 
commenced the process to select a 
facilitator to conduct the 2023/24 
evaluation.

CONSIDER RESULTS  
AND AGREE ACTIONS

MARCH 2023

The Group Company Secretary undertook a detailed review of 
the 2021/22 Board Effectiveness evaluation process in order to 
develop the approach for 2022/23, incorporating 
recommendations from the 2018 Code, Parker Review, FRC 
Guidance on Board Effectiveness and Ofwat’s Board leadership, 
transparency and governance principles. A focused 
questionnaire was designed to gather individual Directors’ 
perceptions of the effectiveness of the Board and its operations, 
including in relation to accountability, oversight, strategy, value 
creation, culture, ethics, behaviours, stakeholder engagement 
and information flows to the Board and its Committees.

The questionnaires were issued and each Director was also 
asked to complete an updated entry for the Board skills matrix, 
taking into consideration skills that had been strengthened 
through training and development over the previous year. 
Directors were also asked to highlight any additional skills that 
they felt may be beneficial for the Board to have amongst its 
members in order to discharge its duties effectively. 

Board members participated in comprehensive one-to-one 
meetings with the Chair and Group Company Secretary, with 
additional input from the Senior Independent Director, to allow 
reflection on their personal responses to the questionnaire and 
discussion of matters relevant to boardroom culture, process 
and development. Separate discussions were held to consider 
the effectiveness of the CEO, CFO and Group Company 
Secretary, led by the Chair. The Chair’s performance evaluation 
was led by the Senior Independent Director.

The Group Company Secretary collated the individual 
responses, including analysis of themes and proposed 
actions. A detailed report, setting out the findings of the 
evaluation, was provided to the Chair for consideration. The 
Group Company Secretary and Chair met to discuss the 
findings, with the resulting report being tabled to the 
Nominations Committee and Board in March 2023.

The findings of the evaluation exercise were fully considered 
when making recommendations in respect of the appointment 
and reappointment of individual Directors, and included an 
assessment of their independence, time commitment and 
individual performance. The respective proposed 2023 AGM 
Resolutions were considered and agreed by the Board. The 
proposed actions arising from the evaluation were thoroughly 
discussed and agreed for implementation and monitoring.

STAGE 5 

MONITOR PROGRESS

APRIL 2023 ONWARDS

The Board will continue to oversee the progress made in 
relation to the agreed actions to ensure their timely 
completion. The Nominations Committee will also continue to 
play a key role in monitoring the actions relating to Board 
succession, composition, recruitment and induction.

RECOMMENDATION

INITIAL PROGRESS

SUCCESSION PLANNING AND BOARD COMPOSITION

Ensure process to enable the smooth succession of Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Senior Independent Director, commences 
well in advance of scheduled retirements.

Succession planning continues to be a key focus of the Board and a 
standing item on the agenda for Nominations Committee meetings. 
Robust succession plans are in place for all roles.

BOARD AGENDA

Notwithstanding the well-structured agendas which comprise an optimal 
mix of strategic and operational items, consideration should be given to:

The Board forward agenda has been reviewed to ensure that:

 – All matters are appropriately scheduled for discussion at future 

 – Scheduling key strategic and complex regulatory topics earlier on 

Board meetings; and 

the Board agenda to ensure sufficient time for discussion and 
debate; and 

 – Allocating more time on the Board agenda to discuss strategic 

developments and opportunities, as well as innovation initiatives, 
both within and outside of the utilities sector.

BOARD REPORTS

Notwithstanding the high quality of Board reporting, there was 
an opportunity to enhance executive summaries and articulate 
key takeaways within Board reports to facilitate focus of 
Board discussions.

 – Sufficient time is devoted to the discussion of strategic and 

innovative topics.

Feedback on Board reporting has been incorporated into the Group’s 
suite of report writing training. 

EVALUATION RECOMMENDATIONS FROM 2021/22

The internally-facilitated board effectiveness process also provided an update on the recommendations identified in the 2021/22 review. The report 
concluded that good progress had been made in relation to the recommendations from the 2021/22 evaluation. Further details are set out in the table below.

RECOMMENDATION

BOARD AGENDA

ACTION TAKEN

Notwithstanding the well-structured agendas which comprise an 
optimal mix of strategic and operational items, more opportunity 
could be afforded to allow the Board to discuss bolder strategic 
moves and opportunities, future likely trends and developments 
outside of the utilities sector, and potential areas of differentiation.

The Board developed and agreed a set of Board objectives for 2022/23, 
which were reviewed at its meetings in March and April 2022. The 
Board forward agenda was also reviewed to ensure that all matters 
were appropriately scheduled for discussion at future Board 
meetings.

In addition to the informative oral reports provided to the Board by 
the Chair on her meetings with shareholders, consideration should 
be given to include dedicated time on the agenda for all Directors to 
provide feedback on engagement with stakeholders.

ENGAGEMENT OUTSIDE MEETINGS

The Board agenda allows time for Directors to provide individual 
feedback on their engagement activity with all stakeholders.

Non-Executive Directors should continue to be invited to additional 
site visits outside the Board meeting rhythm to further build 
relationships with each other and gain an even deeper 
understanding of the business.

Alongside the regular programme of Board meetings being held at 
operational sites, a number of additional site visits were scheduled, 
covering the full range of the Group’s operations. See page 110 for 
further details.

‘Teach in’ sessions for non-Treasury Committee members should be 
established to provide other Non-Executive Directors with additional 
knowledge and experience of this technically complex area.

A programme of ‘teach in’ sessions was developed, including 
Treasury-related topics and other technical matters.

BOARD COMMITTEES

Nominations Committee – consideration should be given as to 
whether the Committee’s remit should be expanded to cover wider 
talent development, below Executive Committee level.

The Committee’s remit was considered during the review of its Terms 
of Reference undertaken in March 2023 and it was determined that 
these remained appropriate and reflective of the requirements 
outlined in the 2018 Code. The Board participated in a Group-wide 
succession planning and talent management session during the year. 
Read more in the Nominations Committee Report on pages 121 to 126.

Remuneration Committee – consideration should be given as to 
whether there should be an additional Non-Executive Director on 
the Committee.

As part of its ongoing succession planning activity, the Board 
continues to consider the composition of all Committees, including 
that of the Remuneration Committee.

GOVERNANCE REPORTCOMPOSITION, SUCCESSION AND EVALUATION CONTINUED

External appointments
It is imperative that Directors have sufficient time 
to meet their responsibilities of providing 
constructive challenge and strategic guidance, 
and holding management to account. Approvals 
were sought from the Board during the year for 
Directors’ additional roles and due consideration 
was given to any potential conflicts of interest 
and ability to devote sufficient time to Severn 
Trent Plc before consent was granted. 

A further review of each Director’s time 
commitment was undertaken as part of the 
evaluation, with full consideration given to 
the number of external positions held by the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors, including 
the time commitment required for each. The 
Nominations Committee, in considering the 
Continuing Office of Directors, did not identify any 
instances of overboarding and confirms that all 
individual Directors have sufficient time to commit 
to their appointment as Directors of Severn Trent 
Plc. The full list of key external appointments held 
by our Directors can be found in their biographies 
on pages 104 to 105. 

Effectiveness of Board Committees
The Board places significant reliance on its 
Committees by delegating a broad range of 
responsibilities and issues to them. It 
therefore remains crucial that effective links 
are maintained between the Committees and 
the Board, not least as it is impracticable for 
all Independent Non-Executive Directors to be 
members of all the Committees. Mechanisms 
are in place to facilitate these links, including 
ensuring that there are no gaps or 
unnecessary duplications between the remit of 
each Committee and overlapping membership 
between Board Committees where necessary. 
Each Committee has its own Terms of 
Reference, which are reviewed annually, and 
the Board receives a written summary of each 
of the Committee’s meetings along with oral 
updates at the Board, where appropriate. 

The effectiveness of the Board Committees is 
therefore an important part of the evaluation 
and, along with each respective Committee, the 
Board also monitors any Committee-related 
recommendations that arise from the review. 
Overall, Board members are fully satisfied that 
the governance and controls in place are working 
well and give the Board the visibility it needs to 
carry out its oversight duties. Each Committee 
remains effective in providing the Board with the 
support it has requested. Further details on each 
Committee, including its oversight and focus 
during the year, can be found in the Committee 
reports starting on page 121.

Chair’s performance
The Senior Independent Director, Kevin Beeston, 
carried out a review of the performance of the 
Chair, which included meeting with the Non-
Executive Directors without the Chair being 
present. The consolidated feedback, which was 
wholly positive in nature, was discussed with the 
Chair and subsequently reported to the 
Nominations Committee and Board. The review 
confirmed that the Chair continued to 
demonstrate strong leadership and commitment, 
highlighting her expert management of the Board 
succession process during the year. It was 
concluded that the Chair promoted a culture of 
inclusivity, openness and debate, ensuring that 
views from others were sought before expressing 
her own perspective. As such, meetings were 
constructive and focused, and Directors received 
accurate, timely and clear information in advance. 
Board members confirmed that the Chair devoted 
sufficient time to the role, including in relation to 
building good relationships with key stakeholders, 
and in all respects met the requirements of the 
2018 Code.

John Coghlan’s independence
John Coghlan will have served on the Board for 
nine years in May 2023. The Board is satisfied that 
John continues to demonstrate independent 
character, judgment and objectivity. Continual 
monitoring of his independence and performance 
will be undertaken over his remaining tenure.

The Board, taking into account the provisions set 
out in the 2018 Code, considered that John 
remained independent notwithstanding the fact 
he would be serving for a period of more than 
nine years and concluded that there were no 
relationships or circumstances likely to impair 
his judgment. This was based on a number of 
factors, including: 

 – John’s strong record in making objective 

decisions and holding management to account, 
and remaining willing and able to do so;

 – His clear independence demonstrated in terms 

of his participation at meetings with 
management and his interactions with 
stakeholders including the External Auditor;

 – His arm’s-length approach to dealing with 

Executive Directors and continued challenge of 
management where appropriate; 

 – The fact that none of John’s external 

directorship appointments conflicted or 
potentially conflicted with those of the 
Company; and

 – The broader composition of the Board, 

including the fact that no other Non-Executive 
Director had a tenure in excess of nine years.

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT

Dear Shareholder 
This report details the role of the Nominations 
Committee and the important work it has 
undertaken during the year. It highlights the 
vital part played by the Committee to ensure 
that the Board has the appropriate balance of 
skills, experience, knowledge and diversity to 
provide the Company with the strong 
leadership required to support its workforce 
and deliver long-term sustainable success.

The Committee also ensures there is a 
high-quality, stable Executive Team in place, 
focused on the long term but adaptive to the 
changing world around us in order to deliver 
for all of our stakeholders.

This year has seen a number of significant 
changes to the composition of the Board, 
following the retirement of Philip Remnant, 
former Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
in November. I would like to convey my thanks 
to Philip for his dedication and significant and 
impactful contributions to the Board and 
Committee discussions. Sharmila Nebhrajani 
has taken on the role of Remuneration 
Committee Chair and, as such, will introduce 
her first Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
shareholders this year. 

We also welcomed Sarah Legg as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director of the 
Board from 1 November 2022. Given her 
strong financial background and deep interest 
in sustainability matters, Sarah joined our 
Audit and Risk, Treasury and Corporate 
Sustainability Committees, in addition to the 
Nominations Committee. Details of her 
ongoing induction programme can be found on 
page 117. 

During the year, we also announced the 
planned retirement of James Bowling, our 
Chief Financial Officer of eight years, and 
Bronagh Kennedy, our Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary of nearly twelve years. 
The Committee was delighted that, following 
rigorous internal and external search and 
selection processes, the appointments in 
relation to both these roles, and the 
subsequent opportunities they created on 

the Executive Committee, were largely made 
from existing talent within our business, 
helping us preserve the incredible knowledge 
and experience we possess and help drive us 
forward over the coming years. As a result of 
the Committee’s positive action, the Group’s 
succession readiness has been strengthened 
and the Committee considers that all key roles 
have credible succession plans in place. You 
can read more about these appointments 
on pages 123 and 124.

Following the implementation of these 
changes, the Committee has been focused on 
planning for the transition of our long-standing 
Non-Executive Directors, ensuring that the 
Board remains well balanced, with a strong 
pipeline of candidates with the appropriate 
skill sets, experience and capabilities.

During the year, the Committee also 
considered the Board Diversity Policy (the 
‘Policy’) and reviewed progress made against 
the agreed objectives set out in the Policy. The 
importance of the Policy aligning with the 
diversity of our region, specifically in respect 
of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, 
skills and experience, was paramount. The 
Committee also considered the new Listing 
Rule requirements in relation to diversity and 
inclusion, and progress in achieving the 
individual targets. Following its review, the 
Committee recommended to the Board that 
the Policy was amended to cover a broader 
range of diversity characteristics and facilitate 
the open and transparent reporting by 
Directors. Read more on page 125.

I am pleased to report that the Company 
complies with the targets outlined within the 
Listing Rules, with 60% of the current Board 
Directors being women, two of the senior 
positions currently held by women (Chair and 
Chief Executive) – moving to three following 
Helen Miles’ appointment as Chief Financial 
Officer in July 2023 – and two members of our 
Board from non-White Ethnic Minority 
backgrounds. We have developed a refreshed 
disclosure this year, which can be found on 
page 126, and we welcome feedback on this.

Christine Hodgson
Chair

The evolution of the Board 
and succession planning for 
the Executive Committee 
have been key areas of focus 
for the Committee this year 
and we believe we have 
the right team in place to 
deliver our Strategy into the 
next AMP and beyond.

All members of the Committee are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors of 
the Board, with the exception of Christine 
Hodgson (who was independent on 
appointment). Only members of the 
Committee have the right to attend 
Committee meetings. Other individuals, 
such as the Chief Executive, the Director 
of Human Resources and other senior 
management and external advisers, may 
be invited to attend meetings as and when 
appropriate. None of these attendees are 
members of the Committee.

GOVERNANCE REPORTNOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

As part of the Committee’s governance oversight 
role, the Committee also assists the Board in its 
consideration of conflicts of interest and 
independence issues. As part of its 
recommendation to the Board in respect of the 
Continuing Office of Directors, the Committee 
conducted its annual review of individual Director 
conflict authorisations as recorded in our 
Conflicts of Interest Register. When reviewing 
conflict authorisations, the Committee 
considered any other appointments held by 
the Director as well as the findings of the Board 
Effectiveness evaluation.

Following the review, the Committee 
recommended to the Board that each conflict 
authorisation remained appropriate and that 
there were no business or other circumstances 
that were likely to affect the independence of 
any Non-Executive Director. As such, the 
Committee determined that all Non-Executive 

Directors continued to demonstrate 
independence and I am pleased to report that 
the Board concurred with our conclusion.

In accordance with the 2018 Code, all the 
Directors will retire at this year’s AGM and, 
with the exception of James Bowling, submit 
themselves for appointment, in the case of 
Sarah Legg and Helen Miles, or reappointment 
by shareholders. Each of the Non-Executive 
Directors seeking appointment or 
reappointment are considered to be 
independent in judgment and character.

Finally, in what has been a very busy year 
for the Committee, we also paid significant 
attention to enhancing the effectiveness of 
the Board and its Committees. An internally-
facilitated Board Effectiveness evaluation was 
conducted earlier this year, which concluded 
that the Board continues to operate effectively 
while also signalling minor areas for 
improvement, details of which can be 
found on page 119.

I would like to thank the members of the 
Committee for their continued commitment 
throughout the year, for the open discussions 
that take place at our meetings, and for the 
contribution they all provide in support of 
our work.

KEY AREAS OF 
FOCUS IN 2022/23

The Committee has responsibility for 
keeping the size, structure and composition 
of the Board and its Committees under 
review and is responsible for ensuring that 
there are formal plans in place for an 
orderly succession to both Board and senior 
leadership positions. The Committee also 
oversees the development of a diverse 
pipeline for succession. The composition of 
the Board is reviewed and refreshed on a 
regular basis and there is a rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the appointment 
of Directors. The Committee leads the 
process for Board and Board Committee 
appointments and makes recommendations 
to the Board. The Committee reports to the 
Board on its key areas of focus following 
each Committee meeting.

Key areas of focus for the Committee this 
year included the following:

 – Consideration of the composition of the 

Board and Committees and the succession 
of Non-Executive Directors and the skills, 
knowledge, experience, diversity and 
attributes required of current and future 
Non-Executive Directors. In considering 
Board succession, the Committee took into 
account the length of tenure of the 
Non-Executive Directors and the 
importance of the progressive refreshing 
of Board membership.

 – Review of individual Director independence 

through the established Conflicts of 
Interest and Persons Closely Associated 
declaration process and concluded that 
there were no concerns as regards the 
composition of the Board, or the 
contribution or commitment of any of 
the Directors.

 – Review of the search firm providers for 

the next stage of the Board’s succession 
planning and engaged the executive search 
firms Hedley May1 and Spencer Stuart2.
 – Oversight of the succession plans in place 
for the Executive Committee and other 
members of senior management, including 
consideration of the Group’s talent 
development programmes to build 
technical and leadership capability.
 – Oversight of the Board Effectiveness 

evaluation and discussion of the feedback, 
observations and recommendations from 

the review of the Board and Committees, 
including the 2023 action plan for approval 
by the Board.

 – Reviewed the Board Diversity Policy 

to ensure it remained aligned with the 
requirements of the Listing Rules and 
incorporated any other best practice.

 – Continued application of the Board 
Diversity Policy and initiatives, and 
reviewed progress made against the 
agreed objectives set out in the Board 
Diversity Policy.

 – Discussion of the role of the Board 
Diversity Policy in advancing the 
composition and effectiveness of the Board 
and Executive Committee.

The Committee also reviewed and approved 
its Terms of Reference, prior to making a 
recommendation to the Board. In completing 
its review, the Committee concluded that the 
Terms of Reference remained appropriate 
and reflected the manner in which the 
Committee was discharging its duties.

The Committee is authorised to seek 
external legal or other independent 
professional advice as it sees fit but did not 
need to do so during the year.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SUCCESSION PLANNING

1
ENHANCED 
REVIEW OF  
INDEPENDENCE

Whilst we see long service on the Board as a positive 
characteristic, the Board is mindful that the 2018 Code 
indicates that Non-Executive Directors should not 
serve for more than nine years and Non-Executive 
Directors that have served over six years should be 
subjected to a particularly rigorous review. 

Such reviews, in line with the requirements of the 2018 
Code, had been undertaken in relation to the 
independence and commitment of the following 
Non-Executive Directors since reaching their six-year 
tenures:

 – Philip Remnant
 – John Coghlan
 – Kevin Beeston

In all cases, the Board remained satisfied that Philip, 
John and Kevin continued to act with the utmost 
independence and considered that their continued 
appointment was in the long-term best interests of 
shareholders. The length of service, independence and 
potential for conflicts of interest of John and Kevin were 
also considered as part of our internally-facilitated 
Board Effectiveness evaluation conducted this year, 
further details of which are set out on pages 118 to 119.

2
PREPARATION  
FOR 
RECRUITMENT

In preparation for two of its longest-serving 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, Philip Remnant 
and John Coghlan, approaching their maximum tenures 
of nine years, the Committee was tasked with reviewing 
the succession plans in place and recruiting additional 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, where 
appropriate, to ensure the optimum balance of skills and 
experience on the Board. During 2021/22, the 
Committee appointed an independent search firm, which 
is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for 

Executive Search Firms, to support with the evolution 
of the Independent Non-Executive membership of the 
Board over the next two to three years. 

Both Philip and John held Committee Chairships and 
therefore tailored recruitment criteria and role 
specifications were developed to outline the appropriate 
skills and experience required to ensure the Board 
continued to comprise members who were qualified 
to carry out these vital roles. 

3
SHORTLIST AND 
SELECTION

The Committee ensured that the recruitment process 
was conducted in line with the Board Diversity Policy, 
in particular that diverse candidates from a wide 
variety of backgrounds and those with non-listed 
company experience were included within the 
respective shortlists. Read more about our Board 
Diversity Policy on page 125.

Interviews were conducted by the Chair, Senior 
Independent Director and Chief Executive, with support 
from the Group Company Secretary. Once a preferred 
candidate had been selected, a pre-appointment 
meeting with Ofwat was arranged ahead of the 
proposed Non-Executive Director being formally 
appointed to the Board of Severn Trent Water Limited. 

4
APPOINTMENTS

Since 2021, the Committee has recommended the 
following appointments to the Board:

 – Gillian Sheldon – as an Independent Non-Executive 

Director and member of the Audit and Risk, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees, and 
Chair of the Treasury Committee.

 – Tom Delay – as an Independent Non-Executive 

Director, Chair of Corporate Sustainability 
Committee and member of the Nominations 
Committee.

 – Sarah Legg – as an Independent Non-Executive 

Director and member of the Audit and Risk, 
Nominations, Corporate Sustainability and 
Treasury Committees.

The Committee had also recommended to the Board 
the appointment of Sharmila Nebhrajani, an existing 
Independent Non-Executive Director, to the 
Remuneration Committee in anticipation of her 
succeeding Philip Remnant as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee.

The Committee also considered succession plans for 
the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, John 
Coghlan, who will have served on the Board for nine 
years in May 2023. The Committee and Board 
are satisfied that John continues to demonstrate 
independent character, judgment and objectivity. 

5
SUCCESSION 
AND INDUCTION

All newly appointed Directors undertook thorough, tailored induction programmes, overseen by the Committee, 
which included specific focus on key aspects of their roles on the Board Committees. Further details on Non-
Executive Director induction programmes can be found on page 117.

FUTURE 
PLANNING

The Committee is satisfied that all key roles have credible succession plans in place. Notwithstanding this, the 
Committee considers succession planning at each of its meetings and will continue to make appropriate 
recommendations to the Board as necessary.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE SUCCESSION PLANNING

THE NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE ALSO CONSIDERED SUCCESSION PLANNING FOR MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DURING THE YEAR, 
INCLUDING IN RELATION TO THE BELOW ROLES.

CHIEF FINANCIAL 
OFFICER

The Company announced on 1 February 2023 that 
James Bowling, Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’) and 
Executive Director, intended to retire from the 
Severn Trent Board following the conclusion of 
the AGM on 6 July 2023, having served the 
Company for over eight years.

Following a rigorous internal and external search 
and selection process, led by the Committee, it 
was announced that Helen Miles, the Group’s then 
incumbent Director of Capital and Commercial 
Services, would be appointed as an Executive 
Director and the CFO Designate with effect from 
1 April 2023.

The Chair and the CEO led the process to identify 
suitable candidates for the CFO role and the 
executive search firm Spencer Stuart1 was engaged 
as part of the recruitment process, having 
demonstrated, of the executive search firms 
considered, that it had the best understanding and 
knowledge of the Group and its culture. Having 
been provided with a role specification and detailed 
brief of the desired candidate profile, Spencer 
Stuart undertook the initial independent appraisal 
process and identified a number of potential 
internal and external candidates for the Committee 
to consider. Those shortlised were then interviewed 
by members of the Committee.

The Committee was pleased to recommend to the 
Board the appointment of Helen Miles given her 
highly experienced and commercial background 
along with a detailed understanding of the water 
sector and proven track record of exceptional 
delivery.

Furthermore, the Committee was particularly 
pleased that Helen would have the opportunity to 
work alongside James prior to his retirement to 
ensure an effective and orderly handover.

1   Spencer Stuart is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct 
for Executive Search Firms. Christine Hodgson acts as an 
External Board Adviser to Spencer Stuart Management 
Consultants NV. The decision to appoint Spencer Stuart was 
first discussed with John Coghlan, Chair of the Audit and Risk 
Committee, before the Board considered the matter and 
determined that the engagement of Spencer Stuart would 
present no conflict of interest.

GROUP GENERAL 
COUNSEL  
AND GROUP COMPANY 
SECRETARY

The Company announced on 13 September 2022 
that Bronagh Kennedy, Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, intended to retire from 
Severn Trent on 2 December 2022, having served 
the Company for nearly twelve years. 

Following a rigorous internal and external search 
and selection process, the Committee considered 
that the role should be split into two roles – Group 
General Counsel and Group Company Secretary – 

with the following two candidates recommended 
for appointment:

 – Didar Dhillon was appointed as the Company’s 
new Group General Counsel with effect from 
2 December 2022, having joined the Group in 
October 2022.

 – Hannah Woodall-Pagan was appointed as Group 
Company Secretary with effect from 2 December 
2022, having joined the Group in October 2015.

DIRECTOR OF CAPITAL 
AND COMMERCIAL 
SERVICES AND DIRECTOR 
OF CUSTOMER 
OPERATIONS

Further to Helen Miles’ appointment as CFO 
Designate, the Committee oversaw the succession 
plans in place for the Executive Committee. 

 – Director of Customer Operations – Appointment 

of Steph Cawley, who has held a number of 
senior roles since joining the Group in 2018.

The Committee recommended to the Board the 
following:

 – Director of Capital and Commercial Services – 
Appointment of James Jesic, who previously 
served as Director of Customer Operations since 
2020 and has been with the Group since 2003.

The Committee was particularly pleased to 
appoint internal candidates to these roles, as 
it demonstrates the strength and talent of the 
Senior Management Team within the business.

Diversity on our Board  
and Committees
The Committee and Board continue to drive the 
agenda of diversity across the Group in setting 
the right tone from the top and are proud of the 
progress being made to date. Whilst Severn 
Trent has long been an advocate of a diverse 
workforce and the huge advantages that this 
brings teams across the business, the 
Committee acknowledges that there is more to 
be done to encourage greater diversity, so that 
all companies can experience the benefits of 
wide-ranging experience and backgrounds.

We welcome the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
(‘FCA’) policy statement, published in April 
2022, regarding changes to the Listing Rules in 
relation to diversity and inclusion on company 
boards. This section of the Annual Report 
addresses the FCA’s requirements in relation 
to diversity and inclusion disclosures set out in 
Listing Rule 9.8.6R(9).

The Nominations Committee reviews the 
Board Diversity Policy (the ‘Policy’) on an 
annual basis and makes recommendations 
to the Board where it identifies changes 
that can be made to further contribute to 
improving the diversity of the Board and 
Executive Committee.

This year, the Policy was updated to include 
reference to the Board Committees required 
to be considered under the 2018 Code and in 
consideration of how wider diversity 
characteristics can be addressed. The main 
objectives contained in the Policy are set out 
below, alongside an overview of the action 
taken to implement the Policy. The full Policy 
is available on the Severn Trent Plc website.

BOARD POLICY OBJECTIVES

IMPLEMENTATION

PROGRESS MADE

Ensure the Board comprises an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience and knowledge 
required to effectively oversee and support 
the management of the Company.

Annual review of the Board’s composition by 
the Nominations Committee with particular 
consideration being given to the balance of 
skills, experience and independence of the 
Board. The Board Effectiveness evaluation 
specifically considered the composition of the 
Board and the contribution, commitment and 
independence of individual Directors.

Ensure consideration is given to diverse 
candidates for Non-Executive Director 
Board appointments from a wide pool, 
including those with no listed company 
Board experience.

Ensure Board appointment ‘longlists’ include 
candidates with a diversity of social and 
ethnic backgrounds and cognitive and 
personal strengths.

The Board and Nominations Committee 
recognise the importance and benefits of 
greater diversity, including gender diversity, 
social and ethnic background and cognitive 
and personal strengths, throughout the 
organisation, including on the Board itself.

On instruction of an executive search firm, the 
specification will ensure that candidates with 
no listed company Board experience are fully 
considered.

Ensure focus is given to the development of 
a pipeline of diverse, high-calibre candidates 
for Board level roles and report annually on 
the diversity of the Executive pipeline as 
well as the diversity of the Board.

Regular Board and Nominations Committee 
consideration of the importance and benefits 
of greater diversity, including gender diversity, 
social and ethnic background and cognitive and 
personal strengths. This includes 
representation of these cohorts in the Group’s 
talent pipeline and on the Board itself.

At its March 2023 meeting, the Committee 
formally reviewed the composition of the 
Board and the performance, contribution and 
commitment of individual Directors in the 
context of the Board Effectiveness evaluation. 
No concerns were raised in relation to the 
composition of the Board and the balance 
of skills, experience and knowledge on the 
Board as a whole. All Board succession 
discussions took place in consideration of 
the Policy.

Sarah Legg was appointed to the Board as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director on 
1 November 2022. 

Following the end of the financial year, 
Helen Miles was appointed to the Board as 
an Executive Director and the CFO Designate 
on 1 April 2023.

The recommendations in respect of these 
Board appointments were conducted in full 
consideration of the Policy, the 2018 Code 
and additional relevant guidance.

The Committee ensured that Hedley May and 
Spencer Stuart, the executive search firms 
engaged for these appointments, presented 
a diverse potential candidate list, including 
candidates with no listed company 
experience.

At its April 2023 meeting, the Board 
considered diversity and inclusion within the 
Group. The Board committed to building on 
existing graduate, apprentice and leadership 
programmes to embed inclusivity in our 
succession planning and talent development 
work. This included discussion on 
strengthening our talent pipeline, with an 
enhanced focus on ensuring appropriate 
representation from minority ethnic 
candidates, as well as other relevant diverse 
cohorts. This was also an area of specific 
focus within the Board and Executive 
Committee succession planning discussions 
that took place during the year.

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT

Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present this report, which aims 
to give shareholders a clear insight into the 
work we have done as a Committee to provide 
challenge and assurance on the integrity of the 
2022/23 Annual Report and Accounts and the 
Group’s regulatory reporting requirements.

The Committee assists the Board by 
establishing, reviewing and monitoring the 
formal and transparent policies and procedures 
to ensure the independence and effectiveness 
of the Internal and External Audit functions, the 
integrity of financial and narrative reporting, the 
Company’s internal control framework and the 
adequacy of the process that enables the Board 
to assess the extent of Principal Risks the 
Company is willing to take to achieve its 
long-term strategic objectives. 

Throughout the year, I maintained regular 
dialogue with other members of the 
Committee, the Chief Financial Officer and 
other members of management, including 
presenters of upcoming agenda items prior 
to meetings, to ensure the Committee was 
provided with the necessary information to 
enable it to guide, challenge and advise and, 
when required, make informed decisions. I 
also met privately with the Head of Internal 
Audit and representatives from the External 
Auditor and External Assurer, both to discuss 
any issues that may have arisen and as part of 
my ongoing assessment of their effectiveness. 

Much of the Committee’s work relates to the 
regulated activities of Severn Trent Water, which 
represent over 91% of Group turnover. The 
Committee’s vital contribution to our Purpose 
of ‘taking care of one of life’s essentials’ ensures 
that the interests of shareholders and other 
stakeholders, particularly our customers and 
regulators, are properly protected, by overseeing 
the Group’s financial reporting and internal 
control arrangements. The Committee uses its 
collective expertise, with input from the External 
Auditor, to provide challenge to the approach and 
judgments made by management in the 
treatment of financial matters and the resulting 
disclosures within the financial statements. 
Transparency and openness are fundamental 
to the relationship between management and 
the Committee, which is further reinforced 
through our culture of Doing the Right Thing.

As such, one of our key roles is to advise the 
Board that we are satisfied that the Annual 
Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 

Company’s position, performance, business 
model and strategy. In doing so, we ensure that 
management’s disclosures reflect the 
supporting detail, or challenge them to explain 
and justify their interpretation and, if necessary, 
re-present the information. The Committee has 
spent considerable time reviewing and 
scrutinising the Group’s financial results, and 
details of the significant issues we considered 
can be found on page 134.

The External Auditor performs its statutory 
audit, by auditing the accounting records of the 
Company against agreed accounting practices, 
relevant laws and regulations. Deloitte’s audit 
report can be found on pages 168 to 175. 

The Financial Reporting Council’s Audit Quality 
Review (‘AQR’) team selected for review the 
audit of the Severn Trent Plc financial 
statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 
as part of its annual inspection of audit firms. 
As Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, I 
received a full copy of the findings of the AQR 
and have discussed these with Deloitte. The 
findings were largely positive, with no 
significant areas for improvement identified 
within the report. The Committee is also 
satisfied that there is nothing within the report 
which might have a bearing on the audit 
appointment. Based on consideration of the 
responses to our internal effectiveness review, 
and taking into account the AQR report, the 
Committee remains satisfied with the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the audit.

We were pleased to advise the Board that the 
2022/23 Annual Report and Accounts are fair, 
balanced and understandable, and that the 
Directors have provided the necessary 
information for our shareholders to assess 
the Company’s position, prospects, business 
model and strategy. Our review process is 
described in further detail on page 131.

During the year, the Committee reviewed and 
agreed with management’s proposal for the 
Company’s long-term Viability Statement to 
continue to cover a seven-year period (see pages 
80 to 83). It was agreed that this was appropriate, 
given the nature of the regulatory framework in 
the water sector and Ofwat’s statutory duty to 
ensure that companies can finance the proper 
carrying out of their functions.

The increasing focus of stakeholders on 
the impact of climate change and other 
environmental issues has become evident in 
the Committee’s workload. The Committee 
plays a key role in the governance of 
environmental and climate-related reporting, 

John Coghlan
Chair

Against the backdrop of upcoming audit 
and corporate governance enhancements, 
the Committee’s contribution to ensuring 
that reporting is fair, balanced and 
understandable is increasingly vital for 
shareholders and other stakeholders who 
want to assess the Company’s performance 
and hold the Board to account.

All members of the Committee are Independent 
Non-Executive Directors of the Board. The Board 
considers that all members of the Committee 
have recent and relevant financial experience and 
competence relevant to the sector, with the Chair 
and the majority of the Committee members being 
qualified accountants. Only members of the 
Committee have the right to attend Committee 
meetings. Other regular attendees at meetings at 
the invitation of the Committee include the Chair 
of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Chief 
Financial Officer (‘CFO’), the Group Company 
Secretary, the Group General Counsel, the Group 
Financial Controller, the Head of Internal Audit, 
other members of senior management, 
representatives from the External Auditor, 
Deloitte, and non-financial regulatory 
performance and data assurers, Jacobs. None of 
these attendees are members of the Committee.

The Committee regularly holds private 
discussions with the Head of Internal Audit and 
the External Auditor separately, without 
management present. The Chair of the Committee 
regularly holds separate one-to-one meetings 
with the CFO, the Head of Internal Audit, the 
External Auditor and with Committee members 
outside of scheduled meetings to better 
understand any issues or areas for concern.

GOVERNANCE REPORTAUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

including overseeing, in conjunction with the 
Corporate Sustainability Committee and 
supported by independent third-line assurance 
by Jacobs, the Group’s Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’). 

The Committee has also spent a considerable 
amount of time reviewing the Group’s risk 
management processes and procedures, with 
good progress made in enhancing their 
effectiveness during the year. You can read more 
about our approach to risk on pages 73 to 74.

You will see that this report contains an overview 
of the Company’s whistleblowing arrangements. 
The Board has previously agreed that the 
responsibility for oversight of whistleblowing 
arrangements should continue to be delegated to 
the Audit and Risk Committee and not be a 
matter reserved solely to the Board. However, 
the Board as a whole monitors and reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s whistleblowing 

arrangements annually, to ensure that it has 
sufficient oversight of whistleblowing to support 
its work on culture, risk and stakeholder 
engagement. The Audit and Risk Committee 
continues to receive reports on investigations 
and all significant whistleblowing matters are 
reported directly to the Board. The Board has 
reviewed these arrangements again this year 
and is satisfied that they are effective, facilitate 
the proportionate and independent investigation 
of reported matters and allow appropriate 
follow-up action to be taken.

The annual Board Effectiveness evaluation, which 
was conducted internally this year, assessed our 
performance as a Committee, and I am pleased 
that this concluded that we operate effectively and 
that the Board takes assurance from the quality of 
our work. The Board is satisfied that the 
Committee members bring a wide range of 
financial experience across various industries and 

all members have competence relevant to our 
sector, with significant recent and relevant 
financial experience. Further information about 
each Committee member is contained in their 
individual biographies, which can be found on 
pages 104 to 105.

I would like to thank the members of the 
Committee, the management team, Internal 
Audit, Deloitte and Jacobs for their continued 
commitment throughout the year, for the open 
discussions that take place at our meetings, and 
for the contribution they all provide in support 
of our work.

John Coghlan
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee

KEY AREAS 
OF FOCUS IN 2022/23

The Committee has an extensive  
agenda focusing on the audit, risk and 
assurance processes within the business 
which it deals with in conjunction with 
management, the External Auditor, Internal 
Audit and the Finance and Regulatory 
Compliance and Assurance teams.

Internal Audit and assurance
 – Considered Internal Audit reports 

presented to the Committee and satisfied 
itself that management had resolved or 
was in the process of resolving any 
outstanding issues or actions.

 – Reviewed and approved the Internal Audit 

plan and approach for 2023/24.

 – Reviewed the quality and effectiveness  
of Internal Audit and the effectiveness of 
the current co-source arrangements.
 – Considered the findings of the assurance 

that had been undertaken as part of 
regulatory submissions for the Drainage 
and Wastewater Management Plan, Water 
Resources Management Plan, Water 
Industry National Environment Programme 
and Strategic Resource Options.

 – Reviewed the detailed assurance plan and 
approach for the Severn Trent Water PR24 
submission. 

Internal controls and risk 
management
 – Reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 

ERM processes and procedures and internal 
control systems, and integration of the 
components of the risk framework into 
Board and Committee reporting, prior to 
making a recommendation to the Board.
 – Received updates on legal, regulatory and 

ethical matters, and monitored fraud 
reporting and incidents of whistleblowing, 
including a review of the adequacy of the 
Group’s whistleblowing processes and 
procedures, prior to reporting to the Board 
on this activity.

 – Oversaw and monitored the Group’s 

compliance with the Bribery Act 2010, 
including a review of the adequacy of the 
anti-bribery, corruption and fraud processes 
and procedures (and associated policies).

External Audit
 – Managed the relationship for the 2022/23 

statutory audit, including the key audit risks 
and level of materiality applied by Deloitte, 
audit reports from Deloitte on the financial 
statements and the areas of particular 
focus for the 2022/23 audit.

 – Considered the outcome of the FRC’s Audit 
Quality Review of Deloitte’s audit of the 
Company’s 2021/22 financial statements.
 – Assessed the effectiveness of the External 
Auditor and made a recommendation to the 
Board on the reappointment of Deloitte as 
the External Auditor.

 – Agreed the statutory audit fee for the year 

ended 31 March 2023.

 – Reviewed and approved the non-audit 

services, provided by the External Auditor 
and related fees for 2022/23. 

Financial and regulatory reporting
 – Reviewed and discussed reports from the 
Chief Financial Officer on the financial 
statements, considered management’s 
significant accounting judgments and the 
policies being applied, and assessed the 
findings of the statutory audit in respect of 
the integrity of the financial reporting of full 
and half-year results.

 – Reviewed the integrity of the regulatory 
reporting process relating to the Annual 
Performance Report, and other regulatory 
submissions, for Severn Trent Water as 
required to be submitted to Ofwat.

 – Reviewed the 2022/23 Annual Report and 

Accounts, and provided a recommendation 
to the Board that, as a whole, they complied 
with the 2018 Code principle to be ‘fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy’.
 – Challenged and scrutinised management’s 

detailed assessment of the Group’s 
long-term viability and its ability to 
continue as a going concern. In doing so, 
the Committee took into account the risks 
facing the business, and its ability to 
withstand a number of severe but 
plausible scenarios. Having considered 
management’s assessment, the 
Committee recommended to the Board the 
long-term Viability Statement set out on 
pages 80 to 83.

 – Considered the Company’s proposals 

to address the response to the 
Government’s call to strengthen the audit, 
corporate reporting and corporate 
governance regime in the United Kingdom. 
Read more on page 129.

The Committee also reviewed and approved the Committee’s Terms of Reference, prior to making a recommendation to the Board. In 
completing its review, the Committee concluded that the Terms of Reference remained appropriate and reflected the manner in which the 
Committee was discharging its duties.

The Committee is authorised to seek external legal or other independent professional advice as it sees fit but did not need to do so during the year.

SPOTLIGHT ON 
CORPORATE REFORM

The quality and accuracy of reported 
information has always been a key focus of 
the Committee’s work. As such, the 
Committee welcomed the response from the 
Department of Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy (‘BEIS’) on proposals to 
strengthen the UK’s audit, corporate 
reporting and corporate governance 
systems, which was published during the 
year. Whilst the timelines and final 
conclusions of the reforms are uncertain, the 
Committee requested from management a 

summary of the measures that the Financial 
Reporting Council (‘FRC’) and the Audit 
Reporting and Governance Authority (‘ARGA’, 
the successor to the FRC) intend to progress, 
an initial assessment of how the changes 
could impact the Group and any proactive 
action that could be taken in the interim 
period ahead of formal legislation being 
passed.

and internal control system in relation to 
financial reporting was strong and, as a 
result, many of the proposed reforms were 
expected to be implemented efficiently and 
effectively. A number of action points were 
considered by the Committee for the short to 
medium term, whilst clarity was awaited on 
potential amendments to the 2018 Code and 
the enactment of relevant legislation. 

The review undertaken by the Finance and 
Company Secretariat teams concluded that 
the Group’s existing governance framework 

A summary of the Committee’s 
considerations is set out below.

PUBLICATION OF AN AUDIT AND 
ASSURANCE POLICY EVERY THREE YEARS 
AND AN IMPLEMENTATION  
REPORT ANNUALLY

By virtue of the Group’s existing regulatory requirements, a robust audit and assurance 
framework and system are already in place. Details of our current audit and assurance 
framework and systems are reported externally through the Annual Report and Annual 
Performance Report. We welcome further guidance and look forward to publishing our 
Audit and Assurance Policy in due course.

STRENGTHENING OF INTERNAL CONTROL 
PROVISIONS IN THE 2018 CODE

The Committee oversees the annual review of the Group’s systems, processes and 
procedures in order to provide assurance to the Board that the Group’s internal control 
systems continue to operate effectively. As such, the Committee noted that there will be 
future changes to the 2018 Code which will require a formal statement regarding the 
effectiveness of controls and the basis of the assessment that has been completed. The 
Group will continue to review any proposed changes in relation to internal control to ensure 
compliance to future changes.

PROVISION OF A RESILIENCE STATEMENT 
TO REPORT ON MATTERS THAT THE 
COMPANY CONSIDERS WILL RESULT IN A 
MATERIAL CHALLENGE TO ITS RESILIENCE 
OVER THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM

Given the existing risk, going concern and viability requirements and disclosures, the Group 
is well positioned to address developments relating to the introduction of a formal 
Resilience Statement. The Group will continue to comply with current requirements and 
will review any amendments to legislation and the 2018 Code to ensure readiness ahead of 
changes coming into effect.

REQUIREMENT FOR DIRECTORS TO MAKE 
A STATEMENT ON STEPS THE COMPANY 
HAS TAKEN TO PREVENT AND DETECT 
MATERIAL FRAUD

To ensure the Group has an appropriate and effective fraud risk management framework in 
place, during the year an initial review of our existing framework was undertaken. As a 
result of the review, minor amendments have been implemented, including training staff to 
recognise common forms of bribery and corruption, and ensuring Group Authorisation 
Arrangements remain appropriate. 

DISCLOSURE AND AUDIT OF 
DISTRIBUTABLE RESERVES

INCREASED TRANSPARENCY OVER 
EXECUTIVE PAY

We currently disclose the amount of reserves that are distributable and we publish the 
Group’s approved Dividend Policy. Once further guidance has been made available, a review 
of the reporting requirements will be undertaken and any additional detail relating to 
dividends and capital maintenance will be included to ensure compliance.

The Government has proposed changes to the provisions of the 2018 Code, including greater 
transparency of the conditions under which Executive pay can be withheld or recovered and 
provisions in relation to minimum malus and clawback conditions which should be applied 
by remuneration committees. Once guidance has been published, a review of the updated 
requirements will be undertaken and the Committee will work alongside the Remuneration 
Committee to ensure the necessary disclosures are made.

ENGAGEMENT OF SMALLER CHALLENGER 
AUDIT FIRMS TO CONDUCT A MEANINGFUL 
PORTION OF SUBSIDIARY AUDITS

We await further guidance on the definition of a ‘meaningful portion’. Once the guidance is 
available, an assessment will be undertaken to consider how the appointment of a 
challenger audit firm could be implemented and how this might impact our next external 
audit tender process, which we anticipate will be conducted no later than 31 March 2024.

GOVERNANCE REPORTAUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

INTERNAL AUDIT

Internal Audit is an independent assurance function available to the Board, Audit and Risk Committee and all levels of management, and is a 
key element of the Group’s corporate governance framework.

Support is provided by four main co-sourcing partners: PwC, EY, KPMG and BDO. Co-source arrangements are reviewed annually and we 
believe this structure adds value, through greater access to specific areas of expertise, increased ability to flex resources, and the ability to 
challenge management independently. Co-source specialists continue to bring expertise to support the team and delivery of the audit plan 
where relevant.

INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN AND ACTIONS

The role of Internal Audit is to provide independent and objective 
assurance that the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems are well designed and operate effectively, and that any 
corrective action is taken in a timely manner.

A three-year strategic audit planning approach is applied, from which 
Internal Audit develops an annual risk-based audit plan; this 
facilitates an efficient deployment of resource in providing assurance 
coverage over time across the whole business. The Committee’s role 
is to review and challenge the plan, specifically whether the key risk 
areas identified as part of our ERM process are being audited with 
appropriate frequency and depth. Individual Committee members 
also bring an external view of risks the Company may be exposed to. 
Once approved by the Committee, regular reporting enables the 
Committee to monitor delivery of the audit plan and ensure that 
Internal Audit performs its work in accordance with the mandatory 
aspects of the International Professional Practice Framework of the 
Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (the ‘CIIA’), with integrity 

(honestly, diligently and responsibly) and objectively (without conflicts 
of interest).

Following the completion of each planned audit, Internal Audit seeks 
feedback from management and reports to the Committee on the 
findings of the audit, including any action that may be required. Where 
any failings or weaknesses are identified in the course of the review 
of internal control systems, management puts in place robust actions 
to address these on a timely basis. No material weaknesses were 
identified during the year. Action closure is reported to, and 
monitored by, the Committee and we are pleased to confirm that our 
review established that management places a strong focus on closing 
audit actions and ensuring timely completion.

The Internal Audit function also liaises with the External Auditor, 
discussing relevant aspects of their respective activities which 
ultimately supports the assurance provided to the Committee 
and Board.

EFFECTIVENESS

We undertake an annual review of the effectiveness of the Internal 
Audit function in line with the CIIA Internal Audit Code of Practice and 
the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees. The CIIA guidance states that 
Audit Committees should obtain an independent and objective external 
quality assessment at least every five years. However, we consider it 
prudent to carry out external effectiveness reviews every three years. 
The last external review of the effectiveness of the Internal Audit 
function was undertaken in December 2021. The review was carried out 
by BDO, which concluded that the Internal Audit function remained fit 
for purpose, was operating efficiently and effectively, and in line with 
good practice. 

BDO’s findings also highlighted clear evidence that the Internal Audit 
function operated with strategic alignment, a focus on risk and an 
emphasis on quality and continuous improvement, all underpinned 
by objectivity and integrity. The minor areas of improvement raised 
by BDO have been incorporated into an action plan which was shared 
and agreed with the Chair of the Committee. All actions were 
completed in line with the proposed timescales.

Taking all these elements into account, the Committee concluded that 
the Internal Audit function was an effective provider of assurance 
over the Group’s risks and controls, and appropriate resources were 
available as required.

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The 2018 Code sets out requirements in relation to companies’ internal controls and risk management and, as such, throughout the year, 
the Committee receives and reviews regular management reports and updates in relation to internal controls and risk management 
to assure itself that the processes in place remain effective.

INTERNAL CONTROLS

An internal control system can provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss, as it is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives. The Committee reviews the Group’s internal control 
systems and receives updates on the findings of Internal Audit’s 
investigations at every meeting, prior to reporting any significant 
matters to the Board, which retains overall responsibility for the 
effectiveness of the full suite of internal controls across the Group.

As set out on page 130, the Audit and Risk Committee has oversight of 
the Group’s preparations to enact early recommendations that have 
arisen from the BEIS consultation on ‘Restoring trust in audit and 
corporate governance’. We are fully committed to ensuring that the 
Group’s audit and governance arrangements reflect best practice and 
address any new requirements within the expected timeframes.

As part of this, during the year a detailed review of the Group’s 
systems, processes and procedures was undertaken by the 
Committee in order to provide assurance to the Board that the 
Group’s internal control systems, including those which cover 
financial reporting, continue to operate effectively.

Further to the reports received by the Committee, which set out 
the Group’s processes, systems and assurance procedures, the 
Committee has concluded that it has complied with its obligations 
under the 2018 Code in relation to the assessment of risk and the 
monitoring and review of the effectiveness of internal controls and 
risk management. The Committee is pleased to confirm that it was 
able to provide the Board with assurance that the Group’s internal 
control systems and risk management procedures are effective, 
efficient and operating as required.

The Group has an ERM process in place through which our Principal 
Risks and related controls are identified and assessed. The Board has 
overall responsibility for setting the Group’s risk appetite and ensuring 
that there is an effective risk management framework in place, and has 
delegated responsibility for review of the risk management methodology 
and effectiveness of internal controls to the Audit and Risk Committee. 
The Committee reviews the processes for, and outputs from, the Group’s 
ERM activity, through which our Principal Risks and related controls are 
identified. It also reviews the effectiveness of the risk management 
system on behalf of the Board and keeps under review ways in which the 
control and assurance arrangements can be enhanced. The Audit and 
Risk Committee is complemented by a Strategic Risk Forum which 
assists the Committee in reviewing the risk management system, 
internal controls that mitigate risks and undertaking reviews of 
assurance risk reports prior to Audit and Risk Committee meetings. 
The Central ERM Team also undertook a review of the integration of the 
components of the risk framework into Board and Committee reporting, 
prior to making a recommendation to the Board. 

This year, the Committee spent a considerable amount of time 
reviewing the Group’s ERM processes and procedures, with good 
progress made in enhancing its effectiveness during the year. The 
Committee also reviewed the Group’s Risk Appetite Statement and 
recommended this for consideration and approval by the Board. You 
can read more about this important work on pages 73 to 74.

The Committee received half-yearly reports from the Head of Risk, 
detailing the significant risks and uncertainties faced by the Group. 
Each risk submitted for review includes an assessment of the overall 
risk status, status of the control environment and a summary of the 
risk mitigation plan to take the risk to the target risk position, which 
needs to be in line with the risk appetite. The risk mitigation plan 
covers action plans to improve controls where this has been assessed 
as necessary and assesses whether actions are on target, with the 
correct prioritisation in place. Further details of the Group’s risk 
management systems and controls and Principal Risks can be found 
in the Strategic Report on pages 73 to 79.

WHISTLEBLOWING

The Group has established procedures by which all employees may, in 
confidence, report any concerns. Our Whistleblowing Policy, ‘Speak 
Up’, sets out the ethical standards expected of everyone that works 
for, and with, us and includes the procedure for raising concerns in 
strict confidence. Our workforce can raise concerns through their line 
manager, senior management and through our confidential and 
independent whistleblowing helpline and online channel, ‘Safecall’. 
All investigations are carried out independently with findings being 
reported directly to the Audit and Risk Committee.

The Board as a whole monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s whistleblowing arrangements annually, to ensure that it has 

sufficient oversight of whistleblowing to support its work on 
assessing culture, risk and stakeholder engagement. The Audit and 
Risk Committee receives reports on investigations and all significant 
whistleblowing matters are reported directly to the Board. The Board 
also receives regular updates from the Committee and the Board 
completes an assessment of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
whistleblowing procedures. The Board has reviewed these 
arrangements again this year and is satisfied that they are effective, 
facilitate the proportionate and independent investigation of reported 
matters and allow appropriate follow-up action to be taken.

FAIR, BALANCED AND 
UNDERSTANDABLE 
REPORTING
At the request of the Board,  
the Committee has considered 
whether, in its opinion, this  
Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is ‘fair, balanced 
and understandable’ (‘FBU’) and 
whether it provides  
the ‘information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy’.

The following process was 
followed by the Committee in 
making its assessment.

1

REGULAR DISCLOSURE  
COMMITTEE REVIEW

The Disclosure Committee reviewed the Annual 
Report and Accounts throughout the drafting process 
and undertook a detailed FBU assessment ahead of 
tabling a detailed report to the Audit and Risk 
Committee.

2

REGULAR AUDIT AND RISK  
COMMITTEE REVIEW

The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the Annual 
Report and Accounts at an early stage, and 
throughout the drafting process, to enable sufficient 
time for review and comment, and to ensure overall 
balance and consistency between the narrative 
sections and the financial statements.

The Audit and Risk Committee was supported in its 
review by the Disclosure Committee, whose 
appraisal of the Annual Report and Accounts is 
undertaken by members of the Executive Team who 
are not directly involved in drafting any content.

3

INTERNAL AUDIT VERIFICATION 
AND OVERSIGHT

Internal Audit reviewed the Annual Report and 
Accounts, and oversaw the verification process for 
all factual content and reported back to the Audit and 
Risk Committee on its assessment findings.

4

FBU ASSESSMENT

The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed and 
approved the process in place to support the FBU 
assessment and reviewed the findings of this 
process. The Audit and Risk Committee was satisfied 
that all the key events and issues reported to the 
Board by management (both positive and negative) 
had been adequately referenced or reflected within  
the Annual Report and Accounts.

5

EXTERNAL AUDITOR REVIEW

The External Auditor is required to consider whether 
there are any material inconsistencies between 
information presented in different sections of the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taking into account the 
Auditor’s knowledge obtained during the audit and 
the Auditor’s understanding of the legal and 
regulatory requirements applicable to the narrative. 

The External Auditor presented the results of its 
audit work. The significant issues the Audit and Risk 
Committee considered were consistent with those 
identified by the External Auditor in its report (see 
pages 168 to 175 for more detail).

6

RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD

The Board approved the Audit and Risk Committee’s 
recommendations that the FBU statement could be 
made in the Annual Report and Accounts. A 
declaration to this effect is included within the 
Directors’ Responsibility Statement on page 167.

GOVERNANCE REPORTAUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

EXTERNAL AUDITOR

The Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with the External Auditor, including assessing its performance, 
effectiveness and independence annually, and making a recommendation to the Board in respect of its reappointment or removal.

TENDER AND APPOINTMENT

Following a formal tender process in 2015/16, Deloitte LLP was 
reappointed as External Auditor at the 2016 AGM. Following the rule 
that the audit engagement partner must change every five years, 
Jacqueline Holden became the senior statutory auditor and has 
overseen the audit of the Severn Trent Group since 2020/21. Other 
senior audit staff also rotate at regular intervals.

The Committee anticipates that the next competitive tender will be 
conducted no later than 31 March 2024, in accordance with current 
regulation that requires a tender every ten years. Deloitte will not be 
able to participate due to mandatory rotation requirements.

EFFECTIVENESS AND COMPETENCE

The Committee considers audit quality to be the principal 
requirement of the annual audit process and, as such, a full 
effectiveness review is conducted annually. This year, it involved 
assessment of the External Auditor by the Committee, key Executives 
and relevant senior management, including an evaluation of whether 
the External Auditor met the minimum standards of qualification, 
independence, expertise, effectiveness and communication. All 
members of the Committee, as well as key members of management 
and those who have regular contact with the External Auditor, 
completed a feedback questionnaire focusing on the following areas:

 – Robustness of the external audit process, ‘professional scepticism’ 

of the External Auditor and degree of challenge to matters of 
significant audit risk and areas of management subjectivity.

 – Appropriateness of the scope of the audit and the planning process 

for the delivery of an effective and efficient audit.

 – Quality of the delivery of the audit, the service provided by the 
External Auditor and its knowledge and understanding of the 
Group’s business.

INDEPENDENCE

The Committee regards independence of the External Auditor as 
absolutely crucial in safeguarding the integrity of the audit process 
and takes responsibility for ensuring the three-way relationship 
between the Committee, the External Auditor and management 
remains appropriate.

The Committee recognises that independence is also a key focus for 
the External Auditor, and Deloitte has confirmed that it has complied 
with its own ethics and independence policies, which are consistent 
with the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard (2019). This includes the 
External Auditor’s assurances that all of its partners and staff 
involved with the audit are independent of any links to the Group and 
that none of its employees working on our audit hold any shares in 
Severn Trent Plc. 

The proposed tender date is in the best interests of shareholders and 
the Company as Deloitte has a detailed knowledge of our business, an 
understanding of our industry and continues to demonstrate that it 
has the necessary expertise and capability to undertake the audit.

The Company has complied with the provisions of the Competition and 
Markets Authority’s Order for the financial year under review in 
respect to audit tendering and the provision of non-audit services.

 – Expertise of the audit team conducting the audit.
 – Independence applied by the External Auditor and that policies and 

procedures were consistently applied.

 – Views on the quality of the interaction between the audit partner 

and senior members of the audit team and the Company.

 – Whether the statutory audit contributed to the integrity of the 

Group’s financial reporting.

Feedback was collated and presented to the Committee in March 
2023, without the External Auditor present. The Committee discussed 
the conclusions and any opportunities for improvement, which were 
brought to the attention of the External Auditor. The Committee also 
considered the outcome of the FRC’s Audit Quality Review into the 
External Auditor’s audit of Severn Trent Plc’s financial statements for 
the year ended 31 March 2022. No significant issues were reported as 
part of either the internal or external review processes, and it was 
concluded that the external audit process and services provided by 
Deloitte were satisfactory and effective.

Deloitte provides confirmation of independence during the planning 
stage of the audit, disclosing matters relating to its independence and 
objectivity. There were no independence issues raised in respect of 
the 2022/23 audit.

The Committee also develops and recommends to the Board the 
Group’s policy on non-audit services and associated fees paid to 
Deloitte, to ensure the External Auditor is not providing any additional 
services which could impede its independence. You can read more 
on this policy on page 133.

STATUTORY AUDITOR REAPPOINTMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 MARCH 2024

The Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP be proposed for reappointment for the year ending 31 March 2024 at the 
forthcoming AGM on 6 July 2023. There are no contractual obligations that restrict the Committee’s choice of auditor; the recommendation is 
free from third party influence and no auditor liability agreement has been entered into.

132

SEVERN TRENT PLC  

 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

NON-AUDIT SERVICES

To preserve objectivity and independence, the External Auditor is not 
asked to provide other services unless it is in the best interests of the 
Company that these are provided by Deloitte rather than another 
supplier, in accordance with our Non-Audit Services Policy (the 
‘Policy’).

We reviewed and updated the Policy during 2019/20 to reflect the 
FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard and the more restrictive list of 
services that are now permitted, and the Policy was subject to a 
further review during the year. The Policy requires Committee 
approval for all such non-audit services. The Policy also prohibits 
aggregate fees for non-audit services in excess of 70% of the 
average audit fee for the previous three financial years. Non-audit 
services for which the External Auditor may be used include 
audit-related services required by statute or regulation and other 
audit or assurance services as set out in the Ethical Standard.

During the year, Deloitte received £1.3 million in fees for work relating 
to the audit services it provides to the Group. Non-audit-related work 
undertaken by Deloitte amounted to fees of £0.3 million this year, 

which is 23.1% of the total audit fees paid to it (as shown in the chart 
below). The more significant non-audit services provided by Deloitte 
were the audits of the financial information contained within the 
Severn Trent Water and Hafren Dyfrdwy Annual Performance 
Reports and the independent review of the Company’s half-yearly 
financial report. 

Audit and non-audit fees paid to Deloitte are set out in note 7 to the 
financial statements on page 192. In approving these non-audit fees, 
we considered the overall ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees and, 
given the scope of work, considered that Deloitte was best placed to 
perform these services. Where Deloitte was chosen, this was as a 
result of its detailed knowledge of our business and understanding 
of our industry, as well as demonstrating that it had the necessary 
expertise and capability to undertake the work cost effectively whilst 
maintaining its objectivity and independence.

Details of audit and non-audit fees and the significant non-audit work 
undertaken during the year are set out below.

GOVERNANCE REPORTAUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED AND ADDRESSED IN RELATION TO THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Committee looked carefully at those 
aspects of the financial statements that 
required significant accounting judgments or 
where there is estimation uncertainty. These 
areas are explained in note 4 to the Group 
financial statements. The Committee also 
considered the accounting treatment for 
revenue and accrued income. It received 

detailed reports from both the CFO and the 
External Auditor on these areas and on any 
other matters which they believed should be 
drawn to the Committee’s attention.

The draft External Auditor’s report on the 
financial statements was also reviewed, with 
particular reference to those matters reported 
as carrying risks of material misstatement.

The Committee discussed the range of 
possible treatments both with management 
and with the External Auditor, confirming that 
the judgments made by management were 
robust and supportable. For all the matters 
described below, the Committee concluded 
that the treatment adopted in the Group 
financial statements was appropriate.

SIGNIFICANT ISSUE

HOW THE ISSUE WAS ADDRESSED BY THE COMMITTEE

GOING CONCERN BASIS FOR THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS AND LONG-TERM VIABILITY STATEMENT

DETERMINATION OF THE PROVISION FOR 
IMPAIRMENT OF TRADE RECEIVABLES IN 
SEVERN TRENT WATER LIMITED

At 31 March 2023, the provision in the Group’s financial 
statements was £135.1 million and the charge for the 
year was £24.5 million. Severn Trent Water Limited has a 
statutory obligation to continue to supply water and waste 
water services to customers even when their bills are 
unpaid. This increases the risk of bad debts. In addition, 
it has a large and diverse customer base which requires 
impairments against trade receivables to be assessed 
on a systematic basis.

The Committee reviewed and challenged the evidence and assumptions underpinning 
the use of the going concern assumption in preparing the accounts and in making the 
statements in the Strategic Report on going concern and long-term viability.

In particular, the Committee considered severe but plausible scenarios modelled in 
relation to the Company’s Principal Risks, noting the stress tests performed by 
management and the potential mitigating actions identified.

Our Business Model can be found on pages 4 to 5. Principal Risks and uncertainties 
can be found on pages 75 to 78. The Viability Statement can be found on pages 80 to 83 
and the Going Concern Statement on page 83.

The Committee challenged management’s assumptions regarding historical cash 
collection and the impact of the cost of living pressures on Severn Trent Water’s 
customers on the expected credit losses for trade receivables existing at 31 March 
2023, noting the independent forecasts of the likely economic impacts and the recent 
evidence of a link between macroeconomic conditions and the Group’s bad debt 
experience.

The Committee considered the work performed by the External Auditor and the 
conclusions they reached regarding the adequacy of the provision.

The Committee determined that no adjustment to the amounts recorded was required.

THE PROPOSED CLASSIFICATION OF COSTS 
BETWEEN OPERATING EXPENDITURE AND CAPITAL 
EXPENDITURE IN SEVERN TRENT WATER LIMITED

The Committee considered the application of the Group’s accounting policies in 
relation to capital expenditure during the year. The Committee enquired of 
management whether the policies had been applied consistently from year to year.

Severn Trent Water Limited has a significant capital 
programme that includes projects made up of 
combinations of expenditure and activities, some of which 
are recognised as property, plant and equipment and 
some of which are recognised as operating costs. For 
most of the expenditure this distinction is clear but there 
is an element where subjective judgments are required to 
determine the appropriate accounting treatment.

DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE GROUP’S 
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

At 31 March 2023, net retirement benefit obligations 
amounting to £279.4 million were recognised. The net 
obligation recognised on the balance sheet is the difference 
between the fair value of the schemes’ assets at the balance 
sheet date and the present value of the benefits expected 
to be paid to members of the schemes. This requires 
assumptions to be made for the expected age of retirement 
and longevity of members, future inflation rates and 
increases to benefits.

It is also necessary to determine an appropriate discount 
rate to calculate the present value of the estimated 
gross obligations. 

Management takes advice from external qualified actuaries 
who perform the calculation of the present value of the 
benefits based on the assumptions set by management.

The Committee considered the results of the External Auditor’s work and discussed 
the conclusions with the External Auditor.

The Committee determined that no adjustment to the amounts recorded was required.

The Committee scrutinised the assumptions underlying the valuation of the obligations 
and obtained explanations for the significant reduction in the deficit recorded. The 
Committee considered whether the assumptions, taken as a whole, were appropriate, 
taking into account the work of the External Auditor and the benchmark information 
provided. The Committee also scrutinised the methodologies applied in assessing the fair 
values of the schemes’ assets and considered the estimation techniques used for assets 
for which an up-to-date valuation was not available.

The Committee considered that the assumptions and methodologies were reasonable, 
and that no adjustment was required to the draft Group financial statements.

The Committee further considered the accounting treatment for the bulk annuity 
buy-in for the Dee Valley Water Section of the Water Companies Pension Scheme and, 
in particular, management’s conclusion that this transaction did not represent a 
settlement under IAS 19. The Committee noted that the Group retained the legal 
obligation to pay the member benefits as they fall due and discussed this conclusion 
with the External Auditor.

The Committee determined that no adjustment to the amounts recorded was required.

TREASURY COMMITTEE REPORT

Dear Shareholder 
I am delighted to introduce my first report as 
Chair of the Treasury Committee and would 
like to convey my thanks to John Coghlan for 
his leadership of the Committee over the 
previous seven years and for the significant 
time he has invested in ensuring a smooth and 
effective handover to me.

The Committee continues to oversee the Group’s 
funding requirements and financing risks and 
opportunities and, in doing so, assists the Board 
in the effective discharge of its responsibilities 
in relation to treasury management. 

The Committee plays a key role in ensuring that 
the Group remains in a strong financing position 
and, in recognition of the importance of its work, 
feedback from the 2021/22 Board evaluation led 
to a dedicated ‘teach-in’ session on Treasury 
matters being held during the year for Directors 
who were not members of the Committee.

Future funding is an important part of the 
normal business planning process and the 
Committee provides regular updates to the 
Board in respect of funding, solvency and 
liquidity matters so that the Group can respond 
quickly to any opportunities.

This year the Committee spent a large amount 
of time considering the impact of the external 
economic environment on the Group, including 
the growing cost of energy, the impacts of the 
rise in interest rates and increasing inflation, and 
the ongoing effects of geopolitical events. The 
Committee also continually reviews financial 
counterparty risk. Against this tumultuous 
backdrop and resulting uncertainty, it was 
crucial that the Group continued to develop and 
maintain a diverse range of funding sources and 
access to a range of global debt markets.

During the year, the Group refinanced £979 million 
of its debt and issued £1,351 million of new debt. 
The Treasury Team has been active in diversifying 
its sources of funds, promoting the Group in new 
global markets. This comprehensive activity 
ensured that the Group remained in a strong 
liquidity position and in compliance with its 
Liquidity Policy. At the balance sheet date, the 
Group had sufficient liquidity to meet its forecast 
cash flow requirements in line with the Group’s 
treasury policies.

Of the total debt raised, Severn Trent Water issued 
a further £600 million under the European Medium 
Term Note Programme, providing cost-effective 
liquidity, whilst continuing to maintain diversity in 
the Company’s sources of funding. This comprised 
a £400 million sustainable GBP fixed-rate bond and 
£100 million CPIH debt issue, which provides a 
hedge against the Company’s index-linked 
revenues and Regulatory Capital Growth (‘RCV’), 

and fixed-rate Private Placements totalling 
£100 million. In addition, Severn Trent Water raised 
a further £350 million through bank loans and 
£200 million from US Private Placements.

In common with many other companies, we closely 
monitored the volatile energy market during the 
year and the effect that the rapid rise of energy 
costs was having on inflation. The Group’s Hedging 
Policy was reviewed to ensure it remained 
appropriate in consideration of market volatility 
being observed. In line with its Terms of Reference, 
the Committee proposed to the Board that 
amendments were made to the Group Authorisation 
Arrangements to enable management to act swiftly 
in relation to future hedging opportunities.

Sustainable finance remained a core element of the 
Group’s funding strategy and an updated 
Sustainable Finance Framework was published in 
July 2022. The Group closely monitors developments 
in sustainable finance through its Sustainable 
Finance Committee, which reports to the Treasury 
Committee on at least an annual basis.

During the year the Dee Valley Pension Scheme 
completed a bulk annuity buy in with Just 
Retirement Limited, effectively de-risking the 
scheme from future interest rate, inflation and 
longevity risk. The UK Gilt market also saw 
unprecedented volatility, which affected many 
pension schemes. The Treasury Team, with the 
oversight of the Treasury Committee, worked 
closely with the Trustee of the Severn Trent 
Pension Scheme to review its risk management 
controls and procedures and ensure continued 
liquidity throughout the market volatility.

The annual Board Effectiveness evaluation, which 
was conducted internally this year, assessed our 
performance as a Committee and I am pleased that 
this concluded that we operate effectively and that 
the Board takes assurance from the quality of our 
work. The Board is satisfied that the Committee 
members bring a wide range of financial experience 
across various industries and all members have 
competence relevant to our sector, with significant 
recent and relevant financial experience. Further 
information about each Committee member is 
contained in their individual biographies, which 
can be found on pages 104 to 105.

I would like to thank the members of the Committee, 
the management team and our debt advisers, 
Rothschild & Co, for their continued commitment 
throughout the year, for the open discussions that 
take place at our meetings, and for the contribution 
they all provide in support of our work.

GOVERNANCE REPORTTREASURY COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

KEY AREAS 
OF FOCUS IN 2022/23

The Committee provides Board 
oversight of the Group’s key financing 
risks and opportunities.

 – Execution of the Group’s financing 
plan and evaluation of funding 
opportunities, in consideration of the 
external operating environment, 
including entering new financial 
markets.

 – Consideration of the Group’s Liquidity 

Policy and confirmation that a 
15-month Policy remained 
appropriate.

 – Review of the Group’s treasury 

policies in relation to hedging of 
market risks (including energy, 
interest rates, inflation and currency), 
and financial counterparty credit risk 
and credit ratings.

 – Annual update of the Group’s 
European Medium Term Note 
Programme and approval for bonds 
to be issued pursuant to that 
Programme during the year, including 
a £400 million Sterling Bond 
completed in November 2022.

 – Review of the Group’s Sustainable 

Finance Framework and associated 
governance.

 – Regular review of the Group’s Funding 

Strategy, including interest rate 
strategy to support the Group in 
consistently outperforming the cost 
of debt allowance.

The Committee also reviewed and 
approved its Terms of Reference, prior to 
making a recommendation to the Board. 
In completing its review, the Committee 
concluded that the Terms of Reference 
remained appropriate and reflected the 
manner in which the Committee was 
discharging its duties.

The Committee is authorised to seek 
external legal or other independent 
professional advice as it sees fit but 
did not need to do so during the year.

Sustainable Finance Framework
Our financing strategy recognises that a strong 
liquidity position and the availability of 
committed funding are essential to meeting 
the Group’s objectives and obligations. It is 
also imperative that we achieve these aims in 
a responsible and sustainable way.

The Sustainable Finance Framework (the 
‘Framework’) was first established in 2019 to 
enable Severn Trent Plc and its subsidiaries 
to raise debt in support of the financing and/or 
refinancing of assets and expenditure of a 
sustainable nature across the Group’s 
activities. The Framework was updated 
during the year to align to the latest market 
standards.

Under the Framework, we report on a range 
of environmental and social impacts resulting 
from the investments and the eligible projects 
funded by the proceeds. To date, around 
£3 billion of finance has been raised under 
the Framework and these proceeds have 
been allocated to the areas listed below.

Environmental:
 – Generating energy from renewable sources 

for use on site.

 – Reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

 – Reducing leakage.

 – Increasing biodiversity by planting trees 
and ensuring sustainable land and water 
resources management practices.

 – Improving the quality of our rivers in the 

Severn Trent region.

Social:
 – Supporting vulnerable customers 

struggling to pay their bills.

 – Providing free employability training 
under our Employability Scheme.

More information on how proceeds from 
the Framework have been used to progress 
our eligible projects can be found in the 
dedicated Allocation Reports on our website. 

We are committed to applying the most 
up-to-date standards and methodologies to 
measure and report on the impact of future 
issuances. All reporting under the Framework 
is available to investors via our website in line 
with the reporting requirements.

Ahead of the updated Framework being 
published, independent assessors, DNV, 
provided a Second Party Opinion on the 
accuracy and integrity of the Framework to 
give investors confidence that the Framework 
was aligned to accepted market principles. A 
copy of DNV’s opinion confirming the 
Framework’s compliance with the required 
standards and protocols can also be found on 
our website.

CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE REPORT

Dear Shareholder 
I am delighted to introduce my second report 
as Chair of the Corporate Sustainability 
Committee. The following pages describe the 
activities of the Committee and provide an 
overview of the topics addressed during 
the year.

The Corporate Sustainability Committee has a 
key role in supporting the Board by providing 
guidance and direction on the Company’s 
sustainability ambitions. The Committee 
provides Board oversight for elements of the 
Group’s Strategy that relate to the environment 
and also social and economic priorities in 
accordance with the Company’s Sustainability 
Framework, ensuring the Company can 
demonstrate that it lives through its Purpose 
and Values, and acts responsibly in its 
engagement with all stakeholders.

Sitting alongside me on the Committee are 
Christine Hodgson, Sharmila Nebhrajani and 
Sarah Legg, and Liv Garfield attends each 
meeting, with an open invitation, to bring the 
benefit of her expertise in sustainability 
matters. Our collective experience and 
capability lead to insightful and passionate 
debate around a wide range of existing and 
emerging sustainability topics. The 
Committee’s discussion is then presented to 
the Board at the beginning of every meeting to 
ensure that its oversight of Environmental, 
Social and Governance (‘ESG’) matters 
remains strategic, current and effective. 

I would like to extend a personal welcome 
to Sarah Legg, who joined the Board as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director from 
1 November 2022 and as a member of the 
Corporate Sustainability Committee. In 
addition to a strong financial background, 
Sarah has a wide range of experience having 
been heavily involved in community work and 
diversity initiatives during her career. I know 
that sustainability is a topic of particular 
interest to her and we are delighted to have 
her as a member. 

Following the refresh of the Group’s Strategy, 
the Committee reviewed and approved its 
Terms of Reference during the year before 
getting the approval of the Board. In its review, 
the Committee concluded that the Terms of 
Reference remained appropriate and reflected 
the manner in which the Committee was 
discharging its duties. Additional duties were 
introduced to strengthen the role of the 
Committee in advising the Severn Trent Plc 
Remuneration Committee on the Group’s 
performance against sustainability metrics 
and on the setting of sustainability-related 
targets.

Global sustainability agenda
The turbulence of the last year has led to many 
of the long-term challenges around 
sustainability being accelerated. From a 
climate resilience perspective, we have seen 
extremes from across the globe that bring into 
sharp focus the real-life impact behind the 
climate science, such as water scarcity, 
extreme heat and rainfall intensity. At the 
same time, geopolitical unrest has created 
unprecedented supply pressures, and 
subsequent price volatility across a range of 
commodities, including energy and chemicals. 
These have created significant cost pressures 
for both businesses and individual households, 
our customers. Inflationary increases are 
putting pressure on household income, further 
exacerbated by interest rate rises, recession, 
and potential job losses. 

While the evidence continues to build that 
systemic change is needed to address these 
issues that the world is facing, there are 
divided opinions on how change should happen 
and who should deliver it. Severn Trent 
continues to take a pragmatic approach, 
maintaining a balance between the needs of our 
stakeholders, the drive for sustainable change 
and the needs of the communities we serve.

Tom Delay
Chair

Sustainability is not a new 
or separate direction for 
us. Our drive to deliver 
outstanding performance 
in a way that has a positive 
sustainable impact is what 
makes Severn Trent so 
unique, guiding our purpose 
of ‘taking care of one of life’s 
essentials’.

All members of the Committee are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors of 
the Board, with the exception of Christine 
Hodgson (who was independent on 
appointment). Only members of the 
Committee have the right to attend 
Committee meetings. Other individuals, 
such as the Chief Executive, the Director 
of Human Resources and other senior 
management and external advisers, may 
be invited to attend meetings as and when 
appropriate. None of these attendees are 
members of the Committee.

GOVERNANCE REPORTCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

Sustainability led culture
Sustainability is not a new or separate direction 
for us. Acting in a responsible manner is 
integral to our Purpose of ‘taking care of one of 
life’s essentials’ and our culture reflects the 
social challenges that we face. We developed 
our Sustainability Framework to draw together 
our ESG ambitions, which form an integral part 
of our business plan that is deeply embedded 
within the organisation. Performance against 
the Sustainability Framework is reported on a 
quarterly basis to the Committee, in our Annual 
Report and Accounts, on our website and 
through selected ESG indices. You can read 
more in our standalone Sustainability Report, 
which will be available on the Severn Trent Plc 
website in June.

The Group’s Remuneration Policy is designed 
with all stakeholders in mind and incentivise 
service delivery for our customers, society and 
the environment. 

In 2021, the Company agreed the development 
of sustainability performance measures in the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) with a 
weighting of 20%. In March 2022, we 
announced our commitment to ‘Get River 
Positive’ and directly linked our river pledges 
to our remuneration structures through 
including them in our Annual Bonus Plan for 
2022/23. This year, the Board approved two 
new equally-weighted carbon measures for 
the 2023-26 LTIP aligning more closely to 
internationally recognised mechanisms such 
as the Science Based Target Initiatives for 
Scope 1, 2 and 3. These are: ‘Direct 
Contributors to Carbon Reduction’ and 
‘Innovation and Engagement for Carbon 
Reduction’. For the 2023 award, each of these 
has two components. 

Our culture ensures that we care about our 
customers and the broader communities that 
we serve. Many of our people live in these 
communities, which is why we are so 
committed to our new Societal strategy 
announced in November 2022. Our ambitious 
ten-year plan aims to address the underlying 
causes of poverty across the Midlands in a 
landmark scheme designed to help 100,000 
people out of poverty. The scheme supports 
more people to help themselves and improve 
their life chances, through initiatives such as 
work experience, training and employability 
skills development, partnerships, mentoring 
and more.

See pages 32

This year we continued to test, at scale, how 
innovation can drive the reduction of our 
carbon footprint. Recognising the importance 
of early action, we recently announced an 
exciting partnership with Melbourne Water and 
Aarhus Vand Partners, working collaboratively 
to develop and test technologies that could 
reduce the carbon footprint of waste water 
treatment sites, share existing expertise, and 
establish new international standards for 
measuring and reporting emissions. This joint 
commitment looks to reduce carbon emissions 
by over a million tonnes and aims to lead the 
green transformation of the sector. I am 
encouraged by this collaborative approach 
to support our transition to net zero and embed 
circular economy principles so we can 
maximise the value from the material that is in 
our waste.

The Committee is authorised to seek external 
legal or other independent professional advice 
as it sees fit, but did not need to do so during 
the year.

The Committee is proud of the Company’s 
many achievements over the last year, 
described within the Strategic Report on pages 
2 to 99, and the work we have undertaken to 
positively impact communities within our 
region. Further detail on key matters, 
ambitions and achievements that the 
Committee has considered during the year are 
set out on the pages that follow, in addition 
to the areas of focus for 2023/24. 

The increasing focus of stakeholders on the 
impact of climate change and other 
environmental issues has become evident in 
the Committee’s workload. The Corporate 
Sustainability Committee plays a key role in 
the governance of environmental and 
climate-related reporting, including 
overseeing, in conjunction with the Audit and 
Risk Committee and supported by independent 
third-line assurance by Jacobs, the Group’s 
TCFD disclosure. 

I would like to thank the members of the 
Corporate Sustainability Committee for the 
open, constructive, ambitious and progressive 
discussions that take place at our meetings, 
and for their passion and personal 
commitment to our wide-ranging and 
purposeful agenda.

The Committee recognises that our 
sustainability ambitions are deeply rooted and 
owned across the whole Company. We are 
proud that our affordability approach won ESG 
Initiative of the Year at the Corporate 
Governance Institute Awards 2022, and were 
delighted to have been placed 58th by Corporate 
Knights as one of the world’s most sustainable 
companies. In August 2022, we also achieved 
the ‘Advancing’ tier of Carbon Trust Route to Net 
Zero, a new certification that we piloted last 
year. These achievements underline our 
commiment to delivering excellence on the 
sustainability agenda. The Committee has a 
clear view of the focus areas for our 
sustainability journey, and both the Committee 
and Board are confident that we have the right 
aims and approach in place.

OUR TCFD 
DISCLOSURE

We are committed to the 
recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(‘TCFD’), providing our stakeholders with 
transparent information on climate-
related risks and opportunities that are 
relevant to our business. 

Our fifth TCFD disclosure can be found on 
pages 39 to 56. 

Human rights and modern slavery 
We are committed to protecting the human 
rights of our employees and contractors, as 
outlined in our Code of Conduct, Doing the 
Right Thing. 

We have a responsibility to understand our 
potential impact on human rights and to 
mitigate potentially negative impacts. Whilst 
not having a specific human rights policy, 
we have a range of Group policies on Human 
Resources, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Fraud, 
Whistleblowing (‘Speak Up’) and 
Procurement, as well as a Modern Slavery 
Escalation and Remediation Policy and a 
separate Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking 
Statement. We consider this approach goes 
above and beyond a human rights policy. 
Additionally, our Group policies are well 
embedded across the Group.

STRONGFORD

Process emissions contribute significantly 
to our reduction challenge, accounting for 
around 83% of operational emissions. We 
aim to convert a large number of our sites to 
low carbon works, necessitating scale 
deployment of new technologies and 
alternative processes to reduce our process 
emissions. Our first pilot project in this area 
is to deliver a Net Zero hub at Strongford, 
working in partnership with others in the UK 
and internationally. Proving the value of this 
concept now will provide the basis for wider 
roll-out across our region in coming years.

We know modern slavery is a growing global 
issue and our customers and other 
stakeholders share our concern, which is why 
we remain fully committed to protect against 
modern slavery in our business and supply 
chain. Our highest risk is within our supply 
chain and, as such, we work closely with our 
suppliers to ensure they operate to the same 
standards we set ourselves and ensure the 
risks involved in their own supply chains are 
understood and mitigated. All suppliers are 
required to sign up and operate in line with 
our Code of Conduct, which clearly sets out a 
zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, 
and this requirement is built into our 
procurement tender process.

Our commitment to training colleagues, senior 
managers and Board members remains as 
strong as ever, and our partnerships with 
Slave-Free Alliance, the Supply Chain 
Sustainability School and Utilities Against 
Slavery help support this. We provide our 
employees with access to a wide range of 
learning resources, including dedicated 
modern slavery awareness training for 
all organisations within the Group’s supply 
chain. Our full Anti-Slavery and Human 
Trafficking Statement can be found on the 
Severn Trent Plc website. 

Freedom of association and 
collective bargaining 
We recognise the right of all employees to 
Freedom of Association and Collective 
Bargaining. We seek to promote co-operation 
between employees, our management team 
and recognised Trade Unions. We meet with 
our Trade Unions on a quarterly basis at the 
Company Forum and see mutual benefit in 
sharing information with our colleagues and 
seek their feedback and suggestions. We 
believe this fosters a common understanding 
of business needs and helps to deliver joint 
solutions aimed at making our business 
successful. The Company Forum also provides 
an invaluable opportunity for engagement with 
the whole workforce to ensure their views are 
taken into account.

Responsible business practices are an integral 
part of our business strategy. Performance 
against our sustainability commitments is 
reported throughout our Annual Report and 
Accounts, reflecting their embedded nature in 
our Governance Framework. You can read 
more in our standalone Sustainability Report 
and on our dedicated sustainability webpages, 
which will be available on the Severn Trent Plc 
website in June.

The Committee is fully 
aware of the unique nature 
of our business, being 
both a regional monopoly 
and an essential public 
service. We strive to ensure 
management is held to 
account through setting 
stretching targets and 
assessing performance in 
the round and over time, 
with incentives that can 
only be achieved through 
the delivery of value for 
our stakeholders.

All members of the Committee are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors of 
the Board, with the exception of Christine 
Hodgson (who was independent on 
appointment). Only members of the 
Committee have the right to attend 
Committee meetings. Other individuals, 
such as the Chief Executive, the Director 
of Human Resources, the Chief Financial 
Officer, other senior management and

Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to present my first Directors’ 
Remuneration Report as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’). I 
joined the Severn Trent Board in May 2020 and 
took over as Chair of the Committee from 
Philip Remnant in December 2022. On behalf of 
the Committee, I am pleased to provide an 
overview of both Executive Director and wider 
workforce remuneration for the financial year 
ended 31 March 2023. 

Over the next few pages, I set out how we  
are actively addressing and factoring in 
stakeholder expectations into our approach  
to Executive pay, for the benefit of our 
customers, colleagues, communities and 
shareholders alike.

In this letter, as well as setting out 
performance for the year under review and 
remuneration decisions for the year ahead, I 
focus on how the Committee takes into account 
broader stakeholder views when setting and 
determining our remuneration policy, 
structure and outcomes. 

We are in no doubt that the issue of Executive 
pay has struck a powerful chord with the 
public and is understandably under scrutiny. 
There is also no doubt that water companies 
need to acknowledge this as a totemic issue 
and demonstrate robust principles and 
decision making on Executive pay. 

Our Remuneration Policy is designed to 
deliver balanced outcomes for our 
stakeholders, driving long-term sustainable 
performance for the benefit of all groups. 
In overseeing remuneration outcomes, the 
Committee ensures that performance is 
assessed in the round and over time through 
a number of lenses, incorporating a variety 
of stakeholder perspectives. Page 148 
provides more detail about how the 
Committee reviewed the formulaic bonus 
and Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
outcomes for 2022/23, taking into account 
broader aspects of the Company’s 
performance.

Looking beyond the year in review, the 
Committee always considers the impact 
on broader stakeholder groups when 
making decisions on remuneration. The 
table overleaf shows the principles on which 
our Remuneration Policy is built to ensure 
stakeholders are considered.

Focus on 
long-term 
performance

How applied

 – All of our people share in our success by participating in our all-employee bonus plan, ensuring employees are aligned with the 

same measures and rewarded for achieving our key objectives.

 – The Company has real Living Wage employer accreditation and reviews salaries in this context.
 – As of April 2022, Executive Director employer pension contributions are fully aligned to those of the wider workforce.
 – All employees can participate in the Save As You Earn scheme, Sharesave, which attracts significant take-up rates with 73.4% 

of employees actively participating.

 – All employees are eligible to participate in our flexible benefits scheme, which we believe is one of the best in the industry and 

is designed to support all aspects of physical, mental and financial wellbeing. See page 24 for our range of benefits.

 – We take our commitment to keeping our employees safe and well very seriously and as a result we set stretching targets for 

this via a Lost Time Incidents (‘LTI’) measure which comprises 8% of the annual bonus. 

 – In 2022/23, the Company delivered its best ever health and safety performance, with a world-leading LTI rate of 0.11.

 – 50% of Executive Directors’ annual bonuses are awarded in shares that are deferred for three years and 100% of the LTIP is 

awarded in shares, which are subject to a two-year holding period post-vesting. 

 – All of the Company’s incentive scheme rules contain malus and clawback provisions, allowing the Committee to reduce or 
recoup any past incentive payments from individual Executives if we later learn of information that was material to the 
incentive scheme outcome after the time of the award. Use of deferral mechanisms aids our ability to operate malus and 
clawback as required, though neither have been deemed necessary to date. 

 – Post-cessation shareholding requirements were introduced as part of the 2021 Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) to reinforce 

the importance of sustainable long-term performance. 

Proportionate  
base pay

 – The Committee regularly assesses the position of base pay against other water and sewerage companies (‘WaSCs’) and 

similar listed companies with benchmark data provided by our external remuneration advisers, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (‘PwC’). 

 – Cumulative Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) and Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’) pay increases have been below both inflation 

every year since appointment and the cumulative increases applied to the wider workforce during the same period.

 – Three-quarters of potential CEO pay is variable in nature (see chart below), based on stretching targets that are reviewed 

annually by the Committee.

Assessment 
of 
performance  
in the round

Stretching  
targets

Focus on the 
environment

 – When determining Executive pay outcomes, we do not simply follow the formulaic outcome of each performance measure but 
also undertake a thorough assessment of ‘performance in the round’ through several lenses. This assessment examines 
whether formulaic outcomes are appropriate in the context of overall business performance and service delivery for 
customers, the environment and wider stakeholders. 

 – ‘Performance in the round’ is also assessed by an independent market assessment report prepared for the Committee by PwC.

 – LTIP maximum outturn can only be achieved if Severn Trent’s Return on Regulated Equity (‘RoRE’) performance is upper 

quartile (‘UQ’) relative to other WaSCs. 

 – We set stretching targets on the profitability component of the Annual Bonus Scheme (‘ABS’), and the degree of stretch is 

shown by the fact that the overall outturn for this measure has only paid out once in full during AMP6 and AMP7.

 – Customer Outcome Delivery Incentives (‘ODI‘) bonus measures are split into three buckets to ensure the Company focuses on 
performing well across all measures, rather than prioritising a few. The Committee’s insistence on stretching targets means 
that we have not paid out the maximum possible bonus during AMP7 to date, despite delivering sector-leading ODI 
performance.

 – In 2021, we introduced a sustainability-based performance measure within the LTIP, with a weighting of 20%, with targets 

aligned to our Triple Carbon Pledge. 

 – In 2022, we created a specific section of the annual bonus for measures and targets linked to river health equating to 8% of the 

total bonus. This took the overall the weighting of environmental measures from 12% to 20%.

 – In 2023/24, the weighting of environmental measures in the bonus has been increased again from 20% to 30%. This was done 

primarily by increasing the river health weighting from 8% to 12%, and introducing a new EPA 4* measure worth 5%.

Performance for  
the year under review
This year has been a challenging one for most 
businesses in the UK, and Severn Trent is no 
exception. Rising energy and chemical costs, 
coupled with one of the hottest summers on 
record, has tested the Company both 
financially and operationally. Notwithstanding 
the challenging backdrop, the Company has 
delivered a resilient set of results and 
maintained its focus on delivering for 
customers, caring for communities and 
colleagues, and nurturing the environment. 

There can be no doubt that the cost of living 
crisis has affected many employees. The 
Committee was pleased to see the Company 
continuing to prioritise its duty of care to 
employees throughout the year. As well as 
being a real Living Wage employer, employees 
have access to a wide range of services and 
benefits designed to take care of all aspects of 
wellbeing; physical, mental and financial. For 
more details of how we are helping colleagues 
through the cost of living crisis, see the case 
study on page 157.

2022/23 bonus outcome
A consistent bonus design is operated 
throughout the organisation. When 
implementing the 2022/23 scheme, the 
Committee determined that it would continue to 
use the measures and weightings agreed with 
shareholders. Page 146 sets out details of the 
2022/23 annual bonus outturn, which will pay 
out at 38.5% of maximum opportunity, 
compared to 81% in 2021/22. The payout for 
2022/23 is equivalent to 46.2% of salary for both 
the CEO and CFO, versus 97.2% in 2021/22. The 
lower outturn is driven largely by lower 
performance against the PBIT measure, 
reflecting a significantly tougher operating 
environment, particularly the impact of higher 
energy and chemical costs. Whilst the overall 
outcome of our Customer and Environment ODI 
measures is below target and lower than last 
year, c.80% of measures are green, and we 
performed well against our health and safety 
targets, with a formulaic outcome just below 
maximum performance. 2022/23 was the first 
year of operation of our river health bonus 
measure and we achieved full vesting following 
excellent performance against our reduction in 
Combined Sewer Overflows (‘CSO’) activations 
and reduction in Reasons for Not Achieving 
Good Status (‘RNAGS’) targets. 

LTIP vesting
The standard element of the 2020 LTIP 
award measures the Company’s performance 
against RoRE set by Ofwat’s Final 
Determination (‘FD’). Over the three-year 
performance period of the 2020 LTIP, the 
Company achieved a RoRE of 1.95x against the 
target of 1.39x the base RoRE return.

This results in full vesting of the standard 
element of the 2020 LTIP award, which is 
equivalent to 75% of maximum for the 
total 2020 LTIP award for the CEO, and 66.7% 
of maximum for the CFO. The Committee has 

reviewed the vesting of the award to consider 
potential windfall gains and concluded that, 
subject to final share price on vesting, there 
has not been any windfall gain. For more 
details on how the Committee assessed this, 
please see page 148.

Vesting under the UQ element of the 2019 LTIP 
award was only known at the end of July 2022 
when comparable statistics for the other WaSCs 
were published. This meant that the LTIP single 
figure value reported for 2021/22 did not include 
the UQ element of the 2019 LTIP award. We 
now know that Severn Trent achieved UQ 
performance, and therefore the UQ element of 
the 2019 LTIP award is included in the 2022/23 
single figure for the CEO and CFO. 

Assessment of performance 
in the round
In overseeing remuneration outcomes, the 
Committee ensures that performance is 
assessed in the round through a number of 
lenses, to incorporate a variety of stakeholder 
perspectives. This assessment examines 
whether formulaic incentive outcomes are 
appropriate in the context of overall business 
performance for customers, the environment 
and wider stakeholders. It also considers other 
factors, including regulatory investigations, 
environmental compliance beyond the 
measures contained in the incentive schemes, 
health and safety performance, treatment of 
the wider workforce and societal matters 
such as support for our local communities.

We have demonstrated again this year that we 
are one of the sector’s leading performers:

 – We are highly confident in achieving EPA 4* 

in the Environment Agency’s annual 
assessment for the fourth consecutive year. 

 – c.80% of our ODI measures are green, 
including those that measure leakage, 
pollutions and water quality complaints.

 – In November 2022 we launched our Societal 
Strategy, with the objective of helping up to 
100,000 people in our region, giving them 
improved chances in life and tackling the 
underlying causes of poverty.

Further detail on the Committee’s assessment 
of performance in the round is set out on page 
148.

Following the Committee’s assessment of 
these factors in the performance in the round, 
no discretion has been exercised to override 
the formulaic outturn of either the 2022/23 
annual bonus or the standard element of the 
2020 LTIP award.

The Committee believes that the outcomes 
of the annual bonus and LTIP are both 
appropriate and reflective of the Company’s 
broader performance over their respective 
performance periods, and that the Policy 
has operated as intended. 

Remuneration for the year ahead
The Committee considers all elements of 
Executive Director pay as well as reviewing 
wider workforce implications. Looking ahead 

to 2023/24, the Committee has made the 
following decisions for the coming year: 

Base salaries and fees
The Executive Director base salaries, Chair’s 
fee, and Non-Executive Director base fees will 
increase by 3.0% in July 2023. Although 
negotiations with our Trade Unions for the 
wider workforce pay increase are ongoing 
at the time of publication, these rises are 
less than half of the current offer that has 
been tabled.

2023/24 bonus
Over the last year the focus on environmental 
performance of water companies has 
intensified, particularly in relation to how it 
links to Executive pay outcomes. Whilst the 
Committee is confident that we already have 
strong links between environmental 
performance and pay, with 20% of the existing 
annual bonus linked to environmental 
measures, we believe it is appropriate to go 
further and make the link between 
environmental performance and remuneration 
even stronger and more direct. 

In April 2023, the Committee approved an 
increase to the weighting of the river health 
element from 8% to 12% and the creation of a 
specific section of the annual bonus for the 4* 
Environmental Performance Assessment 
(‘EPA’) rating equating to 5% of the total. This 
means that, from 2023/24, 30% of the annual 
bonus will be linked to measures relating 
specifically to environmental measures and 
river health. 

The Committee shared these proposals with 
30 of our largest shareholders, which are 
aligned with the Policy and will apply to our 
bonus structure from the 2023/24 financial 
year onwards. More detail can be found on 
page 157.

The maximum bonus opportunity will be 120% 
of salary for the Executive Directors, with 
performance conditions continuing to be 
consistent throughout the organisation. 

2023 LTIP grant
The Committee has determined to make the 
grant on the normal timetable and to retain the 
existing RoRE and sustainability performance 
elements, with updated measures and targets 
for the sustainability element (see box on the 
next page, and page 151). In April 2023, we 
shared these proposals with 30 of our largest 
shareholders to inform them of the evolution of 
the sustainability measures. These changes 
are within the remit of the current Policy, 
which will be reviewed and tabled for 
shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM.

The Committee will assess the value of the 
2023 LTIP award at vesting and will ensure that 
the final outturn reflects all relevant factors, 
including consideration of underlying 
performance and progress towards the 
achievement of our Triple Carbon Pledge.

GOVERNANCE REPORT               
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED

Board changes
In February 2023, Severn Trent announced 
James Bowling’s intention to retire as CFO and 
Executive Director. James has been 
instrumental in driving the success of Severn 
Trent since his appointment in 2015, and I know 
how much the Board and wider Company have 
valued his experience and counsel over the 
last eight years. I’d like to thank James on 
behalf of the Committee, and I wish him well 
for the future.

It was also announced that, following a 
rigorous internal and external search and 
selection process, our Capital and Commercial 
Services Director Helen Miles would succeed 
James as CFO. Helen was appointed as 
Executive Director of the Company on 1 April 
2023, with the title of CFO Designate. James 
will remain an Executive Director and the CFO 
until the conclusion of the AGM on 6 July, at 
which point Helen, having completed a full 
handover process, will take on the 
responsibility. The Committee has determined 
that James will leave with ‘good leaver’ status, 
and is being treated in line with the Policy, as 
set out in more detail on page 151. The 
Committee considered the status of ongoing 
regulatory investigations and noted its ability 
to exercise its powers of malus and clawback if 
appropriate, once concluded.

Helen has been appointed on a salary of 
£480,000, and her wider remuneration package 
is in line with that of her predecessor, and the 
shareholder-approved Policy. Helen is a CFO 
of exceptional calibre, with a detailed 
understanding of the water sector, and I am 
delighted that she was appointed as James’ 
successor. 

Further detail on implementation of 
remuneration for all Executive Directors for 
2023/24 can be found on pages 149 to 150.

We remain committed to maintaining an 
ongoing and transparent dialogue with our 
major shareholders and we will actively 
engage with each of them individually as the 
formal Policy review commences later in 2023. 
I hope that we can rely on your vote in support 
of our approach to remuneration. If you would 
like to discuss any aspect of this Report, I 
would be happy to hear from you. You can 
contact me through our Group Company 
Secretary.

Sharmila Nebhrajani OBE
Chair of the Remuneration Committee

LTIP sustainability 
As part of the 2021 Policy, we introduced a 
sustainability-based performance measure 
within the LTIP, with a weighting of 20%. The 
first LTIP awards with this measure were 
granted in June 2021.

Our LTIP sustainability framework 
focuses on two equally weighted areas, 
‘Direct Contributors to Carbon Reduction’ 
and ‘Innovation and Engagement for Carbon 
Reduction’, and for the 2023 award each 
of these measures has two components, 
as follows:

Direct Contributors 
to Carbon Reduction

Scope 1 & 2 reduction
A Scope 1 & 2 reduction target is a 
natural evolution from measuring 
process emissions to delivering actual 
reduction. It continues the activity 
previously incentivised through the LTIP, 
including improving emissions 
measurement and electric or low-carbon 
vehicles. These actions and subsequent 
reductions will directly contribute 
towards our committed 46% reduction 
Science-Based Target (‘SBT’).

Self-generation of renewable energy
In light of the renewed ambition to push 
further on renewable energy investment 
for both economic, resilience and 
environmental purposes, this measure 
remains a fundamental driver of our 
credible carbon reduction journey. 

Innovation and Engagement 
for Carbon Reduction

Roll-out of Net Zero hub
Process emissions contribute 
significantly to our reduction challenge, 
accounting for around 80% of operational 
emissions. Our aim is to turn a large 
number of our sites into net zero works, 
which will require new technologies and 
alternative processes. 

We have made a commitment to deliver  
a Net Zero hub at one of our largest sites 
as a pilot project. The successful delivery 
of this will underpin the future roadmap 
to Net Zero by 2030 for the business and 
will lead the sector in delivery of scale 
improvements in process emissions in 
AMP8 and beyond.

Scope 3 supply chain engagement
Aligned to our own SBT, we have 
committed to engage a percentage of  
our suppliers to have set a SBT 
themselves by 2026. This engagement 
target for the supply chain is a key staging 
post on the journey to set that reduction 
pathway by 2026.

REMUNERATION AT A GLANCE

Strategic alignment of remuneration
The approach to remuneration across the 
Group is to ensure all our employees are 
rewarded and incentivised to deliver Severn 
Trent’s performance driven, sustainability-led 
strategy. Delivering against this Strategy is 
critical to the creation of long-term value for 
our stakeholders: customers, communities, 
employees, shareholders, suppliers and 
contractors, and our regulators.

In determining the right performance 
measures for our incentive plans, the 
Committee seeks to strike a balance between 
short- and long-term financial, operational 

and sustainability goals. As we are a long-term 
business, actions taken in a single year flow 
through to longer-term performance. We 
operate an Annual Bonus Scheme across the 
Group, which reflects our belief that all our 
employees play a part in the creation of value 
for our stakeholders.

The diagrams below illustrate the 
performance measures that we use within our 
incentives and explain how the measures, 
together with the overall structure of 
incentives, help deliver the Group’s financial, 
operational and sustainability goals.

A significant proportion of ODIs relates to the service 
we provide to our customers and supports alignment 
with customer focus. Our ODIs are grouped into three 
categories. To achieve the maximum outtum for this 
section of the bonus requires outperformance 
across all three categories, thereby ensuring 
strategic focus across all customer 
and environmental performance indicators.

Customer and  
Environment ODIs  
35%

Our five river pledges focus on what is most pertinent 
to stakeholders, namely reducing the impact of our 
operations on river health, helping others reduce 
their impact, and increasing opportunities for people 
in our region to enjoy our waterways.

We are committed to achieving the industry-leading  
4* EPA status.

River Health  
12%

EPA  5%

Health and Safety  
8%

Deferral into shares

We are committed to keeping our employees safe 
and well, and set stretching targets via our 
‘Lost Time Incidents’ measure.

For Executive Directors, 50% of the bonus is 
deferred into shares for three years to support 
long-term shareholder alignment.

RoRE  
80% 
(standard &  
UQ element)

RoRE is a financial Key Performance Indicator 
(‘KPI’) and is the core driver of overall Company 
performance, supporting the long-term 
sustainability of the Company. 
Components of RoRE are as follows:

– Wholesale totex

– Customer ODIs

– Retail operating costs

– Financing

As explained on page 146, the RoRE performance 
measure of the LTIP award comprises a standard 
element and a UQ element. The UQ element ensures 
that exceptional relative performance must be 
achieved to justify full vesting of the RoRE element.

Our sustainability measures are aligned with our 
environmental commitments to reach net zero 
carbon emissions by 2030.

Sustainability  
20%

Two-year holding 
period

For Executive Directors, the LTIP is fully delivered 
in Company shares subject to a two-year holding 
period, ensuring long-term alignment with 
shareholder interests and delivery for stakeholders, 
including customers and the environment.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED

REMUNERATION FOR THE YEAR IN REVIEW
The Committee believes it is important that, for Executive Directors and senior management,  
a significant proportion of the remuneration package should be performance-related and aligned 
to targets that deliver value for stakeholders. 

The following section highlights the performance and remuneration outcomes for our Executive 
Directors for the year ended 31 March 2023, starting with the total single figure outcomes. 

2022/23 single figure outcomes £’000
The graphs below show how the successful delivery of our Strategy has flowed through to the rewards provided to our Executive Directors.

The single figure amounts in 2022/23 are 18.7% and 18.5% lower than 2021/22 for the CEO and CFO respectively, mainly due to the lower bonus 
outcome in 2022/23.

As part of the 2018 Policy review, the maximum potential remuneration of the Executive Directors was increased through the introduction of 
a new stretch UQ element within the LTIP. This change, which received overwhelming support from shareholders, saw the maximum LTIP 
opportunity increase from 150% to 200% of salary for the CEO and 100% to 150% of salary for the CFO.

In order to determine if the Company has achieved the stretch LTIP target, comparative data for the other WaSCs needs to be collated, verified 
and published by Ofwat. This process concludes in July each year, which is after the publication date of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The outcome of the LTIP UQ element will therefore always be published one year in arrears.

Comparative data published by Ofwat in July 2022 confirmed that the Company achieved UQ status and therefore the UQ element of the 2019 
LTIP award vested, and is reported in the 2022/23 single figure as shown above.
For more detail on the single figure value, see page 160.
