Letter from the Chair

Our governance framework 
is the foundation upon 
which we remain confident 
in our decision making 
across the Group as we 
continue to navigate 
challenges presented by 
ever-changing market 
conditions.”

Dear shareholders,

Introduction
2023 has been another year where the Board’s 
role in monitoring and managing emerging 
risks in the macro-economy, and in markets, 
has been critical. The UK has continued to face 
a number of challenges and global market 
conditions have continued to be volatile during 
the period. Throughout this, Legal & General 
has remained robust and resilient, and we have 
much to be positive about going into 2024.

As a Board we remain confident in our strategy 
and in our ability to deliver resilient growth, 
supported by our strong competitive positioning 
in attractive and growing markets. Our strategy 
positions us well to navigate the prevailing 
market environment. We are confident we 
can continue to deliver profitable growth as 
we execute on our strategy and deliver on our 
purpose to improve the lives of our customers, 
create value for our shareholders and build 
a better society.

Our 2023 half year results were the first under 
a new accounting standard for insurance 
contracts. IFRS 17 was first conceived in the 
late 90s, but for most insurers significant work 
started in earnest in 2017. I would like to express 
my gratitude to everyone that contributed 

to the IFRS 17 programme across the 
Company. More detail on the implementation 
of this standard can be found in the Audit 
Committee report on pages 86 to 91.

As shareholders will be aware, in January 2023, 
Sir Nigel Wilson informed the Board of his 
intention to retire from executive life after 
14 years with Legal & General, 11 of those years 
as Group Chief Executive Officer. Nigel’s 
achievements over those years, and the 
leadership qualities he brought to the Company, 
are immense. Nigel has successfully navigated 
significant geopolitical changes as well as 
challenges in the regulatory and market 
environments of each of our core businesses 
and has steered the Group into a position of 
strength from which it can continue developing 
on behalf of its shareholders, customers and 
people. These achievements were rightly 
recognised, not only by Nigel’s knighthood, but 
also when we were voted Britain’s Most 
Admired Company by our fellow FTSE 100 and 
FTSE 250 companies last year. Under his 
stewardship, the Group has consistently 
delivered profitable, sustainable and inclusive 
growth. Nigel has been a tireless champion for 
investment-led growth and responsible 
investment. On behalf of the Board, I thank 
Nigel for his significant contribution and 
leadership of the Company and wish him well 
for the future.

Following Nigel’s decision to retire from 
executive life, the Nominations and Corporate 
Governance Committee led a rigorous, global, 
selection process which led to the appointment 
of António Simões, who joined us on 1 January 
2024. I look forward to working with António 
over the coming years. Further detail on the 
selection process can be found in the 
Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee report on page 81.

As a Board we continue to oversee and test the 
Company’s strategy. The development and 
delivery of that strategy falls to our executive 
colleagues, led by our new Group Chief 
Executive Officer, António Simões, our Group 
Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Davies, and the 
heads of our four business divisions: Laura 
Mason, Andrew Kail, Michelle Scrimgeour and 
Bernie Hickman, each in turn supported by their 
management teams.

They are highly effective, individually and 
collectively, and there were a number of major 
successes across the Company during the 
period, which you will read about throughout 
this report. Our divisions work best when they 
work together: Legal & General Capital (LGC) 
creates real assets to support the 
Legal & General Retirement Institutional (LGRI) 
buy-out deals and fund annuities.

(LGIM) helps clients de-risk in preparation 
for buy-out – the majority of LGRI clients have 
been LGIM clients first. We are also a UK market 
leader in Retail for life insurance, workplace 
pensions and retirement income, and our 
divisions continue to work together to drive 
synergies to help us maintain excellent customer 
service, competitive market positions and 
business growth. Our collegiate and collaborative 
approach is crucial for maximising opportunities.

I would also like to note the opening of Calon, 
our new office in Cardiff. ‘Calon’ translates 
to ‘Heart’ in English and was chosen as the 
preferred name in a vote by our employees. 
The development of Calon and the wider 
investment into the Central Square of Cardiff 
has drawn upon the input of many key 
stakeholder groups. In addition to surveying 
our own people to understand their 
requirements, Legal & General fostered close 
relationships with local partners, suppliers and 
communities throughout the development 
process to ensure that the investment in the 
office benefits the local community as well as 
our employees. The office has been designed 
to operate with a lower carbon footprint than 
a standard office and is a key milestone towards 
Legal & General’s commitment of achieving net 
zero carbon emissions from our occupied 
offices (where we control the management 
of utilities) by 2030. More information about 
Calon can be found on page 77.

Our approach to governance
As a Board, it is our role to promote the highest 
levels of corporate governance and ensure 
these values are embedded within our culture 
and throughout the organisation. As our 
business continues to evolve and as we pursue 
our strategic objectives in an ever-changing 
environment, our strong governance framework 
supports the Board in ensuring that across the 
Group we make decisions in the right way. 
The Board has worked closely with the executive 
team throughout the year as the business has 
continued to navigate the challenges presented 
by volatile market conditions to ensure our 
business can continue to flourish.

Ahead of 2024, a group-wide project was 
initiated which has led to the optimisation 
of our executive decision making across the 
Group through the implementation of a new 
executive governance framework, which took 
effect from 1 January 2024. More information 
on this new enhanced framework can be found 
on page 66.

For the year ended 31 December 2023, we were 
required to measure ourselves against the 
Code. The Board has considered carefully the 
requirements of the Code and I am pleased 
to report that we have complied with all 
provisions of the Code throughout the year. 

Further details on our compliance with the 
Code and how we have applied the various 
principles can be found on page 67.

Stakeholder engagement
As a Board, we are very focused on the impact 
that our business and decisions have on our 
stakeholders, as well as our wider societal 
impact. Our stakeholders are key to our 
decision making and it is hugely informative 
for us to hear the viewpoints from a variety 
of parties with an interest in the Company. 
We were able to conduct a number of 
face-to-face interactions this year, including 
site visits to our offices in Hove and Cardiff. 
I am always impressed during our Board site 
visits how evident our purpose is and how our 
values are demonstrated every day in ensuring 
we are doing the right thing for our customers. 
I would like to thank all of our colleagues for 
their significant contribution to our business. 
Through their roles as Designated Workforce 
Director and Consumer Duty Champion, 
non-executive directors Nilufer von Bismarck 
and Laura Wade-Gery have also conducted 
a number of meetings and site visits. We view 
these visits as an important way to meet with 
our partners and employees and experience 
Legal & General’s culture first hand.

We presented our Climate transition plan at our 
2023 AGM, and I was pleased this was supported 
by 97.7% of our shareholders. The Climate 
transition plan sets out our climate 
commitments and how we plan on achieving 
them. We spoke with a range of our major 
institutional investors about the plan who 
provided useful feedback during its development. 
Our Climate transition plan details how we are 
going to make our ambitions a reality, organised 
under three pillars: invest, influence and 
operate. It is important that we make our plans 
for addressing climate change public and 
ensure that our shareholders are supportive 
of them. More about our progress against 
the Climate transition plan can be found 
on page 43.

Board changes and succession planning
Legal & General continues to benefit from an 
outstanding Board with a diverse range and 
depth of expertise and skills.

The Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee spent a considerable amount 
of time this year focusing on executive 
succession planning, particularly in relation 
to the Group Chief Executive Officer. Each year, 
the Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee also considers the Board’s skills 
and experience to support discussions around 
non-executive succession planning, which 
once again was a focus for the Nominations 
and Corporate Governance Committee in 2023. 
In September 2023, Lesley Knox succeeded 

Philip Broadley as the Board’s Senior Independent 
Director. Philip remains a non-executive 
director of the Company and as a member 
of all five of its Committees. In February 2024, 
Laura Wade-Gery succeeded Lesley Knox 
as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. 
Lesley remains as a member of the 
Remuneration Committee. 

Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The 2024 AGM will be held on Thursday 23 May 
at 11am at the British Medical Association, 
BMA House, Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury, 
London WC1H 9JZ, once again in a hybrid 
format, with additional facilities for shareholders 
to join and vote electronically. Full details of the 
business to be considered at the meeting will 
be included in the Notice of Annual General 
Meeting that will be sent to shareholders 
by their chosen communication means and 
published on our website: group.
legalandgeneral.com/AGM.

Board effectiveness
During 2023, we conducted an external 
effectiveness review of our Board and its 
Committees. Following a tender process, 
Clare Chalmers Limited was appointed as the 
preferred provider to facilitate the review, which 
consisted of one-to-one interviews with Board 
members and observations at a series of Board 
and Committee meetings. The output of this 
review was considered by the Nominations and 
Corporate Governance Committee and the 
Board, and I am pleased to report that the 
conclusion was that the performance of the 
Board and each of its Committees continues 
to be highly-rated. Further details of the process 
and outcome of the external evaluation can be 
found on pages 84 to 85.

Conclusion
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my 
fellow Board members and colleagues at Legal 
& General for their dedication to the business 
and our customers. I have confidence that in 
the coming years Legal & General will continue 
to adapt, and grow, thanks to our greatest 
asset, our people.

Role and leadership 
The Board is responsible for the overall 
leadership of the Group; it is charged with setting 
the Group’s values and standards. The role 
of the Board is to promote the long-term 
sustainable success of the Company, whilst 
simultaneously generating value for 
shareholders and contributing to wider society; 
how the Board achieved this throughout 2023 
is outlined in greater detail in our s.172 statement 
on pages 76 to 78. The Board is committed to 
maintaining the highest standards of corporate 
governance across the Group to support the 
delivery of our strategy, the fostering of positive 
stakeholder relationships and the creation of 
long-term sustainable value for our 
shareholders. 

The specific parameters of the Board’s role 
and responsibilities are set out in the Matters 
Reserved for the Board and are separated into 
eight categories: 

risk and internal control

•  strategy and management
•  structure and capital
•  financial reporting and dividends
• 
•  corporate governance
•  key personnel and remuneration
•  product distribution and pricing
•  brand.

The Matters Reserved for the Board outline the 
decision-making powers reserved for the Board 
and underpins the governance framework 
across the Group. It is reviewed and approved 
as part of an annual corporate governance 
review, and otherwise as required, to ensure the 
role and responsibilities of the Board remain 
appropriate and up to date. 

The Board, as well as the boards of the Group’s 
principal subsidiaries, operate within a clearly 
defined, and fully embedded, delegated 
authority framework. The delegated authority 
framework ensures that there is an appropriate 
level of Board oversight of, and contribution to, 
key decisions and that the day-to-day business 
is managed effectively. It also enables an 
appropriate level of debate, challenge and 
support in the decision-making process.

Those matters which are not reserved for 
the Board’s consideration are delegated 
by the Board to Group-level Committees and 
the Group CEO. The Board has delegated the 
day-to-day management of the Company, and 
the responsibility of the successful execution 
of the strategy, to the Group CEO. Throughout 
2023, the Group CEO, Sir Nigel Wilson, 
delegated further decision making onward 
to the Group Capital Committee, an executive 
decision-making forum, as well as to his direct 
reports. Following the appointment of António 
Simões as Group CEO on 1 January 2024, 
a new governance framework has been 
implemented. Further information on the 
changes is outlined on page 66.
Although the Board delegates the day-to-day 
management of the Company, it is accountable 
for the long-term sustainable success of the 
Company and must continue to oversee the 
Group’s strategic objectives and monitor 
performance against those objectives. 
The Board meets formally on a regular basis 
and at each meeting considers business 
performance, strategic proposals, material 
transactions and critical projects in the context 
of the Group’s strategy, risk appetite, the 
interests of the Group’s stakeholders and our 
wider social purpose. 

The Board is supported in its work by its 
Committees, each of which is governed 
by its own terms of reference, which clearly 
outline its remit and decision-making powers. 
The Committees of the Board, and their core 
responsibilities, are set out in the governance 
framework outlined on page 67, and each 
of the respective Committee reports on pages 
79 to 119.

Composition, independence, and 
effectiveness 
As at the date of this report, the Board 
is comprised of the independent non-executive 
Chair, two executive directors and nine 
independent non-executive directors. At least 
half of the Board, excluding the Chair, are 
independent non-executive directors, in 
accordance with provision 10 of the Code. 
Upon appointment, the Chair was identified 
by the directors as being independent 
in accordance with provisions 9 and 10 
of the Code.

When considering the appointment of new 
directors, the Board is mindful of the 
contribution and skillset that each new 
appointee will bring to the Board; the Board 
has an established skills matrix which supports 
Board succession planning. The Board 
continues to focus on maintaining a well-
balanced and diversified Board, with the right 
mix of individuals who can apply their wider 
business knowledge and experiences to the 
setting and oversight of delivery of the Group’s 
strategy. More information on the Group’s 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy can be found 
on pages 82 and 83.

In January 2023, Sir Nigel Wilson announced 
his intention to retire from his role as Group 
CEO after over a decade in the role. Following 
a rigorous, global, selection process managed 
by the Chair, António Simões was appointed 
as Group CEO with effect from 1 January 2024. 
Prior to joining Legal & General, António was 
CEO of Banco Santander Spain and Regional 
Head of Europe, and previously spent 13 years 
at HSBC in various roles including CEO of UK 
and Europe and CEO of Global Private Banking. 
António strengthens the Board’s experience 
having worked across complex, global 
organisations and brings a formidable 
leadership track record at the most senior level 
of financial services. António will help ensure 
that Legal & General continues to deliver on its 
enormous potential for its shareholders, 
employees, customers and the communities 
of which it is a part, through his executive 
leadership and strategic direction. More 
information on the Group CEO appointment 
process can be found on page 81. 

A board effectiveness review is conducted 
on an annual basis. In line with the 
requirements of the Code, this review was 
externally facilitated in 2023. As part of this 
review, board dynamics and board decision-
making, including non-executive directors’ 
engagement, constructive challenge and 
contribution to board discussions, is assessed. 
Throughout the year, there were no concerns 
as to the operation of the Board or management 
of the Company.

Further information relating to the external 
effectiveness review can be found on pages 
84 to 85.

Conflicts of interest and time commitment 
The identification and management of Board 
members’ conflicts of interest is defined and 
governed by the Company’s Articles of 
Association, law and regulation, best practice 
and a number of internal policies which are 
reviewed and approved by the Board, as part 
of an annual corporate governance review. 
When identifying and managing any potential 
rise in conflict of interest, a record is maintained 
for each Board members’ disclosed directorships 
and appointments. In the instance of an actual 
or potential conflict of interest arising, if the 
Board authorises said conflict, a formal record 
is maintained as part of the Company’s records 
and would be declared at the start of each 
relevant meeting and noted within the minutes 
of the meeting, as stipulated and governed 
by our directors’ conflict of interest policy. 
To ensure accurate records, on an annual basis, 
Board members are required to formally 
approve and sign their conflicts of interest 
register, thereby confirming that all 
directorships and appointments contained 
within are accurate and up to date. 

All non-executive directors’ letters of 
appointment outline the time commitment 
expected of them throughout their tenure 
on the Board. At times, their commitment may 
be required to go beyond that set out in the 
letter of appointment. The time commitment 
is reviewed regularly. External commitments, 
which may have an impact on existing time 
commitments, must be agreed in advance with 
the Chair and approved by the Nominations 
and Corporate Governance Committee, acting 
under its delegation from the Board. As part 
of the external appointments approval process, 
each director’s time commitments are assessed 
in detail. The significant commitments of each 
director are detailed in their biographies 
on pages 64 to 65.

Non-executive directors’ time commitments 
are considered by the Nominations and 
Corporate Governance Committee as part 
of its ongoing assessment of the Board’s 
composition. Upon review, the Committee 
assesses the directors’ commitments to the 
Company alongside their other significant 
commitments to ensure that they continue 
to be able to fulfil their duties to the Company. 
Where the Committee approved new external 
appointments, it was satisfied that they did not 
give rise to a conflict of interest and would not 
impact the directors’ time commitment to the 
Company. In line with our conflicts of interest 
policy, directors absent themselves from any 
discussions relating to their own internal or 
external appointments. 

The Board, on the recommendation of the 
Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee, is satisfied that each non-executive 
director serving at the end of the year remains 
independent, effective and continues to have 

sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities 
to the Company. Upon making new appointments 
to the Board, prospective candidates are 
expected to devote sufficient time to fulfil their 
responsibilities and duties to the Company and 
to do so by acting with integrity, leading by 
example and promoting the desired culture. 

The Chair’s commitments were considered 
on appointment, are regularly reviewed, and 
are assessed robustly whenever he proposes 
to take on an external appointment. In June 
2023, the Chair took up the roles of chair at 
Barclays UK PLC and non-executive director 
at Barclays PLC. The Nominations and 
Corporate Governance Committee, led 
by the SID, carefully considered these external 
appointments and determined that, given the 
length of the Chair’s tenure at the Company 
and significant experience, he was capable 
of balancing the time commitments and any 
potential conflicts, and overall the new roles 
would be additive to the Chair’s experience, 
and accordingly, to the Company. Thus, the 
Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee was comfortable that the Chair 
is able to devote sufficient time to the Company. 

Diversity and inclusion (D&I) 
At Legal & General, we are building an inclusive 
culture that celebrates diversity and creates 
fair opportunities for everyone. Diversity 
is important to the Board, and the Group 
as a whole, because it generates a wider pool 
of talent by reflecting the broadest range of 
human attributes, experience and backgrounds, 
whilst simultaneously supporting good decision 
making and reducing the risk of groupthink.

It is important for our Board to have a broad 
range of insights and perspectives to help 
us make better decisions as a business and 
create an inclusive culture for our people. 
All appointments to the Board are based upon 
an impartial gap analysis of knowledge, skills, 
experience and diversity across the Board 
as a whole. This gap analysis is routinely 
conducted to review the composition of the 
Board and make relevant recommendations 
for any changes; it also takes account 
of succession plans to ensure a sustainable 
pipeline of diverse board talent.

D&I continues to be an area of focus for both 
the Board and the Nominations and Corporate 
Governance Committee. For more information 
on the Board’s commitments to D&I, please visit 
our Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee report on pages 80 to 85.

Our purpose and culture 
The Company’s three core ‘behaviours’ embody 
our values and reflect the belief that it’s not just 
what we do that is important, but how we do it. 
Together we are: purposeful, straightforward 
and collaborative. 

70

Legal & General Group Plc Annual report and accounts 2023

Governance

These behaviours are the foundations of our 
long-term sustainable success and define how 
we do what we do. Throughout 2023, we have 
reshaped the way we assess our performance 
culture and reinforced a balance between 
the ‘what’ in terms of our achievements, and 
the ‘how’ in terms of demonstrating our core 
behaviours whilst achieving our goals. 
This approach not only helps us to further 
enhance our performance culture, but also 
to ensure our core behaviours are embedded 
into the way we do what we do.

The Board regularly receives updates on the 
Voice survey which provides insights into 
employee satisfaction. The surveys include 
questions on purpose, values and culture 
to enable the Board to understand whether 
these areas are aligned to the three key pillars 
used to measure satisfaction; engagement, 
culture and productivity, and enablement. 

As well as reshaping the way we assess 
and measure performance against our core 
behaviours and values, in September we 
sought to achieve further insight into what 
it is like to work as part of the Company, 
by seeking views directly from our employees 
globally. This qualitatively complimented the 
findings from our Voice survey and enabled 
a deeper understanding which was not led 
or constrained by questions in a survey, but 
instead facilitated via a forum for employees 
to communicate their views, in confidence. 

Throughout the year, the Board attended site 
visits across our UK offices, which enabled 
our directors to meet with our employees and 
gain insights into our culture and behaviours 
in action. In addition, Board members meet 
with smaller groups of employees to speak 
directly with them, both with and without 
management present, and hold town hall 
events to answer questions from employees. 
The executive management team also held 
numerous town hall events at various locations 
throughout the year to update the workforce on 
topical issues. Employees are offered the 
chance to ask the management team questions 
throughout these sessions. These events are 
run as hybrid events to maximise engagement.

Subsidiary boards 
At Legal & General we have benefited from 
a strong governance framework operating 
at subsidiary level for many years now. 

Henrietta Baldock and Lesley Knox continue 
in their roles on the board of two of our principal 
operating subsidiaries: Henrietta as Chair of 
Legal and General Assurance Society Limited 
(LGAS) and Lesley as non-executive director 
of Legal & General Investment Management 
(Holdings) Limited (LGIM(H)). George Lewis 
was also appointed as the Chair of Legal and 
General Assurance (Pensions Management) 
Limited in February 2024, having been 
a member of the board since April 2022. 
This crossover of directors on our Group Board, 
principal and other key subsidiary boards 
allows greater interactions, information flows 
and promotes enhanced collaboration.

Induction, training and development 
The Board places great value on training 
and development, and all new non-executive 
directors are invited to participate in a 
comprehensive, formal and tailored induction 
programme upon joining the Board. Induction 
programmes provide new directors with the 
knowledge and understanding of the Company 
and its business to enable them to provide 
effective contribution to Board discussions, 
effectively challenge the executive and properly 
fulfil their statutory duties. 

Following his appointment as Group CEO, 
António received a comprehensive and tailored 
executive director induction to the Board. 
All Board members receive regular training 
throughout the year; the Board believes that 
continual director training and development 
is important to maximise the effectiveness 
of the Board and ensures the Board can 
effectively challenge the executive. The training 
programme is generated on an annual basis, 
based on the needs of the Board, and internal 
and/or external circumstances, including any 

recommendations from the annual evaluation 
of the Board and its Committees. It is the 
responsibility of the Chair to help ensure 
directors continually update their skills, 
knowledge and familiarity with the Group, and 
the Chair does so with input from the Board 
and the Group Company Secretary. In 2023, 
the Board received specific training on various 
topics, including cyber security, biodiversity 
and AI. In addition, Board and Committee 
meetings are regularly used to update the 
Board on developments in the areas in which 
the Group operates, and specific training 
sessions for directors are scheduled for key 
topical issues. As part of their ongoing training 
and development, Board members are invited 
to attend site visits to the Group’s various 
offices, developments and investments, with 
the aim of widening Board members’ knowledge 
of the business, gain first-hand insights and 
to provide Board members with the opportunity 
to meet personally with our employees. 
Throughout the year, site visits were carried out 
at our offices in London, Hove and Cardiff, as 
well as individual director visits to Solihull.

The Board meets 
regularly to oversee the 
delivery of the Group’s 
strategic objectives to 
ensure it continues to 
promote the long-term 
sustainable success 
of the Company.

How the Board spent its time in 2023 
The Board meets regularly to oversee the 
delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives 
to ensure it continues to promote the long-term 
sustainable success of the Company. 
Throughout 2023, the Board held 10 Board 
meetings, including one strategy event, and 
one additional site visit. Board Sub-Committees 
were also constituted on a number of occasions 
in order to deal with particular matters arising 
outside of the formal schedule of meetings: 
a Sub-Committee was constituted during the 
year to oversee and closely manage the Group 
CEO search process. The non-executive 
directors have private meetings without the 
executives present before and after each Board 
meeting, and otherwise as required. 

This is reflected in the Board agendas 
throughout the year, which are set by the 
Chair, with input from the Board, and consist 
of regular reports on the following discussion 
areas:

•  updates from the Group CEO, the Group CFO 
and the Chair of each of the Committees
•  updates from key business divisions on 

business performance and progress against 
strategy, key business initiatives, customer 
and employee engagement, the control 
environment and culture

•  discussions on strategic ambitions, material 
transactions and other material initiatives, 
to ensure alignment with strategic 
objectives

•  updates about meetings held between 
directors and key regulators, such 
as the FCA and PRA
implementation of the Consumer Duty and 
a greater board focus on customer outcomes
risk and compliance matters, including 
regular updates on whistleblowing 

• 

• 

•  audit matters, including IFRS 17 

• 

considerations
legal and governance matters from 
the Group General Counsel and Group 
Company Secretary

•  people, culture, and employee engagement 

matters, including updates from the 
Designated Workforce Director and updates 
on the results of the employee Voice survey 

•  ESG, climate and sustainability 

• 

considerations
the Group’s relationship with various 
stakeholder groups. For more information 
on the Board’s stakeholder engagement 
throughout the year, see pages 76 to 78.

Board members meet informally with the 
executive directors and Group Management 
Committee on a regular basis outside of the 
formal meeting schedule. Members of the 
Group Management Committee and, as 
appropriate, individuals from the relevant 
business areas are also invited to attend Board 
meetings in relation to key items, allowing the 
Board the opportunity to debate and challenge 
initiatives directly with the senior management 
team, along with the executive directors.

The Board informs itself of the views of 
shareholders on a regular basis through 
updates from the Group CEO and Group CFO, 
as well as an update from the Chair following 
his annual schedule of investor meetings. 
Where relevant, Board Committee Chairs also 
hold meetings with investors.

The Board has established the Company’s 
purpose, values and strategy, and has satisfied 
itself that these and its culture are aligned.

I was honoured to 
receive the Instant 
Impact Award at the 
2023 Legal & General 
Awards, and have this 
presented to me by one 
of our non-executive 
directors. It was a 
fantastic opportunity 
for all nominees 
and winners to meet 
and integrate with 
the Board.”

It’s clear that Nilufer

unique partnership with 
Unite. She has had a 
positive impact on 
the business and our 
members, particularly 
around Diversity and 
Inclusion and Wellbeing.”

Pam Edwards 
Head of Unite

Elevating employee views
There is a standing item at each Board meeting 
to discuss my activities as Workforce Director 
since the last meeting and to provide relevant 
feedback. During 2023, I reported against the 
programme and discussed relevant issues 
and any potential responses or changes.

Not all issues required discussion at the Board 
and so I decided in each case whether it was 
more appropriate to raise issues with the 
relevant member of the executive team and 
then report to the Board on any action taken.

The key focus was always to ensure that 
what mattered most to our people was 
communicated and, where appropriate, 
addressed, whilst providing our people with 
transparency of relevant Board activities.

My role
The wellbeing of our employees is a key priority 
for the Board and we recognise that our success 
is driven by our people. As Workforce Director, 
I engage with, and listen to the concerns of, our 
employees. I seek to support our people by 
representing their views to the Board and 
finding ways to address the issues I uncover.

At the end of 2022, with input from both 
employees across divisions and the Board, 
we established my 2023 programme for 
engagement with our people based around 
three pillars:

•  Diversity and Inclusion and Wellbeing
•  Collaboration
•  Growth.

These pillars are relevant to all areas 
of the business and align with the priorities 
established by wider management. Engagement 
with employees during 2023 was structured 
around these pillars and we tracked the impact 
and outcomes of my engagement.

Some of my 2023 activities
My relationships with Unite and the Management 
Consultative Forum (MCF) are key. Through 
these bodies, I can gather the views and 
concerns of a range of employees at a variety 
of grades across the Group. During 2023, I met 
with representatives from both organisations 
every quarter.

For each business division, I received regular 
updates on Diversity and Inclusion, Wellbeing 
and on the Voice survey results and actions 
being taken following such results. This links 
to my 2023 programme pillar of Diversity 
and Inclusion and Wellbeing, but also to 
Collaboration as I have been able to share best 
practices across different parts of the business.

I have participated in various events across 
the business, such as the Women in 
Business & Finance panel, LGC’s ‘Grade 5 
forum’ and the summer internship induction 
programme, all supporting the focus on Growth.

Through meeting people at our business 
locations in Barnsley, Cardiff, Chicago, 
Frederick, Hove, London, Solihull and Stamford, 
I have been able to focus on issues specific 
to business areas and location, building 
on all three pillars of my programme.

Voice
I interrogate the Voice survey data to 
understand how our people feel and this 
is discussed by Board members at the 
Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee, together with any appropriate 
actions to take in response. Employee 
satisfaction is at 79%, and work is underway 
to improve this even further in 2024. 

2024
On behalf of the Board, I will continue to listen 
to our people, provide feedback, and, where 
relevant, implement changes through wider 
management and the Board. 

In 2024, my priorities as Workforce Director 
will again be aligned with the Board and wider 
management’s focus. I will continue to focus 
on Diversity and Inclusion and Wellbeing, and 
Collaboration, whilst Growth will evolve to 
Performance and Capability. I will build my 
interactions with employees around these 
pillars, complemented with analysis and 
understanding of the results of employee surveys. 

We are grateful for the 
regular forum with 
Nilufer to raise issues 
impacting management-
level employees and 
have been able to shape 
approaches to benefits 
and internal policies.”

Section 172 statement and 
stakeholder engagement 

Statement on Section 172 
of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’)
Section 172(1) of the Act requires directors 
to act in the way they consider, in good faith, 
would be most likely to promote the success 
of the Company for the benefit of its members 
as a whole, and in doing so, have regard 
to a non-exhaustive list of factors to ensure 
that the broader implications and interests 
of stakeholders are considered in their 
decision-making. 

The Board recognises the importance of 
nurturing its positive relationships with its key 
stakeholders and is committed to maintaining 
strong engagement with them. The Board 
believes that this engagement provides 

meaningful insights into the views, priorities 
and issues facing its key stakeholders which 
can then be considered as part of the Board’s 
strategic decision-making and planning. 

The Board has reflected on its engagement 
mechanisms throughout 2023 and concluded 
that they remain effective and have provided 
the Board with a comprehensive understanding 
of the interests of its key stakeholders. 

A summary of the Board’s major decisions 
and activities during 2023 can be found below. 
This, combined with our key engagement 
activities on page 78, makes up our section 
172(1) statement. Further information on our 
key stakeholders and their importance is set 
out on pages 14 and 15.

            Key employee engagement 

in the year

Following the announcement of the 
appointment of António Simões as 
Group CEO Designate, effective from 
1 January 2024, a new group-wide 
CEO edition of the employee Voice 
survey was launched in preparation 
for António’s arrival. The survey invited 
employees to share their feedback 
on working at Legal & General which 
was shared directly with António upon 
his appointment. 

Major decisions and activities during 2023

The following examples of major decisions and 
activities during the year illustrate how the Board 
considers different stakeholders’ interests 
in its decision making and how this supports the 
implementation of the Group’s long-term strategy 
and its strategic growth drivers (as set out on pages 
10 and 11).

We believe that major decisions are those that are 
both material to the Group and to its key stakeholders. 
Whilst not all decisions affect every stakeholder 
group, the Board and its delegated decision-making 
forums endeavour to balance the sometimes 
conflicting needs of our stakeholders to ensure 
that all are treated consistently and fairly.

Approval of a £2.7 billion buy-in with 
the British Steel Pension Scheme

The Board approved a final buy-in policy with the 
British Steel Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), 
totalling £2.7bn, under which the remaining 40% 
of liabilities was insured. This was the final 
transaction in a series of four phased buy-ins to 
fully insure the £7.5bn of the Scheme’s liabilities, 
securing the benefits of all circa 67,000 retired 
and deferred members. In doing so, the Scheme 
became the largest pension scheme in the UK 
to have fully insured all its members’ benefits. 

This transaction demonstrates our expertise in 
pensions de-risking and our commitment to 
helping schemes find solutions to secure pension 
commitments against a backdrop of ageing 
demographics.

At the core of these transactions, and to insure 
benefits at this scale, Legal & General 
developed strong relationships with the 
Trustees’ sponsoring company, the Scheme’s 
in-house teams and advisors and brought 
together expertise across Legal & General. 
These transactions signal a successful 
continuation of our long-term, collaborative 
relationship with the Scheme.

Through rigorous board review and decision 
making, and a series of well-timed transactions, 
the Scheme capitalised on volatile markets and 
strong decision making to capture attractive 
pricing and achieve the Trustees’ and Sponsors 
objective of full insurance. 

For more information on the Group’s 
institutional retirement business, please visit 
pages 29 to 31. 

 Customers

Circa 67,000 members will benefit from the security 
that Legal & General provides to their pensions. 
As populations live longer, their pensions last 
longer too. By delivering on a carefully considered 
and well-established plan, we helped the Trustees 
and sponsoring company of the Scheme secure 
the benefits of their members for the long-term 
– far faster than initially anticipated. 

 Regulators

We continue to maintain strong and positive 
regulatory engagement with the Prudential 
Regulation Authority and we provided updates 
on the transaction through our periodic 
pipeline reporting.

 Shareholders

This transaction has helped us to deliver 
another strong result for our pension risk 
transfer business and create long-term value and 
strong returns for our shareholders.

The development and residency 
of our new Cardiff office, Calon

. 
Throughout the year, the Board was updated on 
the £475 million regeneration project in Cardiff’s 
Central Square, which included the development of 
Calon, our new Cardiff headquarters. Our aim was 
to create a workplace with sustainability, wellbeing 
and our purpose of inclusive capitalism at its core. 
By October 2023, all of our Cardiff based colleagues 
had been successfully relocated to Calon, bringing 
our people and our Company into the heart of the 
investments we’re making in the city, and their 
long-term future.

To celebrate the opening of Calon, our Group CEO, 
Group CFO, Group HR Director and Retail CEO 
joined employees and community stakeholders 
for an official ‘opening ceremony’ to celebrate 
our new home for our circa 2,500 people in Wales. 
In November, the Board held its strategy event 
at Calon and combined this with an interactive site 
visit to experience the new office for themselves 
and to meet with colleagues.

As part of this, the Board held an in person 
town hall and invited all colleagues to join. 
Updates were provided on diversity and 
inclusion within the Board, emerging risks 
and opportunities and Consumer Duty. 
Employees were invited to ask a range 
of questions and provide their feedback 
on their new working environment.

Calon has been designed for sustainability, 
wellbeing and inclusivity. The new office has 
been developed using a climate-focused 
approach and represents the delivery of our 
socially responsible investing agenda and 
our continued relationship with all of our 
stakeholders. It is hoped that Calon will drive 
an evolution on how cities are suitably 
designed to be sustainable, long-term.

The development of Calon is the result 
of a £475 million investment by Legal & General 
into the regeneration of Cardiff’s Central 
Square, run in partnership with Cardiff Council, 
the Welsh Government and Rightacres. 
It demonstrates our commitment to investing 
in the real economy and forms part of our wider 
£1 billion investment in Cardiff in recent years.

 Employees

Engaging with our employees throughout the 
planning and development stages of Calon has 
supported our inclusive company culture whilst 
understanding what is important to them 
in a hybrid working environment. Our workforce 
is vital to our success. To help us understand the 
views of our employees, we engaged through 
formal and informal channels; the name of the 
new office ‘Calon’ – Welsh for heart – was chosen 
in a vote by our employees. 

  Communities and 
envi  ronment

Calon meets the highest standards in sustainable 
design. There is no gas in the building, and it can 
generate its own electricity from solar panels 
and air source heat pumps. It has achieved 
a BREEAM Outstanding rating and is also 
targeting Nabers UK 5-star. With over 3,000 living 
plants and natural lighting throughout, it has 
occupants’ wellbeing at its core. 

Suppliers

In line with our commitment to inclusive 
capitalism, we utilised local suppliers and 
products throughout the development process 
where possible, to further improve the social 
impact the building delivers.

The Board oversaw the development of our 
science and technology real estate joint venture 
with Bruntwood SciTech, the leading property and 
innovation services provider in the UK, including 
a new partnership with Greater Manchester 
Pension Fund (GMPF), the UK’s largest local 
government pension fund, securing £500m 
of additional investment.

We’re bringing a fresh injection of capital which 
reinforces our commitment to investing 
purposefully in the real economy. The long-term 
vision for our joint venture with Bruntwood SciTech 
is to provide the infrastructure that businesses and 
the public sector need to thrive and to provide the 
UK’s regional cities with the capacity they need to 
support future growth.

Opportunities exist to export our investment 
expertise internationally to support our global 
ambitions. The success of Bruntwood SciTech 
has paved the way for the expansion of our UK 
business model to the US market with Ancora 
L&G, where we believe there is significant 
potential for further growth.

For more information on the Group’s capital 
investment business, please visit pages 32 to 34.

  Communities and 
environment

We are committed to creating and supporting 
thriving cities and our joint venture with Bruntwood 
SciTech has enabled us to work with cities and 
universities to create modern science 
infrastructure. The growth of the Bruntwood 
SciTech partnership through the introduction 
of GMPF supports the delivery of a significant 
long-term investment project that is economically 
viable and bolsters innovation strategies and 
regeneration of towns and cities in the UK. 

At Bruntwood SciTech’s core is the drive to invest 
in an innovation backbone for the UK. The new 
capital will be used to expand and redevelop 
existing science and technology campuses and 
city centre innovation hubs, delivering additional 
world-leading lab and office space in the UK 
across a secured 3.6m sq ft development pipeline.

The investment supports the drive to regenerate 
towns and cities in the UK, helping to create 
highly skilled jobs, increase productivity and 
drive wage growth, while supporting the UK’s 
target to become a global science and 
technology superpower by 2030.

I am pleased to present my second report 
as the Chair of the Data and Technology 
Committee. During the year, the Committee’s 
remit evolved to include oversight of 
Legal & General’s data strategies. This is an 
important area of focus for Legal & General 
as we recognise the opportunities that can 
be derived from data. This change has enabled 
the Committee to become a more forward-
looking and strategic forum to drive innovation. 

The Committee’s focus during the year has 
been around four key themes: control & risk; 
capability & capacity; strategy & innovation; 
and change delivery. These themes have 
allowed the Committee to explore technology, 
data and cyber in depth and has created an 
environment where these key strands can be 
brought together to support the Board in 
seizing technological and data opportunities 
and overseeing the challenges presented by 
technology and cyber. The Committee is 
supported by an executive level technology and 
security governance framework. This framework 
has provided greater oversight of, and allowed 
the Committee to place greater reliance on, the 
Group’s executive-level governance arrangements. 

During the year, the Committee has focused 
considerably on data as it becomes an 
increasingly important element of our 
business. Data touches every application, 
process and business decision we make. 
We have an ambition to become a more data 
driven and insight led organisation, and to 
do this, we need to ensure data is treated 
as a highly valuable and strategic asset. 
The Committee also spent time focusing 
on how divisions can collaborate to drive 
greater efficiencies and capabilities. In October, 
we concentrated on this from a people and 
capabilities’ perspective. This was a useful 
exercise as it highlighted some shared 
challenges and opportunities across the Group 
and recognised that the different markets 
in which our businesses operate demand 
different skill sets, experiences and capabilities 
to meet their divisional needs. I have been 
pleased to see the formation of a technology 
leadership community across the Group which 
is bringing together these shared challenges 
and opportunities.

As Artificial Intelligence continues to embed 
into society, the Committee will continue 
to discuss and oversee its associated 
opportunities and challenges.

Chair’s introduction
I am pleased to present my report as Chair 
of the Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee. 

One of the Committee’s main areas of focus 
for the year was succession planning, 
particularly the extensive search and full 
and robust selection process to appoint our 
new Group Chief Executive Officer. The Board 
was delighted to appoint António Simões with 
effect from 1 January 2024 and I look forward 
to working with António. In addition, we 
implemented succession planning for the Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee, as well as the 
Senior Independent Director, as part of our 
commitment to, and support of, the FCA’s 
targets on board diversity as set out in the 
Listing Rules. 

The external Board effectiveness review was 
another key area of focus this year for the 
Committee. Further information on the process 
and results can be found on pages 84 and 85

Corporate governance 
The Committee is responsible for overseeing 
and monitoring the Company’s corporate 
governance framework and compliance with 
the Code. The Company has complied with all 
provisions of the Code throughout the year. 
Further details of the Group’s corporate 
governance framework, including compliance 
with the Code, can be found on page 67.

Appointment of our new Group Chief Executive Officer 
Upon recommendation from the Committee, the Board appointed António Simões as our new Group Chief Executive Officer with effect from 
1 January 2024. António’s appointment followed a rigorous, global selection process managed by a Sub-Committee of the Nominations and 
Corporate Governance Committee, led by the Chair. A summary of the process is outlined below.

Talent management  
and succession planning

The Committee annually reviews and assesses the executive talent pipeline to ensure there is a pipeline of credible 
and capable successors for executive management, including for the role of Group CEO.

1.  Constitution of Sub- 

Committee to manage  
and oversee the process

A Sub-Committee of the Committee, led by the Chair, was constituted to provide direction and Board oversight of the Group 
CEO succession planning process. 

2.  Engagement with  
executive search  
firm and creation  
of role specification

The Sub-Committee engaged with independent external search firm Russell Reynolds. Russell Reynolds has no other 
connection with the Company or its directors and is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search 
Firms. Russell Reynolds was chosen for its significant depth in insurance and financial services more generally, a track 
record of focusing on diversity, and a strong leadership team who would challenge the Board on its thinking on candidates.

The Sub-Committee worked with Russell Reynolds to devise a role specification, which was approved by the Board. 

3. Candidate long lists

The search firm produced a diverse long list of candidates which was reviewed, thoroughly discussed and refined 
by the Sub-Committee. The long list included internal candidates and best-in-class external talent. In reviewing the long 
list, the Sub-Committee was mindful of diversity, including of background and experience, as well as the desired skills 
and attributes for the role as set out in the role specification.

4.  Candidate short  

list and interviews

All candidates on the long list were interviewed by the Sub-Committee, following which a short list of final candidates 
was produced. All shortlisted candidates were assessed against the role specification, on merit and with due regard 
to all forms of diversity. The final candidates were interviewed by the full Committee, which included a presentation from 
candidates. In addition, they underwent psychometric testing, and references were taken on the external candidates.

Induction

Following shortlisted candidates’ presentations and interviews, the Board discussed each candidate in detail, 
taking into account all elements of the search process. Following this discussion, it was agreed that António 
was the outstanding candidate. 

The Committee unanimously recommended to the Board the appointment of António Simões as the next Group CEO, 
subject to regulatory approval, and the Board duly approved the appointment. The Remuneration Committee led 
on the development of an appropriate remuneration package. António was interviewed by the PRA and FCA as part 
of the approval process, and approval for his appointment was granted in October 2023.

A comprehensive, tailored induction programme was undertaken by António upon appointment, led by the Chair and the 
Group Company Secretary. This included a focus on the markets and regulatory regions in which the Group operates, as 
well as meetings with all senior management, key external stakeholders, and undertaking site visits to the Group’s offices 
in the UK and globally.

and counsel. Lesley was considered by the 
Committee as the outstanding candidate 
for the role of SID due to her length of tenure, 
strong understanding of, and experience 
in dealing with, the Group and its various 
stakeholders from her roles as Remuneration 
Committee Chair, Designated Workforce 
Director and her role on the board of one 
of our principal subsidiaries. 

Board composition 
The Committee undertakes a rigorous annual 
review of the Board’s composition to support 
discussions on succession planning. This 
includes a capability assessment of Board 
members’ knowledge, skills and experience 
in the context of the Company’s short and 
medium-term strategy, supported by a 
self-assessment analysis undertaken by each 
individual director, which forms part of an overall 
Board skills matrix. The skills matrix reflects 
the results of the assessment. The skills matrix 
is refreshed and reviewed on an annual basis 
and is used by the Committee to support 
discussions on succession. Various other 
considerations, including the tenure of the 
Board as a whole, independence and diversity, 
are also considered by the Committee when 
reviewing the Board’s composition. 
The outcome of the 2023 discussion on 
composition was that, overall, the Board was 
of an appropriate size and composition, with key 
succession plans having been executed over 
the course of the year. The upcoming focus for 
the Committee will be succession planning for 
the Chair and non-executive directors who will 
be coming to the end of their tenure. 

The Committee also considered 
reappointments of directors to the Board, and 
directors’ external appointments to the boards 
of other companies. Where the Committee 
approved new external appointments, it was 
satisfied that the appointments did not give rise 
to a conflict of interest and would not impact 
the directors’ time commitment to the 
Company. In line with our conflicts of interest 
policy, directors absent themselves from any 
discussions relating to their own 
reappointment, chair appointment or other 
internal or external appointments. 

Other board changes 
The Committee considered and approved 
the following board composition changes 
throughout the year.

Being mindful of the time commitment for 
Lesley to take on the role of SID, Laura 
Wade-Gery succeeded Lesley as the Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee in February 
2024. The Committee considered Laura an 
excellent candidate due to her established 
track record as a UK-listed company 
Remuneration Committee Chair and her strong 
understanding of the Committee’s current 
workings and short- and medium-term 
priorities. Laura fulfils the Code requirement 
for any appointee to the Remuneration 
Committee Chair role to have served on 
a Remuneration Committee for at least 
12 months prior to appointment. Having 
discussed Laura’s internal and external time 
commitments, the Committee considered that 
Laura has sufficient time to dedicate to the 
Remuneration Committee Chair role.

Executive succession and talent management 
In addition to reviewing the Board’s 
composition, throughout the year the 
Committee has focused on executive-level 
succession across near- to long-term time 
horizons to ensure there is a credible pipeline 
of successors for executive roles. 

Subsidiary succession 
The Company benefits from a strong 
governance framework operating at subsidiary 
level. The continued strength of the boards of 
the Group’s subsidiaries is vital for ensuring the 
Group’s high standards are maintained and 
there is sufficient oversight of activity further 
down the Group, particularly in our principal 
subsidiaries. While succession planning 
remains the responsibility of each subsidiary 
board, it is nevertheless very important for the 
Committee to have continued oversight of its 
key subsidiaries and ensure orderly succession 
plans are in place. In addition, I meet regularly 
with the non-executive directors of our principal 
subsidiary boards, without the presence of 
executive management, to gain direct 
feedback. 

Following the 2022 and 2023 discussions on 
board composition, Lesley Knox succeeded 
Philip Broadley as SID in September 2023. 
As a result of this change, the Company now 
complies with the FCA’s targets on board 
diversity to have at least one of the following 
senior board positions held by a female: Chair, 
Chief Executive, SID or Chief Financial Officer. 
Philip remains a member of the Board and we 
continue to benefit from Philip’s experience 

Appointments to the Group’s principal 
subsidiaries are made on the recommendation 
of the Committee. This year the board of one of 
the Group’s principal subsidiaries, Legal and 
General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS), 
approved the appointment of Andrew Kail as its 
new CEO, following regulatory approval, on the 
recommendation of the Committee. Andrew 
succeeded Sir Nigel Wilson who held the LGAS 
CEO role (in addition to the Group CEO role) 

82

Governance

until his retirement in December 2023. In making 
its decision, the Committee highlighted 
Andrew’s knowledge and understanding of the 
Group and the LGAS business, having run the 
Group’s PRT business for the last two years 
as well as previously running the Group’s Retail 
Retirement division, meaning that Andrew was 
well-placed to take on the role. 

Diversity and inclusion (D&I) 
D&I across the Group 
As a Group, we are working towards a more 
equitable workplace where all our people can 
realise their potential. We believe that diversity 
of experience and skills brings diversity of 
thought and perspective, which in turn drives 
greater proximity to our customers and 
promotes a culture which more readily 
embraces innovation. 

Last year, we set ourselves deliberately 
challenging ethnicity goals across the Group 
in order to expand the scope of our D&I agenda 
and to complement existing goals for gender. 
These goals are for 17% of our workforce, 
senior management roles and Board members 
to be from minority ethnic backgrounds by 
2027. During 2022, we built these new goals 
into group-wide and divisional D&I plans, 
including key operational areas like recruitment. 
As a Group we have made good progress on 
achieving our ethnicity goals by 2027, and good 
progress on our employees’ voluntary 
disclosure of ethnicity data. However, we are 
aware that faster progression is required to 
achieve our gender diversity goals, particularly 
achieving 40% female leadership at the senior/ 
middle management level, and we continue to 
explore areas of opportunity to achieve this. 

Throughout 2023, the Committee received 
regular updates on the progress against the 
group-wide and divisional D&I plans and the 
following key D&I focus areas: 

•  embedding the progress made in 2022, 

including inclusive recruitment, improving 
line manager capabilities and the creation 
of opportunities for those from 
underrepresented backgrounds

•  evolving the D&I governance and operating 
model across the Group by increasing 
transparency, reducing duplication and 
elevating the voice of our employee 
networks 

•  holding leaders and line managers 
to account on diversity matters. 

The Committee continues to support the work 
of the executive management and the D&I 
Council in driving the D&I agenda across the 
Group. For more information on our group-wide 
D&I activity during 2023, including our progress 
on achieving our objectives, please see page 49 
of this report.

D&I of the Board 
As a Committee, we believe that diversity is 
important as it supports good decision making 
and reduces the risk of groupthink by providing 
different viewpoints, ideas and challenge. 
As part of this, we believe that it is important 
for our Board to be diverse in terms of gender, 
ethnic and social backgrounds and have a broad 
range of perspectives to help us make better 
strategic decisions and lead by example in 
creating an inclusive culture for our people. 

Lesley Knox was appointed as SID in September 
2023. This appointment reflects our commitment 
to gender diversity in senior board positions 
and complies with the FCA’s targets on board 
diversity as set out in Listing Rule 9.8.6(9)(a)(ii), 
that at least one of the following senior board 
positions should be held by a female; Chair, 
Chief Executive, SID or Chief Financial Officer.

We are proud to have a Board which is diverse, 
both in terms of gender and ethnicity. As at 
31 December 2023, the Board comprised 42% 
women, and 25% of the Board was from an 
ethnically diverse background. Both of these 
percentages exceed regulatory requirements, 
the targets in the FTSE Women Leaders Review 
(Hampton-Alexander) and Parker Review, as 
well as the goals we set ourselves in our Board 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy. The Board is also 
compliant with the board diversity requirements 
in the Listing Rules and discloses its compliance 
in the prescribed format below.

When making appointments to the Board, the 
Committee only engages executive search 
firms that are signatories to the Voluntary Code 
of Conduct for Executive Search Firms which 
promotes gender diversity and best practice for 
corporate board searches.

Listing Rule disclosure on diversity 

D&I of senior management 
A diverse senior leadership team is as important 
as a diverse Board, because we believe that 
executive decision-making is more effective if 
it takes into account a wider range of views and 
opinions. Last year we introduced a new goal of 
17% of our senior management roles to be held 
by people from minority ethnicity backgrounds 
by 2027. During 2023, we are pleased that our 
hiring rates for minority ethnicities are trending 
positively, increasing our confidence in our 
ability to achieve our 2027 goals. 

We continue to monitor the progress of our 
gender diversity goals of 40% female leadership 
by 2025 and a 50:50 gender balance across the 
workforce by 2025. We have made good 
progress on the representation of women over 
the last 5 years, particularly in some of our 
most senior roles, however the pace of change 
has been slow. As a result, focus on areas of 
opportunity for this particular segment of 
employees, such as optimising incentives, 
job-sharing and job design, continues. 

Board D&I Policy 
During the year, the Committee reviewed and 
approved the Board Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy, which complements the Group’s wider 
workforce policies and values on D&I. 
The Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets 
out the approach to diversity and inclusion 
of the Board of Legal & General Group Plc, 
and its Committees, in compliance with the 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
(DTR). As a business, we have a clear purpose 
to improve the lives of our customers, build 
a better society for the long term and create 
value for our shareholders. Inclusive capitalism 
lies at the heart of our business strategy and 
is built on the belief of being economically and 
socially useful, embracing diversity and being 
fully inclusive in everything we do. As part of 
the policy, the Board, upon recommendation 
from the Committee, has committed to building 
a diverse and inclusive Board and a more 
diverse and inclusive senior management 
team, as well as driving diversity and inclusion 
across the Group. 

From 1 January 2024, we implemented a new 
executive governance framework. The Group 
Management Committee was formed as a 
formal committee of the Group CEO. As at 
31 December 2023, our Group Executive 
Committee (which existed under our previous 
governance framework) comprised 40% 
women*, with 50% of our businesses led by a 
female CEO. Also at 31 December 2023, 
representation at the middle/ senior 
management level was 37.2% women (2022: 
38%). We are eager to increase the ethnic 
diversity of senior management across the 
Company, which is why we have set ourself the 
goal of 17% by 2027 – we are currently at 17.3% 
for this constituency.

including the gender and ethnic diversity of our 
Board and executive management, can be found

Assessing board and committee effectiveness

Another role of the Committee is to oversee the 
annual Board and Committees’ effectiveness 
review. In line with best practice, a formal and 
rigorous review of the effectiveness of the 
Board and its Committees is conducted each 
year. The Board and its Committees undergo 
a full, independent external evaluation every 
three years, and an externally-facilitated 
internal evaluation on all other years. This year, 
in line with the requirements of the Code, the 
effectiveness review was undertaken by an 
independent, external board effectiveness 
review specialist. 

Following a robust tender process conducted 
by the Chair and Group Company Secretary, 
upon the Committee’s recommendation, the 
Board approved the appointment of Clare 
Chalmers Limited as the independent external 
reviewer to conduct the 2023 evaluation. Clare 
was chosen due to her specialism in financial 
services firms. Clare Chalmers Limited has no 
other connection with the Company or 
individual directors. 

The process, findings and resulting actions 
from the 2023 effectiveness review of the 
Board and its Committees can be found in the 
diagram below across pages 84 and 85. Clare 
had the opportunity to comment on these 
disclosures. 

Chair and individual director 
performance evaluations 
The SID leads the non-executive members 
of the Board in an annual evaluation of the 
performance of the Chair, which includes an 
assessment of the working relationship 
between the Chair and the Group CEO. In 
carrying out the annual evaluation, the SID 
meets with the non-executives without the 
Chair present and takes into account the views 
of the executive directors, as appropriate. 
Following this year’s review, the effectiveness 
of the Chair continued to be highly-rated.

The Chair meets with Board members 
throughout the year to assess their individual 
performance. Following this year’s review, and 
the insights gained from the external facilitator, 
the Chair confirmed that the individual 
directors’ continued to contribute effectively 
to the Board.

Process

Document review and 
meeting observations 
Clare and her associates 
conducted a thorough 
review of previous Board 
and Committee papers, 
minutes and other relevant 
documentation to provide 
context on Board matters 
and the decision-making 
process, to help inform the 
one-to-one interviews. 
Following this review, Clare 
observed a series of Board 
and Committee meetings 
to enable her to form an 
independent view of the 
meeting dynamics.

Scoping
Clare met with the Chair and 
Group Company Secretary to 
agree the scope of the 2023 
effectiveness review. This 
included the objectives of the 
review and the key areas of 
focus. The agreed aim of the 
review was to assess the 
effectiveness of the Board, both 
as a collective unitary Board and 
at Committee level. The review 
focused on, amongst other things: 

•  board composition, 
including diversity

•  succession planning for 
the Board and senior 
management

•  board dynamics, board 

decision-making and how 
effectively members work 
together to achieve objectives
•  strategy, performance and risk
•  purposes, values and culture
•  stakeholder considerations. 

Interviews
Clare held in-depth 
one-to-one interviews with 
Board members covering 
a broad range of topics, 
as agreed with the Chair 
and the Group Company 
Secretary. The topics for 
consideration were shared 
with the Board members 
prior to their individual 
interviews. Clare also 
interviewed certain 
members of senior 
management, including 
the Group Chief Risk 
Officer, Group HR Director, 
Group Chief Auditor and 
Group Company Secretary, 
to bring useful insights 
on the performance of 
the Committees and an 
overall holistic view of 
effectiveness. Discussions 
with all interviewees 
remained confidential. 

4

Report
Clare produced an 
initial, draft report on 
her independent review 
findings, which she 
discussed with the Chair 
and Group Company 
Secretary in the first 
instance. Clare then 
presented a final written 
report to the Committee 
and invited discussion on 
the report’s findings and 
recommendations. 
No views were attributed 
to any individual in the 
final report.

Update on previous board evaluations 
In 2021 and 2022, internal reviews of the performance of the Board and its Committees were undertaken, externally facilitated by Ffion Hague at 
Independent Board Evaluation (IBE). IBE has no other connection with the Company or individual directors. At each board meeting, an update on 
progress against the review recommendations is provided. An overview of the recommendations from the 2022 review and progress against them 
is provided below.

Recommendations from 2022 review

Progress against recommendations

Continuing the practice of ‘top down’ risk 
discussions and ‘lessons learnt’ exercises

Ensuring that strategy papers continued to be 
forward-looking

Continuing to prioritise stakeholder impacts 
and views

‘Lessons learnt’ exercises continued to be requested and presented to the Board and its Committees 
throughout 2023, including lessons learnt in relation to the LDI crisis and data security and privacy. 
The Group Chief Risk Officer now presents an annual update on emerging (‘top down’) risks to the Group 
Risk Committee.

The Board strategy papers continued to be reviewed by the Group Strategy & Investor Relations Director 
and Chair at an early stage to ensure papers were sufficiently ‘forward-looking’. Throughout the year, 
divisional CEOs provided the Board with assessments of macro-economic changes applicable to their 
divisional businesses and the potential strategic and operational impacts.

Following a review by Group Secretariat, new board paper and coversheet templates were rolled out across the 
Group during 2023; these templates now require paper authors to specifically include information on wider 
stakeholder impacts in their papers for the Board’s consideration, including nature and climate. In addition, 
the Board paper pre-review process continues to focus on ensuring that papers consider stakeholder impacts 
and views, where relevant.

Results of effectiveness review

Findings
The tone of Clare’s report was very 
positive overall and indicated that 
the Board, and each of its Committees, 
continued to be effective. The report 
identified a number of key strengths, 
including the experience and skillsets 
of the non-executive directors, the 
level of debate in meetings and the 
strong contributions of all Board 
members, as well as the supportive, 
positive nature of interactions 
between the non-executive directors 
and management, both inside and 
outside of formal meetings. 
The strength of the Company’s 
culture was also noted, built around 
good behaviours, positive and open 
stakeholder relationships and the 
value-adding engagement from 
designated board roles such 
as the Designated Workforce 
Director. 

The appointment process of the 
Group CEO was felt to have been 
well-managed and it was recognised 
that succession planning for the 
longer-serving non-executive 
directors on the Board would 
be a key area of focus for the coming 
year, particularly in terms of ensuring 
that the Board’s composition would 
effectively support the development 
of strategy under the Company’s 
new executive leadership. The report 
commented on the strength of the 
Chair and the Committee Chairs, 
noting their extensive work outside 
of the boardroom, as well as the 
considerable roles performed 
by each of the Committees 
in supporting the Board. Clare 
provided a number of thoughtful 
recommendations in the report 
for the Board’s consideration. 

6

Action plan 
The Board discussed the findings 
of the 2023 effectiveness review 
and subsequently agreed an 
action plan for the coming year. 
The key actions included 
(i) continuing to support the new 
Group CEO as he transitions into 
the role, (ii) continuing to develop 
relationships with, and 
appropriate governance of, the 
Group’s principal subsidiaries, 
and (iii) continuing to oversee 
how the Consumer Duty is 
embedded into the organisation 
and how reporting on consumers 
could be more strategic. 
Progress to implement the 
agreed actions is underway. 
Progress is monitored by the 
Group Company Secretary and 
will continue to be reported 
to the Board at each meeting.

Chair’s introduction
I am pleased to present my report for the year 
ended 31 December 2023. During my first full 
year as the Chair of the Audit Committee, the 
Committee continued to assist the Board in 
fulfilling its core responsibilities, including 
monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
reporting, the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the internal control environment and the 
performance and objectivity of both the internal 
and external audit functions. 

A key area of focus for the Committee in 2023 
was the final phase of implementation of the 
new IFRS accounting standard IFRS 17, 
‘Insurance Contracts’. The Group has applied 
IFRS 17, alongside IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’, 
for the first time from 1 January 2023. These 
standards have brought significant changes 
to the accounting treatment for insurance and 
reinsurance contracts and financial instruments 
respectively and have had a material impact on 
the Group’s financial statements in the period 
of initial application. It was therefore appropriate 
that the Committee spend a significant 
proportion of its time overseeing the final 
elements of implementation.

This included regular updates on the results 
of a series of ‘dry runs’ ahead of initial reporting 
under the new standards and monitoring the 
development and implementation of the 
required changes to systems, processes and 
operating models. In addition, the Committee 
paid close attention to the effectiveness of the 
systems of controls over the new IFRS 17 
reporting systems and also reviewed, 
challenged and approved the material 
accounting judgements, methodologies, policies, 
assumptions and new reporting metrics.

The Committee has also received regular 
updates from KPMG in relation to IFRS 17 and 
commissioned Group Internal Audit to perform 
audits on various aspects of the implementation 
and received regular updates on the outcome 
of these audits. 

IFRS 17 was an unusually complex accounting 
standard to implement. It required fundamental 
changes to accounting records, as well as new 
systems and processes for preparing financial 
statements in accordance with the required 
framework. In common with other insurers, the 
Group began significant implementation work 
in 2017, some years before the final form of the 
standard was known. I would like to express my 
gratitude to everyone that contributed to the 
IFRS 17 programme for their dedication and 
tenacity in ensuring the Group was fully 
prepared for the transition. 

Committee meetings and membership
The Committee met 6 times during the year – 
this represents 1 more meeting than in an 
average year due to additional time spent on 
monitoring and reviewing the implementation

Other key areas of focus for 
the Committee during 2023
In addition to the implementation 
of IFRS 17, the Committee has also 
focused on:

Macroeconomic environment: the 
impacts of economic volatility on 
key accounting and actuarial areas 
of judgement and estimates that 
are sensitive to changing interest 
rates and inflation, as well as 
consideration of geopolitical 
events and their potential impact 
on balance sheet valuations and 
valuation uncertainty.

Internal controls: activities

of IFRS 17. The Committee comprises only 
independent non-executive directors and fulfils 
the experience and expertise criteria required 
by the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
FCA’s disclosure and transparency rules. 
The Board considers that the Committee, 
as a whole, has a balance of skills and 
experience to deliver its responsibilities and 
has competence relevant to the sector and 
broader financial services industry. In addition, 
the Board considers that I, as Chair of the 
Committee, have recent and relevant financial 
experience and am competent in accounting 
and auditing. 

All members of the Committee are also members 
of the Risk Committee, which ensures that there 
is appropriate identification and management 
of any issues that are relevant to both 
committees. The full biographies of all 
Committee members can be found on pages 
64 and 65. Between meetings, I meet regularly 
with senior management across the Group’s 
Finance, Tax and Internal Audit functions, as 
well as with the lead external audit partner. 

Review of financial disclosures 
The Committee reviewed the half year and 
annual financial statements, which focused 
on the integrity and clarity of disclosure, 
application of accounting policies and 
judgements and compliance with legal and 
financial reporting standards. With the 
implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, and their 
impact across multiple reporting periods, 
including the transition as at 1 January 2022 
and a restatement of the Group’s 2022 half year 
and annual results, additional meetings were 
scheduled in advance of the Group’s half year 
2023 results to ensure that the Committee had 
sufficient opportunity to understand, review 
and challenge those first financial statements 
and disclosures under the new standards. 
As part of its review, the Committee received 
regular updates from management and the 
external auditor and was able to place reliance 
on the updates provided throughout the year on 
internal controls in relation to financial reporting. 

During the second half of 2023, the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) undertook a thematic 
review of ‘IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ Interim 
Disclosures in the First Year of Application’. 
The Group received the outcome of this review 
in respect of the Group’s half year report 
to 30 June 2023. This review was conducted 
in accordance with the FRC’s usual procedures, 
and accordingly was based solely on that half 
year report without detailed knowledge of our 
business or an understanding of the underlying 
transactions entered into. The review does not 
provide assurance that the half year report was 
correct in all material respects. The Committee 
was pleased to note both that, based on the 
review, there were no further questions or 
queries that the FRC wished to raise, but also 

that the FRC’s report on their thematic review, 
published in November 2023, included a 
number of disclosures contained in the Group’s 
half year report as examples of better practice.

As part of its review of financial disclosures, 
the Committee also considered whether the 
annual report was fair, balanced and 
understandable (FBU) and whether it provided 
the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy, as well as the 
risks facing the business including in relation 
to increasingly important ESG and climate 
considerations. The Committee reviewed the 
FBU assessment taking into consideration the 
impact of market volatility and the changing 
interest rate and inflationary environment and 
giving due attention to the use of APMs in 
increasing the level of information available 
to investors on the Company’s underlying 
performance and the effects of one-off 
financial events. In conjunction with verification 
processes, management assurance and a 
report from the external auditor, the Committee 
recommended to the Board that the annual 
report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable.

The Audit Committee, together with the Risk 
Committee, reviewed the key assumptions and 
methodologies of the risk-based capital model, 
Solvency II disclosures and disclosures made 
in relation to internal control and risk 
management, as well as the principal risks and 
uncertainties the Group faces. The Committee 
can confirm that the key judgements and 
significant issues considered in relation to the 
2023 financial statements are consistent with 
the disclosures of key estimation uncertainties 
and critical judgements as detailed in Note 1 
on page 151. The statement is underpinned 
by the Committee’s belief that all important 
information has been disclosed and that the 
descriptions and reviews of the Group’s business 
and performance as set out in the Strategic 
report are consistent with the financial 
reporting in the Group’s financial statements. 

Climate and other non-financial reporting 
While the FRC chose not to include any 
revisions to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code in respect of wider responsibilities 
and considerations for boards and audit 
committees in relation to ESG objectives and 
other sustainability matters, following its 
consultation in 2023, the Committee provides 
close oversight over the Group’s climate and 
other non-financial reporting, in light of 
ever-increasing stakeholder expectations. 
During the year, the Committee has received 
updates on the European Union’s Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive and the 
release of the inaugural standards from the 
International Sustainability Standards Board.

In addition, the Committee has focused on 
improvements that can be made to the Group’s 
climate-related disclosures in the financial 
statements and ensuring that there is a 
coherent link between those disclosures and 
the narrative in the front half of the Annual 
report and accounts. The Committee also has 
responsibility for reviewing and approving the 
Group’s Climate and nature report and Social 
impact report and, to that end, has sought to 
understand the verification and assurance 
framework that is in place to ensure that 
disclosures were in line with relevant 
requirements, and were materially accurate, 
consistent, fair and balanced. The Committee 
remained supportive of the proposal to 
commission limited third-party assurance over 
specific climate and pay gap-related metrics.

Internal control 
The Committee has the primary responsibility 
for the oversight of the Group’s system of 
internal controls including controls over 
financial reporting and the work of the Internal 
Audit function. The Committee, in collaboration 
with the Risk Committee, seeks to ensure that 
the Group operates within a framework of 
prudent and effective controls that allow risks 
to be identified, assessed and managed. 

Policies and manuals in relation to International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
Solvency II reporting requirements and a 
Financial Control Framework (FCF) are in place 
across the Group. FCF is a first line framework 
that supports the Committee in enabling it to 
understand and assess the design and 
effectiveness of controls over financial 
reporting, covering IFRS, APMs, Solvency II 
and, going forward, climate and other 
non-financial reporting. FCF is a risk-based 
approach with management identification, 
documentation, testing, remediation (as 
required), reporting and certification over key 
financial reporting-related controls. 

The Committee has completed its review and 
approval of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control policies and procedures, 
during the year and up to the date of this report, 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
guidance on risk management, internal control 
and related financial and business reporting 
published by the FRC. During this review, the 
Committee did not identify any weaknesses 
which were determined to be significant 
to the preparation of the financial statements. 
Where areas for improvement were identified, 
processes are in place to ensure that the 
necessary actions are taken, and progress 
is monitored by the Committee. 

UK audit and corporate governance reform 
2023 has seen a significant scaling back of 
proposals relating to audit and corporate 
governance reform in the UK, with: primary 
legislation required for, amongst other things, 
the establishment of the Audit, Reporting and 
Governance Authority (ARGA) now likely delayed 
until post the general election; the late withdrawal 
of proposed secondary legislation on the Audit 
and Assurance Policy, Resilience Statement, 
fraud reporting and reporting on distributable 
reserves; and finally the removal of a number 
of proposed changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code following the FRC’s 
consultation in 2023. As a Group, Legal & General 
remains supportive of proposals that make the 
UK an attractive market for shareholders, 
investors and broader stakeholders through 
high quality and transparent audit and corporate 
governance activities. The Committee has 
been actively engaged throughout the year 
in overseeing the Group’s readiness for the 
proposed reforms and, while it was disappointing 
to see such late changes, it will continue to 
keep a close focus on the changes to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code that remain, 
notably in relation to the declaration on the 
effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control framework.

Audit quality 
It remains an important aspect of the 
Committee’s work to keep under review the 
independence and effectiveness of the internal 
and external audit process. 

Internal audit 
The Group Chief Internal Auditor presents a 
report at each Committee meeting, to update 
the Committee on the results of audits since 
the previous meeting. The report includes: 
details of any significant control weaknesses 
and positive assurance provided; themes 
arising from audits and management’s 
progress in addressing actions related to audit 
findings; and Group Internal Audit’s (GIA) 
evaluation of the overall control environment 
for each of the Group’s divisions. Key areas of 
GIA’s work reported to the Committee during 
the year included: financial reporting processes 
and controls related to IFRS 17; IT and data 
security; data privacy risk management; IT and 
operational resilience; Solvency II compliance; 
financial risk governance including credit, 
market and liquidity risk; financial crime risk 
management; third-party oversight including 
material outsourcing; readiness for the FCA’s 
Consumer Duty regulation; climate change 
reporting; and major IT change programmes. 
GIA continues to evaluate the risk and control 
culture across the Group and includes specific 
reporting to the Committee on the results of 
this work. The Committee approved GIA’s 
risk-based audit plan for the year and 
monitored the delivery of the plan throughout 
the year as well as the associated key 
performance metrics.

During 2022, Deloitte were engaged to perform 
an external quality assessment of GIA, which 
assessed the function’s effectiveness including 
its independence and positioning within the 
organisation. Deloitte presented its report to 
the Committee in May 2023. The function was 
assessed as a mature internal audit function, 
generally conforming with International Internal 
Audit Standards and applicable professional 
codes for effective internal audit in financial 
services. The Deloitte report noted the 
function’s clear purpose and support from 
management; appropriate safeguards related 
to independence and objectivity; mature 
working practices; a high quality experienced 
team, and a strong focus on data analytics and 
continuous improvement. 

The Committee continued to meet with the 
Group Chief Internal Auditor in private 
throughout the year. In accordance with the 
Institute of Internal Auditors’ Financial Services 
Code of Practice, the Committee conducted its 
annual review of the independence and 
objectivity of the Group Chief Internal Auditor 
and concluded that independence and 
objectivity had been maintained throughout the 
year. The Committee undertook its annual review 
of, and approved, the GIA Charter and undertook 
a regular review of key performance indicators, 
including: audit plan delivery progress; resourcing 
and skill levels; and progress in completing 
actions to implement the recommendations 
from Deloitte’s 2022 External Quality 
Assessment, which were incorporated into 
GIA’s continuous improvement plan.

Based on regular internal audit reporting, 
private sessions with the Group Chief Internal 
Auditor, and taking into consideration the 
externally facilitated evaluation noted above, 
the Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness 
of the GIA function and the appropriateness 
of its resources. 

External audit 
The Committee has the primary responsibility 
for overseeing the relationship with, and 
performance of, the external auditor. This 
includes making recommendations for their 
appointment, reappointment, removal and 
approval of remuneration. The Committee 
reviews and approves the terms of engagement 
of the external auditor and monitors its 
compliance with the independence criteria 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code. 

The Committee meets regularly and privately 
with the external auditor. These meetings allow 
for regular and open dialogue of any issues 
relevant to the Committee’s work. Audit 
Committee members also meet regularly with 
management outside of formal Committee 
meetings to discuss the relationship with the 
external auditor and the efficiency of the audit 
process. Throughout the year, the Committee 
has received updates on the quality of the

external audit process and has continued to 
work with, and challenge, management and 
KPMG on efficiency gains and ensuring that 
audit fees are fair and proportionate to the 
audit work required for the Group. In addition, 
the Committee has overseen the succession 
of the KPMG lead audit partner in 2023. 

Non-audit services
In order to safeguard the auditor’s independence 
and objectivity, the Group has in place a policy 
setting out the circumstances in which the 
external auditor may be engaged to provide 
services other than those covered by the audit. 
The policy applies to all Legal & General 
subsidiaries and other material entities over 
which the Group has significant influence. 
The core principle of the policy is that non-audit 
services (other than those legally required 
to be carried out by the Group’s auditor) should 
be performed by the auditor only in certain 
controlled circumstances. The policy sets out 
those types of services that are permitted 
(permitted services) and those types of services 
which are not permitted. The policy pre-approves 
a number of the permitted services, provided 
the fee is below a certain threshold; all other 
permitted services must be specifically approved 
in advance by the Committee. 

The policy is reviewed on an annual basis 
to ensure that it is fit for purpose and that 
it reflects applicable rules and guidelines. 
The policy is aligned with the FRC’s requirements 
and includes the requirement to consider the 
self-review test under the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) Code 
of Ethics, applicable for periods beginning on or 
after 15 December 2022, before a proposed 
engagement is assigned. It is also aligned with 
KPMG’s own internal policy on non-audit 
services for FTSE 350 companies, which broadly 
restricts non-audit work to services that are 
‘closely related’ to the audit. Any changes to the 
policy are required to be approved by the 
Committee. This is in accordance with laws 
applicable in the UK and FRC guidance, pursuant 
to which audit committees of Public Interest 
Entities are required to approve non-audit 
services provided by their auditors to such 
entities; and subsidiary Public Interest Entities 
in the UK – such as Legal and General 
Assurance Society Limited (LGAS) – can rely 
on the approval of non-audit services by the 
ultimate parent’s Board Audit Committee.

Appointment 
The Company confirms that it has complied 
with requirements governing the appointment 
of an external auditor, notably the requirements 
of the Competition & Markets Authority contained 
in the Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Uses of Competitive Tender Process and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, 
including requirements for mandatory audit 
firm rotation. 

Following a competitive tender carried out 
in 2016, KPMG was appointed as the Group’s 
external auditor with effect from the financial 
year ended 31 December 2018. In May 2023, 
KPMG was reappointed as the Group’s external 
auditor for the financial year ended 
31 December 2023, which is their sixth year 
as the Group’s external auditor. In accordance 
with the ICAEW’s requirements, Salim Tharani 
stood down as KPMG’s lead audit partner 
during 2023, and was replaced by Phil Smart, 
who had previously shadowed Mr Tharani 
during the 2022 audit.

The Committee considers the quality and 
effectiveness of the external audit and 
recommends to the Board, on an annual basis, 
whether to recommend the reappointment 
of the external auditor for shareholder approval. 
On the basis that KPMG continue to maintain 
their independence and objectivity, and the 
Committee continues to remain satisfied with 
their performance, there are no plans as at the 
date of this report to conduct a tender exercise 
for external audit services before the end 
of the current required period of 10 years. 
The Committee believes it would not be 
appropriate to tender before the end of this 
period as it recognises that, while it is 
important to ensure the audit firm remains 
objective and does not become overly familiar 
with management, there is an important 
balance to be struck with the investment of 
time required both from management and any 
completely new audit team for them to gain 
sufficient understanding of a large and 
complex organisation, such as Legal & General, 
to ensure a top-quality audit. 

Audit fees
The Committee assesses the external auditor’s 
fee structure, resources and terms of 
engagement annually. Total fees paid to the 
auditor for the year were £23.1 million (2022: 
£17.5 million), of which £1.9 million (2022: 
£1.7 million), was spent on non-audit and other 
assurance services. £1.6 million (2022: 
£1.6 million) was spent on audit-related 
services required by legislation, which is 
excluded from any calculation of the ratio of 
non-audit to audit fees in accordance with the 
UK FRC Revised Ethical Standard for Auditors 
(2019). Further details can be found in Note 29 
to the consolidated financial statements. The 
non-audit fee represents 10% of the total audit 
fee for 2023. 

Included within KPMG’s fees for 2023 are 
additional audit fees related to the 
implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, and 
specifically work to support KPMG’s audit 
opinion in respect of the transitional impact to 
the Group’s balance sheet and equity position 
as at 1 January 2023. The Committee is 
satisfied that this level of fee is appropriate in 
respect of the audit services required for the 

Group and that an effective audit can be 
conducted for this fee. The Committee 
continues to work with KPMG to ensure costs 
remain appropriate and proportionate to the 
services provided.

Assessment of independence 
and effectiveness 
The Committee is responsible for assessing 
the effectiveness, objectivity and independence 
of the external auditor. This assessment is 
on-going throughout the year and concludes 
with a formal, internal, effectiveness review, 
which was conducted in December 2023. 
As part of the on-going assessment, the 
Committee assesses the external auditor 
against a number of criteria, including but not 
limited to: provision of timely and accurate 
industry-specific and technical knowledge, 
maintaining a professional and open dialogue 
with the Audit Committee Chair and members 
at all times, delivery of an efficient and effective 
audit, the ability to meet objectives within the 
agreed time frames and the quality of judgements 
and audit findings, management’s response 
and stakeholder feedback. In addition, the 
Committee holds private meetings with the 
external auditor to discuss the audit process 
and relationship with management. 

Overall, the assessment of KPMG was positive, 
with a small number of areas noted for 
consideration in future audit cycles. Taking into 
account the result of all of the above, the 
Committee concluded that KPMG maintained 
its independence and objectivity and that the 
audit process was effective. Upon the 
Committee’s recommendation, the Board has 
recommended that KPMG be reappointed as 
the Company’s auditor, by shareholders, at the 
2024 AGM.

Key accounting and reporting judgements
Throughout the year, the Committee was briefed at each meeting on the Group’s key accounting and reporting judgements by management and 
KPMG. The Committee’s response to each issue can be found below and the Committee is satisfied that the financial statements appropriately 
address the key accounting judgements and estimates in respect of both the amounts reported and disclosures made.

Issue

Committee’s response

Valuation of insurance contract liabilities – 
retirement:

The insurance liabilities for retirement products are 
significant in size and their estimation is inherently 
judgemental.

Valuation of complex investments:

Mark to model investments can involve significant 
judgement and can produce valuation challenges 
for investments in new classes. 

Mark to model valuations inherently include 
assumptions that lead to the existence of a range 
of plausible valuations for financial instruments 
(known as valuation uncertainty). Certain assets are 
subject to a higher degree of valuation uncertainty, 
particularly where valuations are modelled using no 
market inputs or the valuations are affected by other 
factors such as the illiquidity of the asset. 

The Committee evaluated the significant judgements that have an impact on the valuation of insurance 
liabilities for retirement products. This included considering: 

Longevity assumptions – which estimate how long policyholders receiving annuity payments will live. 
The challenge around the setting of longevity assumptions was a particularly significant area for review 
as the judgements made could be expected to have a material impact on the Group’s results. The Committee 
considered the effectiveness of the controls over the accuracy and completeness of the data used in 
determining the longevity assumption and the validity of independent industry data supporting those 
assumptions. The Committee also reviewed available data illustrating recent trends in mortality experience 
in the UK population and the mortality experience on different blocks of our business, taking account of the 
uncertainty in more recent data as a result of Covid-19.

Valuation interest rates – which are used to discount the liabilities. These are sensitive to judgements made, 
for example, on credit default of the backing assets, as well as the investment data used to calculate the 
internal rate of return. The Committee focused on management’s proposed changes to reserving assumptions, 
other modelling changes, and the determination of the credit default assumption. This included analysis 
of internal historical data and external market experience.

Directly attributable expense assumptions – which determine the specific future expenses that are 
incorporated in the calculation of the IFRS insurance liabilities. The Committee considered the allocation 
between servicing new and existing business and the consistency of approach applied.

The Committee concluded that the retirement insurance contract liabilities are appropriate for including 
in the financial statements, reflecting the asset risks and the available data on policyholder longevity.

The Group balance sheet carries exposure to complex investments (typically classified as Level 3 in the fair 
value hierarchy), in line with the Group’s strategy and risk appetite. The valuation of these investments, 
including property assets, lifetime mortgages and private credit, requires the use of complex models and 
management judgement. The Committee seeks to ensure that the valuation process for these investments 
is robust. 

These harder to value assets remain a key area of focus, partially heightened in 2023 as a result of 
macro-economic volatility and geo-political events. The valuation of a number of asset classes is sensitive 
to higher interest rates and inflation, and these have therefore been areas of enhanced challenge and review 
by the Committee.

The Committee has continued to review the processes and controls over investment valuations, and 
in particular the valuation uncertainty policies and governance which include management’s assessment 
of valuation uncertainty by asset type. While we do not currently see any material impact on the valuation 
of our asset portfolio arising from climate change, there is an increased consideration of climate and other ESG 
factors in both internal and third-party valuations. We expect this to be an increasing area of judgement (and 
therefore disclosure) in future years, and it will form a key area of focus in the Committee’s review of this area. 

The Committee concluded that there are appropriate controls surrounding the valuation of complex assets 
and that they are valued appropriately for inclusion in the financial statements.

Valuation of insurance liabilities – protection:

The insurance liabilities for protection contracts are 
an important driver of the profitability for this line of 
business and require judgements to be made 
regarding the assumed rates of mortality and 
persistency. The Company makes extensive use of 
reinsurance to reduce mortality risk.

The Committee has reviewed the methodology for calculating reserves including the allowance made for 
payments to and from reinsurance counterparties. The assumptions for the rate of future mortality and 
morbidity (how many customers will die or become ill during the policy term) and persistency (how many 
customers will discontinue cover) are based on the Company’s internal experience and use judgement about 
how experience may vary in the future. During 2023, the Committee has spent time reviewing the findings and 
judgements in respect of the continuing elevated levels of mortality experience in the UK and the US, reflecting 
indirect impacts of Covid-19 related illness, and potentially reflecting the deferral of diagnostics and medical 
treatments for other conditions. 

The Committee reviewed the judgements underlying the directly attributable expenses included in the 
insurance liabilities and considered the effectiveness of controls in place over valuation models. 

The Committee concluded that the insurance liabilities of the Group’s insurance businesses are appropriate 
for inclusion in the financial statements.

Committee’s response

Alternative performance measures (APMs):

As part of its consideration of whether the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable, the Committee 
has paid particular attention to the use of APMs in reporting the Group’s performance. 

APMs offer investors and stakeholders additional 
information on the Company’s performance and the 
financial effect of ‘one-off’ events, and the Group 
uses a range of these metrics to enhance 
understanding of the Group’s performance.

IFRS 17:

IFRS 17 is a new accounting standard for insurance 
contracts which took effect from 1 January 2023. 
IFRS 17 has had a significant impact on the 
reporting of the Group’s financial performance.

The Committee has reviewed the changes to the definition of adjusted operating profit to reflect the adoption 
of IFRS 17 and its application. Specifically the Committee has considered the inclusion of certain items either 
as part of adjusted operating profit or investment variances, to ensure that they are aligned to both the 
Group’s disclosed policies on these APMs and the underlying principles of fair and consistent reporting. 
Where appropriate the Committee has reviewed additional disclosures provided to enhance transparency 
in respect of the Group’s APMs. 

The Committee concluded that the use and disclosure of APMs, including the clarity of labelling the 
prominence of APMs versus statutory measures, are appropriate for inclusion in the annual report. 

As well as continuing to monitor the preparedness of the Group to implement IFRS 17, the Committee 
has reviewed a number of papers during both 2022 and 2023, covering various areas of policy, methodology 
and assumptions. 

In particular, the Committee reviewed the methodology and assumptions to support the transition to IFRS 17, 
and has reviewed and approved both the impact of that transition on the Group’s balance sheet and equity 
position as at 1 January 2022 and the results of the comparative period ended 31 December 2022. This 
included a particular focus on the assumptions and judgements that have underpinned the calculation of the 
contractual service margin (CSM) at transition, most notably CSM for business transitioned using the fair 
value methodology, and the determination of the compensation required for bearing the uncertainty about 
the amount and timing of the cash flows arising from non-financial risk as insurance contracts are fulfilled. 

The Committee concluded that the disclosures in respect of IFRS 17 (and IFRS 9) included in Note 1 Basis 
of Preparation and the comparative period results are appropriate for inclusion in the annual report.

The role of the Committee
The Committee assists the Board 
in its oversight of risk by assessing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management framework, risk strategy, 
risk appetite and tolerance for the 
categories of enterprise, emerging and 
principal risks to which the Group may 
be exposed and providing advice on what 
constitutes acceptable risk taking.

Key responsibilities 
•  Review the Group’s risk profile and 
appetite for risk and assess the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management framework. 

•  Oversee and advise the Board on the 
current risk exposures of the Group 
and oversee the management by the 
executive of those categories of risk.
•  Oversee and advise the Board on the 

governance, operation and performance 
of the Group’s internal model. 
•  Review, approve and oversee the 

performance of the Group’s own risk 
and solvency assessment (ORSA) 
which is designed to measure, 
aggregate and monitor risks in 
accordance with strategy, policy 
and principles.

•  Support the Remuneration Committee 
on specific risk adjustments to be 
applied to performance objectives

Legal & General Group Plc Annual report and accounts 2023

Governance

The Risk Committee assists 
the Board with strategic advice 
in relation to current and potential 
future risk exposures. The risk 
management framework supports 
informed risk taking and sets out 
those risks within appetite. 
The Committee conducts 
a thorough review of the risk 
management framework 
on an annual basis to ensure 
it remains fit for purpose.”

I am pleased to present my report as your Chair 
of the Risk Committee. I joined the Committee 
upon appointment to the Board in 2018 and 
assumed the role of Chair in 2022. Since 
becoming Chair of the Committee, I have 
further developed my knowledge and 
understanding of the risk environment in which 
the Company operates and sought to ensure 
that the Committee continues to operate 
effectively. Throughout 2023, I have continued 
to engage with my fellow Committee members 
to understand their views, in particular, on any 
risk areas which they feel require further 
oversight and challenge. This has been 
supported by my active and regular 
engagement with key colleagues in the 
business, with particular emphasis on the 
support received from the Group Chief Risk 
Officer and his team. 

Oversight of risk management
In a challenging macroeconomic and 
geopolitical environment, the Committee has 
continued to oversee, robustly challenge and 
provide advice to the Board, on the Group’s 
current and future risk exposures and profile. 
During the year, geopolitical risks have continued 
to heighten with ongoing conflict and rising 
political tensions. Macroeconomic risks have 
also increased as many major economies 
faced slowing growth against a backdrop 
of high inflation, energy market shocks and 
rising interest rates, abating somewhat in the 
latter part of 2023. The Committee has continued 
to monitor the ongoing global economic 
uncertainties and, with the prospect of several 
important elections in the coming year, this will 
continue to remain an important focus for the 
Committee in 2024. Despite these challenging 
market conditions, the Company has remained 
resilient to a number of risk events and has 
largely continued to operate within risk appetite. 
The Committee, in conjunction with the Audit 
Committee, keeps under review the effectiveness 
of the Company’s risk management and internal 
control systems, which monitors and reviews 
all material controls including financial,

operational and compliance controls. In addition, 
we closely monitor risk appetite and tolerance 
levels and challenge management to ensure 
these are regularly stress tested to ensure they 
are able to withstand wider macroeconomic 
risk events.

2023 activity
Given the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic 
and geopolitical environment, the Committee 
has spent a significant amount of time during 
the year hearing directly from the business, 
alongside risk and compliance colleagues, 
about how they are managing the associated 
risks and what mitigating actions are being 
taken. In addition, the Committee receives an 
update from the Group Chief Risk Officer at each 
meeting which covers an in-depth overview of 
the risk profile, outlook and landscape. During 
the year, the Committee paid close attention 
to the Group’s capital and liquidity position, 
in light of the macroeconomic and geopolitical 
landscape, and received in depth updates on 
credit, insurance, longevity and market risk. 
A particular area of focus for the Committee 
during the year centred around property risk. 
The UK commercial property markets continued 
to reflect the broader uncertainty in the 
economic outlook and the Committee paid 
close attention to the Company’s exposure 
to commercial property, particularly the office 
sector, and the management action being 
taken to mitigate the risks. 

In addition to the geopolitical and 
macroeconomic climate, the Committee has 
continued to focus on the management of the 
Group’s non-financial risks. The Committee 
received regular updates, and challenged the 
progress made by management, on operational 
resilience, embedding the Consumer Duty 
regulations, change management, governance 
controls around technology and data risk and 
operational risks such as those related to 
conduct risk and ensuring appropriate 
mitigations are in place to prevent the 
facilitation of financial crime.

Alongside the Group Chief Risk Officer’s report, 
the Committee is provided with management 
information on risk appetite, comparing actual 
positions relative to the Group’s risk appetite 
statement and quantitative analysis of the 
Group’s exposures to financial and operational 
risks, including risk-based capital requirements 
in relation to the core risks implicit in the 
Group’s businesses. The Committee also 
receives an assessment of the overall profile 
of conduct risks for the Group; analysis and 
trends in complaints data and a suite of 
customer service metrics designed to enable 
the Committee to assess the management 
of the customer journey.

Risk appetite review
In July 2023, the Committee considered the 
risk profile of the Group’s strategic plan and 
its alignment with the Group’s risk appetite. 
The Committee undertook a detailed review 
of the operation of the Group’s strategic risk 
appetite and the key metrics and tolerances 
used to determine acceptable risk taking. 
As part of the review, refinements were 
recommended to the metrics to ensure 
a more reliable and accurate measure of the 
Group’s performance against risk appetite. 
The Committee also conducted an annual 
review of emerging risks and continues to 
encourage management to be alert to areas 
of emerging risk, particularly in light of the 
rapidly evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical 
climate to ensure that the Company remains 
well diversified and robustly protected against 
market shocks.

Risk-based capital model
The Group’s risk-based capital model (internal 
model) is used to determine the capital 
requirements for the Group and forms the 
calculation engine for the Solvency II internal 
model. During the year, the Committee 
reviewed and approved the internal model 
development plan and validation report. 
As part of this review the Committee takes 
into consideration: 

•  key assumptions, methodologies and areas 
of expert judgement used within the model
•  activities undertaken to validate the outputs 

of the model

•  development of the model to ensure that 

it reflects the business lines and risk profile 
of the Group

•  processes to ensure that changes applied 
in the model are undertaken in a controlled 
manner, and in line with model development 
plans.

In addition, the Committee also reviewed and 
approved the 2023 recovery and resolution 
plans as well as ORSA policy and scenarios, 
which are an ongoing assessment of the risks 
to which the Group is exposed and an 
assessment of the capital resources available 
to ensure that the Group is able to sustain its 
business over the plan horizon. 

Climate risk
It is widely recognised that actions taken today 
can influence the likelihood of different climate 
outcomes, and impact on future risk exposures. 
This, alongside climate scenario analysis, 
informs our risk management framework. 
During the year, the Committee considered the 
Group’s climate risk management approach 
and reviewed and approved the 2022 Climate 
report, prepared in line with recommendations 
by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures. In addition, the Committee 
reviewed and approved the Group’s climate 
goals and commitments, including our stated 

journey to net zero, as well as the Company’s 
Climate transition plan, which was presented 
for a shareholder advisory vote at the Annual 
General Meeting in 2023. 

Working collaboratively
The Committee continued to work closely 
throughout the year with the Audit Committee 
on risk and control matters as well as the 
Remuneration Committee so that risk 
management and risk culture are properly 
considered in setting the Remuneration Policy 
and determining remuneration outcomes. 
In addition, the Committee also works closely 
with the Data and Technology Committee 
to consider technology risk. An important 
element of this will be the emerging risk and 
opportunities that Artificial Intelligence presents. 
The Committee also reviewed and approved 
the Group Technology Risk Policy and Technology 
Risk Appetite statements during the year. 

Legal & General has a strong subsidiary 
governance framework in place to support the 
Board in discharging its responsibilities for the 
Group. Directors of the Group’s principal 
subsidiaries (LGAS and LGIM(H)) are members 
of the Risk Committee; this brings valuable 
insight, oversight and challenge to the 
Committee’s discussions on specific aspects 
of the Group’s operations. An overview of the 
Company’s risk appetite and risk management 
approach, as well as our principal and emerging 
risks, can be found on pages 56 to 59.

2024 priorities
The Committee has an important role in 
supporting the Board in the oversight and 
management of the risk framework. During 
2024, the Committee will continue to focus on: 

• 

impacts and associated risks arising from 
the macroeconomic and geopolitical 
environment, regulatory landscape including 
the UK Solvency reforms, and global climate 
change, with a focus on consideration 
of emerging risks

•  management of capital and liquidity risks 
•  oversight of the current and emerging 

• 

non-financial and conduct risk exposures 
of the Group, including operational 
resilience, change management and the 
embedding of the Consumer Duty regulation 
review the output of the Bank of England’s 
system-wide exploratory scenario exercise, 
investigating the behaviours of banks and 
non-bank financial institutions following 
a severe but plausible stress to financial 
markets.

Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the Remuneration 
Committee’s report for 2023. With effect from 
26 February 2024, I have stepped down from 
my role as Chair of the Committee, and have 
been succeeded by fellow non-executive 
director, Laura Wade-Gery. The Board considered 
Laura an excellent successor due to her 
established track record as a UK-listed company 
Remuneration Committee Chair and her strong 
understanding of the Committee’s current 
workings and priorities. Laura fulfills the 
Code requirement for any appointee to the 
Remuneration Committee Chair role to have 
served on a Remuneration Committee 
for 12 months prior to appointment. I have 
maintained my membership of the Committee.

Within this report, we have presented the 
considerations and decisions for the Committee 
throughout 2023.

Link between pay and performance
In 2023, we delivered a further set of good results, 
with adjusted operating profit of £1.7 billion 
and profit for the year of £443 million. Earnings 
per share (EPS) was 7.35 pence compared 
to 12.84 pence in 2022. 

Annual Variable Pay (AVP)
For executive directors, 70% of the bonus 
opportunity is determined by the Group’s 
financial performance, measured against 
pre-determined targets.

Strategic objectives determine the other 30% 
of bonus opportunity, including strategy,

The Committee has 
continued to be mindful 
of both the immediate 
and long-term financial 
wellbeing of the wider 
workforce, particularly 
in these economically 
uncertain and challenging 
times. We made a one off 
payment of £750 in July 
2023 and approved an 
increase in the employer 
contribution to pension 
of 1% of base pay effective 
from 1 April 2024, with

subject to regulatory approval. Regulatory 
approval for the appointment was confirmed 
in October 2023 and António joined the Board 
as Group CEO on 1 January 2024.

Sir Nigel’s departure was confirmed by the 
Company once regulatory approval for António’s 
appointment had been received and he will 
remain employed for his 12 month notice 
period in order to ensure a smooth transition. 
Consistent with his service contract and the 
executive remuneration policy, Sir Nigel will 
continue to receive his current base pay and 
benefits until his employment ends. Sir Nigel 
will not receive an AVP award for performance 
in 2024 nor will he receive a PSP award in 2024.

Consistent with the remuneration policy and 
the rules of the SBP and PSP, Sir Nigel will 
be a good leaver and as such his outstanding 
share awards will be treated in line with the 
good leaver provisions in the respective plan 
rules. His deferred AVP awards for 2021, 2022 
and 2023 will vest three years from the date 
of grant. His outstanding PSP awards will 
be pro-rated with reference to the proportion 
of the performance period that has elapsed upon 
leaving and will then vest based on performance 
to the end of the performance period and will 
be released, subject to performance, on the 
fifth anniversary of the date of grant.

Sir Nigel will retain a shareholding in 
Legal & General Group of at least 325% 
of base pay for two years post his departure 
from the Board in line with the Director’s 
remuneration policy.

António Simões
Context
As reported previously, following a rigorous, 
global, selection process managed by 
Sir John Kingman, António Simões was 
appointed as CEO in June 2023, and took 
up his post formally on 1 January 2024.

When determining an appropriate remuneration 
package, the Committee considered our current 
remuneration practices and shareholder 
approved remuneration policy, relevant market 
practice and António’s remuneration levels 
at his previous employer. As part of the 
Remuneration Policy renewal last year, 
we made a number of changes to assist 
the Committee in a recruitment scenario. 

This policy was supported by more than 
95% of shareholders and this additional 
flexibility was critical in allowing us to secure 
António’s appointment.

customer and culture, and risk as well as 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
metrics, as described in more detail on page 
106. These act as a moderator to the overall 
AVP outcome.

As in previous years, the Committee chose 
to exclude the beneficial impact of mortality 
assumption changes from the financial results 
when determining bonus awards, resulting 
in bonus outcomes of 52.7% to 53.8% of 
maximum for the executive directors. Targets 
and outcomes are summarised in the ‘Quick 
read’ section on page 99 and in further detail on 
page 105.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The long-term incentive (PSP) awards granted 
in 2021 were subject to EPS growth and Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) growth over the 
three-year period ended 31 December 2023.

EPS growth is determined based on measuring 
the change in EPS over the three-year 
performance period. However, the introduction 
of IFRS 17 from 1 January 2023 prevents EPS 
from being measured on the same basis from 
the start of the period (on an IFRS 4 basis) 
to the end of the performance period (on an 
IFRS 17 basis). In order to fairly measure the 
EPS growth performance, the Committee has 
considered the annual change in each of the 
three years, as the EPS for 2022 has been 
reported on both an IFRS 4 and IFRS 17 basis. 
On this basis, EPS grew by 52.3% over the 
period (15.1% per annum). Further details 
on this are provided on page 107 of the report.

TSR grew by 23.1%, out-performing the median 
of the FTSE 100, but below the median for the 
bespoke comparator group.

This resulted in 61.1% of the 2021 PSP award 
vesting. In accordance with the remuneration 
policy, the Committee assessed the formulaic 
outcome, considering overall performance, risk 
management progress against ESG 
commitments, and other capital and solvency 
measures, and determined that the outcome 
was appropriate in all the circumstances, and 
no downward adjustment was required. Under 
the terms of the PSP plan for executive directors, 
the vested shares will be deferred for a further 
two years and released in 2026. The PSP 
performance targets and outcomes are 
summarised in the ‘Quick read’ section 
on page 99.

Board changes
Sir Nigel Wilson
In January 2023, we announced Sir Nigel Wilson’s 
intention to retire as CEO of Legal & General 
Group. Sir Nigel agreed to continue in the role 
until a successor was appointed and to support 
a smooth transition following their appointment. 
In June 2023, we announced that António 
Simões would be appointed as the new CEO, 

Directors’ report on remuneration

Legal & General Group Plc Annual report and accounts 2023

Directors’ report on remuneration 
continued

The total remuneration package provided to 
António at his previous employer was 
significantly higher than both the previous 
package provided to Nigel Wilson and the 
package António is now receiving at 
Legal & General.

Ongoing remuneration policy
When determining the final remuneration 
package for António, the Committee adopted 
a number of principles. Firstly, in 
acknowledgment of the fact that António’s 
pay would be higher than Nigel’s, we sought 
to deliver the majority of the increase through 
variable pay rather than fixed pay. This ensured 
that a material portion of pay was linked to 
performance, and therefore would only be 
realised if stretching performance targets were 
met. Doing so also means we could moderate 
the level of fixed pay required to secure 
António’s appointment, where we know 
absolute levels of fixed pay are a focus area 
of investors.

The second key principle the Committee 
adopted was to ensure that the remuneration 
package we offered was broadly in line with 
other FTSE 100 companies. This ensured that 
we operated within market norms and 
shareholders’ expectations. With this in mind 
António’s remuneration package consists of:

•  a base salary of £1,175k. This is between 

the median and upper quartile of FTSE 100 
financial services companies

•  pension of 10% of salary, in line with the 

current rate offered to the wider workforce
•  benefits in line with our remuneration policy, 
including relocation support to assist with 
António’s move from Spain, which will be 
provided for 12 months

•  a maximum bonus of 200% of salary and 

maximum PSP of 300% of salary. These are 
the maximum levels of remuneration we can 
offer under our remuneration policy and are 
also broadly in line with the median 
opportunities offered by other FTSE 100 
financial services companies.

This resulted in a total remuneration package 
positioned between the median and upper 
quartile of other FTSE 100 financial services 
companies, which is appropriate in the context 
of Legal & General’s size and complexity.

Replacement award
As is common practice in financial services, 
and particularly in banking, António had 
numerous unvested awards which he would 
forfeit as a result of joining Legal & General. 
In line with our remuneration policy, the 
Committee has agreed to buy out these awards 
with equivalent Legal & General awards, 

ensuring António is immediately aligned 
to the Legal & General share price and 
shareholder interests.

All awards will be bought out on a ‘like for like 
basis’, meaning that:

•  deferred cash and share awards will be 
bought out in cash/shares respectively
•  all replacement awards will have identical 

vesting/deferral periods to the original awards

•  for all awards with performance conditions 

we calculated how performance was 
tracking against targets in order to 
determine a fair value for each award.

The total value of these buyout awards is 
significant, however the Committee is 
comfortable that these represent the genuine 
levels of awards being foregone and that the 
awards were critical to securing António’s 
appointment. The majority of these awards 
will be granted in shares with a grant date 
of 20 March 2024, creating immediate 
alignment to Legal & General’s performance 
and share price. Additionally, all awards will 
be subject to relevant deferral, malus and 
clawback provisions. In line with our 
remuneration policy all awards will be subject 
to forfeiture and clawback if António leaves 
the Company voluntarily within three years.

Implementation of Remuneration 
Policy for 2024 
Base pay
Having reviewed pay and conditions across the 
Group, and considered the broader market and 
overall business performance, the Committee 
have determined to increase base pay for Jeff 
Davies by 4.3% with effect from 1 March 2024. 
For 2024, the average base pay increase for UK 
employees is expected to be around 4.3% but 
with higher increases for lower paid employees. 
The first review of base pay for António Simões 
will be in 2025 and so his base pay will remain 
unchanged during 2024.

Annual Bonus
The proportion of the annual bonus measures 
assessed against financial metrics will remain 
70%, with 30% assessed against non-financial 
objectives. Financial metrics will cover a range 
of KPIs assessing profitability and growth, 
aligned to António’s strategic review.

PSP
In order to place further emphasis on the 
important influence the Company has on 
climate, the Committee have determined 
to include a strategic measure with a 20% 
weighting based on progress against our 
published climate commitments. The remaining 
80% will be split equally between EPS growth 
and relative TSR performance. Further details, 
including the quantitative climate targets, are 
shown on page 108.

Governance

Consideration of the wider workforce
The Committee has regard for the remuneration 
of all employees across the Group. The policies 
and practices applying to executive directors 
are the same as for the wider workforce 
in most instances, although quantum and 
participation by location and grade may vary.

The Committee has continued to be mindful 
of both the immediate and longer term financial 
wellbeing of the wider workforce, particularly 
in these economically uncertain and challenging 
times. We made a one off payment of £750 in 
July 2023 to lower paid employees to mitigate 
inflation pressures, in addition to the £1,500 
payment made in 2022. The Committee also 
reviewed pension provisions for UK employees 
below senior management and approved 
an increase to the employer contribution 
to pension of 1% of base pay effective from 
1 April 2024 with a view to aligning employer 
pension contributions with those for senior 
management over the next 5 years.

In addition, Legal & General continues to 
provide further financial support to all UK 
employees including SmartSaving (the 
employee discount scheme) and preferential 
borrow/save/advance finance facilities through 
our partner organisation, Salary Finance.

For 2024 a stratified approach to base pay 
increases has been adopted with higher 
percentage increases applied to employees 
in lower paid roles, reflecting their 
proportionally greater exposure to price 
inflation, with those in more junior roles 
receiving a base pay increase of 5%.

Most employees are eligible to be considered 
for a bonus payment based on group, divisional, 
individual and/or other specific performance 
metrics, with bonuses for performance during 
2023 paid shortly after the year end, at the 
same time as bonuses for executive directors.

The Committee continues to maintain 
an oversight of progress on continuing 
work on diversity and inclusion and achieving 
a further narrowing of the gender pay gap. 
Further details on this can be found on page 49 
and in our Social impact report. I hope that you 
will find this report a clear account of the 
Committee’s considerations and decisions, 
and the remuneration outcomes for the year.

Operation
Conditional award of shares, subject to a performance period 
of no less than three years and a holding period such that no 
awards are released before five years from grant. Performance 
targets are set annually by the Committee, aligned with the delivery 
of shareholder returns over the longer term. The Committee may 
amend the vesting downwards (but not increase the level of 
vesting) depending on the overall performance of the Group. 
PSP awards are subject to malus and clawback.

Opportunity
The maximum award opportunity is 300% of base pay. 15% 
of the award vests for threshold performance, increasing to 100% 
of the award vesting for achievement of maximum performance.

Performance
An appropriate mix (normally an equal weighting) of earnings 
performance and shareholder return.

Alignment with strategy and 2023 performance outcomes

The performance measures for the incentive plans are directly aligned to the Group’s key performance indicators (KPIs). The Group Board reviews 
the KPIs annually and adds to or changes them where appropriate. KPIs are explained in more detail on pages 24 and 25 and further details 
of performance measures and outcomes are provided on pages 105 to 108.

Summary of remuneration policy

The directors’ remuneration policy was approved by shareholders by way of a binding vote at the 
2023 AGM on 18 May 2023 and applies for three years from the 2023 AGM. The policy table below 
summarises key aspects of the approved policy. The full remuneration policy can be found in the 
2022 annual report, and on the Company’s website.

Base pay

Pension contributions

Benefits

Annual Variable Pay (AVP)

Fixed pay

Purpose 
and link 
to strategy

Provides a fixed level 
of earnings, appropriate 
to the market and 
requirements of the role.

Provides a basis for 
savings to provide an 
income in retirement.

Provides benefits and allowances 
appropriate to the market, and 
to assist employees in efficiently 
carrying out their duties.

Operation

Reviewed annually with 
effect from 1 March, taking 
into account:
•  the individual’s skills, 

In line with other 
employees in the UK, 
executive directors may:
•  participate in a DC 

pension plan
•  receive a cash 

allowance in lieu

•  receive some 

combination thereof.

Non-UK national executives 
may be permitted to 
participate in home-
country pension plans 
where relevant.

Base pay is the only 
element of pensionable 
remuneration.

Pension contributions 
for executive directors 
are aligned to that available 
to the majority of the UK 
workforce (currently 
up to 10% of base pay).

In line with other employees in the 
UK, benefits currently include:
•  private medical insurance
•  life insurance
•  income protection
•  all-employee (ShareSave 

and Share Purchase) plans.

Executive directors may participate 
in voluntary benefits and choose 
to acquire Legal & General products 
which they fund themselves, 
sometimes through salary sacrifice.

In line with other senior managers 
in the UK, executive directors 
receive a non-pensionable cash 
allowance in lieu of a company car.

Where an executive director is 
required to relocate, or perform duties 
outside their home country, additional 
benefits may be provided, (including 
healthcare and assistance for housing, 
school fees, home travel, relocation 
costs and tax compliance advice) 
for a period not exceeding two years.

The maximum amount paid in 
respect of benefits will be the actual 
cost of providing those benefits 
which, particularly in the case 
of insured benefits, may vary from 
year to year, although the Committee 
is mindful of achieving the best 
value from benefit providers.

The maximum opportunity 
for participation in the all-employee 
share plans is the same for all 
employees and takes into account 
prevailing HMRC rules.

There are no performance 
conditions.

There are no performance

•  scope of the role
•  external market data, 

including other FTSE 100 
companies and other 
financial and non-
financial institutions
•  pay and conditions 

elsewhere in the Group

•  overall business 
performance.

There is no obligation 
to increase base pay upon 
any such review, and any 
decision to increase base 
pay will take into account 
the associated impact 
on overall quantum. 

There is no set maximum 
base pay, but any increases 
will normally be in line with 
the range of increases 
for other UK employees. 
In specific circumstances, 
the Committee may award 
increases above this level, 
for example where:
•  base pay for a recently 
appointed executive 
director has been set 
with a view to allowing 
progression in the role 
over time

•  there has been a 

significant increase in 
the size or scope of an 
executive director’s role 
or responsibilities
•  there is a significant 

change in the regulatory 
environment.

Personal performance will 
be taken into consideration 
in determining any base 
pay increase.

Legal & General Group Plc Annual report and accounts 2023

Governance

Incentivises and rewards the achievement of annual 
financial performance and delivery of strategic priorities.

50% of any AVP award is deferred into shares, 
reinforcing retention and alignment with shareholders 
by encouraging long-term focus and risk alignment.

In normal circumstances:
•  performance is assessed over a one-year period
•  performance measures and weightings are set 

annually to ensure they are appropriately stretching, 
and aligned with the Group’s strategic priorities
•  performance targets take into account internal 
forecasts, market expectations and prior year 
performance. Target normally equates to the 
forecast in the strategic plan, with maximum set 
at an appropriate stretch above plan, but still within 
the Company’s risk appetite

•  AVP awards are determined after the year end, 
taking into consideration performance against 
targets, individual performance, and overall 
business performance

•  50% of any AVP award is paid in cash, after the year 
end, with 50% deferred into restricted shares (or 
nil-cost options, or phantom equivalent, or other 
forms dependent upon business or regulatory 
requirements) for a further three years

•  dividends or dividend equivalents may accrue 

during the deferral period and vest and are paid 
in shares upon vesting

•  malus and clawback apply to both cash awards 

and deferred awards.

The maximum opportunity in respect of any financial 
year is:
•  up to 200% of base pay for the Chief Executive 
Officer and any executive director appointed 
after the approval by shareholders of the 
remuneration policy

•  150% of base pay for the current Chief 

Financial Officer.

No bonus is payable for threshold performance 
or below, with up to 50% of maximum for target 
performance.

•  The Committee will consider the calculated 
outcome in the context of a range of factors 
(not just the specific performance measures) 
including risk management, behaviours, culture, 
capital generation, Solvency II coverage ratio 
and sustainable financial performance, and may 
apply a ‘moderator’ to reduce (but not increase) 
an AVP award if there are factors that warrant 
such a reduction.

A combination of:
•  financial performance (primary measure with 

at least 70% weighting) – to ensure growth and 
return to shareholders

•  strategic and personal performance – to safeguard 
the future, with the development of future income 
streams, and focus on key metrics including 
customers, culture and ESG.

Provides a direct and transparent link between executive pay 
and the delivery of shareholder returns over the longer term.

Compensates non-executive directors for their 
responsibilities and time commitment.

Purpose 
and link to 
strategy

Operation

A conditional award of shares (or nil-cost options, or phantom 
equivalent, or other forms dependent upon business or regulatory 
requirements). In normal circumstances: 
•  subject to a performance period of no less than three years 

and a further holding period of no less than two years following 
the end of the performance period

•  performance measures and targets are set annually by the 
Committee to ensure they are relevant and appropriately 
stretching, and aligned with the delivery of shareholder returns 
over the longer term

•  performance targets take into account internal forecasts, any 
guidance provided to the market, market expectations, prior 
performance, and the company’s risk appetite

•  dividends or dividend equivalents may accrue during the 

performance period based on the number of shares that vest 
but not those that have lapsed

•  malus and clawback apply.

Exceptionally, the Committee may adjust and amend the PSP 
awards in accordance with the rules, including:
•  lengthening the performance period and/ or the holding period 

for future awards

•  reducing (but not increasing) the level of vesting dependent upon 

the performance of the Group.

Opportunity 
or 
requirement

The maximum opportunity for an executive director in respect 
of any financial year is 300% of base pay.
•  15% of the award vests for threshold performance
•  100% of the award vests for achievement of maximum.

The Committee assesses the formulaic vesting outcome, and may 
amend the vesting downwards (but not increase the level of vesting) 
considering a range of factors including overall performance, 
risk management, capital generation, Solvency II coverage ratio, 
and ESG.

Provides alignment with 
shareholder returns and ensures 
the impact on directors’ 
shareholdings moves in line with 
Legal & General’s share price.

Executive directors are expected 
to retain any after-tax vested 
share awards until their 
shareholding requirements 
are met, and maintain that 
shareholding requirement 
(or their actual shareholding 
at the date of leaving, if lower) 
for at least two years after 
leaving employment with 
the Group.

The Committee retains the 
discretion to withhold future 
PSP grants if executive directors 
are not making sufficient 
progress towards their 
shareholding requirement.

Non-executive directors may 
elect to receive a proportion 
of their fees (normally 50%) 
in Legal & General shares until 
their shareholding requirement 
is met.

The sale of shares prior to the 
shareholding requirements 
being met may be permitted 
in extenuating situations, for 
example, a change to personal 
circumstances, ill health, etc.

Shares owned outright 
equivalent to:
•  325% of base pay for 
executive directors
•  100% of base fee for 

non-executive directors.

Fees for the Chair and non-executive directors 
are set at an appropriate level to reflect:
•  time commitment required to fulfil the role
•  responsibilities and duties of the positions
•  typical competitor practice in the FTSE 100 
and other financial services institutions.

Fees comprise a base fee for membership 
of the Board, plus (where applicable) additional 
fees for:
•  Senior Independent Director (SID)
•  Committee Chairship
•  Committee membership (not including 

the Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee)

•  Designated Workforce Director.

Additional fees for membership of Committee, 
or Chairship or membership of subsidiary 
Boards, or other fixed fees may apply if justified 
by time or commitment.

The Chair receives an inclusive fee for the role. 
The Chair’s fee is reviewed annually by the 
Committee, and the non-executive directors’ 
fees are reviewed by the executive directors. 
There is no obligation to increase fees upon 
any such review.

Fees are subject to the aggregate limit 
in the Company’s Articles of Association 
or any subsequent shareholder resolution. 
Any changes in this limit would be subject 
to shareholder approval.

The Chair and non-executive directors are not 
eligible to participate in any benefit, pension 
or incentive plan. However, additional benefits 
may be provided if the Board feels this is justified, 
such as tax compliance advice, work permits 
or similar. Expenses incurred in carrying out 
duties (and any associated tax liability) may 
be reimbursed or paid directly by the Company.

Performance

An appropriate mix (normally an equal weighting) of:
•  earnings performance – to incentivise growth in earnings
•  shareholder return – to deliver a competitive return for 

shareholders; and

•  strategic performance including ESG – to incentivise the delivery 

of broader aspects of the Company’s strategy.

The maximum weighting for any strategic measures will be 20%.

No performance conditions.

Recruitment Remuneration

Component

Overall approach

Policy and operation

The Committee will pay no more than it considers necessary to attract appropriate candidates, and it is not contemplated 
that remuneration will need to be different from the structure or exceed the limits set out in the remuneration policy table.

Maximum variable remuneration

The maximum variable remuneration will be in line with that set out in the remuneration policy table, that is 500% of base pay, 
excluding any compensation for awards forfeited on appointment.

Compensation for forfeited awards

As a result of regulations around the globe in the financial services sector, executives are likely to have accrued deferred 
remuneration which may be lost upon a change of employment. Accordingly, to aid the recruitment of a new executive 
director, the Committee may grant deferred cash and share awards to compensate for awards forfeited upon leaving 
a previous employer, taking into consideration relevant factors including:
•  the form of the award
•  any performance conditions
•  the vesting profile and likelihood of vesting
•  relevant regulatory requirements and guidance.

Any awards will reflect the terms and the value of the arrangements forgone, and any such compensation will be subject 
to forfeiture and clawback if the executive leaves the Company voluntarily within a fixed time period determined by the 
Committee, being not less than three years. Where possible the Committee will use existing share-based plans. 
However, in the event these are not appropriate, the Committee retains the discretion to use the Listing Rules exemption 
(LR 9.4.2) for the purpose of making an award to compensate for amounts forfeited upon leaving a previous employer.

For internal appointments, the Committee may continue to honour prior commitments made before joining the Board.

Relocation 

Where a new executive director has to relocate to take up the appointment, either within the UK or from overseas, practical 
and/ or financial support may be provided in relation to relocation or mobility including the cost of any tax incurred for 
a period not exceeding two years.

For appointments from overseas, certain home country benefits may continue to apply. Relocation and mobility support 
may also apply to the recruitment of a non-executive director.

The Committee will normally align the remuneration arrangements for new non-executive directors with those outlined within the policy table.

Termination and payments for loss of office

Component

Fixed pay

Annual Variable Pay (AVP)

Performance Share Plan (PSP)

Other payments

Policy and operation

Any termination payments in lieu of notice would consist solely of base pay and the cost of providing benefits for the 
outstanding notice period. Any statutory requirements will be observed. Our standard practice is to include within executive 
directors’ contractual terms mitigation provisions as regards to payments in lieu of notice.

Eligibility for annual variable pay, deferred annual variable pay awards and performance share awards are governed by their 
respective plan rules, as summarised below:
•  annual variable pay (AVP) – there is no automatic entitlement to an annual bonus in the year of cessation of employment. 
However, for a ‘good leaver’, the Committee may determine that an executive director will receive a bonus pro-rated for the 
period through to leaving based on targets and performance for the full year, and an assessment of overall business and 
personal performance

•  deferred AVP awards – in the event that a participant is a ‘good leaver’ any outstanding unvested deferred awards will 

normally be released in accordance with the ordinary timescale. Exceptionally, the Committee reserves the right 
to accelerate any vesting or payment, for example in the case of terminal illness.

Performance share plan (PSP) – unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that a participant is a ‘good leaver’ 
any unvested PSP awards will be pro-rated for the period through to leaving and vest based on targets and performance to the 
end of the performance period, with awards released at the normal times. Exceptionally, the Committee reserves the right 
to accelerate vesting or payment due, for example, in the case of terminal illness.

The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in connection with a director’s cessation of office/ 
employment where the payments are made in good faith in the discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of 
damages for breach of such obligation) or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of the 
director’s office/ employment, or for any fees for outplacement assistance and/ or director’s legal and/ or professional advice 
fees in connection with his/ her cessation of office/ employment.

‘Good leaver’ circumstances are leaving due to death, disability, ill-health or injury, redundancy, retirement with company agreement, the individual’s 
employing company/ business ceasing to be part of the Group, or other circumstances at the Committee’s discretion. For all other leavers, unvested 
awards lapse.

Awards will generally vest early upon a takeover of the Company, merger or other corporate reorganisation. Alternatively participants may be allowed 
or required to exchange their awards for new awards. If there is a demerger, delisting or special dividend or other transaction which may affect the 
share price, the Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a takeover.

António Simões Remuneration Disclosure

António Simões was formally appointed as Group CEO from 1 January 2024, following the announcement of his appointment in June 2023. As set 
out in the Chair’s letter on page 62, when determining an appropriate remuneration package the Committee considered our current remuneration 
practices and shareholder approved Remuneration Policy, relevant market practice and António’s remuneration levels at his previous employer.

Ongoing remuneration package
On appointment, the key elements of António’s remuneration package will consist of:

•  a base pay of £1,175k, which is between the median and upper quartile of FTSE 100 financial services companies
•  pension of 10% of salary, in line with the rate offered to the wider workforce during 2023
•  benefits in line with our remuneration policy, including relocation support to assist with António’s move from Spain. Relocation support is provided 

for 12 months only

•  a maximum AVP of 200% of base pay
•  a maximum PSP of 300% of base pay.

These are the maximum AVP and PSP levels of remuneration we can offer under our remuneration policy and are also broadly the median 
opportunities of other FTSE 100 financial services companies.

Replacement award
As is common practice in Financial Services, and in particular in banking, António had numerous unvested awards which he forfeited as a result 
of joining Legal & General. Our policy on recruitment remuneration provides, that in these circumstance, the Committee may grant awards 
equivalent to the remuneration arrangements forfeited upon leaving the previous employer, taking into consideration relevant factors including 
but not limited to, the form of the award, any performance conditions attached to those awards, the vesting profile and likelihood of vesting and 
any relevant regulatory requirements and guidance in relation to awards. 

All awards will be replaced on a ‘like for like basis’, meaning that:

•  deferred cash and share awards have been bought out in cash/ shares respectively
•  all buyout awards will have identical vesting/ deferral periods to the original awards
•  for all awards with performance conditions we have calculated how performance was tracking against targets in order to determine a fair value 

for each award.

Accordingly, in accordance with our policy on recruitment remuneration, the following cash and share awards will be granted to António, subject 
to malus and clawback, matching as close as possible both the expected value and timescale to vesting of his forfeited Santander awards.

In recognition of the forfeit of annual bonus for 2023 from António’s previous employer, a payment of £3,079,242 will be awarded of which 50% 
will be paid in cash at the end of March 2024 and 50% will be granted as shares in April 2024, vesting 3 years from the date of grant.

In addition, in recognition of the forfeit of other unvested awards the following cash and share awards will be made:

1.  Reporting of the 2020 PSP in the 2022 annual report

The vesting date of the 2020 PSP award occurred after the 2022 results announcement. As a result, the PSP figures recognised in the 2022 annual report were based on a three-month 
average share price to 31 December 2022. The 2020 PSP figures reported in the 2022 single figure table above now reflect the share price at vesting on 10 March 2023, at 252p per 
share. The figures in the 2022 report were £1,353,539 (Sir Nigel Wilson) and £815,301 (Jeff Davies).

Strategic objectives comprise a qualitative assessment by the Remuneration Committee of operational performance and risk management, 
customer and culture metrics, and other strategic objectives set by the Committee, including ESG objectives. A qualitative assessment, rather 
than an outcome based only on pre-determined numerical targets, is considered more appropriate for the assessment of strategic objectives, 
as this enables the Committee to consider performance in the context of a range of factors and changing situations during the year.

continued

Key focus areas are identified at the beginning of each year, and strategic objectives may be set individually for each executive director or assessed as their 
individual contribution to joint objectives. Normally, 10% of the total bonus opportunity is allocated to each category encompassing:

•  Strategy: focus on safeguarding the future of the company and developing future income streams.
•  Culture & Customer: based on a range of metrics which reflect the impact of culture on employees and customers, including customer performance scores 

and feedback, employee engagement scores, and progress against gender and other diversity goals.

•  Risk: supported by analysis from the Chief Risk Officer, using quantitative and qualitative metrics, including divisional and group operational performance, 

capital management, prudential risk, IT and cyber risk, and internal audit.

•  Environmental: (moderator*): progress against key environmental commitments as referenced in our 2023 Climate and nature report and increase in the 
prominence of sustainability considerations in commercial decisions taken during the year (including operational, investment and product development 
decisions).  
*ESG metrics are incorporated into the existing strategic and personal performance measures, rather than a separate or additional component. AVP may 
be reduced if insufficient progress is made against ESG metrics.

In addition, the Committee considers the Solvency II coverage ratio (2023: 224%) and sustainable financial performance, and may apply a ‘moderator’ to reduce 
(but not increase) an AVP award if there are factors that warrant such a reduction. For 2023, it was determined that no adjustment was necessary to the 
calculated AVP award.

Risk consideration
The Committee reviewed a comprehensive report from the Chief Risk Officer to ascertain that the executive directors’ objectives had been 
fulfilled within the risk appetite of the Group. In addition, the Committee received feedback from the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance 
function that there were no issues to consider relating to regulatory breaches or customer outcomes that would prevent payment of any AVP 
award or trigger a recommendation that malus should be applied. The Committee was satisfied that the AVP awards should be paid.

Deferral policy
In line with the remuneration policy, 50% of all 2023 AVP awards have been deferred for three years into restricted shares, subject to continued 
employment and with malus and clawback provisions. 

AVP potential 2024
In line with the remuneration policy, for 2024 the target and maximum AVP opportunities for our executive directors will be:

Financial metrics will cover profitability and growth, aligned to António’s strategic review. Group financial targets will be disclosed in the 2024 
annual report. Some strategic and personal targets are considered confidential and will not be disclosed in any future report.

In line with the remuneration policy, 50% of all 2024 AVP awards will be deferred for three years into restricted shares, subject to continued 
employment, with malus and clawback provisions.

Details of how the 2021 PSP award vested
The 2021 PSP award vested at 61.1% of maximum in March 2024 based on a combination of total shareholder return (TSR) out-performance (50%) 
and earnings per share (EPS) growth (50%) over the three-year performance period ended 31 December 2023. A summary of the outcome per 
measure is below, with further detail provided on page 108.

The Committee reviewed the company’s overall performance taking into consideration an assessment of Solvency II performance and progress 
against long-term environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives. The Committee was satisfied that the PSP awards should vest 
in accordance with the TSR and EPS growth outcomes.

Approach to calculation of EPS growth
EPS growth is determined based on measuring the change in EPS over the 3 year performance period. However, as previously indicated, the 
introduction of IFRS 17 prevents EPS from being measured on the same basis from the start of the performance period (where EPS was reported 
based on IFRS 4) to the end of the performance period (where EPS was reported based on IFRS 17). In order to fairly measure the EPS growth 
performance, the Committee has considered the annual change in each of the three years, as the EPS for 2022 has been reported on both an IFRS 4 
and IFRS 17 basis. The basis for the calculation is illustrated in the table below:

1.  TSR is calculated in accordance with the Performance Share Plan rules using the three-month average prior to the start and end of the performance period.

The PSP award will vest on 8 March 2024. As the share price at the date of vesting was not known as of the date of this report, the value included in the ‘single 
figure’ of remuneration on page 104 has been calculated based on the number of shares vesting multiplied by the average share price over the quarter ended 
31 December 2023 (226.3p). The actual share price and value at vesting will be reported in the 2024 annual report.

Performance Share Plan (PSP) 2024 awards: António Simões will be granted an award with a face value of 300% of base pay and Jeff Davies 
will be granted an award with a face value of 250% of base pay

For the 2024 award, the following performance measures will be used:

•  TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100 (20% of award)
•  TSR performance relative to a bespoke comparator group of companies (20% of award), noting that the bespoke comparator group will 

be unchanged from the 2023 PSP

•  EPS growth (40% of award)
•  progress against published commitments in our Climate transition plan, aligned to our three-pillar strategy of Invest, Influence, Operate 

(20% of award) as detailed in the table on the following page.

Vesting of the overall awards will also be subject to assessment against Solvency II objectives.

In setting targets for the 2024 PSP awards the Committee have considered:

the business plan over the next three years, market expectations of performance
the impact of the new IFRS 17 accounting standard on the timing of the reporting of profit

• 
• 
•  progress against our published commitments with the Climate transition plan and projected progress over the performance period.

Based on these considerations the Committee considered it appropriate to for vesting to be based on performance as set out in the table 
on the following page.

In determining the final outcome for the Climate transition measures, the Remuneration Committee may make a downwards adjustment if they are not satisfied 
that positive and sufficient progress has been made against our target of 70% of eligible AUM to be managed in alignment with net zero1.
The Remuneration Committee will also consider material market movements or business composition changes when assessing the final outcome and may 
make adjustments to the outcome as a result.

Performance conditions for PSP awards granted in 2023
The PSP awards were granted on 6 April 2023. 25% of the award will vest based on TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100, 25% of the 
award will vest based on TSR performance relative to a bespoke peer group (comprising Abrdn, Aegon, Ageas, Allianz, Assicurazioni Generali, 
Aviva, AXA, CNP Assurances, Gjensidige Forsikring, Hannover Rueck, Lincoln National, M&G, Mapfre, Metlife, Muenchener Ruck, NN Group, 
Phoenix Group, Principal Financial, Prudential Financial, Prudential, Sampo A, Swiss Re, Talanx and Zurich Insurance Group), and 50% of the 
award will vest based on the EPS growth. Vesting will be based on performance as set out in the table below:

Performance below threshold results in a nil vesting, and performance between threshold and maximum vests on a straight line basis 
between 15% and 100% of maximum.

At the end of the three-year performance period commencing 1 January 2023, the Committee will assess whether the formulaic vesting 
outcome is justified by looking at a number of factors including: whether the result is reflective of overall performance and has been achieved 
within the company’s risk appetite, the Solvency II coverage ratio, the quality of earnings, the nature of any changes in leverage or key 
assumptions and progress against long-term ESG objectives. If such considerations mean that the formulaic outcome of the vesting is not 
considered to be justified, the Committee can amend the vesting downwards (but not increase the level of vesting).

Notes
Shares used for the above calculation exclude those with performance conditions, any unexercised options, those shares subject to a period of deferral and any shares held 
in a private trust where the executive director is not a trustee. They include vested shares where the executive director has beneficial ownership, shares independently acquired 
in the market and those held by a spouse or civil partner or dependant child under the age of 18 years.

Although the shareholding requirement is not contractually binding, executive directors are expected to retain any after tax vested share 
awards until their shareholding requirements are met, and maintain that shareholding requirement (or their actual shareholding at the date 
of leaving, if lower) for at least two years after leaving employment. The Committee retains the discretion to withhold future grants under the 
PSP if executives are not making sufficient progress towards their shareholding requirement. Once shareholding requirements have been met, 
executive directors may sell shares in excess of the shareholding requirement if they wish. The Committee has discretion to allow executive 
directors to sell shares prior to the shareholding requirement being met in extenuating situations, for example, a change to personal 
circumstances or ill health, etc.

Share options exercised during 2023
PSP awards may be granted in the form of nil-cost options with an exercise date no earlier than the normal vesting date. Executive directors 
may also participate in the company’s ShareSave Plan. Where such share awards have been exercised during 2023 they are shown below:
