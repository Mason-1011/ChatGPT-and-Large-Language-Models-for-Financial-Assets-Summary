Financial measures
With the introduction of IFRS 17 on 1 January 2023, some of our previously reported 
financial measures are no longer relevant and others have been restated on the new basis. 
Accordingly, we have presented the current year and restated prior year values only.

Profit before tax £m 

Adjusted operating profit £m

Earnings per share p

Store of future profit £bn

£195m

£1,667m

(2022: £939m)

(2022: £1,663m)

7.35p

(2022: 12.84p)

£14.7bn

(2022: £13.5bn)

Profit before tax comprises all items 
of income and expense recognised 
in profit or loss (excluding tax). 

Adjusted operating profit measures 
the pre‑tax result excluding the impact 
of investment volatility, economic 
assumption changes caused by changes 
in market conditions or expectations 
and exceptional items. The measure enhances 
the understanding of the Group’s operating 
performance over time by separately 
identifying non‑operating items.

Earnings per share (EPS) measures the 
profitability and strength of a company over 
time. It is determined as total shareholder 
profit after tax divided by the number 
of shares outstanding.

Store of future profit refers to the gross of 
tax combination of established contractual 
service margin (CSM) and risk adjustment 
(RA) (net of reinsurance) under IFRS 17.

Solvency II capital coverage ratio, which 
shows own funds on a regulatory basis 
divided by the solvency capital requirement, 
is one of the indicators of the Group’s 
balance sheet strength and aligns to 
management’s approach of dynamically 
managing the Group’s capital position.

Solvency II operational surplus generation 
is the expected surplus generated from the 
assets and liabilities in‑force at the start of 
the year. It is based on assumed real world 
returns and best estimate non‑market 
assumptions, and includes the impact 
of management actions to the extent that, 
at the start of the year, these were reasonably 
expected to be implemented over the year.

This is made up of our ownership share 
of the emissions related to the assets we 
invest in within the Group proprietary asset 
portfolio. It includes bonds, equities, and 
investment property but excludes cash, 
derivatives, or any assets already covered 
in our operational footprint. It is measured 
per unit of investment.

Measures the greenhouse gases (GHG)
associated with our direct operations. 
Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions 
occurring from sources owned or controlled 
by the Company. Scope 2 emissions are 
indirect GHG emissions from consumption 
of purchased electricity, heat or steam.

Performance measures and remuneration
The performance measures used for the purpose of determining variable elements 
of directors’ remuneration are aligned to the Group’s key performance indicators (KPIs). 
These are indicated with the icon: 

.

For more details, refer to pages 100 to 103 of the summary of remuneration policy. 

Alternative performance measures (APMs)
The Group uses certain APMs to help explain its business performance, indicated 
with the icon: 

.

Further information on APMs, including a reconciliation to the financial statements 
(where possible), can be found on page 270. 

Full definitions of the financial metrics above are included in the glossary on page 273. 

1.  Metrics have been re‑baselined through a combination of methodology and data sourcing changes. Figures from the 2022 report, with an associated impact assessment, are provided 

in the 2023 Climate and nature report at: group.legalandgeneral.com/reports.
 Our total scope 1 and scope 2 (location) emissions have been subject to independent limited assurance by Deloitte. The basis of preparation (or reporting criteria) for our Group carbon 
footprint and Deloitte’s limited assurance report is available in our 2023 Climate and nature report at group.legalandgeneral.com/reports.

Introduction
2023 marked the beginning of a transition 
for Legal & General, with the Company’s 
announcement in January that our Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO), Sir Nigel Wilson, 
would stand down by the end of the year, and 
the appointment of António Simões, with effect 
from 1 January 2024, as his successor. It is 
pleasing in that context to be publishing an 
Annual report that demonstrates continued 
good progress across the full breadth of our 
organisation. This is a testament both to Nigel’s 
personal impact, and the strength of the business 
he has helped to build over the course of a decade.

As we look back on the year, I want to reiterate 
my gratitude, alongside the Board’s, to Nigel for 
his relentless commitment to Legal & General, 
and for his leadership and contribution since 
he took up his post over a decade ago. Under his 
stewardship, Legal & General delivered outstanding 
shareholder returns, while putting purpose and 
societal impact at the heart of our choices, 
through our championship of inclusive capitalism. 

Following a rigorous global selection process, 
António Simões formally assumed the role 
of CEO on 1 January 2024. António brings 
a formidable leadership track record at the most 
senior level in financial services, working across 
complex global organisations. His energy, 
ambition, and clarity of strategic thinking stood 
out during the selection process, as did his 
strong belief in the positive role that business 
should play in society which, of course, he shares 
with Legal & General.

Change beyond our business
Businesses are now becoming accustomed 
to a new inflation and interest rate environment, 
with the global economic outlook remaining 
uncertain. Geopolitical tensions have also 
accelerated with the impacts of the war in 
Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and the 
prospect of several important elections in the 
coming year. These conditions create complex 
challenges for investors to navigate, as well 
as rises in cost of living for many households. 
Our customers rely on Legal & General to 
continue to pay their pensions, protect their 
income and manage their assets. I am proud 
of the role we play, always keeping sight of our 
purpose, making a real and positive difference 

to people’s lives. 2023 was also a time of wider 
transition in our industry, particularly in our 
regulatory environment, with the introduction 
of IFRS 17 and the Consumer Duty. IFRS 17 
changes the way insurance firms account for 
insurance contracts, and the Consumer Duty 
sets out new rules for delivering good 
outcomes for all customers. 

Both of these initiatives are important context 
for Legal & General’s business, and I am pleased 
to report that our teams have done a terrific job 
to prepare for their introduction. Thanks are 
due to all colleagues involved.

Positive momentum
In 2023, we delivered a resilient set of results, 
with an adjusted operating profit of £1.7 billion 
and a 9% growth in our store of future profit to 
£14.7 billion. Profit for the year of £443 million 
and EPS of 7.35 pence reflected mark-to-
market movements and certain one-off 
accounting impacts.

We have a strong balance sheet, with a 
Solvency II coverage ratio of 224%, and capital 
generation in the year of £1.8 billion. These 
have supported a final dividend of 14.63 pence, 
consistent with our stated ambition to grow the 
dividend at 5% per year to 2024.

Our performance highlights the benefits of our 
synergistic business model. This year, we have 
seen more long-standing LGIM clients transition 
to our pension risk transfer (PRT) business, 
where we continue to take advantage of our 
powerful asset origination and management 
capabilities to match these liabilities with low 
capital strain.

The Group continues to build out its international 
franchises. We have made good progress in the 
US over the last decade and LGIM continues to 
expand in Europe and Asia, with 40% of assets 
under management (AUM) now outside of the UK.

We remain on track to achieve our five-year 
ambitions, and ready to set new, stretching 
goals for the next phase of our journey.

We have identified strategic growth areas and 
in doing so have generated consistent, 
sustainable, and socially beneficial returns.
We are committed to supporting individuals 
in planning their financial futures, and are proud 
to help regenerate towns and cities, provide 
housing and deliver on our climate commitments. 

We are delighted to now be settled into our new 
office in Cardiff, which brings these elements 
together to create a workplace with sustainability 
and wellbeing at its heart. This is the culmination 
of years of strategic investment and development 
around Cardiff Central Square – Legal & General 
has invested more than £1 billion in the city 
in recent years – and underlines the broad and 
positive value our approach can generate for 
our shareholders, customers and our people.

We continue to take action on climate change, 
regarding this as both a responsibility and 
a fundamental element of our business strategy. 
Our 2023 Climate and nature report highlights 
our progress against the targets we set out 
in our Climate transition plan, released in 
April 2023, and our commitments for the coming 
years. Our material climate disclosures are 
disclosed on pages 45 to 48 of this report.

Looking ahead
With a first-class executive team, a strong and 
resilient business model and platform for growth, 
the opportunities for impact are plentiful. In our 
first months working together, following a smooth 
and well-managed leadership transition, António’s 
dynamism and ambition have been evident. 
I am confident we can look forward to going 
from strength to strength under his leadership. 

In closing, I should like to extend my thanks 
and appreciation to leaders and teams across 
Legal & General for their enthusiasm and delivery 
throughout the year, and to our shareholders 
for their continued support. I look forward 
to working alongside you, and on your behalf, 
in the year ahead.

A growing force for good 
Acting in both an economically and socially 
useful way is core to the way we do business.

Chief Executive 
Officer’s Q&A

Welcoming António Simões

Legal & General is a 
business with strong 
foundations, and 
excellent potential.”

What attracted you to Legal & General? 
Three things stood out to me: our sense of 
purpose and commitment to playing a positive 
role in society, the quality and performance 
of our businesses, and the talent and 
commitment of our people. 

Few businesses have such a long-standing 
heritage – this year is our 188th birthday. 
We have seen through multiple economic cycles 
and societal changes, and evolved to stay 
relevant. We have proven that we can adapt and 
thrive in changing circumstances, and support 
our customers and partners throughout. 

Today we are a very significant business – 
a global leader in pension risk transfer, supporting 
the needs of c.14 million people through our 
Retail division, managing £1.2 trillion of client 
assets, and investing alongside them to 
originate new, socially valuable assets – 
generating returns that help to fulfil long-term 
pension liabilities.

With this unique synergistic approach, and our 
track record of consistent performance and 
delivery for our shareholders, clients and 
customers, we are well placed to continue 
to seize the many growth opportunities 
in our markets.

Central to this success are our people. 
Legal & General has a reputation for the 
dedication and expertise of its employees. 
I was drawn to the Company as a place with 
a rich culture, in which excellent people thrive. 
I’m pleased to say these impressions have 
only been reaffirmed now I have joined. 

In short, Legal & General is a business with 
strong foundations, and excellent potential. 
I am looking forward to helping define and 
lead our next phase. 

What should shareholders expect from 
you as a leader of Legal & General? 
A fresh perspective. I bring experiences from 
outside the business, which means I ask 
different questions and look at issues in new 
ways. I am encouraging us to think broadly 
about our markets and how we work. 

My first priority as CEO has been to listen. 
By taking the time to hear from my colleagues, 
our customers, clients, shareholders and 
partners, I am learning what Legal & General 
means to them, getting their perspectives 
on what matters most, and where they see 
our future potential. 

Looking ahead, I hope to combine strategic 
vision and focus with consistent delivery. 
I am working with my team to articulate our 
long-term growth strategy, considering how 
each of our divisions needs to focus and evolve 
to address our biggest opportunities. I look 
forward to presenting this later in the year, 
and working with our people and partners 
to execute our plans. 

How will the experiences you bring from 
other organisations shape your approach? 
I’ve learned that putting customers at the top 
of our priority list is how we succeed in the long 
run. Every decision we take should be with our 
customer in mind, whether that’s a retail 

customer, institutional client, co-investor 
or partner. Understanding where our clients 
are coming from and being able to walk in their 
shoes is really important – that focus keeps 
us compassionate and relevant, and helps 
us to spot new opportunities to add value. 
I’ll be encouraging all our teams to dedicate 
time to building that connection.

Having lived and worked around the world, 
I bring a truly international mindset. I understand 
what it takes to succeed and scale in different 
markets, particularly the importance of 
understanding local culture and knowledge. 
I am also focused on how we take learning 
from different contexts to improve and 
innovate elsewhere.

Finally, with nearly 30 years of experience 
in financial services, I have a strong appreciation 
of the complexity of our stakeholder environment, 
and how it shapes our opportunities and success. 
I’m committed to ensuring Legal & General 
continues to be an insightful, thoughtful voice 
in our industry. 

What are your early observations 
on the business? 
My early observations are very positive. 
The strengths I saw looking from the outside 
are authentic. We are purposeful and commercial; 
the business is full of talented and expert 
people. Our track record of delivery against 
the targets we set in 2020 shows the power 
and resilience of our business model. 

Alongside this, I am focused on our future 
growth opportunities. The world is hungry for 
capital and expertise to support new industries 
and the transition to net zero; institutions want 
help to navigate a changing economic 
backdrop; and individuals increasingly need 
support to prepare for the future financially. 
With our strengths in asset management and 
origination, and a respected, trusted brand, 
we are well placed to help and to benefit. 

To be successful, we need to communicate 
our vision clearly and crisply. My focus over 
the coming months is to define a strategy that 
shows why and how Legal & General will be 
as relevant in the next 188 years as it has been 
to date. 

How important are culture and purpose 
to you as a business leader? 
Legal & General is a great example of the 
importance of purpose and culture in action. 
Inclusive capitalism has been a powerful 
galvanising force inside the business and 
beyond it, and delivered consistent returns 
for our shareholders. It is motivating to hear 
how people love being part of Legal & General 
because we have a clear role to play in society, 
and to see this reflected in the choices we have 
made as a business. 

Businesses have a responsibility to help solve 
problems. All our business divisions are 
shaping how society and individuals prepare 
for the future. Our decisions can help make 
that future as positive a place as possible 
for the next generation. 

When can we expect to hear more 
on your plans for the business? 
I have thoroughly enjoyed my first few months 
at Legal & General. My conversations with 
our stakeholders, including our shareholders, 
continue to help me and my team to develop 
our plans. I look forward to meeting more 
of our shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting in May and providing an update 
on strategy at our Capital Markets Event in June.

The long view
When we began our usual planning for our 
Annual report and accounts in autumn 2023, 
the team shared with me a selection of those 
we had produced over the course of my tenure 
at Legal & General. 

companies, and in the UK ushered in a period 
of quantitative easing combined with public 
sector austerity. This sustained for nearly 
a decade, until the punctuation of the Covid-19 
pandemic, and then the war in Europe, spurred 
rising inflation, interest rates and living costs.

It was striking how much had changed. 
Legal & General was a part of my life for 
14 years, a third of my career. During that time, 
we saw transformation on a global, national 
and business level, of a scale that none 
of us could have predicted.

I joined the Group as Chief Financial Officer, 
during the Global Financial Crisis. The ripple 
effects of which led to reflection on the role 
and responsibilities of financial services 

Politics has become more turbulent, in business 
‘Big Tech’ has been dominant, and globally 
we have recognised the need to transition 
to a lower carbon way of life, and the extent 
of change and innovation required to deliver 
that shift. Developed countries are grappling 
with the consequences of a rapidly ageing 
population, and looking to square the 
opportunities presented by advances such 
as AI with the potential for equally transformative 
impacts on the labour market.

Our approach
Legal & General has had to be alert and 
adaptable in the context of these changing 
circumstances. I took over a business which 
had lost c.70% of its annuity business in the 
face of pension freedom reforms and disposed 
of around 20 Legal & General businesses 
to allow us to modernise, diversify and grow.

In my early years as CEO, our annual reporting 
was led with the tagline ‘stepping up’. This 
captured my belief, shared with my colleagues, 
that we could both positively advance and 
benefit from the changes around us.

I am proud that the business we built together 
has shown itself to be not just resilient, but 
able to evolve and thrive.

A large part of our success has been driven 
by our people, who have seen the opportunity 
that sits on the other side of challenge, and 
have encouraged and supported others 
to do the same.

Over the past 14 years, the make up 
of Legal & General has changed. We have 
taken informed and rewarded risks; selling, 
combining and creating businesses to build 
the organisation we have today. This enabled 
us to build a global PRT business, delivered 
under the stewardship of five talented CEOs: 
Simon Gadd, John Pollock, Kerrigan Procter, 
Laura Mason and Andrew Kail, whilst building 
the UK’s first £1 trillion asset manager under 
Mark Zinkula and Michelle Scrimgeour.

Alongside these milestones, through the 
creation of Legal & General Capital (LGC), 
we have taken a significant share of the UK 
housebuilding market, enabled impactful 
regional regeneration projects, supported 
growing industries and invested in c.700 
start-ups under Kerrigan Procter and 
Laura Mason’s leadership. Our investment 
in Pemberton, for example, has seen it grow 
from a small business, when we invested in 
2014, to a major mid-market lending platform, 
which has raised over €19 billion from 227 
investors globally across seven strategies.

Meanwhile, we have internationalised our 
operations, opening offices in Bermuda, 
Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, 
Italy and Switzerland.

Our constant has been the way we have 
chosen to do business, as an organisation 
with purpose at its core. Inclusive capitalism 
led us to look for opportunities to invest 
profitably in productive assets that address 
structural societal needs, with the benefits 
being felt by the members of the pension 
funds and investments we manage, 
communities and businesses on the ground, 
and our shareholders.

Our reputation for combining values with 
expertise has enabled us to work with some 
of the most respected universities in the world, 
the most exciting new businesses, and the 
most innovative investors across the private 
and public sectors.

Continued progress
2023 demonstrated the ongoing power of this 
approach as we remained on track for the 
stretching targets we set ourselves back in 
2020. In a challenging economic backdrop, this 
is testament to our resilience, competitiveness 
and the power of our synergistic business model.

We recorded our largest ever PRT volumes 
in both the UK and the US, including the largest 
ever single transaction by premium in the market 
with our buyout of the Boots Pension Scheme. 
In 2023, 99% of our PRT volumes arose from 
the conversion of long-standing asset 
management clients. In a challenging interest 
rate environment, LGIM continued to expand 
its client offering and despite significant 
inflationary impacts, we have taken action 
to keep absolute costs flat.

Our asset origination business, LGC, showed 
continued momentum against its five-year 
targets including significant ‘crowding in’ 
third-party capital. In October, we announced 
that Greater Manchester Pension Fund, the 
UK’s largest local authority pension fund, would 
invest in our joint venture, Bruntwood SciTech, 
which is leading the way in providing workspace 
for innovative UK businesses. We also began 
construction on our first US investment with 
our joint venture partner, Ancora, a state health 
laboratory in Rhode Island. 

In our Retail businesses, our annuities arm 
delivered its strongest ever results with 
a record-breaking £1.43 billion in sales under 
Bernie Hickman’s leadership. This reflected our 
persistence in building our offering throughout 
a time of lower interest rates. Our workplace 
pensions business, an increasingly critical part 
of the long-term savings market, also continues 
to strengthen. In the US, protection sales hit 
a record high of $175 million annualised 
premium equivalent (APE).

Finally, we have seen real successes, working 
with government, to bring forward policy change 
to set us up for future growth. In December 2023, 
we saw the passage of the first phase of 
Solvency UK reforms into law. This is the first 
step in delivering a regime that will uphold 
policyholder security whilst enabling greater 
investment in productive assets.

Moving forward
In closing, I want to thank our shareholders for 
their support over the last decade and a half. 
Leading Legal & General has been the most 
enjoyable and rewarding job of my career. 
I am confident that the business will continue 
to develop and prosper with António at the 
helm, with 11,500 talented and committed 
colleagues working alongside him to deliver 
terrific outcomes for all our stakeholders.

All the best,

Sir Nigel Wilson

Our strategy

Our strategy 
is driven by six 
growth drivers 
that affect 
everyone.

In responding to these long-term drivers, 
our strategic priorities aim to deliver 
sustainable profits as well as positive 
social and environmental outcomes.

Our business model is aligned with our 
strategy, ensuring we derive maximum 
benefit for our stakeholders.

Environmental, social and governance 
issues are central to inclusive capitalism 
and are inherent to all six growth drivers.

Short-term influences
Climate change
2023 has been the hottest year 
on record. We continued to see 
more extreme weather events, 
including several episodes 
of flooding throughout the UK 
and unprecedented wildfires 
in Europe, the US and Canada. 
These events demonstrate the 
rapid and significant impacts 
of climate volatility and 
ecosystem health deterioration. 
Despite this, 2023 also saw the 
rapid increase in deployment 
of solar and wind energy. 
We are making positive progress 
against our Climate transition 
plan, and continue to enhance 
our risk management framework 
to ensure our business remains 
resilient against various climate 
outcomes.

Geopolitical landscape
Ongoing conflicts in Ukraine 
and the Middle East, along with 
broader geopolitical tensions, 
could significantly disrupt global 
economic activity. We are 
carefully monitoring these 
impacts to ensure we remain 
financially and operationally 
resilient to adverse events.

Economic outlook
The global economic outlook 
remains challenging. While the 
market continues to predict falls 
in interest rates over 2024 
supported by an easing of 
inflationary pressures, other 
factors may slow this 
improvement. This may impact 
consumer sentiment, however 
we believe that our products 
and services are relevant across 
a range of economic scenarios 
helping our customers to 
achieve financial security.

Strategic report

1

Ageing demographics
As populations live longer, their pensions need 
to last longer too. Companies increasingly need 
to find solutions to their ongoing pension 
commitments. At the same time, individuals 
need to ensure that their retirement funds and 
other assets can finance longer retirements.

Market opportunity
We participate in the global PRT market, 
focusing on corporate defined benefit (DB) 
pension plans in the UK, the US, Canada, and 
the Netherlands, which together have more 
than £6 trillion of pension liabilities.

Strategic priority
We aim to be global leaders in pensions 
de-risking and retirement income solutions. 
During 2023, we wrote a total of £15.2 billion 
of bulk and individual annuity business globally, 
up 44% on the previous year. This included 
our largest ever single PRT transactions in both 
the UK and the US markets at £4.8 billion and 
$0.8 billion respectively, whilst individual 
annuities increased by 50% over 2022. We also 
announced plans to enter into a long-term 
strategic relationship with Dutch insurer Lifetri, 
putting us in a strong position to capitalise 
on expected growth in the Dutch PRT market.

2

Globalisation 
of asset markets
Asset markets are increasingly globalised 
and growing. North America, Asia Pacific 
and Europe are all attractive markets which 
continue to expand. We look for selective 
opportunities to build and expand our 
successful UK business model abroad into 
markets where we believe we can thrive. 

Market opportunity
As global assets under management 
are projected to increase from more than 
$115 trillion in 2022 to $147 trillion by 
2027, we will continue to innovate in the 
US retirement income market, expand into 
European wholesale asset management 
and increase our presence in Asia Pacific.

Strategic priority
We aim to build a truly global asset management 
business, entering new markets and expanding 
our existing operations. We continue to expand 
our global footprint with international AUM 
growing by 81% since 2018 and now representing 
40% of our total AUM. New offices opened 
in Singapore and Switzerland to support 
our growth ambition in Asia and Europe.

Investing in the  
real economy
Throughout the UK and beyond, there has been 
a long-term trend of under-investment in major 
towns and cities, and we continue to experience 
a serious housing shortage, while small and 
medium enterprises can also struggle to achieve 
scale without access to long-term capital.

Market opportunity
The UK’s ‘levelling up’ programme seeks 
to leverage private sector institutional capital 
to support urban regeneration and drive 
economic growth. Regulatory reform is enabling 
better deployment of pension funds to growth 
opportunities such as building more homes, 
creating science parks, and investing in 
start-up companies.

Strategic priority
By investing capital over the long term, we aim 
to become leaders in direct investments, whilst 
investing our assets in an economically, 
environmentally and socially useful way. 
In 2023, we invested over £1.0 billion in housing 
and over £8.5 billion in social infrastructure. 
We believe investing to address long term, 
enduring societal needs will enable strong 
shareholder returns, as well as improve the 
lives of our customers.

4

Welfare reforms
There is a continued need to protect people 
from financial uncertainty, which includes 
helping people take personal responsibility 
for retirement savings, and safeguarding 
their financial wellbeing and resilience.

Market opportunity
Fiscal pressures, inflation and an ageing 
population are placing the state pension and 
social security system under strain. This in turn 
increases the need for individuals to build and 
maintain their financial wellbeing. Workplace 
defined contribution (DC) assets are expected 
to grow to £1.3 trillion by 2032, with a growing 
need for pension decumulation solutions.

Strategic priority
We continue to deliver value for money for our 
Workplace DC members, providing a low-cost 
pension product to save for their retirement. 
Our Retirement Planner tool helps customers 
understand their retirement goals and the 
launch of our podcast, ‘A Little Bit Richer’, 
has improved financial understanding and 
awareness amongst a younger audience. 
We also offer a range of wider benefits to help 
customers manage their physical and mental 
health and wellbeing.

5

Technological  
innovation
Consumers, clients and businesses look 
to digital platforms to help organise their 
finances and working lives. Technological 
solutions can increase security and improve 
the ways we work and access information. 

Market opportunity
The market for new individual term life 
business in the US is expected to increase 
to $3.2 billion over the next three to five years. 
We anticipate continued premium growth 
across our UK and US protection businesses 
as technological innovation makes our 
products more accessible to customers and 
digital transformation creates competitive 
advantage in the US marketplace, while enabling 
further product and pricing enhancements.

Strategic priority
We will be enhancing our digital capabilities 
in the UK insurance and grow in the US by 
expanding into adjacent markets. The US 
protection grew APE from $129 million to 
$175 million (a 36% increase) in 2023 creating 
market differentiation through our US digital 
platform, as well as digital distribution 
expansion.

6

Addressing  
climate change
To minimise the most damaging consequences 
of climate change, governments around the world 
agree that we must limit global warming to 1.5°C. 
This requires a transition to a low-carbon economy 
while halting nature and biodiversity loss. 

Market opportunity
As global finance supports the changes our 
planet needs to address climate change and 
prevent nature and biodiversity loss, this creates 
a significant shift in investment allocation and 
the emergence of new industries in climate 
solutions. Despite the short-term uncertainty, 
world leaders at COP 28 reaffirmed their 
commitment to rapidly expanding investment 
in renewable energy supply and recognised the 
need for nature-based solutions.

Strategic priority
We are able to support the fight against climate 
change and nature loss through the positioning 
of our investments, our influence as one of the 
world’s largest asset managers and through the 
management of our own operational footprint. 
In 2023, we issued our first Climate transition 
plan and are now focused on delivering against it.

Our synergies in action:

Our biggest 
investment in 
Leeds to date

Funded by Legal & General, and developed in 
partnership with Glenbrook, the Whitehall Riverside 
residential complex is Leeds city centre’s largest  
BTR funding in 2023.

The Whitehall Riverside scheme 
contributes to LGRI’s total direct 
investment into BTR, which stood 
at in excess of £1 billion at the end 
of 2023.

Following the acquisition of our earlier 
BTR sites: Mustard Wharf in 2017 and 
Tower Works in 2021, Whitehall Riverside 
is in addition to almost 500 apartments 
already delivered by Legal & General 
in Leeds, making us the city’s largest 
investor and owner of BTR.

The Whitehall Riverside development 
consists of the delivery of 500 new 
homes and has been carefully 
considered to ensure that residents 
benefit from the diverse and growing 
employment opportunities, as well as 
its cultural destinations, local amenities, 
and strong transport links – including 
Leeds Central station, which is within 
a five-minute walk. 

This investment aligns with our 
commitment to establish positive 
environmental and socio-economic 
impact, addressing sustainability 
issues and innovating for biodiversity 
by including a riverside green and new 
trees in the wider public realm, as well 
as an ambition to drive down operational 
carbon emissions. 

With funding provided by LGRI, and 
utilising LGIM’s expertise as an asset 
manager, this demonstrates how our 
businesses work together to make 
a difference. The power of responsibly 
investing our pension savings in urban 
regeneration, thereby transforming 
and reshaping cities, creates productive 
assets for future generations. 
This is inclusive capitalism in action.

Both institutional retirement and 
investment management businesses 
are being actioned within this investment.

Shareholders

Customers

Employees

Our shareholders are institutional and 
individual investors. We provide them with 
honest and transparent information on our 
strategy, outlook and business performance 
and we generate value through share price 
appreciation and a progressive dividend.

Our customers include those saving 
for retirement, recipients of retirement 
income, insurance policyholders, mortgage 
holders, residents of our housing and 
retirement villages, and investors. Listening 
to our customers helps us to better understand 
their needs, and provide suitable, reliable 
products and services.

Our employees are based in the UK, the 
US and other countries and jurisdictions 
in Europe and Asia. We’re working to build 
a more diverse workforce and inclusive 
workplace, where care is taken to protect 
individuals’ wellbeing and resilience.

We invest shareholder capital (targeting 
returns) and retirement capital (for long-term 
income streams to pay retirement benefits) 
into environmentally friendly and socially 
useful investments, including alternative 
assets such as urban regeneration, clean 
energy and affordable housing. 

Our segmentation model helps us personalise 
customer service at key financial moments. 
We’ve improved digital journeys like pension 
transfer and consolidation. Our Consumer 
Duty driven research shaped how we identified 
vulnerabilities, developed new products and 
services, and supported customers.

We supplemented the data gathered through 
our Voice surveys with targeted employee 
research using Natter – a tool for collaboration 
and discussion provided by an investee of our 
capital business – to improve our understanding 
of employees’ views of our culture.

In 2023, we achieved record new business 
volumes in our institutional and retail annuities 
businesses, as well as US protection. 

Our store of future profit, comprising CSM and 
RA, grew 9% while adjusted operating profit 
remained flat demonstrating resilience in the 
volatile market environment.

One million people saw our TikTok videos 
in the first three months of 2023. Our new over 
50s’ lifetime mortgage reimagined retirement 
lending and our Focus Fortnight webinars 
broadened intermediaries’ knowledge.

Our protection retention project helped people 
stay covered despite the cost of living crisis, 
and Group protection’s wellbeing guide helped 
employees and employers respond to it.

In the UK, we continue to enjoy a productive 
partnership with Unite, the union which 
represents employees individually and for 
collective bargaining, and with our in-house 
Management Consultative Forum. 

Our Cardiff-based employees moved into our 
newly constructed office in the centre of the 
city, the latest phase in our investment in the 
Welsh capital.

Our contribution to the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals 
The United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) are focused on 
tackling the pressing social, economic and 
environmental issues that could threaten the 
livelihoods and wellbeing of people worldwide.

Contributing to the SDGs is integral to 
inclusive capitalism. It is important that our 
business priorities and strategy align with 
the goals and that we can demonstrate how 
the outcomes we are delivering contribute 
to specific SDGs. As our business grows 
and evolves, our approach to the SDGs will 
progress too. 

The following SDGs contribute to many 
of our key stakeholder engagements as they 
are most heavily aligned to our growth drivers:

3.  Good health and 

wellbeing

8.  Decent work and 
economic growth 

4. Quality education

Regulators

Communities

Suppliers

The Group is subject to financial services 
regulations and approvals in all the markets 
in which we operate. We maintain a constructive 
and open relationship with our regulators 
and have a programme of regular meetings 
between the Group’s executive and non-
executive directors and our UK regulators.

Our purpose is to improve the lives 
of our customers, build a better society 
for the long term, and create value for our 
shareholders. This inspires us to use our 
assets in an economically and socially 
useful way, and to engage with civil society, 
encouraging our people to get involved 
in community causes.

We work with a broad range of suppliers, 
from services and material providers to IT 
and software suppliers. We strive to work 
with like-minded businesses who comply 
with our Code of Conduct and business 
principles. This includes operating ethically, 
taking environmental responsibility and 
treating workers with respect and dignity.

We hold regular discussions with our key 
regulators on aspects relevant to the evolving 
regulatory agenda to ensure our strategic 
focus meets the needs of all stakeholders.

We actively engage with regulatory 
consultations and calls for evidence across 
key areas of regulatory policy and reform. 
In 2023, this included engagement on 
Solvency UK, the Corporate Governance 
Code, the Sustainability Disclosure 
Requirements and Diversity and Inclusion.

We liaise with our supervisors to ensure 
timely notification of changes to the Group’s 
regulated population and accuracy of the 
Financial Services Register.

Following the 2022 launch of our place-based 
social impact toolkit, 2023 saw us put the 
methodology into action. The toolkit helps 
us identify local needs and priorities 
by working with communities, and to make 
positive economic, environmental and social 
impacts through our real estate investments.

We expanded our partnership with the charity 
RedSTART to deliver age-appropriate 
financial education to primary school 
children, helping expand the programme into 
South Wales and the Brighton and Hove area.

We matched over £452,000 in employee 
charitable fundraising and volunteering. 
In total, we donated £3.4 million to civil society 
sector organisations, including £200,000 
through our annual Summer Challenge.

We work with suppliers to deliver value 
for money for the organisation, to bring 
innovation through best practice and to 
support continued growth for Legal & General.

We aim to build diversity and inclusion into 
our supply chain to create an equal and fair 
marketplace, where opportunities are open to all.

We are committed to protecting the environment 
and this year have set a target to encourage our 
suppliers to transition to net zero by ensuring 
that 80%, by spend, of our suppliers will set 
a science-based1 carbon reduction target 
by the end of 2026.

1. 

 We define a target as science based if it is approved by 
the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) or is aligned 
to its criteria i.e. is a mid-term reduction target with 
enough ambition to align with the global net zero trajectory.

Ancora L&G 

Poole 

Ancora L&G was formed in 2022, 
as a joint venture between the 
US-based science and technology 
real estate developer Ancora and 
Legal & General Capital (LGC). 
It was created as a real estate 
platform dedicated to driving 
science and technology growth 
across the US. The partnership 
will develop a 210,000 sq. ft. 
building designed to provide 
essential space for public health 
services in Rhode Island, advancing 
the state’s critical public health 
and safety goals. It will also provide 
laboratories for development and 
application of cutting-edge new 
science, which is anticipated to 
make a difference to future public 
health and quality of life. 

In March 2023, we purchased 
a site (Science at Square 10) 
near the Yale University campus, 
to further our city-approved plan 
to build a new 11-storey lab and 
office building. It will house 
university research, forward-
looking companies, and innovative 
entrepreneurs in one vibrant hub 
of growth and discovery.

We reinvigorated Kingland high 
street in Poole with an innovative 
scheme to help Dorset-based 
start-ups and independent 
businesses during the pandemic. 
This has generated £3 million 
in direct turnover for operators 
since opening in 2021, led to 
£2.2 million in additional sales 
for operators at LGIM Real Assets’ 
neighbouring shopping centre in 
the first year of opening, created new 
jobs and increased footfall by 16% 
ahead of its pre-pandemic trend. 

We also developed a partnership 
of local stakeholders representing 
the needs of the community, such 
as charities tackling issues including 
homelessness, the NHS, and the 
local university. Our partnership 
with the NHS, who took 20,000 sq. ft. 
within the centre to create an 
outpatient assessment clinic, 
treated over 15,000 patients in 
its first 15 months of opening.

We’ve thought hard about 
how we can catalyse and 
form local partnerships 
to create real positive 
change, including how 
we communicate and 
measure social impact.”

helping us deliver on our transition 
plan. CALA Homes has been 
advancing the use of hydrotreated 
vegetable oil (HVO) to reduce their 
operational carbon footprint and 
has developed a pilot net zero 
enabled home to test designs and 
technology we hope will deliver 
further reductions. IVG is continuing 
to design and develop energy 
efficient homes, in their drive to 
deliver net zero enabled retirement 
villages, for example by incorporating 
heat pumps from our portfolio 
company, Kensa. Suburban Build 
to Rent (SBTR) beat its target 
to have 50% of homes transacted 
as gas-free.

Working
 together

We aspire to empower our employees 
to work together to create value for 
our customers, shareholders and the 
communities we’re here to serve.

Our customers 
sit at the heart of 
everything we do

Employees on our Consumer Duty Programme 
have worked hard together to implement 
the new regulations. They have undertaken 
targeted monitoring reviews across the Group 
to understand how the Consumer Duty 
management information will enhance 
customer outcomes, or where improvements 
are required.

The ongoing collaborative work has enabled 
more accurate and effective communications, 
enhanced delivery of service and driven 
continuous improvement activity. This has 
been central to the work undertaken and its 
subsequent integration into our governance 
and business as usual activity across the teams.

A major milestone for our 
UK pension risk transfer team

We have secured the benefits of 53,000 
members of the Boots Pension Scheme 
in a history-making £4.8 billion transaction. 
This transaction is the UK’s largest single 
buy-in by premium size and, for us, the largest 
single transaction by number of members.

This significant achievement is a testament 
to the importance of our Legal & General 
behaviours – being collaborative, purposeful 
and straightforward across divisions, businesses 
and external clients. We have shown this 
through excellent teamwork and the shared 
commitment to our clients and customers.

CCA Awards recognition
Our UK Customer Service team was recently 
awarded Global Standard Accreditation from 
the Customer Contact Association (CCA) for 
the sixth year in a row. This highly regarded 
accreditation is a framework that assesses 
the reliability and effectiveness of customer 
service operations.

Celebrating Retail 
annuities success
We had a record year in Retail annuity with 
premiums reaching £1.4 billion, an increase 
of 50% over 2022. This means we’ve provided 
guaranteed income to more than 12,000 new 
annuity customers, supporting them in securing 
brighter financial outcomes for their retirement.

Despite increased volumes and the 
challenges that brings, our teams continue 
to focus on helping customers achieve their 
desired outcomes. We aim to offer exemplary 
service and for the sixth consecutive year, 
we have been accredited under the CCA for 
service excellence.

I am proud that we 
have been able to work 
seamlessly across 
our insurance, legal, 
reinsurance, client 
services, finance, risk and 
investment management 
teams to deliver this 
excellent outcome.”

How did Legal & General approach the 
volatile economic backdrop across 2023?
Our diversified business model helped us to 
remain resilient despite the volatile economic 
environment. The store of future profit (CSM + 
RA) grew by 9%, while the adjusted operating 
profit result was flat year on year. Growth 
opportunities continued, with record volumes 
across PRT, Retail annuities and US protection.

The continued higher interest rate environment 
has created significant opportunity in the PRT 
and individual annuity businesses, demonstrated 
by the strong volumes. This was partially offset 
by the adverse impacts in the investment 
management business, where the lower fixed 
income asset values drove a decrease in asset 
management revenues and therefore lower 
year-on-year profit.

You implemented IFRS 17 this year. 
How did the implementation go and how 
have analysts and investors responded 
to this new accounting standard?
IFRS 17 is a new accounting standard effective 
from 1 January 2023. The standard impacts 
insurance contracts which, in our case, 
represents business written through our 
retirement and insurance businesses. LGIM 
and LGC are unaffected. As outlined in our 
half year 2023 presentation, the introduction 
of IFRS 17 only impacts the timing of profit 
recognition – the economics of the contract 
remain the same. There is no change to our 
dividend capacity (or appetite) and no change 
to Solvency II capital.

The implementation has gone well and the 
response from analysts has been positive, 
as IFRS 17 introduces a more stable and 
predictable profit profile through the CSM 
release. For us, this benefit emerges through 
the deferral of new business profit and 
demographic assumption changes to the 
CSM, which will then be spread and released 
into profit consistently over the lifetime 
of the contract. 

CSM has grown by 9% to £13.0 billion, with 
£1.2 billion added from new business in 2023, 
an increase of c.33%. CSM performance over 
2023 reflects the high volume of PRT and 
protection business written, as well as 
favourable longevity assumption changes.

How are you performing against 
your ambitions?
We are making good progress against our 
five-year (2020 – 2024) ambitions. Against 
a cumulative ambition of £8 – £9 billion, capital 
generation (Solvency II operational surplus 
generation) stands at £6.8 billion at the end 
of 2023.

With the 2023 interim and final dividend 
growing by 5%, cumulative dividends declared 
stand at £4.5 billion at the end of 2023, against 
an ambition of £5.6 – £5.9 billion over the 
five-year period. The Board has agreed that 
it aims to continue to grow the dividend at 5% 
per annum out to the financial year 2024, which 
would add an additional £1.3 billion.

We are also performing well against our ambition 
for Solvency II net surplus generation (which 
includes setting up capital for new business) 
to cumulatively exceed dividends paid over 
2020 – 2024. In total, we have created 
£0.8 billion surplus to the end of 2023. 
This has not been at the expense of ongoing 
investment in the business. For example, since 
2020, we have written over £40 billion of PRT 
and individual annuities.

We remain confident in achieving our ambitions, 
with our businesses closely aligned to long 
term and strategic growth drivers, which we 
expect to persist regardless of any short- or 
medium-term market volatility.

The PRT market looks set to continue 
to grow at pace. What is your outlook/
ambition in this market over the 
medium term?
2023 has seen a large volume of PRT deals 
come to market given the favourable 
conditions. The high interest rates have led 

to materially improved funding positions 
for corporate pension funds, that is to say 
pension deficits have significantly reduced 
and, in many cases, have moved to a surplus 
position. This means that a growing number 
of corporate pension schemes are able to 
consider undertaking a de-risking transaction 
with an insurer much sooner than had been 
anticipated.

We are a leader in the UK PRT market, driven 
by our scale and competitive advantage in 
creating, sourcing and managing assets with 
relationships across a large percentage 
of schemes. This is complemented by 
a disciplined pricing approach.

With the acceleration of the UK PRT market, 
we increasingly consider our ambition of 
writing circa £8 – £10 billion of PRT a year 
as ‘business as usual’. In 2023, we wrote 
£12.0 billion of UK PRT business at a Solvency II 
margin of 7.4%.

We are also seeing similar PRT market 
dynamics internationally where we wrote 
£1.7 billion in 2023. We surpassed $10 billion 
of total written premium with over 100 deals 
in the US, since our launch in 2015.

Your Solvency II coverage ratio is strong 
– how do you think about capital allocation?
The strength of our capital position provides 
us with both a significant buffer, should interest 
rates fall, and the scope to continue both 
to invest, so as to ensure the long-term growth 
profile of the Group, and also to maintain 
a progressive dividend. We have a number 
of attractive growth opportunities in which 
we could continue to invest. These opportunities 
include the acceleration of the PRT opportunity 
for LGRI, building out our asset origination 
capability in LGC, continuing to diversify and 
internationalise our investment management 
offering in LGIM, and enhancing our accumulation 
and decumulation platforms and customer 
experience in Retail.

Despite a resilient adjusted operating profit 
performance of £1,667 million, broadly flat on 2022 
(£1,663 million), profit before tax of £195 million 
(2022: £939 million) was heavily impacted by

Chief Tax Officer

Our 2023 tax position
We have a tax credit for the year which includes 
a material one-off tax credit arising from the 
introduction of a new Bermuda corporate 
income tax regime. This relates to the 
recognition of a deferred tax asset on inception 
of the new tax regime and will unwind against 
future taxable profits in Bermuda. 

The tax credit for the year excluding this 
one-off credit is £27m. This is explained 
by the varying rates of tax that we pay on our 
businesses in different territories and the 
mixture of profits and losses across those 
territories. Further explanations of our 2023 tax 
position can be found in our Tax supplement.

The tax environment
With the global economic outlook remaining 
uncertain as people adapt to higher interest 
rates and inflation, governments remain focused 
on both raising revenues and promoting growth 
across the economy, and the tax regime has 
a role to play here. In the UK, we’ve seen 
a number of changes with these aims in mind 
including the ‘super deduction’ being replaced 
with ‘full expensing’ of qualifying plant and 
machinery, changes to the R&D regime and the 
Lifetime Allowance Notification pension rules, 
and reductions in the rate of National Insurance 
for employees. At the same time, the corporate 
income tax rate has been held at 25% and personal 
tax thresholds remain frozen. These changes 
have an impact across our businesses, our 
investments, our employees and our customers.

New accounting standards, tax legislation and 
tax reporting requirements continue to add 
to the complexities that businesses face.

The introduction of any new taxes or levies must 
be clear in its aims and what it is setting out 

Tax supplement
Our Tax supplement is available 
on our Group website. See: 
group.legalandgeneral.com/reports

to achieve. This is particularly important where 
the tax regime is being used to target behavioural 
change, for example where ‘green’ taxes are 
being introduced to incentivise businesses and 
wider society to adopt environmentally friendly 
behaviours. We continue to contribute to 
discussions and research on the tax landscape, 
prospective changes and active consultations 
on new legislation and guidance, with a view 
to the impact across society, our customers 
and wider stakeholders.

We recognise that governments, customers, 
investors, and other stakeholders have justifiably 
high expectations for compliance, risk 
management and transparency. Our approach 
remains consistent with a focus on engaging 
with all our stakeholders and supplementing 
our disclosures on tax where we believe this 
will add value.

Our purpose is to build a better society and make 
a positive difference to people’s lives while 
delivering value for our shareholders. We believe 
that paying tax is part of the impact we have on 
the economy and society and that the tax regime 
should endeavour to balance the needs of all 
stakeholders across society, whilst ensuring that 
policies do not create unintended consequences. 

We monitor risks and complexities across all 
the territories in which we operate, to ensure 
we pay the right tax, at the right time, in the 
right place, consistent with our tax strategy. 
Further detail on our main risk areas – and how 
we manage those risks – can be found in our 
Tax supplement.

The new global minimum tax regime
During the year, the UK Government enacted 
legislation to apply a global minimum tax 
rate of 15% to multinational businesses 
headquartered in the UK, under the Model Rules 
agreed by the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD). These 
rules apply from 1 January 2024 and will apply 
to all of Legal & General’s businesses globally. 

In December 2023, Bermuda enacted a new 
corporate income tax regime that will apply 
from 1 January 2025, with a headline rate of 15%. 
These are all new rules and additional guidance 
on the implementation of the new regimes and 
their interaction is expected and will be kept 
under review for any impact.

The Group is expected to be liable to UK top-up 
tax in 2024 and Bermuda corporate income tax 
from 2025 in respect of profits arising in our 
global reinsurance hub in Bermuda.

Changes to accounting standards 
impacting the tax we pay
On 1 January 2023, a new global accounting 
standard for insurance contracts, IFRS 17, came 
into effect. IFRS 17 is an accounting change 
only, which does not change the underlying 
economics of our insurance contracts. It does 
not change our strategy, capital generation, 
solvency or dividend capacity.

The introduction of this new accounting standard 
impacts the tax we pay in the UK. This is because 
the UK tax regime is based on IFRS results 
for the companies in our Group and we have 
previously paid tax based on our IFRS 4 results. 

At transition on 1 January 2022, shareholders’ 
equity reduced by c.£5.5 billion. Of this, 
£5 billion reflects the value taken to the balance 
sheet under IFRS 17 as part of the CSM, which 
is expected to emerge as future profit. 
The remaining balance relates to the 
implementation of IFRS 9.

The tax regime requires the reduction in equity 
on transition to IFRS 17 to be treated as a tax 
credit, which is spread over 10 years. The credit 
represents the tax that has effectively been 
paid in prior years on IFRS 4 profits that, under 
IFRS 17, will now emerge in the income 
statement in future years. This ensures 
the same profits are not taxed twice.

As a result of the above, our tax payments over 
the next 10 years will be reduced.

Business review

Continuing to share 
our success with 
our shareholders, 
customers and society.

2023 in review
Our unique, powerful and highly synergistic 
business model has delivered another strong 
year, enabling our businesses to capitalise on 
significant growth across our chosen markets. 
Committed to inclusive capitalism, we are 
continuously taking action to protect the 
retirement income of millions and use 
the power of pensions to generate socially 
beneficial infrastructure and create 
opportunities for the next generation. 

With purpose-led expertise across asset 
origination (LGC), asset management (LGIM) 
and retirement and protection solutions (LGRI 
and Retail), alongside our scale and long-
standing relationships, we remain on track 
to achieve our five-year ambitions, and 
are confident in our ability to deliver resilient, 
organic growth.

Outlook
As a leading global player in the pension 
risk transfer (PRT) market, our institutional 
retirement business (LGRI) is uniquely 
positioned to offer holistic, multinational 
pension de-risking solutions. Remaining 
disciplined in pricing and value creation, 
we demonstrate our market leadership 
by executing record-breaking, innovative 
transactions, and we wrote our largest deal 
to date this year. We have now surpassed 
$10 billion of international PRT, and will 
continue to leverage our brand, scale and 
asset origination capabilities to capitalise 
on the large global pipeline. 

Our capital investment business (LGC) is 
committed to deploying shareholder capital 
in a range of underserved areas of the real 
economy which are backed by long-term 
structural trends. In line with our ambition, 
we remain focused on seeking incremental 
opportunities in clean energy and later living, 
expanding our international footprint and 
generating long-lasting value for society.

Building on our success to date, our 
partnership with Ancora is growing, while our 
investment with L&G NTR Clean Power Fund 
will help drive Europe’s decarbonisation and 
support its energy security agenda. 
Underpinned by the impressive growth to date 
of Pemberton, we are on track to achieve our 
third-party AUM ambition of £25 – £30 billion 
by 2025.

The ambition of our investment management 
business (LGIM) is to create a better future 
through responsible investing. Upheld by three 
strategic pillars: modernise, diversify, and 
internationalise, we are committed to raising 
standards in addressing the environmental and 
social challenges arising from a rapidly 
changing world. Alongside its core role in the 
Group’s successful synergistic business model, 
we remain dedicated to broadening our 
investment offering, expanding our global 
footprint and improving our operational 
effectiveness to deliver benefits at scale.

With a mission to reimagine our world to create 
brighter financial futures, our Retail business 
harnesses technological innovation to provide 
our customers with peace of mind. Leveraging 
operational strength and deep distribution 
relationships, we continue to widen our product 
and pricing proposition to ensure we can be 
there when it matters most. We are well-
positioned for long-term growth, after 
delivering a landmark year for annuities, and 
record-setting transaction volumes in the US.

CEO introduction
We transacted record global volumes 
in 2023, including our largest ever deal. 
We are seeing continued growth in the US, 
where total volumes written to date have 
now passed $10 billion. We have developed 
innovative solutions to support long-
standing clients to achieve their de-risking 
goals, securing 33 transactions in the UK 
totalling £12.0 billion, nine in the US 
totalling £1.5 billion and a £0.2 billion 
transaction in the Canadian market.

We provide income and security 
in retirement to more than 600,000 

customers, while allowing businesses 
to thrive by taking risk off their balance 
sheets. With the UK PRT market expected 
to exceed £50 billion in 2024 and a 
significant global PRT pipeline, our 
combination of long-standing expertise, 
continued innovation and uniquely global 
capabilities positions us well to capitalise 
on this opportunity.

Growth drivers
•  Ageing demographics.
• 
•  Addressing climate change.

Investing in the real economy.

2023 key activities
In 2023, we demonstrated how our solutions-
focused expertise can help large pension 
schemes to de-risk at scale, transacting the 
Boots and British Steel schemes – the UK’s 
largest individual transaction and fully insured 
scheme respectively – as well as two schemes 
with United Utilities. Together, these made 
up two thirds of our total volumes and reflect 
the strength of our long-standing client 
relationships and tailored client solutions. 

Excellence in customer service
We pride ourselves on our commitment to 
excellent customer service and have attained 
the Customer Contact Association’s (CCA) 
Global Standard Accreditation for the sixth 
consecutive year. In our most successful year 
to date, we were shortlisted for eight awards 
and won six at the CCA Awards, including 
Great Places to Work and 5 Years of Excellence. 

New business
During the year, we wrote PRT new business 
premiums of £13.7 billion across the UK, US, 
and Canada, including record volumes of 
£12.0 billion in the UK. Along with LGIM, 

we develop strong, long-lasting relationships 
with pension schemes to support them through 
their de-risking journey. We have a proven track 
record of executing ground-breaking transactions 
for very large pension schemes, including 
through pre-agreed umbrella contracts, while 
also preserving a strong presence at the small 
and mid-sized end of the market.

£4.8 billion full buy-in for the Boots 
Pension Scheme 
We agreed a £4.8 billion full buy-in with the 
Boots Pension Scheme. This secured the 
benefits of all 53,000 members of the Scheme, 
making it the UK’s largest single transaction 
of its kind by premium size and our largest 
by number of members. 

Legal & General has a long-standing 
relationship with Boots, having provided 
investment management services to the 
Scheme for over 20 years. 

This transaction also represented another 
innovative step forward in pension de-risking 
by combining investment and insurance 
expertise to find solutions for the Scheme’s

illiquid asset holdings. As a result, the Scheme 
can achieve the certainty of a transaction and 
maximise the value of its assets by transferring 
them to us.

£2.7 billion British Steel Pensions Scheme 
becomes largest in UK to fully insure its 
members’ benefits 
In 2023, we completed a further transaction 
(four in total since November 2021) with the new 
British Steel Pensions Scheme (BSPS), where 
the remaining 40% of liabilities were insured. 

We have now insured £7.5 billion of BSPS’s 
liabilities, securing the benefits of c.67,000 
members.

Over an 18-month period, a deficit of c.£800 
million was closed by executing transactions 
quickly when there were favourable market 
conditions. By completing this transaction, 
BSPS’s trustees are now able to make 
additional payments to members.

is used to measure customer experience on 
a scale of -100 to +100. We hold a 12-month 
rolling NPS score of +70 which is regarded 
as a world-class level of service in the 
industry, with the average UK score for

Customer service

We continually seek opportunities 
to listen, engage and improve our 
service to meet customer needs. 
This year we welcomed over 2,500 
customers to our flagship 
customer event at BBC Gardeners’ 
World Live, and hosted two 
customer roadshows themed 
around wellbeing. 

Excellence in customer service 
is one of the core features of our 
proposition, and we typically find 
that it is a key consideration for 
schemes transacting with us. 

We strive for outstanding service 
levels for our customers, issuing 
98% of customer communications 
within five days of the request. 
We are committed to developing 
our people in the customer service 
area, taking on apprentices in 
2023 to encourage customer-
focused careers. 

£1.8 billion buy-in with United Utilities
We agreed a £1.8 billion buy-in with the trustees 
of two pension schemes sponsored by United 
Utilities, an existing LGIM client, insuring two 
thirds of their liabilities. 

We provided a bespoke price lock to the 
Scheme’s assets, which gave price certainty 
for the trustees while the transaction terms 
were agreed.

£500 million buy-in with Deutsche Bank 
Pension Scheme
In November, we completed a £500 million 
buy-in with the Deutsche Bank (UK) Pension 
Scheme, which secured the benefits of around 
2,000 members.

This was the Scheme’s third buy-in, extending 
coverage to include deferred members for the 
first time, and taking the total buy-in to c.£1.5 
billion. The Scheme made use of the existing 
umbrella contract with Legal & General, allowing 
the buy-in to be transacted quickly and efficiently.

£332 million buy-in with Cable and Wireless 
Superannuation Fund
We secured the benefits of around 1,800 
members as a result of a £332 million buy-in 
with the Cable and Wireless Superannuation 
Fund. This buy-in marked the fund’s third and 
final transaction with Legal & General, following 
buy-ins in 2017 and 2019. It is the culmination 
of a process of reducing investment and 
longevity risk, which began in 2008.

With support from Legal & General, the Trustee 
of the Fund was able to react to changing market 
conditions and transact at an opportune time.

Opportunities for small pension schemes
Close to 75% of UK DB pension schemes have 
assets of £100 million or less and there is 
strong demand from these small schemes. 
We have a streamlined small scheme proposition 
to make the process more efficient for this area 
of the market.

In February, we agreed a buy-in with the Amey 
Services section of the Citrus Pension Plan, 
totalling c.£6.5 million, which secured the 
benefits of 70 members. This transaction 
demonstrated our ability to carry out fast and 
efficient pricing in a busy market as the 
transaction was completed within eight weeks 
of the trustee sharing the initial data with us.

In 2023, we completed 22 transactions under 
£100 million, which secured total premiums 
of £391 million, underlining our commitment 
to schemes of all sizes.

US PRT deals
Legal & General Retirement America (LGRA) 
reached another milestone this year by crossing 
$10 billion in total business written and over 
100 deals since its inception in 2015. As our US 
PRT business continues to grow, so does our 
team, with a new office in Stamford, Connecticut 
allowing a larger team and greater capabilities. 

Adjusted operating profit £m

£886m

(2022: £807m)

We achieved a strong adjusted operating 
profit of £886 million driven by releases 
of the contractual service margin (CSM) 
of £591 million and the risk adjustment 
(RA) of £119 million.

Understanding the risks 
Taking on the responsibility for pension scheme 
liabilities and providing income in retirement transfers 
pension-related risks to Legal & General. In particular, 
we take on the risk of higher than expected life 
expectancy, or that we experience defaults in the 
investments backing our obligations.

We remain vigilant to the long-term trends in longevity 
in our pricing and use reinsurance to manage selected 
risks. Working with our investment management 
business’s credit and property experts, we 
continuously assess default risks in our investment 
portfolio, managing exposures to sectors that may be 
at risk in the prevailing economic environment and, 
where appropriate, trading out of positions.

In 2023, we completed a total of nine deals 
totalling $1.9 billion, securing the retirement 
of over 27,000 annuitants, including an 
individual transaction of nearly $800 million, 
which is our largest to date. Of the nine deals 
transacted, four were with existing clients, 
reflecting the financial security and service 
excellence we provide to sponsors and pension 
plan members.

As lead administrator, LGRA also completed 
two transactions in partnership with 
Reinsurance Group of America (RGA), insuring 
c.$350 million of a total c.$1 billion premium 
and jointly protecting the retirement benefits 
of more than 6,000 members.

Other International PRT deals
In the Canadian market, we have executed 
a reinsurance transaction of CAD$350 million 
with a Canadian regulated insurer which brings 
our total premium to date to over CAD$1.5 billion 
in Canada. There continues to be significant 
opportunity in the US and Canadian markets, 
and we are well positioned to execute deals 
using our global pensions de-risking expertise.

We formed a strategic relationship with Lifetri 
in the Netherlands which presents an exciting 
opportunity for Legal & General to offer PRT 
expertise and secure the benefits of more 
international customers.

Our wider contribution
We have a major impact on wider society 
through the financial security we provide 
to pension scheme members and the capital 
we direct to investment assets, but also 
through the direct contribution our people 
make to the community. For example, this year 
LGRA held its first community day with teams 
in Maryland and Connecticut volunteering 

in their local communities to plant trees 
and clean up a park in partnership with 
the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.

Residential investment in Northern Ireland 
This year, we funded a £150 million residential 
development in Belfast, committing to the 
largest real estate investment in the region 
for 20 years which will fund the development 
of 627 new homes. This investment will help 
address soaring rental demand and drive 
economic growth in the region. 

the country’s biodiversity and environmental 
capital. We also helped fund the world’s largest 
debt-for-nature swap which is linked to the 
conservation of the Galapagos Islands, where 
we were the largest investor in the deal.

Outlook
The UK PRT market continues to grow, and 
we expect increasingly large transaction sizes 
in the future, with projections of £360 billion 
of new business to be written over the next 
five years.

On completion, the build-to-rent scheme will 
be managed by LGIM Real Assets as we continue 
to support Legal & General’s commitment 
to levelling up towns and cities.

As we proceed to execute deals globally, we 
will utilise our PRT expertise to identify and 
transact on favourable deals both in the UK 
and abroad as we leverage our international 
experience and long-term relationships.

Leeds city centre
In April, we agreed to invest £140 million 
for a residential development in Whitehall 
Riverside in Leeds, committing to the delivery 
of 500 new homes which will again be 
managed by LGIM Real Assets.

This marks the third scheme funded by 
Legal & General in Leeds and will bring the 
number of new rental homes it has delivered 
in the City to over 1,000. The development will 
help residents benefit from growing employment 
opportunities and strong transport links in the 
area, showcasing our commitment to delivering 
positive social outcomes.

Development and conservation
This year, we invested in a number of impactful 
initiatives including a senior secured loan to the 
Republic of Senegal, where funding will span 
45 development projects around health, education 
and transportation. We invested in a ‘debt-for-
nature’ swap (Gabon blue bond) to fund marine 
conservation in Gabon, aimed at conserving 

We are continuing to 
see an unprecedented 
acceleration in demand, 
driven by more pension 
schemes being closer to 
buyout than ever before. 
Against this backdrop, 
we have posted a record 
year with £13.7 billion 
of global PRT written.”

Investment solutions 
for large schemes

In 2023, we were able to assist 
four pensions schemes with 
illiquid assets using these solutions, 
allowing them to secure full buy-in 
transactions within their preferred 
time frame.

Working alongside LGIM, we have 
developed a range of solutions 
for pension schemes with illiquid 
asset holdings that are looking 
to secure a bulk annuity. 
This includes accepting assets 
as part of the premium payment 
or deferring part of the payment 
to align with asset sales to provide 
the potential customer with the 
most flexible arrangement.

CEO introduction
Our purpose-driven capital investment 
business, LGC, has long been investing 
in alternative asset classes and partnerships 
that drive superior financial returns with 
positive social and environmental outcomes. 

As we look to grow our business in the UK 
and internationally, we will continue to deploy 
catalytic capital, alongside an increasing 
number of third-party partners. These partners 
will gain access to our unique pipeline of assets 
and investments that create long term, secure 
income streams, underpinned by societal 
demand.

Laura Mason
Chief Executive Officer,
Legal & General Capital

2023 key activities 
In 2023, LGC’s alternative asset portfolio grew 
as we continued to deploy capital into new and 
existing investments in the UK and internationally, 
further strengthening our capabilities across 
a diversified range of alternative assets that 
are underpinned by structural growth drivers. 

Through our ability to manufacture bespoke 
assets tailored to create attractive long-term 
investments, our unique asset origination 
capabilities continue to be a key differentiator 
for our Institutional Retirement business when 
competing in the PRT market. 

Significant third-party capital was secured 
by our partnership with Bruntwood SciTech, 
the UK’s leading specialist property provider, 
as well as Kensa, the UK’s leading ground 
source heat pump provider.

In 2023, Bruntwood SciTech, our joint venture 
with Bruntwood, secured £500 million of 
additional investment and welcomed Greater 
Manchester Pension Fund (GMPF), the UK’s 
largest local authority pension fund, to the 
partnership. The funds will be used to expand 
and redevelop existing science and technology 
campuses and city centre innovation hubs 
across the UK, facilitating the UK’s ambition 
to become an internationally recognised 
science and technology superpower by 2030.

LGC’s 50:50 partnership with Ancora, a US real 
estate developer and asset manager dedicated 
to driving life sciences, research, and technology 
growth in North America, continues to expand 
with three sites across the US, providing 
a valuable ecosystem for universities including 
Yale, Brown and Georgia Tech, all of which are 
within close proximity to the sites. 

Specialist commercial real estate
Across the UK and the US, we are investing 
in specialist commercial real estate (SCRE), 
including laboratory and flexible best-in-class 
facilities for innovation-focused high-growth 
start-ups, scale-ups and global businesses 
in the life sciences and technology sectors. 

Additionally, construction of a new 210,000 
square feet life-and-health sciences building 
in Rhode Island is underway. When complete, 
it will provide essential space for public health 
services, advancing the state’s critical public 
health and safety goals. It will also provide 
laboratories for the development and 

application of cutting-edge new science, which 
is anticipated to make a difference in future 
public health and quality of life.

We continue to build on our track record of 
place-based regeneration through ECF, a joint 
venture with Homes England and Muse, and 
also with Oxford University Development (OUD), 
a joint venture with the University of Oxford. 

With the land provided by Oxford University 
and the investment and development 
management skills of Legal & General, the 
partnership aims to drive investment into 
world-leading innovation to attract and retain 
talent on a global playing field. OUD expects 
to have generated over 1.5 million square feet 
of life science and university space and 3,000 
new homes for the Oxford community. Marking 
a significant milestone for the partnership 
during 2023, the 270,000 square feet Life and 
Mind building and the two 135,000 square feet 
new Begbroke Science Park buildings reached 
their halfway point in construction. Begbroke 
Science Park will complete in Q1 2024. These 
three buildings will provide asset backing for 
our annuities’ pipeline.

Bruntwood SciTech

Our joint venture with Bruntwood 
stands as a pivotal initiative 
to reshape the UK’s innovation 
landscape, contributing to the UK’s 
‘levelling up’ agenda. Bruntwood 
SciTech has now attracted an 
additional £500 million investment, 
with the Greater Manchester 
Pension Fund being the first local 
authority pension fund to actively 
participate in a UK-wide science, 
technology, and innovation 
property platform. 

Over the last five years, Bruntwood 
SciTech has proven its ability to 
create places that nurture and 
grow innovation-based businesses, 
especially those working within the 
life science and technology 
sectors. Now the UK’s largest 
innovation property platform, 
Bruntwood SciTech aims to create 
a £5 billion UK-wide portfolio that 
can support 2,600 high-growth 
businesses by 2032.

Digital Infrastructure
Since LGC’s initial investment in 2019, Kao 
Data, our specialist developer and operator 
of high-performance data centres, has grown 
from a single-site data centre to a multi-site 
platform, with three operational sites. In 2023, 
Kao Data secured a further site in Greater 
Manchester for redevelopment. As a compelling 
strategic growth opportunity, we have provided 
further investment into Kao Data, to facilitate 
its plans to scale across the UK. 

In January 2024, Kao Data secured a £206 
million debt facility, provided by Deutsche 
Bank. This further demonstrates its growth 
from a start-up to a scale-up, its industry-
leading reputation, and both the scale and 
demand for world-class infrastructure that 
is engineered for AI.

Clean energy
We see a huge market opportunity for reliable 
and effective solutions to deliver the transition 
to a low-carbon economy. Our focus is on 
selective investing in attractive growth equity 
and clean technology businesses where we 
have identified the potential for rapid and 
substantial growth alongside investment 
into both new and established clean energy 
infrastructure assets. As of 31 December 2023, 
we had invested over £400 million into clean 
energy infrastructure and technology.

In May 2023, Kensa (the UK’s leading 
manufacturer and installer of ground source 
heat pumps), secured an additional £70 million 
investment and welcomed Octopus Energy 
as partners alongside LGC. 

Recognising the market opportunity and social 
benefits that decarbonising residential real 
estate presents, we have now committed 
£49 million in a breadth of investments from 
reducing construction emissions to the 
technology and support needed to retrofit 
existing housing stock. 

In our clean energy infrastructure portfolio, 
we continue to scale our strategic partnership 
with NTR, leveraging LGIM’s distribution 
capabilities and NTR’s sector expertise to raise 
and deploy significant capital into new and 
existing renewable energy projects. We provided 
seed capital to back the first close of the 
LGIM-managed L&G NTR Clean Power (Europe) 
Fund, which successfully raised €390 million 
in April 2023. This deployment will accelerate 
the construction and operation of clean power 
infrastructure, facilitating Europe’s 
decarbonisation and energy security.

Alternative Finance
Venture capital
Our venture capital platform remains committed 
to investing in innovation and growth companies 
across the UK and internationally through our 
Fund of Funds and direct investment programmes 
as well as our venture capital platform. 
Through these, we have now provided funding 
to c.700 businesses.

Understanding the risks 
Our early-stage investments through

exposed to the risk that they do not 
perform as anticipated. Where we 
undertake construction activity, we 
are also directly exposed to health 
and safety, and environmental risks. 
We seek to closely manage our real 
estate and housing market risk 
exposures, including development 
costs and changes in property 
valuations. Site health and safety 
is a core focus area across all our 
property development and operating 
activities.

The university spin-out market is an area of

General partner investing
Pemberton, our leading European private credit 
manager, continues to innovate and add new 
products to its platform, with success in the 
launches of its European Alternative Credit 
Fund and Working Capital Finance strategy, 
which hit the $1 billion of committed funds 
milestone in 2023. We continue to support 
the UK and European lending market through 
Pemberton, which delivered revenue of 
€108 million in 2023 (2022: €99 million), 
with fee earning AUM of €13.6 billion (2022: 
€12 billion) now deployed across 178 companies.

In March 2023, we announced our investment 
in ImpactA Global, a women-led impact asset 
management firm established to help address 
the sustainable infrastructure deficit in emerging 
markets. ImpactA Global will provide debt 
financing for sustainable infrastructure assets, 
helping to bridge funding gaps in transformational 
projects. In October 2023, we committed up 
to $100 million to support its growth strategies. 
Our partnership with ImpactA Global is indicative 
of those we seek through our General Partners 
Investing Programme due to its close alignment 
with Legal & General’s focus on delivering 
commercially attractive financial returns 
alongside creating a positive environmental 
and socio-economic impact.

Housing
Build to Sell
Our Build to Sell business, CALA, gave 
a resilient performance in the face of a 
challenging market, achieving an adjusted 
operating profit of £112 million (2022: 
£169 million) and delivering 2,917 units.

Later Living
Inspired Villages, our Later Living business, 
backed by a £500 million 15-year partnership 
with NatWest Group Pension Fund, has continued 
to expand its village offering. In 2023, it opened 
its ninth village in Millfield Green, Bedfordshire. 
Significantly, this will be the UK’s first 
operationally net zero retirement community. 

Affordable Homes
Our Affordable Homes business has established 
itself as one of the UK’s leading institutional 
developers and managers of affordable 
housing, having increased its total number 
of homes over 2023 to 4,026, with new builds 
targeted to be operationally net zero by 2030.

Modular Homes
In the first half of 2023, we announced our 
intention to cease production at our Modular 
Homes factory. Unfortunately, long planning 
delays meant that we were not able to secure 
the necessary scale in our pipeline.

Traded portfolio
Our diversified traded portfolio has reduced 
in size after a strategic reallocation of funds 
in favour of direct investments. This year, 
the traded portfolio exceeded expectations 
primarily driven by strong overall market 
performance across equities, multi-asset 
and short-dated private credit investments. 
The traded portfolio helps support the wider 
Group’s sustainability objectives by backing 
funds that support renewables and clean 
energy stocks through our Climate Impact 
Portfolio.

Outlook
We remain well positioned to drive long-term 
growth in our diverse portfolio as we continue 
to scale up our businesses by leveraging our 
strong balance sheet, pursuing international 
expansion, and attracting further third-party 
capital to invest in attractive high-yield 
opportunities. 

The ambition to build LGC’s diversified AUM 
to c.£5 billion (2023: £4.5 billion) across the 
UK and internationally by 2025, with a blended 
portfolio return target of 10% – 12% (2023: 8.7%) 
continues to progress. For investors looking 
to access investment classes that create long 
term, secure income streams that tackle some 
of the major social, environmental, and 
economic issues society is facing, 
Legal & General is an attractive partner.

As we continue to scale our impact in 2024, 
we will bring like-minded, purpose-driven 
capital partners searching for private market 
solutions to invest alongside us into alternative 
asset classes and partnerships that drive 
superior financial returns with positive social 
and environmental outcomes.

CEO introduction
2023 was another challenging year for 
the asset management industry, a year 
characterised by geopolitical conflict, macro 
uncertainty and volatile markets. Against this 
backdrop, our AUM and consequently 
operating profit declined. However, asset 
management is a long-term business and 
we remain confident in our strategy, which 
positions LGIM for sustainable future growth. 

Our strategy is centred around our three pillars 
– to modernise, diversify, and internationalise 
the firm. We’ve expanded into new markets and 
have been investing in our capabilities 

to achieve resilience and global scalability. 
During 2023, many of our investment strategies 
delivered strong relative performance across 
a range of asset classes, as we continued 
to pursue our purpose: creating a better future 
through responsible investing. 

Growth drivers
•  Globalisation of asset markets.
• 
Investing in the real economy.
•  Addressing climate change.
•  Welfare reforms.
•  Ageing demographics. 

2023 key activities 
Against the challenging economic backdrop, 
we are maintaining a disciplined approach 
to cost management whilst continuing to invest 
deliberately and for the long term. We took 
expense actions over 2023, including selective 
reshaping of the workforce and restraint 
on recruitment and variable compensation. 
These actions led to lower costs in 2023 
compared to the prior year, despite significant 
inflationary pressure. 

Delivering on Purpose: 
responsible investing
We are committed to raising standards at the 
companies and markets in which we invest, 
on behalf of our clients, to address the 
challenges of a rapidly changing world. 
As at 31 December 2023, we managed 
£378.1 billion (2022: £332.2 billion) in 
strategies explicitly linked to ESG criteria.

Responsible investing innovation remains core 
to our product agenda. In 2023, we launched 
a developed world, fossil fuels exclusion index 
fund, developed in collaboration with the 
National Trust, Europe’s largest conservation 

charity. We also launched a global diversified 
credit fund aligned to the UN SDGs, as well 
as a suite of net zero, Paris-aligned and 
bespoke funds to help clients meet their 
climate commitments.

Our approach continues to receive industry 
recognition: we recently won the Sustainability 
Provider of the Year award at the Pensions Age 
Awards. Last year, we also added dedicated 
investment stewardship resource in the Asia 
region, as we extend our reach and influence.

Delivering on our strategy
Our strategic pillars of modernising, diversifying 
and internationalising the business remain 
a key focus. We continue to make progress 
on our five strategic growth initiatives (SGIs) 
to expand our investment offering and build 
our distribution footprint. Two SGIs are focused 
on internationalising our business, by expanding 
in Asia and Europe. Two SGIs diversify our 
investment capabilities by expanding in private 
markets and active fixed income, whilst our 
final initiative looks to maximise our offering 
to the UK defined benefit (DB) pension market. 
LGIM plays a key role within Legal & General

alongside our sister divisions, and it is the

Modernising
We are shaping the future of the business 
by investing in our platform, data and people 
to enhance our efficiency and leverage our 
scale. Our plan is driven by our strategic target 
operating model programme, where we are 
working with State Street and Charles River 
to create a global platform for investment and 
middle-office operations to deliver a best-in-class 
client service. This partnership will help us 
to offer a more automated, consistent and 
seamless experience for all of our clients 
across the world. In the first half of 2023, 
172 employees moved to State Street and 
the first stage of the Charles River roll out 
went live in January 2024.

Investment management 
continued

As the defined benefit market continues 
to mature in the UK, we are supporting clients 
to achieve their ‘endgame’ objectives through 
modern solutions and enhancements to our 
platform. With over 75% of schemes now 
recognising buy-out as their likely ultimate 
end state, we expect to increase revenue from 
providing a full range of investment solutions 
along the de-risking journey. In the US, improved 
funding ratios due to higher interest rates have 
increased demand for customised liability 
hedging strategies.

Given our holistic ‘One Legal & General’ 
approach, we expect many of our DB clients 
to choose our institutional retirement business 
(LGRI) as a PRT partner. 

Diversifying
By selectively adding to our investment offering, 
with a focus on higher-margin areas, such 
as private markets and active fixed income, 
we are building on our core capabilities 
to improve the business mix. To meet client 
objectives, we also are increasingly integrating 
ESG factors into our portfolios, with around 
89% of new pooled products developed in 2023 
related to responsible investing.

In 2023, we continued to focus on attracting 
business into our smart beta and active 
capabilities, generating positive flows and 
annualised net new revenue (ANNR) into 
exchange traded-funds (ETFs), multi-asset 
and real assets. Our defined contribution (DC) 
business continues to attract new assets, 
also generating positive flows and ANNR 
in the period, as does our wholesale business, 
which ended the year with record levels 
of client AUM of £68 billion.

Internationalising
We are continuing to expand beyond the UK, 
with international AUM having grown by 81% 

since 2018 to £465 billion, representing 40% 
of our total AUM.

In the US, we are a leading corporate pension 
manager, working with clients to implement 
pensions de-risking strategies. We have 
refocused our index capabilities, leading 
to early success with $8.1 billion (£6.4 billion) 
in higher-margin index plus mandates in 2023.

In Europe, AUM increased 11% as we expanded 
the number of relationships with clients, 
consultants and intermediaries in our core 
markets of Germany, Italy, the Nordics 
and Switzerland.

In Asia, AUM grew by 12% in the year, with new 
mandates in Thailand, South Korea and Taiwan. 
We also opened an office in Singapore to serve 
clients in the region and to build connectivity 
with our London and Zurich offices in serving 
the important global financial institutions 
channel. In Japan, our AUM has almost doubled 
since 2019 and we are now Japan’s seventh 
largest asset manager. 

Outlook
We remain confident that our three-pillar strategy 
positions us well to deliver sustainable future 
growth. Following the success of the first 
phase of our strategic target operating model 
programme, the key foundation of our plan to 
modernise the business, in 2024 we will build 
on this success and continue to invest in both 
our people and technology to lay the 
foundations towards a wider rollout. 

We will look to build on our successes as part 
of our diversify and internationalise agenda, 
expanding into higher-margin product areas 
and global markets where our strengths best 
align to client demand, whilst maintaining 
a sharp focus on our core markets.

Our partnership 
with NTR

In April, we announced that we had 
successfully raised €390 million in 
committed capital and co-investment 
opportunity in the first close of our 
L&G NTR Clean Power (Europe) Fund. 
The fund, built in partnership with NTR, 
a leading renewable energy specialist, 
is designed for institutional investors 
with a focus on pension funds, insurers 
and endowments. 

The partnership demonstrated its 
potential in July, completing the financing 
of three Spanish solar projects in 
partnership with NordLB. When fully 
operational, these will have a combined 
capacity of 115MWp, producing enough 
clean power to serve over 50,000 homes.

Operating profit of £274 million (2022:

of higher interest rates on AUM, with 
average AUM 12% lower year-over-
year. Revenue of £902 million (2022: 
£970 million) has been impacted 
to a lesser extent reflecting LGIM’s 
shift towards higher-margin business. 
We are maintaining a disciplined 
approach to cost management, whilst 
continuing to invest deliberately for 
the long term.

Understanding the risks 
We are exposed to changes in the underlying 
value of the assets under our management, 
as a result of either market moves or flows 
into and out of funds. Operational risk losses 
can occur where services performed do not 
meet expectations of clients and regulators. 
Having a strong control framework within 
which all our risks are managed is integral 
to attracting new funds under management, 
minimising fund outflow and operational 
errors, and managing regulatory and 
reputational risks. Our continued investments 
in systems, processes and people ensures 
our control environment aligns with risk 
exposures across our global operating model.

The market challenges 
we’ve seen over the past 
year have not changed the 
fundamentals of LGIM’s 
long-term growth strategy. 
We are well positioned 
for the future.”

Our diverse portfolio of businesses means we

UK Retail Protection
Our dedication to helping our 5.5 million 
customers plan for the unexpected was 
recognised as we collected five industry 
awards in 2023 and achieved a record-breaking 
NPS of 54. With the introduction of the 
Consumer Duty regulation, we have reinforced 
our commitment to improving customer 
outcomes by upgrading our online platform, 
MyAccount, to give clearer functionality, whilst 
still maintaining our traditional channels of 
contact. Customers can now securely upload 
their documents and track progress, reducing 
the timeline of their claims. Additionally, our 
retention programme is delivering results for 
us and our customers by ensuring they are 
informed of their options.

This year we partnered with Co-op and HSBC 
to offer their customers life and critical illness 
cover, providing them with peace of mind and 
reaffirming our mission to create brighter 
financial futures for both our existing and 
new customers.

UK Group Protection
We are committed to serving over 1.8 million 
employees and safeguarding their financial 
futures as demonstrated through our strong 
retention of existing mandates and winning 
new business from both large corporates 
and small and medium-sized businesses. 
Our successes include winning a £12 million 
life assurance benefit scheme with a significant 
financial services FTSE 100 company.

Over 900 new SME employers joined us through 
Onix, our online quote and buy self-service 
platform, as we continued to invest in digital 
enhancements for our customers and reaffirmed 
our position as a digital transformation pioneer.

During 2023, we further ingrained our health 
and wellbeing framework: ‘Be Well, Get Better, 
Be Supported’. Our intervention and rehabilitation 
services start as soon as we are notified and 
in 20% of cases the employee can return 
to work even before the wait period on the 
policy has expired.

US Protection
In the US, we serve over 1.5 million customers, 
and we are well positioned to capitalise 
on further growth opportunities. We have 
outperformed the market in 2023 and became 
the third largest term insurance provider 
in the US. 

Our commitment to digital transformation 
has been the key to delivering record-setting 
transaction volumes this year. Since its launch 
in 2019, our innovative online quote and buy 
platform has focused on streamlining the 
customer and advisor experience, with more 
than one in three applicants receiving an 
instant decision. By reimagining the way life 
insurance is bought in the US, we have been 
able to amplify our positive track record and 
drive increased market share whilst keeping 
our customers at the forefront of our decisions.

Bank of Family

Our ‘Bank of Family’ research 
uncovered a record number 
of property transactions being 
supported by family gift in 2023, 
highlighting the affordability 
challenges embedded within 
the UK housing market.

The Bank of Family looked set 
to gift £8.1 billion to homebuyers 
during the year, contributing 
towards 47% of all homes 
purchased by buyers under the 
age of 55. We reinforced the value 
of advice for those considering 
providing financial help, and those 
looking for support to take their 
first step, or a step up, on the 
property ladder. 

We help customers 
manage their assets and 
income to achieve their 
life goals. Whether that 
is helping to protect their 
income when life gets 
tough or to grow their 
pension pots to enjoy 
retirement.”

Bernie Hickman
Chief Executive Officer,
Legal & General Retail

Workplace pensions
Throughout 2023, our Workplace Savings 
business performed strongly, growing to over 
5 million members saving for their retirement 
with our trusted brand. Legal & General remains 
the largest commercial Mastertrust in the UK 
market, offering members value for money with 
best-in-class governance.

Our research has shown that younger people 
have low awareness about their workplace 
pension. Nearly one in five young people with 
a workplace pension have no idea how much 
is being contributed to it each month and 
a third have never checked how much they are 
paying in. To help bridge this knowledge gap, 
we have created a series of engaging content 
pieces and have launched them on social 
media platforms in line with our commitment 
to helping the next generation understand the 
importance of their financial futures.

Retirement income
In 2023, we have continued to invest in our 
pricing and underwriting capability, achieving 
record annuity sales of £1.4 billion this year. 
To highlight our commitment to providing 
excellent service and value, we were ‘highly 
commended’ in the Best Annuity Provider 
category of the Investment Life & Pensions 
Moneyfacts Awards.

We appreciate that customers have different 
retirement plans and have experienced both 
strong demand for our Lifetime annuities and 
increased interest in our Fixed-term annuity 
products, which can provide a bridge to any 
potential income gap in retirement and give 
customers financial security. 

Building on the already successful long-term 
relationships we have with Aegon and 
Prudential, we have extended our annuity 
partnerships with both providers for five years 
through to 2028, working together to continue 
helping people plan their finances in retirement. 

Adjusted operating profit £m

£408m

(2022: £415m)

Despite challenging market conditions, our well 
diversified businesses performed well in 2023 and 
our profits were resilient. Whilst insurance operating 
profit was up 22% driven by ongoing profit releases 
in the UK and US, total adjusted operating profit was 
down 2% given the lower contribution from Fintech, 
as valuation uplifts from 2022 did not repeat.

Understanding the risks
As a provider of life insurance, workplace savings, 
retirement income and lifetime mortgage products, 
we make assumptions around changing customer 
health profiles, consumer behaviours, distribution 
dynamics and forecast lifespans, as well as economic 
factors including long-term housing market 
performance. We use our expertise to understand 
these risks, and price and underwrite our products 
to take account of them, where appropriate using 
reinsurance to manage significant exposures.

Retirement lending
We remain a significant lender and innovative 
influencer in the later life mortgage market, 
having supported more than 116,000 
customers to date. During 2023, we introduced 
a first-of-its-kind payment term lifetime mortgage 
(PTLM) for borrowers over 50. PTLM helps 
borrowers access higher amounts of property 
wealth by committing to pay interest for an 
initial term, especially helping customers who 
need to borrow into retirement and are not well 
served by existing products.

In 2023, we enhanced our lifetime mortgage 
range and made the decision to allow new 
Flexible Lifetime Mortgage customers to make 
up to 12 repayments each year, up from four, 
and make repayments by standing order. 
We have also reduced the minimum drawdown 
amount to £1,000 allowing customers to easily 
access their lifetime mortgage funds as and 
when they need and giving them more control 
over their finances.

We received five stars at the Financial Times 
FASA awards and won Best Equity Release/
Lifetime Lender at the Mortgage Strategy, TMA 
Mortgage Club and AiR Mortgage Club awards, 
reinforcing why we are trusted by our customers 
to be with them at every stage of life.

Fintech solutions
Moneyhub
Moneyhub is a provider of open data solutions 
for the UK financial services market. In 2023, 
the platform was the winner of multiple awards 
including Best App and Best Open Finance 
Platform at the Open Banking Expo Awards 

and won Open Banking Provider of the Year 
at the Alt-fi Awards for the second year running. 
The influential CBInsights named Moneyhub 
amongst its 100 leading fintech businesses 
worldwide.

theidol 
Our wholly owned subsidiary theidol provides 
digital development services to several internal 
teams, annuity comparison services for our 
customers and comparison technology to UK 
price comparison websites. During 2023 theidol 
experienced robust growth, particularly in travel 
insurance, where revenues increased mainly 
due to higher sales driven by changing 
consumer habits. 

Onto
An unprecedented fall in the value of used 
electric vehicles led to liquidity challenges 
in the funding arrangements of Onto and 
we wrote down the full value of our investment 
at half year. The business has since gone 
into administration.

Mortgage services
As a pioneer of digital evolution, our Mortgage 
Club is well established in the UK, facilitating 
around one in four of all mortgages, and one 
in three of all intermediated mortgages. 
Since 1995, we have facilitated £978 billion 
of mortgages and during 2023 we worked 
closely with a broad range of lenders as we 
transacted £103 billion of lending.

Mortgage technology 
We have advanced our position as a leading 
provider of research technology through our 

mortgage platform, Ignite, helping advisors 
find the best mortgage for their customers 
with access to 130 lenders. 

Surveying services
As one of the largest market participants, 
managing over 290,000 valuations, we invested 
in new technology and in refining our digital 
valuation proposition.

Outlook
We plan to focus on our long-term growth 
opportunities and build across our core 
markets, with a continued focus on our 
customers, and to harness data and technology 
to deliver excellent client outcomes. We remain 
intent on delivering the best results for our 
Retail customers, helping them navigate 
through challenging economic times and 
providing them with peace of mind that they 
are being looked after by a trusted brand and 
market leader.

Digital Transformation 

Our US protection business has 
had a record-setting year for sales 
volumes, exceeding the previous 
annual record, and becoming the 
3rd largest term provider in the US 
by doing so. 

Our success has arisen from our 
commitment to digital 
transformation with our online 
platform providing an innovative 
underwriting process and offering 
a hassle-free digital buying 
experience for advisors and their 
qualified applicants. 

Since its launch in 2019 the 
platform has helped streamline 
the customer and advisor 
experience through a thoughtful, 
reflexive digital application that 
can be completed in as little 
as 15 minutes. Today more than 
1 in 3 applicants receive an instant 
decision and more than 70% 
of applicants receive an exam-

Sustainability approach
Our purpose is to build a better society while 
creating value for our shareholders. 
We’re conscious of the impact we have 
on the environment, the economy and society. 
We acknowledge that we have a duty to 
maximise the benefits and minimise any 
negative effects our business could cause. 

Our strategic growth drivers on pages 10 
and 11 have a high degree of overlap with 
environmental and social themes. This, 
together with awareness of our responsibilities, 
means that we see the sustainability agenda 
as central to our business. 

We know that our social and environmental 
impact goes beyond simple adherence 
to the requirements of ESG considerations. 
We also see the sustainability agenda and 
its components as a source of commercial 
potential for the Group. The transition to net 
zero, the housing crisis and the need to invest 

in healthcare and other infrastructure all 
present opportunities for the long-term 
investment of capital against our future 
pension liabilities.

Impacts, risks and opportunities 
(IRO) assessment 
During 2023, we reviewed the areas of focus for 
our sustainability strategies and assessed their 
fitness to respond to a taxonomy of over 200 
sustainability-related topics. The findings of 
this IRO assessment were presented to the 
Group Environment Committee (GEC), one of 
our senior management committees, in early 
2024.

We concluded that the nine most material 
sustainability topics identified were, overall, 
adequately addressed in our strategies. 
Further information on this process, and its 
findings, can be found in our supplementary 
Climate and nature and Social impact reports 
(on pages 46 and 7 respectively). 

At Legal & General 
a sense of responsibility, 
commercial opportunity 
and motivated people 
combine. These 
ingredients enable us 
to keep creating value 
for society and 
our shareholders.”

Group Chief Executive Officer

Reporting our progress 
We make sustainability-related disclosures 
across three main publications. We recommend 
that readers who want to understand our 
approach to the whole range of sustainability 
issues – environmental, social and governance 
– read these publications together.

In this section of our Annual report and 
accounts, we set out some of the basic 
reporting that is required under regulation 
and legislation. Elsewhere in this document, 
we outline our approach to sustainable 
business, comment on how our commercial 
activities have contributed to positive 
environmental and social outcomes, 
and describe our governance practices.

Our Climate and nature report, prepared in line 
with the recommendations of the Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), describes our climate and environment 
strategy, scenario planning, risk management, 
metrics and governance. This report contains 
detailed data on our carbon emissions and 
other environmental metrics. 

Our Social impact report describes the 
commercial and not-for-profit actions we’ve 
taken in the reporting year in pursuit of our 
sustainability areas of focus. It also contains 
people-related disclosures, including workforce 
data; diversity and inclusion data and targets; 
and pay gap information by gender and, for the 
first time, ethnicity.

Long-term financial wellbeing
Long-term financial wellbeing is important to 
us because we want our customers and society 
to feel financially confident and resilient. 

At a human level, this is about the security 
of being able to pay the bills today, deal with 
the unexpected, and take steps to ensure 
a healthy financial future. Conversely, financial 
difficulties can affect all aspects of human 
health, especially when unexpected challenges 
arise, such as recent cost of living pressures. 
As a leading insurance and retirement product 
provider, we influence people’s long-term 
financial wellbeing. We are committed 
to creating a better financial future for the 
customers and the communities whom 
we serve.

Our Retail business offers products, services 
and tools which support individuals’ and 
society’s long-term financial wellbeing. 
We enhance these with extra services and 
not-for-profit activities aimed at improving 
our customers’ ability to cope with difficult 
times, creating additional, targeted value for 
customers who need it most. We also invest 
capital in ways which look to generate 
long-term economic value. 

Chapter two of our Social impact report gives 
more detail on this. 

Better communities 
Access to quality jobs, decent housing, thriving 
communities and economic prosperity are key 
to helping people live longer, healthier, happier 
lives. Our Rebuilding Britain Index – which ran 
from 2021, when the UK and other economies 
were still firmly in the grip of Covid-19, until 
May 2023 – showed the scale of the challenge. 
Among the impacts of the pandemic were 
a decline in GDP and declining health and 
educational outcomes, with those communities 
already experiencing some of the poorest 
outcomes in the UK being the hardest hit.

SDG contribution

As well as our actions to address climate 
change, we also seek to do business in ways 
which reduce wider environmental harms, both 
through our investment policies and strategies 
in how we operate our business, particularly 
in the construction field. 

Our Climate transition plan is clear that 
addressing climate change must be pursued 
in tandem with halting nature and biodiversity 
loss. During 2023, business and finance 
increasingly recognised the impacts and 
dependencies we have on nature. We 
welcomed the release of the Taskforce on 
Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) 
global framework for nature. We are building 
our approach to nature on the three pillars of 
our climate strategy, while recognising the 
unique challenges involved with integrating 
nature into decision-making.

performance and plans in these areas, please

Engaging customers and employees
The positive impact a company has on the 
world remains important for many 
stakeholders, including customers and 
employees. Our guiding principle is to create 
a better society, and value for shareholders, 
by investing in long-term assets that benefit 
everyone, from housing to renewable energy. 
This ethos shapes the way we invest, plan, hire 
and do business.

We’re a market leader in life insurance, 
workplace pensions and retirement income, 
meeting the needs of c.14 million people 
through our Retail division. 

We employ over 11,500 people globally. 
Legal & General customers and employees 
are from all walks of life and many different 
backgrounds. As a business whose products 
are so connected to the way people live, we can 
have a material impact on looking after our 
vulnerable stakeholders and supporting them 
during the cost of living crisis.

In chapters four and five of our Social impact 
report, we describe the steps we take to engage 
customers and employees, as well as our 
control framework which ensures we adhere 
to high standards in the ways we do business.

As an investor in towns and cities through our 
capital and real assets business, as well as 
a major housebuilder, we have an opportunity 
to use capital in ways which benefit society.

During 2022, we developed a model that 
we employ throughout the lifecycle of an 
investment, from design and construction 
to the asset’s impact on end users and 
surrounding communities. 2023 saw us begin 
to put its principles into practice: driving not 
only economic, social, and environmental 
benefits for the people and communities where 
we invest, but also helping ensure investments 
maintain long-term relevance.

Chapter three of our Social impact report sets 
out how we have done this. 

Climate and environment 
Climate change is a systemic issue, impacting 
the economies and societies in which we 
operate. Addressing it is central to our purpose. 
We see climate change not only as a risk to be 
managed, but also as an opportunity to invest 
in the solutions that society needs to manage 
the transition to net zero. 

We believe that despite the turbulence of the 
past five years, addressing climate change is 
the right thing to do, not just for our business, 
but for the many different stakeholder groups 
our business impacts. Therefore, our long-term 
strategic response does not change in the face 
of specific short-term shocks.

By investing our long-term assets to support 
decarbonisation, we are working to protect 
our shareholders’ and customers’ returns while 
helping to create a more sustainable future.

Our approach to climate change is built on 
three strategic pillars:

• 

• 

invest: through reducing the intensity of our 
financed emissions and through investing 
in the transition
influence: through the products we offer 
and our engagement with companies, 
governments and policymakers

•  operate: through our operations, our 

purchased goods and services, and the 
businesses we control. 

We believe our strategic response to climate 
change will support our resilience and allow 
us to take advantage of the opportunities 
presented by the transition to a net zero 
economy. It is set out in full detail in our 
Climate and nature report and our Climate 
transition plan, which was presented to, and 
approved by, our shareholders in 2023.

Transition plan: response to FCA 
requirement 2021/61 9.8.6FG
Our Climate transition plan was 
presented to, and approved by, the 
2023 Annual General Meeting of 
Legal & General plc shareholders. 
The plan assumes, and sets out 
our proposed role in bringing 
about, the economy reaching net 
zero carbon emissions by 2050 
in line with the UK Government’s 
Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 
Target Amendment) Order 2019. 

Companies Act 2006 and SECR
In building our footprint, we have 
reported on the emission sources 
for January to December 2023 
required under the Companies Act 
2006 Strategic report and Directors’ 
report regulations 2013 and have 
followed the requirements of the 
Streamlined Energy and Carbon 
Reporting (SECR) framework.

In line with the Greenhouse Gas 
protocol, our scope 1 and 2 is the 
annual carbon emissions of the 
whole Group. We apply the 
operational control approach,  
i.e. we include all operations which 
we directly control, such as the 
energy from our core occupied 
offices, landlord activities, as well 
as the construction of new homes 
within our housing businesses and 
joint ventures.

Environmental system 
We manage our business 
in accordance with ISO14001 
certification.

Strategy

Additional information is provided on pages 6 to 18 of our Climate and nature report

Climate-related risks and 
opportunities 

We have integrated climate risk management into our overall risk management framework and are well placed to play a role in the 
decarbonisation of the economy. Our climate-related opportunities and risks and the time periods to which they are assessed are 
described on page 46.

Impact on our businesses, 
strategy and financial planning

Based on our scenario analysis, our business model is not expected to be significantly disrupted by climate change, however it does 
impact how we execute our strategy. As one of our six strategic growth drivers, we have built a three-pillar approach to address climate 
change: how we invest our assets, how we influence as an asset manager and how our businesses operate. Our proprietary model on 
climate change is used to quantify the potential impacts of climate change on our portfolio. Page 47 shows our key commitments and 
interim milestones under each of these pillars, and descriptions of our climate action statements.

Resilience based on scenarios, 
including a 2°C or lower 
scenario

Our climate scenario analysis helps us to identify and quantify the sources and magnitude of potential climate-related risks that will 
emerge as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy. We describe our resilience to these scenarios, including a 2°C or lower 
scenario, on page 48, and climate considerations are also highlighted in the Group Board viability statement on page 55.

Governance

Additional information is provided on pages 26 to 29 of our Climate and nature report

The Board’s role in oversight 

The Board is accountable for the long-term stewardship of the Group. It has delegated oversight of the management of climate-related 
risks to the Group Environment Committee (GEC). We describe the governance structure in more detail on page 47.

Management’s role in 
assessing risks and 
opportunities

We have appointed a Group Climate Director, who chairs the GEC, and we set out the senior managers’ responsibilities through the 
committees and overall risk and governance framework on pages 47 and 48. The link between executive remuneration and progress 
against climate commitments is set out in our Annual report on remuneration on page 106.

Risk management

Additional information is provided on pages 30 to 35 of our Climate and nature report

Processes for identifying and 
assessing climate-related risks

Climate risk management has been integrated into our risk and governance framework, our approach is described on pages 47 and 48. 
Scenario analysis is a key tool to assess the potential impacts from climate risk, referenced above and described on page 48.

Processes for managing 
climate-related risks

We deploy a range of management actions to manage our exposure to climate-related risks associated with our investments 
and operations, to meet our risk management objectives, including: an established framework for climate commitments; exclusions 
and high-carbon escalation; physical risk controls; review our existing tolerance framework to incorporate climate considerations; 
and active engagement.

How we integrate these risks 
into our overall risk 
management

The Group’s climate governance has been designed to ensure that the management of the financial risks from climate change 
are integrated across the whole governance system and embedded into the existing risk management framework.

Metrics and targets

Additional information is provided on pages 36 to 44 of our Climate and nature report

Internal metrics

Our metrics support our commitment to align with the 1.5°C ‘Paris’ objective, and our key sustainability performance indicators for 
managing the risks and opportunities from climate change are disclosed on page 44. We focus on our investment portfolio economic 
carbon intensity, implied portfolio temperature alignment and operational carbon footprint. We also measure our engagement with 
investee companies.

Greenhouse gas emissions

Our scope 1 and 2 (location) operational emissions were 27,722 tCO2e. Our scope 3 non-investment emissions (fuel and energy-related 
activities, waste, business travel, working from home and serviced offices) were 20,316 tCO2e. Our scope 3 downstream leased assets 
were 0.3 million tCO2e. Our scope 3 investment emissions were 5.0 million tCO2e. Additional metrics are disclosed on page 44.

Targets

We have set our climate targets across our three-pillar climate strategy to align with the ‘Paris’ 1.5°C objective. Our key climate 
commitments, and interim milestones are on page 47. Our Climate transition plan, issued in April 2023, is also available online.

Climate and nature-related opportunities and risks
While there are manifestly risks from climate 
change, the transition to net zero also creates 
opportunities. The table highlights material 
climate and nature-related opportunities and 
risks that Legal & General has identified.

The impacts of climate change are different 
across our businesses, reflecting the nature 
of each business. They are also likely to shift 
over time and we have assessed levels 
of impact as well as a time horizon to try 
to illustrate this.

Governance of 
environmental risks
The Board is ultimately accountable for 
the long-term stewardship of the Group.
Responding to climate change and addressing 
nature-loss and the opportunities and risks 
associated with these issues are of significant 
importance to the Board. Nilufer von Bismarck, 
a non-executive director, has a responsibility 
to give specific focus to climate change 
in her role. 

The Board has delegated oversight of the 
management of environmental risks to the 
GEC, through the Group Risk Committee, 
Executive Risk Committee and Group 
Management Committee. The GEC 
is responsible for providing strategic direction 
of the Group’s environmental response, 

including to climate change, with reference 
to the Group’s broader sustainability strategy.

Our Group Climate Director has responsibility 
for coordinating the Group’s response 
to climate change and incorporating nature 
and biodiversity opportunities and risks. 
The role has responsibility for ensuring that 
an appropriate strategy is in place to understand, 
identify, measure, monitor, control and report 
the opportunities and risks from climate change, 
in line with the risk strategy and risk appetite 
parameters set by the Board. The Group 
Climate Director also supports management 
in the development of appropriate processes 
to monitor and report exposures to the risks 
arising from climate change and in benefiting 
from strategic opportunities arising from 
climate change.

The GEC is chaired by the Group Climate Director 
with membership including: the Group CFO, Group 
HR Director, Group CRO, Group Corporate Affairs 
Director, LGRI CEO, LGC CEO, LGIM CIO and 
with the Head of LGIM’s Investment Stewardship 
team in attendance. The level of seniority 
in its membership and attendees helps ensure 
that there is a single forum to provide oversight 
on our response to environmental issues, 
ensures consistency, encourages debate 
and demonstrates the importance we place 
on our response to these issues.

Climate risk management
Our risk management approach to the financial 
risks arising from climate change reflects our 
climate strategy, the materiality of the exposures 
and how we operate. When assessing materiality, 
we consider both how the Group is affected 
by climate change, as well as the Group’s 
own impact on the climate.

The risks arising from climate change to which 
we are exposed to fall into three broad categories: 
transition risks, physical risk, and corporate 
risks. The risks from climate change and 
nature-loss are far-reaching, uncertain and 
broad-ranging. As much of our balance sheet 
is based on assumptions and expectations 
of future experience, risks can materialise 
through both actual change in experienced 
profits or losses, as well as changes in those 
future expectations. 

Climate risk management is integrated into 
our existing risk and governance framework 
and have carried out a detailed assessment 
of how we could expect climate risk to emerge 
across our business model. Given our business 
model (see page 12), we assess the most 
material financial risks from the potential impact 
of climate change on the value and credit rating 
of our assets.

Transition risks are primarily measured 
in relation to our carbon exposures, both for 
our operational footprint (scope 1 and 2), and 
of our investment portfolio GHG emissions 
intensity to align with the ‘Paris’ objective. 
We deploy a range of management actions 
to manage these exposures including: our 
established framework of climate commitments; 
exclusions and high-carbon escalation; 
physical risks controls; review of our existing 
tolerance framework; and active engagement 
with investees. 

Climate scenario analysis
Our scenario analysis enables us to assess how 
the impacts from climate change may emerge 
under a range of climate scenarios and time 
horizons. Our scenario analysis focuses on 
the financial risks from climate change, both 
physical and transitional risks, across our 
major risk categories of credit, longevity and 
market risk. We have developed four scenarios: 

Inaction (approximate warming 3 – 4°C) – failure 
to act means emissions continue to grow 
at historical rates
Below 2°C (approximate global warming of less 
than 2°C) – immediate ambitious policy and 
investment actions to address climate change
Net Zero 1.5°C (approximate global warming 
of 1.5°C) – immediate, highly ambitious actions 
to address climate change reduces emissions 
to net zero by 2050
Delayed Below 2°C (approximate global warming 
of less than 2°C) – policy and investment action 
to limit warming to well-below 2°C is delayed to 
2030 resulting in much more disruptive change.

Scenario results for our Group portfolio are 
produced for the three pathways which are 
based on transition risks (Below 2°C, Net Zero 
1.5°C and Delayed Below 2°C). We do not apply 
the inaction scenario to our portfolio. 
We expect most of the associated impact 
to be driven by physical risks, which tend to be 
highly localised and manifest further into the 
future and are hence more uncertain. As part 
of our assessment of viability we include the 
impact of the Group’s net zero ambitions, and 
the Group’s ability to adapt its operations and 
business strategy to address the financial risks 
arising from both the physical risk of climate 
change and the transition to a low-carbon 
economy. The Board regularly considers the 
potential financial and reputational impact 
of the Group’s principal risks, which includes 
failure to respond to the emerging threats from 
climate change for our investment portfolios 
and wider businesses.

The nature of our business means we have 
identified four broad mitigations to our 
transition risk exposure.

1.  Our exposure is largely through financial 

assets, many of which are listed, so we have 
significant flexibility to adapt by trading 
to the desired carbon position. This is the 
expected outcome should active 
engagement fail. 

2.  We hold mainly investment grade bonds, 

which are matched against liabilities such 
that we are not materially exposed to price 
risk compared to investors who regularly 
trade their bond portfolios or those holding 
greater exposures to equities. 

3.  We continue to carefully manage our 

balance sheet and our credit portfolio. 
We continually analyse our credit exposures 
and where appropriate, seek out 
opportunities to improve credit quality 
at attractive pricing levels. We have 
incorporated climate considerations within 
our credit and market risk management 
and expect these to develop over time. 
We manage our transition risk from climate 
change through setting our portfolio 
decarbonisation targets. These pre-emptive 
management actions are expected to reduce 
the credit risk of the portfolio and are 
expected to reduce the impact of the credit 
stresses presented in these scenarios. 
Our decarbonisation strategy also covers 
our equity portfolio. 

4.  The balance sheet is well-diversified across 
different sectors of the economy. Our initial 
assessment of our implied portfolio 
temperature alignment indicates that 
we do not have an over-weight allocation 
to the highest carbon intensity names within 
the market sectors.

report for additional information.

We remain committed 
to delivering on our

SDG contribution

A responsible business 
Our commercial success depends on a strong 
and economically resilient society in which 
companies act with integrity and responsibility. 
Legal & General is no exception. Our impact is 
far reaching, and strong business ethics 
are central to making that impact positive.

Governing our business in a responsible 
manner is part of our promise to stakeholders, 
including our employees. Therefore, we hold 
ourselves and our employees to high standards 
of conduct. Our culture is all-important, 
and it plays a role in attracting and retaining 
employees who have the skills and motivation 
to do excellent work for our stakeholders.

Diversity and inclusion (D&I)
Our commitment and strategy 
Addressing the challenges identified in our 
Group strategic growth drivers (see pages 10 
and 11) requires us to build a culture which 
fosters collaboration, constantly improves 
employees’ decision making, and moves 
quickly to solve problems in innovative ways. 
We believe that diversity of experience brings 
diversity of thought and perspective, which in 
turn drives greater proximity to customers, 
better-informed decisions, and a culture which 
more readily embraces innovation.

Our D&I strategy, which seeks to build such 
a culture, has been in place for two years. 
We have strong foundations, built on a much-
improved understanding of our people’s lived 
experience and of our organisational culture. 

Our focus 
Through our D&I strategy, we have committed 
to two outcomes: a more diverse workforce 
and a more inclusive culture. 

We have three strategic priorities: 

recruit and retain diverse talent 
• 
• 
invest in line manager capability
•  create opportunities for everyone 

at Legal & General. 

We measure our success by tracking data 
about the representation of minority or 
underrepresented groups at various levels 
of seniority in our business. We also use data 
from our listening programmes, such as our 
Voice survey, to inform our understanding. 

We have set certain representation goals 
which we publish externally. We believe that 
the actions taken to increase the diversity 
of our workforce will, in time, have the effect 
of progressively narrowing pay gaps because 
they are aimed at improving representation. 

For more on our strategy, objectives and 
performance, please see chapter six of our 
2023 Social impact report. 

Our goals 
We remain committed to our goals for 
improving representation of people from 
minority or underrepresented groups in our 
organisation. Importantly, this applies at all 
levels of the Company.

Our performance: pay gap data 
In 2023, we saw a slight widening of our 
median gender pay gap, from 22.4% to 23.6%, 
the first such year-on-year widening since 
we began to report pay gap data. We remain 
committed to a progressive narrowing 
of the gap as a consequence of our ambition 
of increased representation of women 
in senior roles. 

2023 saw us publish our ethnicity pay gap data 
for the first time. We have a negative median 
gap of -32.1%, meaning that the median pay for 
individuals from an ethnic minority background

We all have mental health, 
just as we do physical 
health. Throughout our 
lives, there are times 
where our mental health 
is in peak condition, and 
other times where we 
struggle. I’ve experienced 
both ends of this range – 
so I know just how 
important it is to feel 
supported and safe. I am 
committed to creating 
a culture where everyone 
at Legal & General has 
access to the support they 
need and someone to talk 
to when they need it.”

SDG contribution

Engaging and developing our people 
Engagement
Our work to build a strong culture is based 
on thoroughly understanding our people 
and involving them in shaping our Company. 
We do this in several ways, with the insights 
we gain informing the actions we take. 

• 

investing in our senior leaders via a new 
executive development programme called 
Leading through Connection

•  helping our people to develop their 

understanding and use of our behaviours, 
in support of our culture and of individual 
performance. 

During 2023, through our Voice survey, 
we requested feedback from our entire 
permanent employee base on two occasions. 
Voice measures employee sentiment 
on a range of issues and the data gathered 
are an important indicator of organisational 
culture. Employee satisfaction in September 
2023 was 79, up one point year-on-year and 
four points above the industry benchmark. 
This was based on a 79% response rate.

While there is always further progress to be 
made, overall the strong score in satisfaction, 
along with a score of 81 on ‘intent to stay’, 
were particularly reassuring given the challenges 
in attracting talent in current markets.

Please see pages 36 and 37 of our Social 
impact report for more information on how we 
engage our people, including information on 
collective bargaining arrangements, and more 
detail on the findings of our Voice surveys and 
other engagement mechanisms used in 2023. 

Development 
We are committed to providing our employees 
with opportunities to enhance their skills, 
enabling our business to stay competitive 
in a rapidly evolving world. Our approach 
to development is to enable employees 
to perform in their roles today, develop their 
skills for the future, and connect with the 
developmental content and experiences 
to help keep these skills relevant. 

Please see page 38 of our Social impact report 
for more information on our approach 
to learning and development. 

Employee wellbeing 
We are committed to protecting the physical, 
mental, financial, and social wellbeing of our 
employees. We want to create a healthy and 
safe organisation that brings together healthy 
people and healthy work, fostering a positive 
work culture, improving morale and benefiting 
both our people and our Company. 

We take our employees’ safety, wellbeing and 
ability to thrive at work extremely seriously. We 
recognise the importance of ‘psychological safety’ 
– creating a safe and open environment where 
people can be themselves – in achieving this.

Jeff Davies, our Chief Financial Officer, was 
named as our executive sponsor for wellbeing 
and mental health during 2021, with accountability 
for our strategy in this area. He remained in this 
role throughout 2023. 

During 2023, we developed a new strategy for 
employee wellbeing, based on the importance 
of resilience. We believe resilience forms the 
foundation of wellbeing and that one of the 
best ways we can support our people is by 
helping them to build and maintain their 
resilience. As a more resilient firm, we can 
respond to change faster while ensuring 
we continue to deliver for our stakeholders.

In 2023, we invested over £5.3 million in people 
development. We offer targeted development 
opportunities for all employees, for managers 
and for senior leaders. These are delivered 
through a blend of in-house and external 
training opportunities. 

Our strategy is based on data about our 
workforce’s needs, gathered through sources 
including employee surveys and sickness data. 
We use this to define our approach to promoting 
better employee wellbeing and in designing 
services and benefits for our people. 

We focused on: 

•  enhancing learning accessibility: simplifying 
our core programmes and making it easy for 
our people, regardless of location, to identify 
what’s relevant to them and how to access 
it. This included running sessions virtually 
and in-person and across multiple time zones
increasing our ‘in-the-moment-of-need’ 
learning offerings: providing easy access 
to content such as videos, top tips and 
how-to guides, which are quick to digest 
and simple to apply in order to help our 
people perform when they need it most 

• 

We continue to offer such services and benefits 
across mental, physical, social and financial 
wellbeing. A full list of these, as well as more 
detail on our wellbeing strategy, can be found 
on pages 39 to 41 of our Social impact report.

Health and safety
The operation of our core offices is managed 
through a health and safety system aligned 
with ISO45001 and our offices are audited 
by a leading health and safety consultancy. 
We have a well established and documented 
process for identifying health and safety 
hazards and risks, and responding to incidents 
and near misses. We continue to review and 
update our risk assessments, which are the

cornerstone of our management system. 
We also use our assessments to form policy, 
processes and guidance for our people.

Procedures and processes are reviewed regularly 
to ensure compliance with law and best practice. 
All employees are required to complete a health 
and safety training module. During 2023, we 
created a new strategy for health and safety, 
with a vision to ‘protect people and places and 
promote safer and healthier lives’. 

More detail on this strategy and the steps we are 
taking to implement it, along with data relating 
to health, safety and sickness, can be found on 
pages 42 and 43 of our Social impact report. 

Modern slavery and human rights 
As a leading financial services company 
and major global investor, we have a duty 
and commitment to uphold human rights 
throughout our operation and value chain. 
We have zero tolerance of labour abuses, 
including modern slavery. 

Our main annual disclosure on the issue 
of modern slavery and human rights is our 
modern slavery statement, which can be found 
on our corporate website. The statement 
covers, among other matters, how we assess 
modern slavery and human rights risk in our 
operations and value chain; the due diligence 
we perform; and our policies and practices. 

We are committed to maintaining high 
standards when it comes to the protection 
of human rights – including a commitment 
to play our part in eradicating modern slavery. 

We base our approach on standards set by 
various bodies, including the United Nations, 
the International Labour Organization, the 
Gangmaster and Labour Abuse Authority, 
the Living Wage Foundation and the Ethical 
Trading Initiative. 

In 2023, we undertook work in several areas 
to improve our management and mitigation 
of modern slavery and human rights risk. We:

• 

joined the UN Global Compact’s Modern 
Slavery Working Group, enabling us to 
undertake further training on this topic 
and learn from peers in the industry 

•  became a member of Unseen, a UK charity 

that supports survivors of trafficking 
and modern slavery as well as providing 
expert support

•  focused our activity on training; securing 

external counsel and support; and undertaking 
audits across our owned and managed 
sites, looking for evidence of any breaches 
of modern slavery and human rights. 

Please see our human rights policy and our 
2023 Modern slavery statement for more 
information about our approach.

Our supply chain 
We have a complex global supply chain and 
understand that our actions have far-reaching 
consequences. We recognise the importance 
of balancing financial considerations with 
promoting sustainability both within our 
operations and within our supply chain. 

Our procurement approach allows us to engage 
with our supply chain effectively and fairly, in 
a manner that manages risk and promotes value 
in the best interests of our customers, employees, 
regulators and shareholders. As part of that 
framework, our contracts set out the commercial 
and legal parameters of our engagements with 
our suppliers, including compliance with laws 
and regulations, and provisions to ensure 
continuity of services and the security of data.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out our 
ambition and defines how we expect our 
suppliers to play their part. The Code focuses 
on areas like wages, environment and climate 
change, human rights and modern slavery, and 
diversity, equity and inclusion. 

We continuously adapt our practices to align 
with evolving sustainability expectations and 
requirements. We modify supplier evaluation 
and monitoring processes to ensure compliance 
with our sustainability standards. This includes 
assessing suppliers’ environmental practices, 
labour conditions and adherence to human 
rights principles. Through regular audits and 
assessments, we aim to maintain a responsible 
and ethical supply chain.

For more information on how we manage our 
supply chain to promote sustainability, please 
see page 47 of our 2023 Social impact report. 

Anti-bribery and corruption 
We will not tolerate any person acting on behalf 
of the Group participating in any form of 
corrupt practice, including the acceptance, 
promise, offer or giving of anything that may 
be considered a bribe. Our financial crime risk 
policy applies across the Group and mandates 
that controls are put in place to prevent and 
detect such activity. 

Controls include an annual bribery and 
corruption risk assessment; regular training; 
due diligence measures; reporting of 
suspicions of bribery and corruption; and the 
control and approval of giving and receiving 
of gifts and hospitality, political and charitable 
donations, and corporate sponsorship.

Managing risk

Our risk management 
approach supports 
informed risk taking 
by our businesses.”

Chris Knight
Group Chief Risk Officer

Overview
Understanding the risks that we are exposed 
to and deploying strategies to ensure residual 
exposures remain within acceptable parameters 
is an integral part of our business. Our risk 
management approach supports informed risk 
taking by our businesses, setting out those 
rewarded risks that we are prepared to be 
exposed to, together with risk limits and required 
standards of internal control to ensure exposures 
remain within our overall risk appetite.

As well as managing financial and non-financial 
risks to our businesses, our risk framework 
considers broader factors including the delivery 
of good customer outcomes and the threats 
from climate change. In focusing beyond pure 
financial measures of risk, we enable our 
businesses to fulfil their social purpose. 

We seek to deeply embed the necessary 
capabilities to assess and price for those risks 
that we believe offer sustainable returns within 
each of our operating businesses, as well 
as ensuring the skill sets to closely manage 
those risk factors which could otherwise lead 
to unexpected outcomes.

Our straightforward, collaborative and 
purposeful behaviours underpin the operation 
of our risk framework, and support a culture 
of openness and transparency in how we make 
decisions and manage risks, balancing 
performance with principles to do what is right.

Our risk landscape

Risk appetite

The risks that are inherent in our business 
arising from:

• 
• 

• 

the products we write
the investments we hold to meet 
our obligations
the business environment in which 
we operate.

Our quantitative and qualitative 
expressions for the types of risk to which 
we are prepared to be exposed.

Alongside the minimum capital 
requirements that we wish to maintain and 
the degree of volatility of earnings we wish 
to avoid, we set a range of tolerances and 
limits for our material financial and 
non-financial risk exposures.

Risk management 
framework
Our formal framework for monitoring our 
risk landscape and ensuring that we are 
only exposed to those residual risks for 
which we have an appetite.

Our framework seeks to reinforce the 
parameters of acceptable risk taking, 
allowing business managers to make 
decisions and take opportunities that 
are consistent with our risk appetite.

Our risk landscape
Our risk landscape comprises asset, insurance, non-financial and 
strategic risks. Our largest risk exposures, measured by undiversified 
solvency capital, are to credit and longevity.

Asset risks 
Market, credit and counterparty risks arise from holding portfolios 
of assets, including property, to meet our obligations to our customers 
and to deliver returns to shareholders. Liquidity risks also arise from 
holding illiquid assets and from investment market conditions. Interest 
rates and inflation are also risk factors. 

Insurance risks
Longevity, mortality and other insurance risks are transferred to us 
by the customers of our PRT, individual annuities and protection 
businesses. The period that customers continue their policies is also 
important for profitability, as is our ability to control expenses in line 
with pricing assumptions. 

Credit risk largely arises in our portfolio of corporate bonds and 
within our direct investment portfolio. As an investor for the long term, 
assessing and managing credit risk is a core competency, and 
alongside setting a range of tolerances to diversify our portfolios, 
we seek to continuously track a variety of risk factors that could 
adversely impact credit markets.

Longevity risks arise in our PRT and retail annuity businesses. Over the 
years we have built significant expertise in understanding and pricing 
for longevity, with a range of disciplines including actuarial, medical, 
public health, statistical analysis and modelling. Mortality, 

morbidity and policy lapse are inherent risks to our protection 

businesses, which we assess and price for.

Our risk 
management 
approach 

 See page 54

Where our businesses directly engage in house building and 
property development, we are exposed to risks associated with 

the management of construction projects, including health and 
safety risks. Alongside construction-related risks, wider safety risks 
arise in the operation of retirement villages and our affordable homes 
businesses. The management of health and safety and the broader 
risks of building safety are an integral part of our wider risk framework, 
with expertise in risk management embedded across our business 
operating model.

We manage a diversified portfolio in which we accept risk in the normal course of 
business and aim to deliver sustainable returns on risk-based capital in excess of the 
cost of capital.
Monitoring metric: minimum return on capital over the planning cycle. 

We have an appetite for risks we understand and are rewarded for, and which are 
consistent with delivery of our strategic objectives. 
Monitoring metric: maximum risk-based capital to be deployed over the planning cycle. 

We aim to maintain an appropriate buffer of capital resources over the minimum 
regulatory capital requirements. 
Monitoring metrics: capital coverage ratios. 

We expect to be able to meet our payment and collateral obligations under extreme, 
but plausible, liquidity scenarios. 
Monitoring metric: minimum liquidity coverage ratio.

We have a low appetite for volatility of earnings; in particular volatility arising from risks 
where Legal & General has more exposure than the wider market. 
Monitoring metric: maximum acceptable variance in earnings compared to plan.

We manage our businesses to align with the mitigation of climate change and to be 
resilient to the risk of different climate outcomes.
Monitoring metrics: investment portfolio decarbonisation and operational footprint 
decarbonisation.

Non-financial and strategic risks
Non-financial risks arise in respect of our business processes 
and IT systems, as well as broader regulatory and legislative 
risks that can arise in the environments in which we operate. 
All our businesses have inherent exposure to non-financial risk. 

Our risk management and internal control framework seeks to identify 
areas of potential weakness that could otherwise lead to customer 
detriment, reputational damage or financial loss and ensure that 
appropriate measures are in place to mitigate adverse outcomes. 

Risk appetite

Strategy

Our risk appetite sets the ranges and 
limits of acceptable risk taking for the Group 
as a whole. We express our overall attitude 
to risk using the statements and measures 
in the table opposite. 

Beneath this, we set further risk tolerances 
covering our specific exposures to market, 
credit, insurance, and operational risks 
including, where appropriate, limits on 
concentrations and significant aggregation 
of risks. Our risk appetite is used to govern 
the nature and quantity of risks that we are 
exposed to. 

Whether we are making a direct property 
investment or pricing a PRT deal, we use 
our risk management framework to assess 
the risk profile and potential rewards 
to ensure we continue to operate within 
the ranges of acceptable risk taking that 
we have set.

Capital

Liquidity

Earnings

Climate

Reputation

We seek to treat stakeholders with integrity and act in a matter that protects and 
enhances the Group franchise.
Monitoring metric: reputation risk dashboard.

Compliance and 
conduct

We have no appetite for action that is likely to result in poor customer outcomes or 
regulatory non-compliance, however where this arises, we will address it quickly. We 
accept compliance and conduct risk can arise in the pursuit of strategic objectives, but 
we aim to minimise this as much as possible.
Monitoring metric: Consumer Duty outcomes and compliance with regulatory requirements.

How we report and review ongoing and emerging risks, and assess actual risk positions 
relative to the risk targets and limits that we set. 

Risk oversight

Review and challenge, by the Group and divisional chief risk officer teams, 
of how we identify and manage risk. 

Risk committees 

Our structure of Group-level Committees oversees the management of risks and 
challenges how the risk framework is working. The role of the Risk Committee is set 
out on pages 92 and 93.

Culture and 
reward 

Performance measures that focus on the delivery of effective risk management, 
business and customer strategy, and culture.

We operate a three lines of defence risk 
governance model:

•  first, our operating businesses are 

responsible for risk taking within the 
parameters of our risk appetite and 
accountable for managing risks in line with 
risk policies. The skills to assess and price 
for risk form part of our first line business 
management activity

•  second, our risk oversight function under 

the direction of our Group Chief Risk Officer. 
The team of risk professionals provides our 
businesses with expert advice and guidance 
on risk and capital management, alongside 
ensuring risk taking remains within 
acceptable parameters
third, our Group Internal Audit function 
provides independent assurance on the 
effectiveness of business risk management 
and the overall operation of our risk 
framework.

• 

Own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA)
Our ORSA process is an ongoing analysis 
of the Group’s risk profile and the sufficiency 
of capital resources to sustain our business 
strategy over the plan horizon. The process, 
which covers the whole Group, considers how 
the financial and broader business risks to 
which we are exposed may evolve over the 
planning cycle. Stress and scenario testing 
is an essential element of the ORSA process. 
It is used to show us how key risk exposures 
respond to different risk factors, together with 
the sensitivity and the resilience of capital and 
earnings to a range of extreme but plausible 
events. The stress testing component of our 
framework assesses the effect of a move in 
one or more risk factors at a point in time. 
The scenario element considers group-wide 
multi-year projections of capital and earnings 
across a range of downside conditions in 
financial markets, demographics and the 
broader economy. The ORSA process is 
integrated into our business risk and capital 
management activities and aligned with the 
strategic planning process to inform forward-
looking decision making. As such, it is a key 
business management tool.

Capital management 
Our risk-based capital model seeks to provide 
a quantitative assessment of the Group’s risk 
exposures. It forms part of the suite of tools 
we use to evaluate our strategic plans, set risk 
appetite, allocate capital and evaluate product 
pricing. Our model is also used to assess 
significant transactions, including large 
PRT deals.

Our principal risks
Our principal risks and uncertainties reflect those factors that may threaten the Group’s business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

Our risk landscape

Principal risks and uncertainties

Asset risks

Investment market performance and conditions in the broader economy may 
adversely impact earnings, profitability or surplus capital. 

In dealing with issuers of debt and other types of counterparty, the Group is exposed 
to the risk of financial loss.

We fail to respond to the emerging threats from climate change for our investment 
portfolios and wider businesses.

Insurance risks

Changes in experience, regulation or legislation may require revisions to our reserves 
and capital requirements, and could also impact our reported solvency position and 
dividend policy.

Non-financial and 
strategic risks

Failure to effectively implement financial services regulatory or legislative change 
in a timely manner could lead to regulatory censure, reputational damage and 
deteriorating customer outcomes.

New entrants and/or new technology may disrupt the markets in which we operate.

A material failure in our business processes or IT security may result in unanticipated 
financial loss or reputational damage.

The successful delivery of our strategy is dependent on the ability to attract and retain 
highly qualified professional people.

viability statement

Group Board viability statement
The Group’s strategy is developed, and 
economic decisions are made, around meeting 
the long-term protection and savings needs of 
its customers, and around creating long-term 
value for customers and shareholders over a 
period of many years. This reflects the Group’s 
business and investment models which 
combine managing credit, longevity and 
market risks over long-term relationships.

The Group’s long-term prospects
The Group’s prospects are primarily assessed 
through our strategic and planning processes. 
Performance against our annual strategic 
planning process is continuously monitored, 
and it underpins our business planning model. 
We consider the sustainability and resilience 
of our business model over the long-term, 
including the strategic growth drivers detailed 
on pages 10 and 11, and longer-term trends in 
areas such as technology and climate change, 
as our investment and insurance products and 
customer relationships are long-standing ones. 

The Group is also subject to regulation and 
supervision, which requires us to manage and 
monitor solvency, liquidity and longer-term 
risks, to ensure that we can continue to meet 
our policyholder obligations.

This long-term prospect assessment is over 
a longer period than that over which the Board 
has assessed the Group’s viability.

Period of viability assessment
While the Board has considered adopting a 
longer period, it believes that five years is the 
most appropriate time frame over which they 
should assess the long-term viability of the 
Group, as required within provision 31 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. The following 
factors have been taken into account in making 
this decision:

•  we have reasonable clarity over a five-year 

• 

period, allowing an appropriate assessment 
of our principal risks to be made
the assessment is underpinned by our 
business planning process, and so aligns 
to the period over which major strategic 
actions are typically delivered, and takes 
account of the economic environment and 
evolving political and regulatory landscape 
during the relevant period. 

Our business planning process is an annual 
process and culminates in the production and 
review of the Group’s business plan. Our plan 
is built up from divisional submissions, and 
considers the profitability, liquidity, cash 
generation and capital position of the Group. 
This projection process involves setting 
a number of key assumptions, which are 
inherently volatile over a much longer reporting 
period, such as foreign exchange rates, interest 
rates, economic growth rates, the continued 
optimisation of capital strategies for Solvency 
II, and the impact on the business environment 
of changes in regulation or similar events.

The Board carries out a detailed review of the 
draft plan during the Group Board’s annual 
strategy assessment, and amendments are 
made accordingly. Part of the Board’s role 
is to consider the appropriateness of any key 
assumptions made. The latest annual plan was 
approved in December 2023, resulting in our 
current five-year business plan.

How we assessed our viability
In making its assessment of viability, the Board 
has considered a number of factors, including 
but not limited to:

• 

•  a robust and detailed assessment of the 
Group’s risk profile and both material and 
emerging risks (see below for further detail), 
in particular those risks which could have a 
material impact on the Group’s future 
operations, financial conditions or regulatory 
expectations
the impact of various stress scenarios on 
both the Group’s viability (see further detail 
below), as well as the operational resilience 
of the Group
the stability of major markets in which the 
Group operates and material known 
regulatory changes
the sustainability of any future capital 
distributions
the impact of the Group’s net zero 
ambitions, and the Group’s ability to adapt 
its operations and business strategy to 
address the financial risks arising from both 
the physical risk of climate change and the 
transition to a low-carbon economy.

• 

• 

• 

The Board regularly considers the potential 
financial and reputational impact of the Group’s 
principal risks (as set out on pages 56 to 59) 
on our ability to deliver the business plan, and
we regularly review and refresh our principal 
risks to reflect current market conditions and 
changes in our risk profile. In its assessment 
of viability, not just long-term prospects, the 
Board has taken into consideration all of the 
Group’s principal risks, as any significant 
change in the risk profile or outlook of those 
principal risks, or inadequate mitigation, could 
have a significant impact on the Group’s 
viability over the assessment time frame.

Quantitative stress and scenario testing 
is undertaken to enable the Board to consider 
the Group’s ability to respond to a number 
of plausible individual and combined shocks, 
both financial and non-financial, which could 
adversely impact the profits, capital and 
liquidity projections in the Group plan. 
For example, during 2023, the Board 
considered the impacts of a severe market 
event. The severe market event was set with 
reference to the Bank of England’s latest 
‘Annually Cyclical Scenario’, but modified 
to reflect the Group’s underlying risk profile. 

The scenario is broadly based on the Global 
Financial Crisis of 2008 for market risks 
exposures and 2002 experience for rating 
transitions (downgrades and spreads).

The scenarios tested showed that the Group 
would continue to have sufficient headroom 
to maintain viability over the five-year planning 
period, after taking into account mitigating 
actions to manage the impacts on capital and 
liquidity. The Group maintains buffers and a 
suite of management actions to maintain 
resilience to adverse scenarios and preserve 
the Group’s viability. It is clearly possible that 
shocks could be more severe, occur sooner 
and/or last longer than we have currently 
considered plausible.

Additionally, reverse stress testing and 
contingency planning gives the Board a solid 
understanding of the Group’s resilience to 
extremely severe scenarios which could 
threaten the Group’s business model and 
viability. This analysis assists in identifying 
any mitigating actions that could be taken now, 
or triggers to put in place for future actions. 
Potential scenarios that were explored included 
severe capital market stresses, adverse 
regulatory changes, reputational and internal 
or external events causing falls in business 
volumes, and severely adverse claims 
experience. The results confirmed that the 
Group remains resilient to extreme stresses 
as a result of the risk management system 
in place and the diverse range of mitigating 
actions available, including raising of capital 
or reduction in the level of dividends.

Our conclusion on viability
Following this assessment, taking into account 
the Group’s current position and principal risks, 
the Board can confirm that it has a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities, as they 
fall due, over a viability horizon of five years. 
The Board’s five-year viability and longer-term 
prospects assessment is based upon 
information known today.

Principal risks and uncertainties

The directors confirm that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

The principal risks are set out below including details of how they have been managed 
or mitigated. Further details of the Group’s inherent risk exposures are set out at Notes 7 
and 15 to 17 of the financial statements.

Risk management

Outlook

Investment market performance and conditions 
in the broader economy may adversely impact 
earnings, profitability or surplus capital. 
The performance and liquidity of financial and 
property markets, interest rate movements and 
inflation impact the value of investments we 
hold in both shareholders’ funds and to meet 
the obligations from insurance business; the 
movement in certain investments directly 
impacts profitability. Interest rate movements 
and inflation can also change the value of our 
obligations and although we seek to match 
assets and liabilities, losses can still arise from 
adverse markets. Falls in the risk-free yield 
curve can also create a greater degree of 
inherent volatility to be managed in the solvency 
balance sheet, potentially impacting capital 
requirements and surplus capital. Falls in 
investment values can reduce our investment 
management fee income. 

In dealing with issuers of debt and other types 
of counterparty, the Group is exposed to the risk 
of financial loss.
Systemic corporate sector failures, or a major 
sovereign debt event, could, in extreme 
scenarios, trigger defaults impacting the value 
of our bond portfolios. Under Solvency II, 
a widespread widening of credit spreads and 
downgrades can also result in a reduction in our 
balance sheet surplus, despite already having 
set aside significant capital for credit risk.

We are also exposed to default risks in dealing 
with banking, money market and reinsurance 
counterparties, as well as settlement, custody, 
and other bespoke business services. Default 
risk also arises where we undertake property 
lending, with exposure to loss if an accrued debt 
exceeds the value of security taken.

We cannot completely eliminate the downside 
impacts on our earnings, profitability or surplus 
capital from investment market volatility and 
adverse economic conditions, although we seek 
to position our investment portfolios and wider 
business plans for a range of plausible economic 
scenarios and investment market conditions to 
ensure their resilience across a range of 
outcomes. This includes setting risk limits on 
exposures to different asset classes and where 
hedging instruments exist, we seek to limit our 
exposures on a financial reporting basis. 

Our ORSA process is integral to our risk 
management approach, and includes an 
assessment of the financial impacts of risks 
associated with investment market volatility 
and adverse economic scenarios for our 
solvency balance sheet, capital sufficiency, and 
liquidity requirements. 

We manage our exposure to downgrade and 
default risks within our bond portfolios, through 
setting selection criteria and exposure limits, 
and using LGIM’s global credit team’s 
capabilities to ensure risks are effectively 
controlled, where appropriate trading out to 
improve credit quality. In our property lending 
businesses, our loan criteria take account of 
borrower creditworthiness and the potential 
for movements in the value of security. 

We manage our reinsurer exposures tightly, 
with the vast majority of our reinsurers having 
a minimum A- rating, setting rating-based 
exposure limits, and where appropriate taking 
collateral. Similarly, we seek to limit aggregate 
exposure to banking, money market and service 
providers. Whilst we manage risks to our 
balance sheet, we can never eliminate 
downgrade or default risks, although we seek 
to hold a strong balance sheet that we believe 
to be prudent for a range of adverse scenarios.

The global economic outlook remains uncertain, with the 
potential for interest rates to remain at current levels for 
longer than anticipated by the markets, and longer than 
required to subdue inflation. This could lead to significant 
unintended damage to the broader economy, including 
a sustained period of low investment and growth, reduced 
consumer spending and higher unemployment. Our 
businesses are primarily exposed to the UK and US 
economies. 

Asset values, including commercial and residential property 
prices, remain susceptible to reappraisal should the current 
economic outlook deteriorate, as well as from a range of 
geopolitical factors including the ongoing war in Ukraine and 
conflict in the Middle East. Towards the end of 2023, 
commercial property markets stabilised to an extent and 
some confidence returned. Within our construction 
businesses’ supply chain, cost inflation and labour shortages 
continue to present risk. 

The risk of credit default increases in periods of low economic 
growth, and we continue to closely monitor the factors that 
may lead to a widening of credit spreads including the outlook 
for the real economy, and fiscal and monetary policy. 

Although real incomes in the UK have risen in 2023, any 
reversal of this would particularly impact economic activity 
in sectors reliant on discretionary spending. 

We remain vigilant, closely monitoring all the names or assets 
in our portfolio in the short term, as well as forming views 
on the medium to long-term outlook. Our credit portfolio 
remains 99% investment grade, and our office property 
lending continues to focus on high-grade assets let to 
investment grade or government tenants. 

Details of our credit portfolios are on pages 195 to 197.

Outlook

Changes in experience, regulation or legislation 
may require revisions to our reserves and 
capital requirements, and could also impact our 
reported solvency position and dividend policy. 
The pricing of long-term business requires the 
setting of assumptions for long-term trends in 
factors such as mortality, lapse rates, expenses, 
interest rates and credit defaults. Actual 
experience may require recalibration of these 
assumptions, changing the level of provisions 
and impacting reported profitability.

Regulation defines the overall framework for the 
design, marketing, taxation and distribution of 
our products, and the prudential provisions and 
capital that we hold. Significant changes in 
legislation or regulation may increase our cost 
base, reduce our future revenues, impact 
profitability or require us to hold more capital. 

The prominence of the risk increases where 
change is implemented without prior 
engagement with the sector. The nature of 
long-term business can also result in some 
changes in regulation, and the reinterpretation 
of regulation over time, having a retrospective 
effect on in-force books of business, impacting 
future cash generation. 

Changes in these areas can affect our reported 
solvency position and dividend policy. 

We undertake significant analysis of the 
variables associated with writing long-term 
insurance business to ensure that a suitable 
premium is charged for the risks we take on, 
and that provisions continue to remain 
appropriate for factors including mortality, 
lapse rates, expenses, valuation interest rates 
and credit defaults in the assets backing our 
insurance liabilities. 

We seek to have a comprehensive understanding 
of longevity, mortality and morbidity risks, and 
we continue to evaluate wider trends in life 
expectancy. However, we cannot remove the risk 
that adjustment to reserves may be required, 
although the selective use of reinsurance acts 
to reduce the impacts to us of significant 
variations in life expectancy and mortality. 

We actively engage with government and 
regulatory bodies to assist in the evaluation 
of regulatory change to promote outcomes that 
meet the needs of all stakeholders. To influence 
policy, our interactions with government and 
policy teams at regulators, include face-to-face 
and virtual meetings, written responses to 
discussion papers and consultations, ad-hoc 
communications and attendance at 
roundtables with industry peers. With our 
experience in various sectors, we can explain 
how proposed policy translates into practice 
and identify potential issues or unintended 
consequences that might arise. 

When such regulatory changes move to the 
implementation stage, we undertake detailed 
gap analysis work and depending on the scale 
of the work required, establish project 
management arrangements with first- and 
second-line teams working together. This is to 
ensure we deliver regulatory change effectively 
and efficiently, minimising disruption to our 
operations. 

We have seen continued elevated levels of mortality in both 
the UK and the US. The causes are unclear, but may reflect 
indirect impacts of Covid-19 related illness, and the deferral 
of diagnostics and medical treatments for other conditions. 
There remains continued uncertainty as to the impacts of 
“long Covid”. Continued cost of living pressures and 
government spending decisions also have the potential to 
affect mortality outcomes. 

Along with the emergence of new diseases and changes in 
immunology impacting mortality and morbidity assumptions, 
other risk factors that may impact future reserving requirements 
include significant advances in medical science leading to 
more effective treatments, beyond that anticipated, requiring 
adjustment to our longevity assumptions. 

Whilst at present we do not believe climate change to be a 
material driver for mortality and longevity risk in the medium 
term, we continue to keep this under review. 

Beginning 2024, the UK will enforce a 15% global minimum tax 
to multi-national firms, following OECD rules. Bermuda’s new 
Corporate Income Tax will be effective from 1 January 2025. 
The Group is expected to be liable to UK top-up tax in 2024 
and Bermuda corporate tax from 2025 on profits arising from 
its Bermuda reinsurance hub. We are actively working with 
relevant bodies on the implementation of these new 
legislations. 

Changes in capital standards, both in the UK and elsewhere, 
could impact our reported solvency position and dividend 
policy. 

Post-Brexit, the UK is reforming its capital regime to move from 
Solvency II to Solvency UK. The key changes are designed 
to enable annuity product providers to invest more broadly 
to diversify risk and support investment in the UK economy. 
A reduction in the risk margin took effect at the end of 2023, 
with reform of the matching adjustment due in 2024. We are 
actively engaging with the PRA on the new regime’s details 
and working to implement the required changes. 

The Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) revised its capital 
regime for life insurers in 2023, with changes effective from 
March 2024. The impact of the proposed changes on 
Legal & General’s business is expected to be modest. 

The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) 
is finalising the Insurance Capital Standards (ICS), a global 
minimum capital standard for Internationally Active Insurance 
Groups (IAIGs). The ICS is expected to be adopted end-2024. 
Legal & General, designated an IAIG by the PRA, has actively 
participated in consultations on the standard. If Solvency UK 
is considered as strong as the ICS, it may be used for ICS 
compliance and therefore would result in little impact on the 
Group. We will continue to engage with both the PRA and the 
IAIS during this period.

Outlook

We fail to respond to the emerging threats from 
climate change for our investment portfolios 
and wider businesses.
As a significant investor in financial markets, 
commercial real estate and housing, we are 
exposed to climate-related transition risks. 
Abrupt shifts in the political and technological 
landscape could impact the value of those 
investment assets associated with higher levels 
of greenhouse gas emissions. 

Physical risks, stemming from extreme climate 
outcomes, could impact the valuation of at-risk 
assets, for example floods could impact the value 
of our property assets; and could also potentially 
have longer-term effects on mortality rates.

We are also exposed to reputation and 
climate-related litigation risks should our 
responses to the threats from climate change 
be judged not to align with the expectations 
of environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
groups. Our risk management approach is also 
reliant upon the availability of verifiable 
consistent and comparable emissions data.

Failure to effectively implement financial 
services regulatory or legislative change in a 
timely manner could lead to regulatory censure, 
reputational damage and deteriorating 
customer outcomes. 
We are exposed to several risks where effective 
identification and implementation of regulatory 
changes are particularly important. These 
include changes relating to our management of 
operational risk, conduct risk, climate risk, and 
health and safety risk. The magnitude or scope 
of some regulatory changes can have a bearing 
on our ability to deliver our overall strategy. 

Regulatory or legislative changes can have 
a significant impact on our business. Such 
changes could limit our ability to operate in 
certain markets or sectors, potentially leading 
to a reduction in our customer base and 
revenue. 

There is a risk that regulatory policies could 
develop in a manner that is detrimental to our 
business and/or customers. Alternatively, 
it could develop in a way that presents 
opportunities, but we fail to revise our strategy 
and adapt quickly enough to benefit. 

Non-compliance with new regulations or 
legislation could potentially damage our 
reputation. This could lead to a loss of customer 
trust and result in regulatory sanctions. 

We recognise our scale brings a responsibility 
to act decisively in positioning our balance 
sheet in addressing climate change risks. We 
assess climate risks in our investment process, 
including in the management of real assets, and 
measure the carbon intensity of our investment 
portfolios. Along with specific investment 
exclusions for carbon intensive sectors, we 
have set overall reduction targets aligned with 
the 1.5°C ‘Paris’ objective. This includes 
defining near term science-based targets to 
support our long-term emission reduction goals 
in line with our Climate transition plan. 

We continue to develop how we incorporate 
the potential physical impacts of climate 
change on both assets and liabilities into our 
modelling and projections work, while also 
evolving our approach to include nature and 
biodiversity in our climate risk work.

Alongside managing exposures, we closely 
monitor the political and regulatory landscape, 
and as part of our climate strategy, we engage 
with regulators and investee companies in 
support of climate action. As we change how 
we invest, the products and services we offer, 
and how we operate, we are mindful of the need 
to have the right skills for the future.

Over the next decade, the change necessary to meet global 
carbon reduction targets will require societal adjustments on 
an unprecedented scale. The events of 2023, particularly the 
increasing frequency of record-breaking heat events and the 
extreme summer weather events experienced in the northern 
hemisphere, have demonstrated that the impacts of increased 
climate volatility can be significant and may emerge rapidly. 

If governments fail to ensure an orderly transition to 
low-carbon economies, it increases the risk of sudden late 
policy actions and large, unanticipated shifts in the asset 
values of impacted industries. Our Climate transition plan 
aims to minimise exposure to this risk, but its success 
is dependent on the delivery of the policy actions and the 
climate reduction targets of the firms we invest in. The 
actions governments take will also significantly impact our 
ability to meet our climate-related targets, and as the science 
of climate change evolves, we may need to adapt our actions. 
Anti-ESG sentiment, particularly within countries with a high 
dependency on fossil fuel-related industries, may also limit 
global efforts to address climate change and investment 
opportunities. 

Although a broad set of actions to limit global warming 
is underway, we are moving to a situation where the path 
to achieving a sub-1.5ºC temperature increase is becoming 
narrower. This could have an impact on our ability to meet 
the climate-related targets we have set ourselves. We expect 
a continuing and increased focus on nature and biodiversity 
risks going forward.

We identify, track and review the impact of 
regulatory change through our internal control 
processes, with material updates being 
considered at the Executive and Group Risk 
Committees and the Group Board. Our 
processes are designed to ensure compliance 
with all new and developing regulation. 

The volume and burden of regulatory change remains high 
across the sectors we operate in. We analyse, interpret and 
implement all relevant financial services legislation and 
regulation impacting our business units ensuring appropriate 
levels of governance and assurance. 

Key forthcoming developments in our risk areas include: 

We actively engage with appropriate regulatory 
bodies to ensure we maintain high standards 
of business and deliver for our customers. 

Operational risk: work is underway to comply with the UK’s 
new operational resilience rules by 31 March 2025 and similar 
developing rules in other jurisdictions.

In 2023, we successfully implemented the 
Consumer Duty for open products, with our 
work on legacy products well underway. 
We have also made progress on our 
implementation of the UK’s operational 
resilience rules which are due to come into 
force in March 2025.

We seek to influence the direction of travel on 
various regulatory policy themes at government 
and regulator level for the benefit of our 
customers and other stakeholders. We have 
advocated on the development of the Consumer 
Duty, pension reforms, sustainability and 
diversity and inclusion. 

Conduct risk: the FCA continues to focus on Consumer Duty, 
with closed book products in scope from 31 July 2024. 
Discussions are ongoing about the advice/guidance boundary 
and a proposal for ‘targeted support’ to close the advice gap. 
In 2024, new rules on diversity and inclusion in financial 
services are expected, likely leading to increased data 
collection, disclosure and reporting requirements. We 
maintain a focus on minimising the risks of financial crime 
for our customers and on our financial results. 

Climate risk: there are a variety of moving pieces in the 
development of climate regulation at the UK, the US and 
EU level. We anticipate more focus on scenario testing 
and scrutiny on sustainability claims following the FCA’s 
new anti-greenwashing rule and Sustainability Disclosure 
Regulations effective from 31 May 2024. We are awaiting 
the UK Green Taxonomy and implementation of International 
Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) disclosure standards. 

Health and Safety: we have enhanced our governance 
processes and developed a three-year strategy focusing on 
culture, quality, consistency, technology, and keeping pace 
with change. Registration requirements for the new Buildings 
Safety Act were met by the October 2023 deadline. 

Strategic risk: we continue to follow the development of the 
government’s Mansion House reforms and wider pensions 
reforms, such as the Pensions Dashboard work.

Outlook

New entrants and/or new technology may 
disrupt the markets in which we operate.
There is already strong competition in our 
markets, and although we have had 
considerable past success at building scale 
to offer low-cost products, we recognise that 
markets remain attractive to new entrants. 

We are also cognisant of competitors who may 
have lower return on capital requirements or be 
unconstrained by Solvency II. 

The continued evolution of AI has the potential 
to be a significant disrupting force across our 
businesses, for example by enabling new 
entrants to compete with potentially lower 
costs, and more efficient processes. The 
technology itself could have an impact on asset 
valuations, and on our liabilities including 
through its impact on the effectiveness of life 
sciences and health care systems.

We continuously monitor the factors that may 
impact the markets in which we operate, 
including evolving domestic and international 
capital standards, and are maintaining our 
focus on our digital platforms. 

We have responded to the rapid advancement 
and accessibility of generative AI capabilities 
from third parties by launching a central AI 
Accelerator programme. This initiative brought 
together colleagues across the Group to shape 
and incubate our generative AI approaches, 
raise awareness and educate our business, and 
deliver a secure environment for internal test 
and learn use cases. 

Our regulatory developments team keeps 
a close watch on the AI landscape across 
all our regulators. We are actively engaged 
in numerous consultations in relation to AI 
and generative AI.

A material failure in our business processes or 
IT security may result in unanticipated financial 
loss or reputational damage.
We have constructed our framework of internal 
controls to minimise the risk of unanticipated 
financial loss or damage to our reputation. 
However, no system of internal control can 
completely eliminate the risk of error, financial 
loss, fraudulent actions, or reputational 
damage. We are also inherently exposed to 
cyber threats including the risks of data theft 
and fraud and more generally, it is imperative 
that we maintain the privacy of our customers’ 
personal data. There is also strong stakeholder 
expectation that our core business services 
are resilient to operational disruption. 

The successful delivery of our strategy is 
dependent on the ability to attract and retain 
highly qualified professional people.
The Group aims to recruit, develop and retain 
high quality individuals. We are inherently 
exposed to the risk that key personnel or teams 
of expertise may leave the Group, with an 
adverse effect on the Group’s businesses. 

As we increasingly focus on the digitalisation 
of our businesses, we are also competing for 
technology and digital skill sets with other 
business sectors as well as our peers. 

Our risk governance model seeks to ensure that 
business management are actively engaged 
in maintaining an appropriate control 
environment, supported by risk functions led by 
the Group Chief Risk Officer, with independent 
assurance from Group Internal Audit. 

We continue to evolve our risk management 
approach to IT, operational resilience and data 
access and privacy.

Whilst we seek to maintain a control 
environment commensurate with our risk 
profile, we recognise that residual risk will 
always remain across the spectrum of our 
business operations and we aim to develop 
response plans so that when adverse events 
occur, appropriate actions are deployed.

We seek to ensure that key personnel 
dependencies do not arise, through employee 
training and development programmes, 
remuneration strategies and succession 
planning. 

Our processes include the active identification 
and development of talent within our workforce, 
and the highlighting of our values and social 
purpose, promoting Legal & General as a great 
place to work. As well as investing in our people, 
we are also transforming how we engage and 
develop capabilities, with new technologies and 
tools to support globalisation, increase 
productivity and provide an exceptional 
employee experience.

We observe a continued acceleration of a number of trends, 
including greater consumer engagement in digital business 
models and on-line servicing tools. In the current operating 
environment, businesses like ours have transformed working 
practices, and we anticipate further investment in automation, 
using robotics and machine learning to enhance business 
efficiency. We are deepening our understanding of the 
impacts of AI on our businesses and in the wider sector. 

Our businesses are also well positioned for changes in the 
competitive landscape that may arise from pensions-related 
changes. We welcome innovation in the market, such as the 
proposed roll out of defined benefit ‘superfund’ consolidation 
schemes, as long as the security of members’ benefits is 
prioritised. We may see alternative de-risking offerings 
coming to the market targeting a similar segment to 
superfunds.   

The pension dashboards initiative will also be a positive 
development. Legislation is being introduced in 2024 to make 
providing a qualifying pensions dashboard service a regulated 
activity, and it is likely we will see firms apply for this. 

On the ‘collective’ defined contribution reform, while we have 
seen limited demand for this to date, it holds the potential to 
disrupt both the workplace and retirement income market. 

We continue to remain alert to evolving operational risks and 
invest in our system capabilities, including those for the 
management of cyber risks, to ensure that our business 
processes are resilient. We also remain cognisant of the risks 
as we implement a new global operating model and IT 
platform for LGIM and have structured the migration 
in phases to minimise change risks. 

Competition for talent remains strong with skills in areas such 
as technology and digital particularly sought after across 
many business sectors, including those in which we operate. 

We also recognise the risks posed by the outlook for inflation 
in salary expectations across the wider employment market, 
and internally we have taken steps to help our employees 
through direct financial support and by providing advice and 
resources to help them manage their financial wellbeing.

Letter from the Chair

Our governance framework 
is the foundation upon 
which we remain confident 
in our decision making 
across the Group as we 
continue to navigate 
challenges presented by 
ever-changing market 
conditions.”

Dear shareholders,

Introduction
2023 has been another year where the Board’s 
role in monitoring and managing emerging 
risks in the macro-economy, and in markets, 
has been critical. The UK has continued to face 
a number of challenges and global market 
conditions have continued to be volatile during 
the period. Throughout this, Legal & General 
has remained robust and resilient, and we have 
much to be positive about going into 2024.

As a Board we remain confident in our strategy 
and in our ability to deliver resilient growth, 
supported by our strong competitive positioning 
in attractive and growing markets. Our strategy 
positions us well to navigate the prevailing 
market environment. We are confident we 
can continue to deliver profitable growth as 
we execute on our strategy and deliver on our 
purpose to improve the lives of our customers, 
create value for our shareholders and build 
a better society.

Our 2023 half year results were the first under 
a new accounting standard for insurance 
contracts. IFRS 17 was first conceived in the 
late 90s, but for most insurers significant work 
started in earnest in 2017. I would like to express 
my gratitude to everyone that contributed 

to the IFRS 17 programme across the 
Company. More detail on the implementation 
of this standard can be found in the Audit 
Committee report on pages 86 to 91.

As shareholders will be aware, in January 2023, 
Sir Nigel Wilson informed the Board of his 
intention to retire from executive life after 
14 years with Legal & General, 11 of those years 
as Group Chief Executive Officer. Nigel’s 
achievements over those years, and the 
leadership qualities he brought to the Company, 
are immense. Nigel has successfully navigated 
significant geopolitical changes as well as 
challenges in the regulatory and market 
environments of each of our core businesses 
and has steered the Group into a position of 
strength from which it can continue developing 
on behalf of its shareholders, customers and 
people. These achievements were rightly 
recognised, not only by Nigel’s knighthood, but 
also when we were voted Britain’s Most 
Admired Company by our fellow FTSE 100 and 
FTSE 250 companies last year. Under his 
stewardship, the Group has consistently 
delivered profitable, sustainable and inclusive 
growth. Nigel has been a tireless champion for 
investment-led growth and responsible 
investment. On behalf of the Board, I thank 
Nigel for his significant contribution and 
leadership of the Company and wish him well 
for the future.

Following Nigel’s decision to retire from 
executive life, the Nominations and Corporate 
Governance Committee led a rigorous, global, 
selection process which led to the appointment 
of António Simões, who joined us on 1 January 
2024. I look forward to working with António 
over the coming years. Further detail on the 
selection process can be found in the 
Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee report on page 81.

As a Board we continue to oversee and test the 
Company’s strategy. The development and 
delivery of that strategy falls to our executive 
colleagues, led by our new Group Chief 
Executive Officer, António Simões, our Group 
Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Davies, and the 
heads of our four business divisions: Laura 
Mason, Andrew Kail, Michelle Scrimgeour and 
Bernie Hickman, each in turn supported by their 
management teams.

They are highly effective, individually and 
collectively, and there were a number of major 
successes across the Company during the 
period, which you will read about throughout 
this report. Our divisions work best when they 
work together: Legal & General Capital (LGC) 
creates real assets to support the 
Legal & General Retirement Institutional (LGRI) 
buy-out deals and fund annuities.

(LGIM) helps clients de-risk in preparation 
for buy-out – the majority of LGRI clients have 
been LGIM clients first. We are also a UK market 
leader in Retail for life insurance, workplace 
pensions and retirement income, and our 
divisions continue to work together to drive 
synergies to help us maintain excellent customer 
service, competitive market positions and 
business growth. Our collegiate and collaborative 
approach is crucial for maximising opportunities.

I would also like to note the opening of Calon, 
our new office in Cardiff. ‘Calon’ translates 
to ‘Heart’ in English and was chosen as the 
preferred name in a vote by our employees. 
The development of Calon and the wider 
investment into the Central Square of Cardiff 
has drawn upon the input of many key 
stakeholder groups. In addition to surveying 
our own people to understand their 
requirements, Legal & General fostered close 
relationships with local partners, suppliers and 
communities throughout the development 
process to ensure that the investment in the 
office benefits the local community as well as 
our employees. The office has been designed 
to operate with a lower carbon footprint than 
a standard office and is a key milestone towards 
Legal & General’s commitment of achieving net 
zero carbon emissions from our occupied 
offices (where we control the management 
of utilities) by 2030. More information about 
Calon can be found on page 77.

Our approach to governance
As a Board, it is our role to promote the highest 
levels of corporate governance and ensure 
these values are embedded within our culture 
and throughout the organisation. As our 
business continues to evolve and as we pursue 
our strategic objectives in an ever-changing 
environment, our strong governance framework 
supports the Board in ensuring that across the 
Group we make decisions in the right way. 
The Board has worked closely with the executive 
team throughout the year as the business has 
continued to navigate the challenges presented 
by volatile market conditions to ensure our 
business can continue to flourish.

Ahead of 2024, a group-wide project was 
initiated which has led to the optimisation 
of our executive decision making across the 
Group through the implementation of a new 
executive governance framework, which took 
effect from 1 January 2024. More information 
on this new enhanced framework can be found 
on page 66.

For the year ended 31 December 2023, we were 
required to measure ourselves against the 
Code. The Board has considered carefully the 
requirements of the Code and I am pleased 
to report that we have complied with all 
provisions of the Code throughout the year. 

Further details on our compliance with the 
Code and how we have applied the various 
principles can be found on page 67.

Stakeholder engagement
As a Board, we are very focused on the impact 
that our business and decisions have on our 
stakeholders, as well as our wider societal 
impact. Our stakeholders are key to our 
decision making and it is hugely informative 
for us to hear the viewpoints from a variety 
of parties with an interest in the Company. 
We were able to conduct a number of 
face-to-face interactions this year, including 
site visits to our offices in Hove and Cardiff. 
I am always impressed during our Board site 
visits how evident our purpose is and how our 
values are demonstrated every day in ensuring 
we are doing the right thing for our customers. 
I would like to thank all of our colleagues for 
their significant contribution to our business. 
Through their roles as Designated Workforce 
Director and Consumer Duty Champion, 
non-executive directors Nilufer von Bismarck 
and Laura Wade-Gery have also conducted 
a number of meetings and site visits. We view 
these visits as an important way to meet with 
our partners and employees and experience 
Legal & General’s culture first hand.

We presented our Climate transition plan at our 
2023 AGM, and I was pleased this was supported 
by 97.7% of our shareholders. The Climate 
transition plan sets out our climate 
commitments and how we plan on achieving 
them. We spoke with a range of our major 
institutional investors about the plan who 
provided useful feedback during its development. 
Our Climate transition plan details how we are 
going to make our ambitions a reality, organised 
under three pillars: invest, influence and 
operate. It is important that we make our plans 
for addressing climate change public and 
ensure that our shareholders are supportive 
of them. More about our progress against 
the Climate transition plan can be found 
on page 43.

Board changes and succession planning
Legal & General continues to benefit from an 
outstanding Board with a diverse range and 
depth of expertise and skills.

The Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee spent a considerable amount 
of time this year focusing on executive 
succession planning, particularly in relation 
to the Group Chief Executive Officer. Each year, 
the Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee also considers the Board’s skills 
and experience to support discussions around 
non-executive succession planning, which 
once again was a focus for the Nominations 
and Corporate Governance Committee in 2023. 
In September 2023, Lesley Knox succeeded 

Philip Broadley as the Board’s Senior Independent 
Director. Philip remains a non-executive 
director of the Company and as a member 
of all five of its Committees. In February 2024, 
Laura Wade-Gery succeeded Lesley Knox 
as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. 
Lesley remains as a member of the 
Remuneration Committee. 

Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The 2024 AGM will be held on Thursday 23 May 
at 11am at the British Medical Association, 
BMA House, Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury, 
London WC1H 9JZ, once again in a hybrid 
format, with additional facilities for shareholders 
to join and vote electronically. Full details of the 
business to be considered at the meeting will 
be included in the Notice of Annual General 
Meeting that will be sent to shareholders 
by their chosen communication means and 
published on our website: group.
legalandgeneral.com/AGM.

Board effectiveness
During 2023, we conducted an external 
effectiveness review of our Board and its 
Committees. Following a tender process, 
Clare Chalmers Limited was appointed as the 
preferred provider to facilitate the review, which 
consisted of one-to-one interviews with Board 
members and observations at a series of Board 
and Committee meetings. The output of this 
review was considered by the Nominations and 
Corporate Governance Committee and the 
Board, and I am pleased to report that the 
conclusion was that the performance of the 
Board and each of its Committees continues 
to be highly-rated. Further details of the process 
and outcome of the external evaluation can be 
found on pages 84 to 85.

Conclusion
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my 
fellow Board members and colleagues at Legal 
& General for their dedication to the business 
and our customers. I have confidence that in 
the coming years Legal & General will continue 
to adapt, and grow, thanks to our greatest 
asset, our people.

The 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) – 2023 Compliance Statement 
The Code emphasises the role of good corporate governance in achieving long-term sustainable success. The principles of the Code are the 
standards against which we are required to measure ourselves. Each year, the Board reviews the Group’s governance framework and compliance 
with the Code. We are pleased to report that we have applied the principles and complied with each of the provisions of the Code for the year ended 
31 December 2023. A Code compliance reference table can be found on page 61. Following the publication of the 2024 UK Corporate Governance 
Code in January, the Board is in the process of conducting a gap analysis against the new requirements to ensure that we are in a position to comply 
from the relevant effective dates.

Our governance framework
Our governance framework supports robust decision making by providing a clear framework of delegations and responsibilities within which 
decisions can be made to deliver our strategy. Our framework also ensures that decisions remain within the risk appetite set by the Board and

Governance report

Role and leadership 
The Board is responsible for the overall 
leadership of the Group; it is charged with setting 
the Group’s values and standards. The role 
of the Board is to promote the long-term 
sustainable success of the Company, whilst 
simultaneously generating value for 
shareholders and contributing to wider society; 
how the Board achieved this throughout 2023 
is outlined in greater detail in our s.172 statement 
on pages 76 to 78. The Board is committed to 
maintaining the highest standards of corporate 
governance across the Group to support the 
delivery of our strategy, the fostering of positive 
stakeholder relationships and the creation of 
long-term sustainable value for our 
shareholders. 

The specific parameters of the Board’s role 
and responsibilities are set out in the Matters 
Reserved for the Board and are separated into 
eight categories: 

risk and internal control

•  strategy and management
•  structure and capital
•  financial reporting and dividends
• 
•  corporate governance
•  key personnel and remuneration
•  product distribution and pricing
•  brand.

The Matters Reserved for the Board outline the 
decision-making powers reserved for the Board 
and underpins the governance framework 
across the Group. It is reviewed and approved 
as part of an annual corporate governance 
review, and otherwise as required, to ensure the 
role and responsibilities of the Board remain 
appropriate and up to date. 

The Board, as well as the boards of the Group’s 
principal subsidiaries, operate within a clearly 
defined, and fully embedded, delegated 
authority framework. The delegated authority 
framework ensures that there is an appropriate 
level of Board oversight of, and contribution to, 
key decisions and that the day-to-day business 
is managed effectively. It also enables an 
appropriate level of debate, challenge and 
support in the decision-making process.

Those matters which are not reserved for 
the Board’s consideration are delegated 
by the Board to Group-level Committees and 
the Group CEO. The Board has delegated the 
day-to-day management of the Company, and 
the responsibility of the successful execution 
of the strategy, to the Group CEO. Throughout 
2023, the Group CEO, Sir Nigel Wilson, 
delegated further decision making onward 
to the Group Capital Committee, an executive 
decision-making forum, as well as to his direct 
reports. Following the appointment of António 
Simões as Group CEO on 1 January 2024, 
a new governance framework has been 
implemented. Further information on the 
changes is outlined on page 66.
Although the Board delegates the day-to-day 
management of the Company, it is accountable 
for the long-term sustainable success of the 
Company and must continue to oversee the 
Group’s strategic objectives and monitor 
performance against those objectives. 
The Board meets formally on a regular basis 
and at each meeting considers business 
performance, strategic proposals, material 
transactions and critical projects in the context 
of the Group’s strategy, risk appetite, the 
interests of the Group’s stakeholders and our 
wider social purpose. 

The Board is supported in its work by its 
Committees, each of which is governed 
by its own terms of reference, which clearly 
outline its remit and decision-making powers. 
The Committees of the Board, and their core 
responsibilities, are set out in the governance 
framework outlined on page 67, and each 
of the respective Committee reports on pages 
79 to 119.

Composition, independence, and 
effectiveness 
As at the date of this report, the Board 
is comprised of the independent non-executive 
Chair, two executive directors and nine 
independent non-executive directors. At least 
half of the Board, excluding the Chair, are 
independent non-executive directors, in 
accordance with provision 10 of the Code. 
Upon appointment, the Chair was identified 
by the directors as being independent 
in accordance with provisions 9 and 10 
of the Code.

When considering the appointment of new 
directors, the Board is mindful of the 
contribution and skillset that each new 
appointee will bring to the Board; the Board 
has an established skills matrix which supports 
Board succession planning. The Board 
continues to focus on maintaining a well-
balanced and diversified Board, with the right 
mix of individuals who can apply their wider 
business knowledge and experiences to the 
setting and oversight of delivery of the Group’s 
strategy. More information on the Group’s 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy can be found 
on pages 82 and 83.

In January 2023, Sir Nigel Wilson announced 
his intention to retire from his role as Group 
CEO after over a decade in the role. Following 
a rigorous, global, selection process managed 
by the Chair, António Simões was appointed 
as Group CEO with effect from 1 January 2024. 
Prior to joining Legal & General, António was 
CEO of Banco Santander Spain and Regional 
Head of Europe, and previously spent 13 years 
at HSBC in various roles including CEO of UK 
and Europe and CEO of Global Private Banking. 
António strengthens the Board’s experience 
having worked across complex, global 
organisations and brings a formidable 
leadership track record at the most senior level 
of financial services. António will help ensure 
that Legal & General continues to deliver on its 
enormous potential for its shareholders, 
employees, customers and the communities 
of which it is a part, through his executive 
leadership and strategic direction. More 
information on the Group CEO appointment 
process can be found on page 81. 

A board effectiveness review is conducted 
on an annual basis. In line with the 
requirements of the Code, this review was 
externally facilitated in 2023. As part of this 
review, board dynamics and board decision-
making, including non-executive directors’ 
engagement, constructive challenge and 
contribution to board discussions, is assessed. 
Throughout the year, there were no concerns 
as to the operation of the Board or management 
of the Company.

Further information relating to the external 
effectiveness review can be found on pages 
84 to 85.

Conflicts of interest and time commitment 
The identification and management of Board 
members’ conflicts of interest is defined and 
governed by the Company’s Articles of 
Association, law and regulation, best practice 
and a number of internal policies which are 
reviewed and approved by the Board, as part 
of an annual corporate governance review. 
When identifying and managing any potential 
rise in conflict of interest, a record is maintained 
for each Board members’ disclosed directorships 
and appointments. In the instance of an actual 
or potential conflict of interest arising, if the 
Board authorises said conflict, a formal record 
is maintained as part of the Company’s records 
and would be declared at the start of each 
relevant meeting and noted within the minutes 
of the meeting, as stipulated and governed 
by our directors’ conflict of interest policy. 
To ensure accurate records, on an annual basis, 
Board members are required to formally 
approve and sign their conflicts of interest 
register, thereby confirming that all 
directorships and appointments contained 
within are accurate and up to date. 

All non-executive directors’ letters of 
appointment outline the time commitment 
expected of them throughout their tenure 
on the Board. At times, their commitment may 
be required to go beyond that set out in the 
letter of appointment. The time commitment 
is reviewed regularly. External commitments, 
which may have an impact on existing time 
commitments, must be agreed in advance with 
the Chair and approved by the Nominations 
and Corporate Governance Committee, acting 
under its delegation from the Board. As part 
of the external appointments approval process, 
each director’s time commitments are assessed 
in detail. The significant commitments of each 
director are detailed in their biographies 
on pages 64 to 65.

Non-executive directors’ time commitments 
are considered by the Nominations and 
Corporate Governance Committee as part 
of its ongoing assessment of the Board’s 
composition. Upon review, the Committee 
assesses the directors’ commitments to the 
Company alongside their other significant 
commitments to ensure that they continue 
to be able to fulfil their duties to the Company. 
Where the Committee approved new external 
appointments, it was satisfied that they did not 
give rise to a conflict of interest and would not 
impact the directors’ time commitment to the 
Company. In line with our conflicts of interest 
policy, directors absent themselves from any 
discussions relating to their own internal or 
external appointments. 

The Board, on the recommendation of the 
Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee, is satisfied that each non-executive 
director serving at the end of the year remains 
independent, effective and continues to have 

sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities 
to the Company. Upon making new appointments 
to the Board, prospective candidates are 
expected to devote sufficient time to fulfil their 
responsibilities and duties to the Company and 
to do so by acting with integrity, leading by 
example and promoting the desired culture. 

The Chair’s commitments were considered 
on appointment, are regularly reviewed, and 
are assessed robustly whenever he proposes 
to take on an external appointment. In June 
2023, the Chair took up the roles of chair at 
Barclays UK PLC and non-executive director 
at Barclays PLC. The Nominations and 
Corporate Governance Committee, led 
by the SID, carefully considered these external 
appointments and determined that, given the 
length of the Chair’s tenure at the Company 
and significant experience, he was capable 
of balancing the time commitments and any 
potential conflicts, and overall the new roles 
would be additive to the Chair’s experience, 
and accordingly, to the Company. Thus, the 
Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee was comfortable that the Chair 
is able to devote sufficient time to the Company. 

Diversity and inclusion (D&I) 
At Legal & General, we are building an inclusive 
culture that celebrates diversity and creates 
fair opportunities for everyone. Diversity 
is important to the Board, and the Group 
as a whole, because it generates a wider pool 
of talent by reflecting the broadest range of 
human attributes, experience and backgrounds, 
whilst simultaneously supporting good decision 
making and reducing the risk of groupthink.

It is important for our Board to have a broad 
range of insights and perspectives to help 
us make better decisions as a business and 
create an inclusive culture for our people. 
All appointments to the Board are based upon 
an impartial gap analysis of knowledge, skills, 
experience and diversity across the Board 
as a whole. This gap analysis is routinely 
conducted to review the composition of the 
Board and make relevant recommendations 
for any changes; it also takes account 
of succession plans to ensure a sustainable 
pipeline of diverse board talent.

D&I continues to be an area of focus for both 
the Board and the Nominations and Corporate 
Governance Committee. For more information 
on the Board’s commitments to D&I, please visit 
our Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee report on pages 80 to 85.

Our purpose and culture 
The Company’s three core ‘behaviours’ embody 
our values and reflect the belief that it’s not just 
what we do that is important, but how we do it. 
Together we are: purposeful, straightforward 
and collaborative. 

70

Legal & General Group Plc Annual report and accounts 2023

Governance

These behaviours are the foundations of our 
long-term sustainable success and define how 
we do what we do. Throughout 2023, we have 
reshaped the way we assess our performance 
culture and reinforced a balance between 
the ‘what’ in terms of our achievements, and 
the ‘how’ in terms of demonstrating our core 
behaviours whilst achieving our goals. 
This approach not only helps us to further 
enhance our performance culture, but also 
to ensure our core behaviours are embedded 
into the way we do what we do.

The Board regularly receives updates on the 
Voice survey which provides insights into 
employee satisfaction. The surveys include 
questions on purpose, values and culture 
to enable the Board to understand whether 
these areas are aligned to the three key pillars 
used to measure satisfaction; engagement, 
culture and productivity, and enablement. 

As well as reshaping the way we assess 
and measure performance against our core 
behaviours and values, in September we 
sought to achieve further insight into what 
it is like to work as part of the Company, 
by seeking views directly from our employees 
globally. This qualitatively complimented the 
findings from our Voice survey and enabled 
a deeper understanding which was not led 
or constrained by questions in a survey, but 
instead facilitated via a forum for employees 
to communicate their views, in confidence. 

Throughout the year, the Board attended site 
visits across our UK offices, which enabled 
our directors to meet with our employees and 
gain insights into our culture and behaviours 
in action. In addition, Board members meet 
with smaller groups of employees to speak 
directly with them, both with and without 
management present, and hold town hall 
events to answer questions from employees. 
The executive management team also held 
numerous town hall events at various locations 
throughout the year to update the workforce on 
topical issues. Employees are offered the 
chance to ask the management team questions 
throughout these sessions. These events are 
run as hybrid events to maximise engagement.

Subsidiary boards 
At Legal & General we have benefited from 
a strong governance framework operating 
at subsidiary level for many years now. 

Henrietta Baldock and Lesley Knox continue 
in their roles on the board of two of our principal 
operating subsidiaries: Henrietta as Chair of 
Legal and General Assurance Society Limited 
(LGAS) and Lesley as non-executive director 
of Legal & General Investment Management 
(Holdings) Limited (LGIM(H)). George Lewis 
was also appointed as the Chair of Legal and 
General Assurance (Pensions Management) 
Limited in February 2024, having been 
a member of the board since April 2022. 
This crossover of directors on our Group Board, 
principal and other key subsidiary boards 
allows greater interactions, information flows 
and promotes enhanced collaboration.

Induction, training and development 
The Board places great value on training 
and development, and all new non-executive 
directors are invited to participate in a 
comprehensive, formal and tailored induction 
programme upon joining the Board. Induction 
programmes provide new directors with the 
knowledge and understanding of the Company 
and its business to enable them to provide 
effective contribution to Board discussions, 
effectively challenge the executive and properly 
fulfil their statutory duties. 

Following his appointment as Group CEO, 
António received a comprehensive and tailored 
executive director induction to the Board. 
All Board members receive regular training 
throughout the year; the Board believes that 
continual director training and development 
is important to maximise the effectiveness 
of the Board and ensures the Board can 
effectively challenge the executive. The training 
programme is generated on an annual basis, 
based on the needs of the Board, and internal 
and/or external circumstances, including any 

recommendations from the annual evaluation 
of the Board and its Committees. It is the 
responsibility of the Chair to help ensure 
directors continually update their skills, 
knowledge and familiarity with the Group, and 
the Chair does so with input from the Board 
and the Group Company Secretary. In 2023, 
the Board received specific training on various 
topics, including cyber security, biodiversity 
and AI. In addition, Board and Committee 
meetings are regularly used to update the 
Board on developments in the areas in which 
the Group operates, and specific training 
sessions for directors are scheduled for key 
topical issues. As part of their ongoing training 
and development, Board members are invited 
to attend site visits to the Group’s various 
offices, developments and investments, with 
the aim of widening Board members’ knowledge 
of the business, gain first-hand insights and 
to provide Board members with the opportunity 
to meet personally with our employees. 
Throughout the year, site visits were carried out 
at our offices in London, Hove and Cardiff, as 
well as individual director visits to Solihull.

The Board meets 
regularly to oversee the 
delivery of the Group’s 
strategic objectives to 
ensure it continues to 
promote the long-term 
sustainable success 
of the Company.

How the Board spent its time in 2023 
The Board meets regularly to oversee the 
delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives 
to ensure it continues to promote the long-term 
sustainable success of the Company. 
Throughout 2023, the Board held 10 Board 
meetings, including one strategy event, and 
one additional site visit. Board Sub-Committees 
were also constituted on a number of occasions 
in order to deal with particular matters arising 
outside of the formal schedule of meetings: 
a Sub-Committee was constituted during the 
year to oversee and closely manage the Group 
CEO search process. The non-executive 
directors have private meetings without the 
executives present before and after each Board 
meeting, and otherwise as required. 

This is reflected in the Board agendas 
throughout the year, which are set by the 
Chair, with input from the Board, and consist 
of regular reports on the following discussion 
areas:

•  updates from the Group CEO, the Group CFO 
and the Chair of each of the Committees
•  updates from key business divisions on 

business performance and progress against 
strategy, key business initiatives, customer 
and employee engagement, the control 
environment and culture

•  discussions on strategic ambitions, material 
transactions and other material initiatives, 
to ensure alignment with strategic 
objectives

•  updates about meetings held between 
directors and key regulators, such 
as the FCA and PRA
implementation of the Consumer Duty and 
a greater board focus on customer outcomes
risk and compliance matters, including 
regular updates on whistleblowing 

• 

• 

•  audit matters, including IFRS 17 

• 

considerations
legal and governance matters from 
the Group General Counsel and Group 
Company Secretary

•  people, culture, and employee engagement 

matters, including updates from the 
Designated Workforce Director and updates 
on the results of the employee Voice survey 

•  ESG, climate and sustainability 

• 

considerations
the Group’s relationship with various 
stakeholder groups. For more information 
on the Board’s stakeholder engagement 
throughout the year, see pages 76 to 78.

Board members meet informally with the 
executive directors and Group Management 
Committee on a regular basis outside of the 
formal meeting schedule. Members of the 
Group Management Committee and, as 
appropriate, individuals from the relevant 
business areas are also invited to attend Board 
meetings in relation to key items, allowing the 
Board the opportunity to debate and challenge 
initiatives directly with the senior management 
team, along with the executive directors.

The Board informs itself of the views of 
shareholders on a regular basis through 
updates from the Group CEO and Group CFO, 
as well as an update from the Chair following 
his annual schedule of investor meetings. 
Where relevant, Board Committee Chairs also 
hold meetings with investors.

The Board has established the Company’s 
purpose, values and strategy, and has satisfied 
itself that these and its culture are aligned.

I was honoured to 
receive the Instant 
Impact Award at the 
2023 Legal & General 
Awards, and have this 
presented to me by one 
of our non-executive 
directors. It was a 
fantastic opportunity 
for all nominees 
and winners to meet 
and integrate with 
the Board.”

Employee engagement 

On behalf of the 
Board, I will 
continue to listen 
to our people.” 

Nilufer von Bismarck
Designated Workforce Director

It’s clear that Nilufer 
is passionate about 
collaboration and our 
unique partnership with 
Unite. She has had a 
positive impact on 
the business and our 
members, particularly 
around Diversity and 
Inclusion and Wellbeing.”

Pam Edwards 
Head of Unite

Elevating employee views
There is a standing item at each Board meeting 
to discuss my activities as Workforce Director 
since the last meeting and to provide relevant 
feedback. During 2023, I reported against the 
programme and discussed relevant issues 
and any potential responses or changes.

Not all issues required discussion at the Board 
and so I decided in each case whether it was 
more appropriate to raise issues with the 
relevant member of the executive team and 
then report to the Board on any action taken.

The key focus was always to ensure that 
what mattered most to our people was 
communicated and, where appropriate, 
addressed, whilst providing our people with 
transparency of relevant Board activities.

My role
The wellbeing of our employees is a key priority 
for the Board and we recognise that our success 
is driven by our people. As Workforce Director, 
I engage with, and listen to the concerns of, our 
employees. I seek to support our people by 
representing their views to the Board and 
finding ways to address the issues I uncover.

At the end of 2022, with input from both 
employees across divisions and the Board, 
we established my 2023 programme for 
engagement with our people based around 
three pillars:

•  Diversity and Inclusion and Wellbeing
•  Collaboration
•  Growth.

These pillars are relevant to all areas 
of the business and align with the priorities 
established by wider management. Engagement 
with employees during 2023 was structured 
around these pillars and we tracked the impact 
and outcomes of my engagement.

Some of my 2023 activities
My relationships with Unite and the Management 
Consultative Forum (MCF) are key. Through 
these bodies, I can gather the views and 
concerns of a range of employees at a variety 
of grades across the Group. During 2023, I met 
with representatives from both organisations 
every quarter.

For each business division, I received regular 
updates on Diversity and Inclusion, Wellbeing 
and on the Voice survey results and actions 
being taken following such results. This links 
to my 2023 programme pillar of Diversity 
and Inclusion and Wellbeing, but also to 
Collaboration as I have been able to share best 
practices across different parts of the business.

I have participated in various events across 
the business, such as the Women in 
Business & Finance panel, LGC’s ‘Grade 5 
forum’ and the summer internship induction 
programme, all supporting the focus on Growth.

Through meeting people at our business 
locations in Barnsley, Cardiff, Chicago, 
Frederick, Hove, London, Solihull and Stamford, 
I have been able to focus on issues specific 
to business areas and location, building 
on all three pillars of my programme.

Voice
I interrogate the Voice survey data to 
understand how our people feel and this 
is discussed by Board members at the 
Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee, together with any appropriate 
actions to take in response. Employee 
satisfaction is at 79%, and work is underway 
to improve this even further in 2024. 

2024
On behalf of the Board, I will continue to listen 
to our people, provide feedback, and, where 
relevant, implement changes through wider 
management and the Board. 

In 2024, my priorities as Workforce Director 
will again be aligned with the Board and wider 
management’s focus. I will continue to focus 
on Diversity and Inclusion and Wellbeing, and 
Collaboration, whilst Growth will evolve to 
Performance and Capability. I will build my 
interactions with employees around these 
pillars, complemented with analysis and 
understanding of the results of employee surveys. 

We are grateful for the 
regular forum with 
Nilufer to raise issues 
impacting management-
level employees and 
have been able to shape 
approaches to benefits 
and internal policies.”

Section 172 statement and 
stakeholder engagement 

Statement on Section 172 
of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’)
Section 172(1) of the Act requires directors 
to act in the way they consider, in good faith, 
would be most likely to promote the success 
of the Company for the benefit of its members 
as a whole, and in doing so, have regard 
to a non-exhaustive list of factors to ensure 
that the broader implications and interests 
of stakeholders are considered in their 
decision-making. 

The Board recognises the importance of 
nurturing its positive relationships with its key 
stakeholders and is committed to maintaining 
strong engagement with them. The Board 
believes that this engagement provides 

meaningful insights into the views, priorities 
and issues facing its key stakeholders which 
can then be considered as part of the Board’s 
strategic decision-making and planning. 

The Board has reflected on its engagement 
mechanisms throughout 2023 and concluded 
that they remain effective and have provided 
the Board with a comprehensive understanding 
of the interests of its key stakeholders. 

A summary of the Board’s major decisions 
and activities during 2023 can be found below. 
This, combined with our key engagement

            Key employee engagement 

in the year

Following the announcement of the 
appointment of António Simões as 
Group CEO Designate, effective from 
1 January 2024, a new group-wide 
CEO edition of the employee Voice 
survey was launched in preparation 
for António’s arrival. The survey invited 
employees to share their feedback 
on working at Legal & General which 
was shared directly with António upon 
his appointment. 

Major decisions and activities during 2023

The following examples of major decisions and 
activities during the year illustrate how the Board 
considers different stakeholders’ interests 
in its decision making and how this supports the 
implementation of the Group’s long-term strategy 
and its strategic growth drivers (as set out on pages 
10 and 11).

We believe that major decisions are those that are 
both material to the Group and to its key stakeholders. 
Whilst not all decisions affect every stakeholder 
group, the Board and its delegated decision-making 
forums endeavour to balance the sometimes 
conflicting needs of our stakeholders to ensure 
that all are treated consistently and fairly.

Approval of a £2.7 billion buy-in with 
the British Steel Pension Scheme

The Board approved a final buy-in policy with the 
British Steel Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), 
totalling £2.7bn, under which the remaining 40% 
of liabilities was insured. This was the final 
transaction in a series of four phased buy-ins to 
fully insure the £7.5bn of the Scheme’s liabilities, 
securing the benefits of all circa 67,000 retired 
and deferred members. In doing so, the Scheme 
became the largest pension scheme in the UK 
to have fully insured all its members’ benefits. 

This transaction demonstrates our expertise in 
pensions de-risking and our commitment to 
helping schemes find solutions to secure pension 
commitments against a backdrop of ageing 
demographics.

At the core of these transactions, and to insure 
benefits at this scale, Legal & General 
developed strong relationships with the 
Trustees’ sponsoring company, the Scheme’s 
in-house teams and advisors and brought 
together expertise across Legal & General. 
These transactions signal a successful 
continuation of our long-term, collaborative 
relationship with the Scheme.

Through rigorous board review and decision 
making, and a series of well-timed transactions, 
the Scheme capitalised on volatile markets and 
strong decision making to capture attractive 
pricing and achieve the Trustees’ and Sponsors 
objective of full insurance. 

For more information on the Group’s 
institutional retirement business, please visit 
pages 29 to 31. 

 Customers

Circa 67,000 members will benefit from the security 
that Legal & General provides to their pensions. 
As populations live longer, their pensions last 
longer too. By delivering on a carefully considered 
and well-established plan, we helped the Trustees 
and sponsoring company of the Scheme secure 
the benefits of their members for the long-term 
– far faster than initially anticipated. 

 Regulators

We continue to maintain strong and positive 
regulatory engagement with the Prudential 
Regulation Authority and we provided updates 
on the transaction through our periodic 
pipeline reporting.

 Shareholders

This transaction has helped us to deliver 
another strong result for our pension risk 
transfer business and create long-term value and 
strong returns for our shareholders.

The development and residency 
of our new Cardiff office, Calon

. 
Throughout the year, the Board was updated on 
the £475 million regeneration project in Cardiff’s 
Central Square, which included the development of 
Calon, our new Cardiff headquarters. Our aim was 
to create a workplace with sustainability, wellbeing 
and our purpose of inclusive capitalism at its core. 
By October 2023, all of our Cardiff based colleagues 
had been successfully relocated to Calon, bringing 
our people and our Company into the heart of the 
investments we’re making in the city, and their 
long-term future.

To celebrate the opening of Calon, our Group CEO, 
Group CFO, Group HR Director and Retail CEO 
joined employees and community stakeholders 
for an official ‘opening ceremony’ to celebrate 
our new home for our circa 2,500 people in Wales. 
In November, the Board held its strategy event 
at Calon and combined this with an interactive site 
visit to experience the new office for themselves 
and to meet with colleagues.

As part of this, the Board held an in person 
town hall and invited all colleagues to join. 
Updates were provided on diversity and 
inclusion within the Board, emerging risks 
and opportunities and Consumer Duty. 
Employees were invited to ask a range 
of questions and provide their feedback 
on their new working environment.

Calon has been designed for sustainability, 
wellbeing and inclusivity. The new office has 
been developed using a climate-focused 
approach and represents the delivery of our 
socially responsible investing agenda and 
our continued relationship with all of our 
stakeholders. It is hoped that Calon will drive 
an evolution on how cities are suitably 
designed to be sustainable, long-term.

The development of Calon is the result 
of a £475 million investment by Legal & General 
into the regeneration of Cardiff’s Central 
Square, run in partnership with Cardiff Council, 
the Welsh Government and Rightacres. 
It demonstrates our commitment to investing 
in the real economy and forms part of our wider 
£1 billion investment in Cardiff in recent years.

 Employees

Engaging with our employees throughout the 
planning and development stages of Calon has 
supported our inclusive company culture whilst 
understanding what is important to them 
in a hybrid working environment. Our workforce 
is vital to our success. To help us understand the 
views of our employees, we engaged through 
formal and informal channels; the name of the 
new office ‘Calon’ – Welsh for heart – was chosen 
in a vote by our employees. 

  Communities and 
envi  ronment

Calon meets the highest standards in sustainable 
design. There is no gas in the building, and it can 
generate its own electricity from solar panels 
and air source heat pumps. It has achieved 
a BREEAM Outstanding rating and is also 
targeting Nabers UK 5-star. With over 3,000 living 
plants and natural lighting throughout, it has 
occupants’ wellbeing at its core. 

Suppliers

In line with our commitment to inclusive 
capitalism, we utilised local suppliers and 
products throughout the development process 
where possible, to further improve the social 
impact the building delivers.

The Board oversaw the development of our 
science and technology real estate joint venture 
with Bruntwood SciTech, the leading property and 
innovation services provider in the UK, including 
a new partnership with Greater Manchester 
Pension Fund (GMPF), the UK’s largest local 
government pension fund, securing £500m 
of additional investment.

We’re bringing a fresh injection of capital which 
reinforces our commitment to investing 
purposefully in the real economy. The long-term 
vision for our joint venture with Bruntwood SciTech 
is to provide the infrastructure that businesses and 
the public sector need to thrive and to provide the 
UK’s regional cities with the capacity they need to 
support future growth.

Opportunities exist to export our investment 
expertise internationally to support our global 
ambitions. The success of Bruntwood SciTech 
has paved the way for the expansion of our UK 
business model to the US market with Ancora 
L&G, where we believe there is significant 
potential for further growth.

For more information on the Group’s capital 
investment business, please visit pages 32 to 34.

  Communities and 
environment

We are committed to creating and supporting 
thriving cities and our joint venture with Bruntwood 
SciTech has enabled us to work with cities and 
universities to create modern science 
infrastructure. The growth of the Bruntwood 
SciTech partnership through the introduction 
of GMPF supports the delivery of a significant 
long-term investment project that is economically 
viable and bolsters innovation strategies and 
regeneration of towns and cities in the UK. 

At Bruntwood SciTech’s core is the drive to invest 
in an innovation backbone for the UK. The new 
capital will be used to expand and redevelop 
existing science and technology campuses and 
city centre innovation hubs, delivering additional 
world-leading lab and office space in the UK 
across a secured 3.6m sq ft development pipeline.

The investment supports the drive to regenerate 
towns and cities in the UK, helping to create 
highly skilled jobs, increase productivity and 
drive wage growth, while supporting the UK’s 
target to become a global science and 
technology superpower by 2030.

Other information

I am pleased to present my second report 
as the Chair of the Data and Technology 
Committee. During the year, the Committee’s 
remit evolved to include oversight of 
Legal & General’s data strategies. This is an 
important area of focus for Legal & General 
as we recognise the opportunities that can 
be derived from data. This change has enabled 
the Committee to become a more forward-
looking and strategic forum to drive innovation. 

The Committee’s focus during the year has 
been around four key themes: control & risk; 
capability & capacity; strategy & innovation; 
and change delivery. These themes have 
allowed the Committee to explore technology, 
data and cyber in depth and has created an 
environment where these key strands can be 
brought together to support the Board in 
seizing technological and data opportunities 
and overseeing the challenges presented by 
technology and cyber. The Committee is 
supported by an executive level technology and 
security governance framework. This framework 
has provided greater oversight of, and allowed 
the Committee to place greater reliance on, the 
Group’s executive-level governance arrangements. 

During the year, the Committee has focused 
considerably on data as it becomes an 
increasingly important element of our 
business. Data touches every application, 
process and business decision we make. 
We have an ambition to become a more data 
driven and insight led organisation, and to 
do this, we need to ensure data is treated 
as a highly valuable and strategic asset. 
The Committee also spent time focusing 
on how divisions can collaborate to drive 
greater efficiencies and capabilities. In October, 
we concentrated on this from a people and 
capabilities’ perspective. This was a useful 
exercise as it highlighted some shared 
challenges and opportunities across the Group 
and recognised that the different markets 
in which our businesses operate demand 
different skill sets, experiences and capabilities 
to meet their divisional needs. I have been 
pleased to see the formation of a technology 
leadership community across the Group which 
is bringing together these shared challenges 
and opportunities.

As Artificial Intelligence continues to embed 
into society, the Committee will continue 
to discuss and oversee its associated 
opportunities and challenges. 

Committee overview
Committee meetings 
and membership
The Committee met 4 times during the 
year. The Committee is composed 
entirely of independent non-executive 
directors. As well as the Committee 
members, the Group CEO, the Group

Technology Officer are expected to 
attend each meeting. The Committee 
is advised by an independent Cyber 
Security Advisor and an independent 
Information Technology Advisor who 
attend each meeting and provide key 
insights into industry trends and advice 
on the evolution of our technology, data 
and cyber strategies.

of the Remuneration Committee, as well as the 
Senior Independent Director, as part of our 
commitment to, and support of, the FCA’s 
targets on board diversity as set out in the 
Listing Rules. 

The external Board effectiveness review was 
another key area of focus this year for the 
Committee. Further information on the process

governance framework and compliance with 
the Code. The Company has complied with all 
provisions of the Code throughout the year. 
Further details of the Group’s corporate 
governance framework, including compliance 
with the Code, can be found on page 67.

Appointment of our new Group Chief Executive Officer 
Upon recommendation from the Committee, the Board appointed António Simões as our new Group Chief Executive Officer with effect from 
1 January 2024. António’s appointment followed a rigorous, global selection process managed by a Sub-Committee of the Nominations and 
Corporate Governance Committee, led by the Chair. A summary of the process is outlined below.

Talent management  
and succession planning

The Committee annually reviews and assesses the executive talent pipeline to ensure there is a pipeline of credible 
and capable successors for executive management, including for the role of Group CEO.

1.  Constitution of Sub- 

Committee to manage  
and oversee the process

A Sub-Committee of the Committee, led by the Chair, was constituted to provide direction and Board oversight of the Group 
CEO succession planning process. 

2.  Engagement with  
executive search  
firm and creation  
of role specification

The Sub-Committee engaged with independent external search firm Russell Reynolds. Russell Reynolds has no other 
connection with the Company or its directors and is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search 
Firms. Russell Reynolds was chosen for its significant depth in insurance and financial services more generally, a track 
record of focusing on diversity, and a strong leadership team who would challenge the Board on its thinking on candidates.

The Sub-Committee worked with Russell Reynolds to devise a role specification, which was approved by the Board. 

3. Candidate long lists

The search firm produced a diverse long list of candidates which was reviewed, thoroughly discussed and refined 
by the Sub-Committee. The long list included internal candidates and best-in-class external talent. In reviewing the long 
list, the Sub-Committee was mindful of diversity, including of background and experience, as well as the desired skills 
and attributes for the role as set out in the role specification.

4.  Candidate short  

list and interviews

All candidates on the long list were interviewed by the Sub-Committee, following which a short list of final candidates 
was produced. All shortlisted candidates were assessed against the role specification, on merit and with due regard 
to all forms of diversity. The final candidates were interviewed by the full Committee, which included a presentation from 
candidates. In addition, they underwent psychometric testing, and references were taken on the external candidates.

5.  Candidate  
selection

6.  Candidate  

appointment 
and approval

Induction

Following shortlisted candidates’ presentations and interviews, the Board discussed each candidate in detail, 
taking into account all elements of the search process. Following this discussion, it was agreed that António 
was the outstanding candidate. 

The Committee unanimously recommended to the Board the appointment of António Simões as the next Group CEO, 
subject to regulatory approval, and the Board duly approved the appointment. The Remuneration Committee led 
on the development of an appropriate remuneration package. António was interviewed by the PRA and FCA as part 
of the approval process, and approval for his appointment was granted in October 2023.

A comprehensive, tailored induction programme was undertaken by António upon appointment, led by the Chair and the 
Group Company Secretary. This included a focus on the markets and regulatory regions in which the Group operates, as 
well as meetings with all senior management, key external stakeholders, and undertaking site visits to the Group’s offices 
in the UK and globally.

and counsel. Lesley was considered by the 
Committee as the outstanding candidate 
for the role of SID due to her length of tenure, 
strong understanding of, and experience 
in dealing with, the Group and its various 
stakeholders from her roles as Remuneration 
Committee Chair, Designated Workforce 
Director and her role on the board of one 
of our principal subsidiaries. 

Board composition 
The Committee undertakes a rigorous annual 
review of the Board’s composition to support 
discussions on succession planning. This 
includes a capability assessment of Board 
members’ knowledge, skills and experience 
in the context of the Company’s short and 
medium-term strategy, supported by a 
self-assessment analysis undertaken by each 
individual director, which forms part of an overall 
Board skills matrix. The skills matrix reflects 
the results of the assessment. The skills matrix 
is refreshed and reviewed on an annual basis 
and is used by the Committee to support 
discussions on succession. Various other 
considerations, including the tenure of the 
Board as a whole, independence and diversity, 
are also considered by the Committee when 
reviewing the Board’s composition. 
The outcome of the 2023 discussion on 
composition was that, overall, the Board was 
of an appropriate size and composition, with key 
succession plans having been executed over 
the course of the year. The upcoming focus for 
the Committee will be succession planning for 
the Chair and non-executive directors who will 
be coming to the end of their tenure. 

The Committee also considered 
reappointments of directors to the Board, and 
directors’ external appointments to the boards 
of other companies. Where the Committee 
approved new external appointments, it was 
satisfied that the appointments did not give rise 
to a conflict of interest and would not impact 
the directors’ time commitment to the 
Company. In line with our conflicts of interest 
policy, directors absent themselves from any 
discussions relating to their own 
reappointment, chair appointment or other 
internal or external appointments. 

Other board changes 
The Committee considered and approved 
the following board composition changes 
throughout the year.

Being mindful of the time commitment for 
Lesley to take on the role of SID, Laura 
Wade-Gery succeeded Lesley as the Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee in February 
2024. The Committee considered Laura an 
excellent candidate due to her established 
track record as a UK-listed company 
Remuneration Committee Chair and her strong 
understanding of the Committee’s current 
workings and short- and medium-term 
priorities. Laura fulfils the Code requirement 
for any appointee to the Remuneration 
Committee Chair role to have served on 
a Remuneration Committee for at least 
12 months prior to appointment. Having 
discussed Laura’s internal and external time 
commitments, the Committee considered that 
Laura has sufficient time to dedicate to the 
Remuneration Committee Chair role.

Executive succession and talent management 
In addition to reviewing the Board’s 
composition, throughout the year the 
Committee has focused on executive-level 
succession across near- to long-term time 
horizons to ensure there is a credible pipeline 
of successors for executive roles. 

Subsidiary succession 
The Company benefits from a strong 
governance framework operating at subsidiary 
level. The continued strength of the boards of 
the Group’s subsidiaries is vital for ensuring the 
Group’s high standards are maintained and 
there is sufficient oversight of activity further 
down the Group, particularly in our principal 
subsidiaries. While succession planning 
remains the responsibility of each subsidiary 
board, it is nevertheless very important for the 
Committee to have continued oversight of its 
key subsidiaries and ensure orderly succession 
plans are in place. In addition, I meet regularly 
with the non-executive directors of our principal 
subsidiary boards, without the presence of 
executive management, to gain direct 
feedback. 

Following the 2022 and 2023 discussions on 
board composition, Lesley Knox succeeded 
Philip Broadley as SID in September 2023. 
As a result of this change, the Company now 
complies with the FCA’s targets on board 
diversity to have at least one of the following 
senior board positions held by a female: Chair, 
Chief Executive, SID or Chief Financial Officer. 
Philip remains a member of the Board and we 
continue to benefit from Philip’s experience 

Appointments to the Group’s principal 
subsidiaries are made on the recommendation 
of the Committee. This year the board of one of 
the Group’s principal subsidiaries, Legal and 
General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS), 
approved the appointment of Andrew Kail as its 
new CEO, following regulatory approval, on the 
recommendation of the Committee. Andrew 
succeeded Sir Nigel Wilson who held the LGAS 
CEO role (in addition to the Group CEO role)

until his retirement in December 2023. In making 
its decision, the Committee highlighted 
Andrew’s knowledge and understanding of the 
Group and the LGAS business, having run the 
Group’s PRT business for the last two years 
as well as previously running the Group’s Retail 
Retirement division, meaning that Andrew was 
well-placed to take on the role. 

Diversity and inclusion (D&I) 
D&I across the Group 
As a Group, we are working towards a more 
equitable workplace where all our people can 
realise their potential. We believe that diversity 
of experience and skills brings diversity of 
thought and perspective, which in turn drives 
greater proximity to our customers and 
promotes a culture which more readily 
embraces innovation. 

Last year, we set ourselves deliberately 
challenging ethnicity goals across the Group 
in order to expand the scope of our D&I agenda 
and to complement existing goals for gender. 
These goals are for 17% of our workforce, 
senior management roles and Board members 
to be from minority ethnic backgrounds by 
2027. During 2022, we built these new goals 
into group-wide and divisional D&I plans, 
including key operational areas like recruitment. 
As a Group we have made good progress on 
achieving our ethnicity goals by 2027, and good 
progress on our employees’ voluntary 
disclosure of ethnicity data. However, we are 
aware that faster progression is required to 
achieve our gender diversity goals, particularly 
achieving 40% female leadership at the senior/ 
middle management level, and we continue to 
explore areas of opportunity to achieve this. 

Throughout 2023, the Committee received 
regular updates on the progress against the 
group-wide and divisional D&I plans and the 
following key D&I focus areas: 

•  embedding the progress made in 2022, 

including inclusive recruitment, improving 
line manager capabilities and the creation 
of opportunities for those from 
underrepresented backgrounds

•  evolving the D&I governance and operating 
model across the Group by increasing 
transparency, reducing duplication and 
elevating the voice of our employee 
networks 

•  holding leaders and line managers 
to account on diversity matters. 

The Committee continues to support the work 
of the executive management and the D&I 
Council in driving the D&I agenda across the 
Group. For more information on our group-wide 
D&I activity during 2023, including our progress 
on achieving our objectives, please see page 49 
of this report.

D&I of the Board 
As a Committee, we believe that diversity is 
important as it supports good decision making 
and reduces the risk of groupthink by providing 
different viewpoints, ideas and challenge. 
As part of this, we believe that it is important 
for our Board to be diverse in terms of gender, 
ethnic and social backgrounds and have a broad 
range of perspectives to help us make better 
strategic decisions and lead by example in 
creating an inclusive culture for our people. 

Lesley Knox was appointed as SID in September 
2023. This appointment reflects our commitment 
to gender diversity in senior board positions 
and complies with the FCA’s targets on board 
diversity as set out in Listing Rule 9.8.6(9)(a)(ii), 
that at least one of the following senior board 
positions should be held by a female; Chair, 
Chief Executive, SID or Chief Financial Officer.

We are proud to have a Board which is diverse, 
both in terms of gender and ethnicity. As at 
31 December 2023, the Board comprised 42% 
women, and 25% of the Board was from an 
ethnically diverse background. Both of these 
percentages exceed regulatory requirements, 
the targets in the FTSE Women Leaders Review 
(Hampton-Alexander) and Parker Review, as 
well as the goals we set ourselves in our Board 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy. The Board is also 
compliant with the board diversity requirements 
in the Listing Rules and discloses its compliance 
in the prescribed format below.

When making appointments to the Board, the 
Committee only engages executive search 
firms that are signatories to the Voluntary Code 
of Conduct for Executive Search Firms which 
promotes gender diversity and best practice for 
corporate board searches.

Listing Rule disclosure on diversity 

D&I of senior management 
A diverse senior leadership team is as important 
as a diverse Board, because we believe that 
executive decision-making is more effective if 
it takes into account a wider range of views and 
opinions. Last year we introduced a new goal of 
17% of our senior management roles to be held 
by people from minority ethnicity backgrounds 
by 2027. During 2023, we are pleased that our 
hiring rates for minority ethnicities are trending 
positively, increasing our confidence in our 
ability to achieve our 2027 goals. 

We continue to monitor the progress of our 
gender diversity goals of 40% female leadership 
by 2025 and a 50:50 gender balance across the 
workforce by 2025. We have made good 
progress on the representation of women over 
the last 5 years, particularly in some of our 
most senior roles, however the pace of change 
has been slow. As a result, focus on areas of 
opportunity for this particular segment of 
employees, such as optimising incentives, 
job-sharing and job design, continues. 

Board D&I Policy 
During the year, the Committee reviewed and 
approved the Board Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy, which complements the Group’s wider 
workforce policies and values on D&I. 
The Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets 
out the approach to diversity and inclusion 
of the Board of Legal & General Group Plc, 
and its Committees, in compliance with the 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
(DTR). As a business, we have a clear purpose 
to improve the lives of our customers, build 
a better society for the long term and create 
value for our shareholders. Inclusive capitalism 
lies at the heart of our business strategy and 
is built on the belief of being economically and 
socially useful, embracing diversity and being 
fully inclusive in everything we do. As part of 
the policy, the Board, upon recommendation 
from the Committee, has committed to building 
a diverse and inclusive Board and a more 
diverse and inclusive senior management 
team, as well as driving diversity and inclusion 
across the Group. 

From 1 January 2024, we implemented a new 
executive governance framework. The Group 
Management Committee was formed as a 
formal committee of the Group CEO. As at 
31 December 2023, our Group Executive 
Committee (which existed under our previous 
governance framework) comprised 40% 
women*, with 50% of our businesses led by a 
female CEO. Also at 31 December 2023, 
representation at the middle/ senior 
management level was 37.2% women (2022: 
38%). We are eager to increase the ethnic 
diversity of senior management across the 
Company, which is why we have set ourself the 
goal of 17% by 2027 – we are currently at 17.3% 
for this constituency. 

More information on the diversity of our workforce, 
including the gender and ethnic diversity of our 
Board and executive management, can be found

Assessing board and committee effectiveness

Another role of the Committee is to oversee the 
annual Board and Committees’ effectiveness 
review. In line with best practice, a formal and 
rigorous review of the effectiveness of the 
Board and its Committees is conducted each 
year. The Board and its Committees undergo 
a full, independent external evaluation every 
three years, and an externally-facilitated 
internal evaluation on all other years. This year, 
in line with the requirements of the Code, the 
effectiveness review was undertaken by an 
independent, external board effectiveness 
review specialist. 

Following a robust tender process conducted 
by the Chair and Group Company Secretary, 
upon the Committee’s recommendation, the 
Board approved the appointment of Clare 
Chalmers Limited as the independent external 
reviewer to conduct the 2023 evaluation. Clare 
was chosen due to her specialism in financial 
services firms. Clare Chalmers Limited has no 
other connection with the Company or 
individual directors. 

The process, findings and resulting actions 
from the 2023 effectiveness review of the 
Board and its Committees can be found in the 
diagram below across pages 84 and 85. Clare 
had the opportunity to comment on these 
disclosures. 

Chair and individual director 
performance evaluations 
The SID leads the non-executive members 
of the Board in an annual evaluation of the 
performance of the Chair, which includes an 
assessment of the working relationship 
between the Chair and the Group CEO. In 
carrying out the annual evaluation, the SID 
meets with the non-executives without the 
Chair present and takes into account the views 
of the executive directors, as appropriate. 
Following this year’s review, the effectiveness 
of the Chair continued to be highly-rated.

The Chair meets with Board members 
throughout the year to assess their individual 
performance. Following this year’s review, and 
the insights gained from the external facilitator, 
the Chair confirmed that the individual 
directors’ continued to contribute effectively 
to the Board.

Process

Document review and 
meeting observations 
Clare and her associates 
conducted a thorough 
review of previous Board 
and Committee papers, 
minutes and other relevant 
documentation to provide 
context on Board matters 
and the decision-making 
process, to help inform the 
one-to-one interviews. 
Following this review, Clare 
observed a series of Board 
and Committee meetings 
to enable her to form an 
independent view of the 
meeting dynamics.

Scoping
Clare met with the Chair and 
Group Company Secretary to 
agree the scope of the 2023 
effectiveness review. This 
included the objectives of the 
review and the key areas of 
focus. The agreed aim of the 
review was to assess the 
effectiveness of the Board, both 
as a collective unitary Board and 
at Committee level. The review 
focused on, amongst other things: 

•  board composition, 
including diversity

•  succession planning for 
the Board and senior 
management

•  board dynamics, board 

decision-making and how 
effectively members work 
together to achieve objectives
•  strategy, performance and risk
•  purposes, values and culture
•  stakeholder considerations. 

Interviews
Clare held in-depth 
one-to-one interviews with 
Board members covering 
a broad range of topics, 
as agreed with the Chair 
and the Group Company 
Secretary. The topics for 
consideration were shared 
with the Board members 
prior to their individual 
interviews. Clare also 
interviewed certain 
members of senior 
management, including 
the Group Chief Risk 
Officer, Group HR Director, 
Group Chief Auditor and 
Group Company Secretary, 
to bring useful insights 
on the performance of 
the Committees and an 
overall holistic view of 
effectiveness. Discussions 
with all interviewees 
remained confidential. 

4

Report
Clare produced an 
initial, draft report on 
her independent review 
findings, which she 
discussed with the Chair 
and Group Company 
Secretary in the first 
instance. Clare then 
presented a final written 
report to the Committee 
and invited discussion on 
the report’s findings and 
recommendations. 
No views were attributed 
to any individual in the 
final report.

Update on previous board evaluations 
In 2021 and 2022, internal reviews of the performance of the Board and its Committees were undertaken, externally facilitated by Ffion Hague at 
Independent Board Evaluation (IBE). IBE has no other connection with the Company or individual directors. At each board meeting, an update on 
progress against the review recommendations is provided. An overview of the recommendations from the 2022 review and progress against them 
is provided below.

Recommendations from 2022 review

Progress against recommendations

Continuing the practice of ‘top down’ risk 
discussions and ‘lessons learnt’ exercises

Ensuring that strategy papers continued to be 
forward-looking

Continuing to prioritise stakeholder impacts 
and views

‘Lessons learnt’ exercises continued to be requested and presented to the Board and its Committees 
throughout 2023, including lessons learnt in relation to the LDI crisis and data security and privacy. 
The Group Chief Risk Officer now presents an annual update on emerging (‘top down’) risks to the Group 
Risk Committee.

The Board strategy papers continued to be reviewed by the Group Strategy & Investor Relations Director 
and Chair at an early stage to ensure papers were sufficiently ‘forward-looking’. Throughout the year, 
divisional CEOs provided the Board with assessments of macro-economic changes applicable to their 
divisional businesses and the potential strategic and operational impacts.

Following a review by Group Secretariat, new board paper and coversheet templates were rolled out across the 
Group during 2023; these templates now require paper authors to specifically include information on wider 
stakeholder impacts in their papers for the Board’s consideration, including nature and climate. In addition, 
the Board paper pre-review process continues to focus on ensuring that papers consider stakeholder impacts 
and views, where relevant.

Results of effectiveness review

Findings
The tone of Clare’s report was very 
positive overall and indicated that 
the Board, and each of its Committees, 
continued to be effective. The report 
identified a number of key strengths, 
including the experience and skillsets 
of the non-executive directors, the 
level of debate in meetings and the 
strong contributions of all Board 
members, as well as the supportive, 
positive nature of interactions 
between the non-executive directors 
and management, both inside and 
outside of formal meetings. 
The strength of the Company’s 
culture was also noted, built around 
good behaviours, positive and open 
stakeholder relationships and the 
value-adding engagement from 
designated board roles such 
as the Designated Workforce 
Director. 

The appointment process of the 
Group CEO was felt to have been 
well-managed and it was recognised 
that succession planning for the 
longer-serving non-executive 
directors on the Board would 
be a key area of focus for the coming 
year, particularly in terms of ensuring 
that the Board’s composition would 
effectively support the development 
of strategy under the Company’s 
new executive leadership. The report 
commented on the strength of the 
Chair and the Committee Chairs, 
noting their extensive work outside 
of the boardroom, as well as the 
considerable roles performed 
by each of the Committees 
in supporting the Board. Clare 
provided a number of thoughtful 
recommendations in the report 
for the Board’s consideration. 

6

Action plan 
The Board discussed the findings 
of the 2023 effectiveness review 
and subsequently agreed an 
action plan for the coming year. 
The key actions included 
(i) continuing to support the new 
Group CEO as he transitions into 
the role, (ii) continuing to develop 
relationships with, and 
appropriate governance of, the 
Group’s principal subsidiaries, 
and (iii) continuing to oversee 
how the Consumer Duty is 
embedded into the organisation 
and how reporting on consumers 
could be more strategic. 
Progress to implement the 
agreed actions is underway. 
Progress is monitored by the 
Group Company Secretary and 
will continue to be reported 
to the Board at each meeting.

Chair’s introduction
I am pleased to present my report for the year 
ended 31 December 2023. During my first full 
year as the Chair of the Audit Committee, the 
Committee continued to assist the Board in 
fulfilling its core responsibilities, including 
monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
reporting, the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the internal control environment and the 
performance and objectivity of both the internal 
and external audit functions. 

A key area of focus for the Committee in 2023 
was the final phase of implementation of the 
new IFRS accounting standard IFRS 17, 
‘Insurance Contracts’. The Group has applied 
IFRS 17, alongside IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’, 
for the first time from 1 January 2023. These 
standards have brought significant changes 
to the accounting treatment for insurance and 
reinsurance contracts and financial instruments 
respectively and have had a material impact on 
the Group’s financial statements in the period 
of initial application. It was therefore appropriate 
that the Committee spend a significant 
proportion of its time overseeing the final 
elements of implementation.

This included regular updates on the results 
of a series of ‘dry runs’ ahead of initial reporting 
under the new standards and monitoring the 
development and implementation of the 
required changes to systems, processes and 
operating models. In addition, the Committee 
paid close attention to the effectiveness of the 
systems of controls over the new IFRS 17 
reporting systems and also reviewed, 
challenged and approved the material 
accounting judgements, methodologies, policies, 
assumptions and new reporting metrics.

The Committee has also received regular 
updates from KPMG in relation to IFRS 17 and 
commissioned Group Internal Audit to perform 
audits on various aspects of the implementation 
and received regular updates on the outcome 
of these audits. 

IFRS 17 was an unusually complex accounting 
standard to implement. It required fundamental 
changes to accounting records, as well as new 
systems and processes for preparing financial 
statements in accordance with the required 
framework. In common with other insurers, the 
Group began significant implementation work 
in 2017, some years before the final form of the 
standard was known. I would like to express my 
gratitude to everyone that contributed to the 
IFRS 17 programme for their dedication and 
tenacity in ensuring the Group was fully 
prepared for the transition. 

Committee meetings and membership
The Committee met 6 times during the year – 
this represents 1 more meeting than in an 
average year due to additional time spent on 
monitoring and reviewing the implementation

Other key areas of focus for 
the Committee during 2023
In addition to the implementation 
of IFRS 17, the Committee has also 
focused on:

Macroeconomic environment: the 
impacts of economic volatility on 
key accounting and actuarial areas 
of judgement and estimates that 
are sensitive to changing interest 
rates and inflation, as well as 
consideration of geopolitical 
events and their potential impact 
on balance sheet valuations and 
valuation uncertainty.

Internal controls: activities 
associated with the operation and 
effectiveness of the Group’s 
framework of internal controls 
over financial reporting and the 
evaluation of any failings or 
weaknesses.

Non-financial reporting: the 
adequacy of climate-related and 
other non-financial disclosures, 
including recommending the 
approval of the Group’s first 
Climate transition plan.

Internal Audit effectiveness 
review: reviewing the outcomes 
of the assessment by an 
independent external party.

UK audit and corporate 
governance reform: overseeing 
the Company’s approach to 
proposed reforms, particularly in 
relation to internal controls, in light 
of a changing approach from both 
the Government and FRC.

of IFRS 17. The Committee comprises only 
independent non-executive directors and fulfils 
the experience and expertise criteria required 
by the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
FCA’s disclosure and transparency rules. 
The Board considers that the Committee, 
as a whole, has a balance of skills and 
experience to deliver its responsibilities and 
has competence relevant to the sector and 
broader financial services industry. In addition, 
the Board considers that I, as Chair of the 
Committee, have recent and relevant financial 
experience and am competent in accounting 
and auditing. 

All members of the Committee are also members 
of the Risk Committee, which ensures that there 
is appropriate identification and management 
of any issues that are relevant to both 
committees. The full biographies of all 
Committee members can be found on pages 
64 and 65. Between meetings, I meet regularly 
with senior management across the Group’s 
Finance, Tax and Internal Audit functions, as 
well as with the lead external audit partner. 

Review of financial disclosures 
The Committee reviewed the half year and 
annual financial statements, which focused 
on the integrity and clarity of disclosure, 
application of accounting policies and 
judgements and compliance with legal and 
financial reporting standards. With the 
implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, and their 
impact across multiple reporting periods, 
including the transition as at 1 January 2022 
and a restatement of the Group’s 2022 half year 
and annual results, additional meetings were 
scheduled in advance of the Group’s half year 
2023 results to ensure that the Committee had 
sufficient opportunity to understand, review 
and challenge those first financial statements 
and disclosures under the new standards. 
As part of its review, the Committee received 
regular updates from management and the 
external auditor and was able to place reliance 
on the updates provided throughout the year on 
internal controls in relation to financial reporting. 

During the second half of 2023, the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) undertook a thematic 
review of ‘IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ Interim 
Disclosures in the First Year of Application’. 
The Group received the outcome of this review 
in respect of the Group’s half year report 
to 30 June 2023. This review was conducted 
in accordance with the FRC’s usual procedures, 
and accordingly was based solely on that half 
year report without detailed knowledge of our 
business or an understanding of the underlying 
transactions entered into. The review does not 
provide assurance that the half year report was 
correct in all material respects. The Committee 
was pleased to note both that, based on the 
review, there were no further questions or 
queries that the FRC wished to raise, but also 

that the FRC’s report on their thematic review, 
published in November 2023, included a 
number of disclosures contained in the Group’s 
half year report as examples of better practice.

As part of its review of financial disclosures, 
the Committee also considered whether the 
annual report was fair, balanced and 
understandable (FBU) and whether it provided 
the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy, as well as the 
risks facing the business including in relation 
to increasingly important ESG and climate 
considerations. The Committee reviewed the 
FBU assessment taking into consideration the 
impact of market volatility and the changing 
interest rate and inflationary environment and 
giving due attention to the use of APMs in 
increasing the level of information available 
to investors on the Company’s underlying 
performance and the effects of one-off 
financial events. In conjunction with verification 
processes, management assurance and a 
report from the external auditor, the Committee 
recommended to the Board that the annual 
report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable.

The Audit Committee, together with the Risk 
Committee, reviewed the key assumptions and 
methodologies of the risk-based capital model, 
Solvency II disclosures and disclosures made 
in relation to internal control and risk 
management, as well as the principal risks and 
uncertainties the Group faces. The Committee 
can confirm that the key judgements and 
significant issues considered in relation to the 
2023 financial statements are consistent with 
the disclosures of key estimation uncertainties 
and critical judgements as detailed in Note 1 
on page 151. The statement is underpinned 
by the Committee’s belief that all important 
information has been disclosed and that the 
descriptions and reviews of the Group’s business 
and performance as set out in the Strategic 
report are consistent with the financial 
reporting in the Group’s financial statements. 

Climate and other non-financial reporting 
While the FRC chose not to include any 
revisions to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code in respect of wider responsibilities 
and considerations for boards and audit 
committees in relation to ESG objectives and 
other sustainability matters, following its 
consultation in 2023, the Committee provides 
close oversight over the Group’s climate and 
other non-financial reporting, in light of 
ever-increasing stakeholder expectations. 
During the year, the Committee has received 
updates on the European Union’s Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive and the 
release of the inaugural standards from the 
International Sustainability Standards Board.

In addition, the Committee has focused on 
improvements that can be made to the Group’s 
climate-related disclosures in the financial 
statements and ensuring that there is a 
coherent link between those disclosures and 
the narrative in the front half of the Annual 
report and accounts. The Committee also has 
responsibility for reviewing and approving the 
Group’s Climate and nature report and Social 
impact report and, to that end, has sought to 
understand the verification and assurance 
framework that is in place to ensure that 
disclosures were in line with relevant 
requirements, and were materially accurate, 
consistent, fair and balanced. The Committee 
remained supportive of the proposal to 
commission limited third-party assurance over 
specific climate and pay gap-related metrics.

Internal control 
The Committee has the primary responsibility 
for the oversight of the Group’s system of 
internal controls including controls over 
financial reporting and the work of the Internal 
Audit function. The Committee, in collaboration 
with the Risk Committee, seeks to ensure that 
the Group operates within a framework of 
prudent and effective controls that allow risks 
to be identified, assessed and managed. 

Policies and manuals in relation to International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
Solvency II reporting requirements and a 
Financial Control Framework (FCF) are in place 
across the Group. FCF is a first line framework 
that supports the Committee in enabling it to 
understand and assess the design and 
effectiveness of controls over financial 
reporting, covering IFRS, APMs, Solvency II 
and, going forward, climate and other 
non-financial reporting. FCF is a risk-based 
approach with management identification, 
documentation, testing, remediation (as 
required), reporting and certification over key 
financial reporting-related controls. 

The Committee has completed its review and 
approval of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control policies and procedures, 
during the year and up to the date of this report, 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
guidance on risk management, internal control 
and related financial and business reporting 
published by the FRC. During this review, the 
Committee did not identify any weaknesses 
which were determined to be significant 
to the preparation of the financial statements. 
Where areas for improvement were identified, 
processes are in place to ensure that the 
necessary actions are taken, and progress 
is monitored by the Committee. 

UK audit and corporate governance reform 
2023 has seen a significant scaling back of 
proposals relating to audit and corporate 
governance reform in the UK, with: primary 
legislation required for, amongst other things, 
the establishment of the Audit, Reporting and 
Governance Authority (ARGA) now likely delayed 
until post the general election; the late withdrawal 
of proposed secondary legislation on the Audit 
and Assurance Policy, Resilience Statement, 
fraud reporting and reporting on distributable 
reserves; and finally the removal of a number 
of proposed changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code following the FRC’s 
consultation in 2023. As a Group, Legal & General 
remains supportive of proposals that make the 
UK an attractive market for shareholders, 
investors and broader stakeholders through 
high quality and transparent audit and corporate 
governance activities. The Committee has 
been actively engaged throughout the year 
in overseeing the Group’s readiness for the 
proposed reforms and, while it was disappointing 
to see such late changes, it will continue to 
keep a close focus on the changes to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code that remain, 
notably in relation to the declaration on the 
effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control framework.

Audit quality 
It remains an important aspect of the 
Committee’s work to keep under review the 
independence and effectiveness of the internal 
and external audit process. 

Internal audit 
The Group Chief Internal Auditor presents a 
report at each Committee meeting, to update 
the Committee on the results of audits since 
the previous meeting. The report includes: 
details of any significant control weaknesses 
and positive assurance provided; themes 
arising from audits and management’s 
progress in addressing actions related to audit 
findings; and Group Internal Audit’s (GIA) 
evaluation of the overall control environment 
for each of the Group’s divisions. Key areas of 
GIA’s work reported to the Committee during 
the year included: financial reporting processes 
and controls related to IFRS 17; IT and data 
security; data privacy risk management; IT and 
operational resilience; Solvency II compliance; 
financial risk governance including credit, 
market and liquidity risk; financial crime risk 
management; third-party oversight including 
material outsourcing; readiness for the FCA’s 
Consumer Duty regulation; climate change 
reporting; and major IT change programmes. 
GIA continues to evaluate the risk and control 
culture across the Group and includes specific 
reporting to the Committee on the results of 
this work. The Committee approved GIA’s 
risk-based audit plan for the year and 
monitored the delivery of the plan throughout 
the year as well as the associated key 
performance metrics.

During 2022, Deloitte were engaged to perform 
an external quality assessment of GIA, which 
assessed the function’s effectiveness including 
its independence and positioning within the 
organisation. Deloitte presented its report to 
the Committee in May 2023. The function was 
assessed as a mature internal audit function, 
generally conforming with International Internal 
Audit Standards and applicable professional 
codes for effective internal audit in financial 
services. The Deloitte report noted the 
function’s clear purpose and support from 
management; appropriate safeguards related 
to independence and objectivity; mature 
working practices; a high quality experienced 
team, and a strong focus on data analytics and 
continuous improvement. 

The Committee continued to meet with the 
Group Chief Internal Auditor in private 
throughout the year. In accordance with the 
Institute of Internal Auditors’ Financial Services 
Code of Practice, the Committee conducted its 
annual review of the independence and 
objectivity of the Group Chief Internal Auditor 
and concluded that independence and 
objectivity had been maintained throughout the 
year. The Committee undertook its annual review 
of, and approved, the GIA Charter and undertook 
a regular review of key performance indicators, 
including: audit plan delivery progress; resourcing 
and skill levels; and progress in completing 
actions to implement the recommendations 
from Deloitte’s 2022 External Quality 
Assessment, which were incorporated into 
GIA’s continuous improvement plan.

Based on regular internal audit reporting, 
private sessions with the Group Chief Internal 
Auditor, and taking into consideration the 
externally facilitated evaluation noted above, 
the Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness 
of the GIA function and the appropriateness 
of its resources. 

External audit 
The Committee has the primary responsibility 
for overseeing the relationship with, and 
performance of, the external auditor. This 
includes making recommendations for their 
appointment, reappointment, removal and 
approval of remuneration. The Committee 
reviews and approves the terms of engagement 
of the external auditor and monitors its 
compliance with the independence criteria 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code. 

The Committee meets regularly and privately 
with the external auditor. These meetings allow 
for regular and open dialogue of any issues 
relevant to the Committee’s work. Audit 
Committee members also meet regularly with 
management outside of formal Committee 
meetings to discuss the relationship with the 
external auditor and the efficiency of the audit 
process. Throughout the year, the Committee 
has received updates on the quality of the

external audit process and has continued to 
work with, and challenge, management and 
KPMG on efficiency gains and ensuring that 
audit fees are fair and proportionate to the 
audit work required for the Group. In addition, 
the Committee has overseen the succession 
of the KPMG lead audit partner in 2023. 

Non-audit services
In order to safeguard the auditor’s independence 
and objectivity, the Group has in place a policy 
setting out the circumstances in which the 
external auditor may be engaged to provide 
services other than those covered by the audit. 
The policy applies to all Legal & General 
subsidiaries and other material entities over 
which the Group has significant influence. 
The core principle of the policy is that non-audit 
services (other than those legally required 
to be carried out by the Group’s auditor) should 
be performed by the auditor only in certain 
controlled circumstances. The policy sets out 
those types of services that are permitted 
(permitted services) and those types of services 
which are not permitted. The policy pre-approves 
a number of the permitted services, provided 
the fee is below a certain threshold; all other 
permitted services must be specifically approved 
in advance by the Committee. 

The policy is reviewed on an annual basis 
to ensure that it is fit for purpose and that 
it reflects applicable rules and guidelines. 
The policy is aligned with the FRC’s requirements 
and includes the requirement to consider the 
self-review test under the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) Code 
of Ethics, applicable for periods beginning on or 
after 15 December 2022, before a proposed 
engagement is assigned. It is also aligned with 
KPMG’s own internal policy on non-audit 
services for FTSE 350 companies, which broadly 
restricts non-audit work to services that are 
‘closely related’ to the audit. Any changes to the 
policy are required to be approved by the 
Committee. This is in accordance with laws 
applicable in the UK and FRC guidance, pursuant 
to which audit committees of Public Interest 
Entities are required to approve non-audit 
services provided by their auditors to such 
entities; and subsidiary Public Interest Entities 
in the UK – such as Legal and General 
Assurance Society Limited (LGAS) – can rely 
on the approval of non-audit services by the 
ultimate parent’s Board Audit Committee.

Appointment 
The Company confirms that it has complied 
with requirements governing the appointment 
of an external auditor, notably the requirements 
of the Competition & Markets Authority contained 
in the Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Uses of Competitive Tender Process and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, 
including requirements for mandatory audit 
firm rotation. 

Following a competitive tender carried out 
in 2016, KPMG was appointed as the Group’s 
external auditor with effect from the financial 
year ended 31 December 2018. In May 2023, 
KPMG was reappointed as the Group’s external 
auditor for the financial year ended 
31 December 2023, which is their sixth year 
as the Group’s external auditor. In accordance 
with the ICAEW’s requirements, Salim Tharani 
stood down as KPMG’s lead audit partner 
during 2023, and was replaced by Phil Smart, 
who had previously shadowed Mr Tharani 
during the 2022 audit.

The Committee considers the quality and 
effectiveness of the external audit and 
recommends to the Board, on an annual basis, 
whether to recommend the reappointment 
of the external auditor for shareholder approval. 
On the basis that KPMG continue to maintain 
their independence and objectivity, and the 
Committee continues to remain satisfied with 
their performance, there are no plans as at the 
date of this report to conduct a tender exercise 
for external audit services before the end 
of the current required period of 10 years. 
The Committee believes it would not be 
appropriate to tender before the end of this 
period as it recognises that, while it is 
important to ensure the audit firm remains 
objective and does not become overly familiar 
with management, there is an important 
balance to be struck with the investment of 
time required both from management and any 
completely new audit team for them to gain 
sufficient understanding of a large and 
complex organisation, such as Legal & General, 
to ensure a top-quality audit. 

Audit fees
The Committee assesses the external auditor’s 
fee structure, resources and terms of 
engagement annually. Total fees paid to the 
auditor for the year were £23.1 million (2022: 
£17.5 million), of which £1.9 million (2022: 
£1.7 million), was spent on non-audit and other 
assurance services. £1.6 million (2022: 
£1.6 million) was spent on audit-related 
services required by legislation, which is 
excluded from any calculation of the ratio of 
non-audit to audit fees in accordance with the 
UK FRC Revised Ethical Standard for Auditors 
(2019). Further details can be found in Note 29 
to the consolidated financial statements. The 
non-audit fee represents 10% of the total audit 
fee for 2023. 

Included within KPMG’s fees for 2023 are 
additional audit fees related to the 
implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, and 
specifically work to support KPMG’s audit 
opinion in respect of the transitional impact to 
the Group’s balance sheet and equity position 
as at 1 January 2023. The Committee is 
satisfied that this level of fee is appropriate in 
respect of the audit services required for the 

Group and that an effective audit can be 
conducted for this fee. The Committee 
continues to work with KPMG to ensure costs 
remain appropriate and proportionate to the 
services provided.

Assessment of independence 
and effectiveness 
The Committee is responsible for assessing 
the effectiveness, objectivity and independence 
of the external auditor. This assessment is 
on-going throughout the year and concludes 
with a formal, internal, effectiveness review, 
which was conducted in December 2023. 
As part of the on-going assessment, the 
Committee assesses the external auditor 
against a number of criteria, including but not 
limited to: provision of timely and accurate 
industry-specific and technical knowledge, 
maintaining a professional and open dialogue 
with the Audit Committee Chair and members 
at all times, delivery of an efficient and effective 
audit, the ability to meet objectives within the 
agreed time frames and the quality of judgements 
and audit findings, management’s response 
and stakeholder feedback. In addition, the 
Committee holds private meetings with the 
external auditor to discuss the audit process 
and relationship with management. 

Overall, the assessment of KPMG was positive, 
with a small number of areas noted for 
consideration in future audit cycles. Taking into 
account the result of all of the above, the 
Committee concluded that KPMG maintained 
its independence and objectivity and that the 
audit process was effective. Upon the 
Committee’s recommendation, the Board has 
recommended that KPMG be reappointed as 
the Company’s auditor, by shareholders, at the 
2024 AGM.

Key accounting and reporting judgements
Throughout the year, the Committee was briefed at each meeting on the Group’s key accounting and reporting judgements by management and 
KPMG. The Committee’s response to each issue can be found below and the Committee is satisfied that the financial statements appropriately 
address the key accounting judgements and estimates in respect of both the amounts reported and disclosures made.

Issue

Committee’s response

Valuation of insurance contract liabilities – 
retirement:

The insurance liabilities for retirement products are 
significant in size and their estimation is inherently 
judgemental.

Valuation of complex investments:

Mark to model investments can involve significant 
judgement and can produce valuation challenges 
for investments in new classes. 

Mark to model valuations inherently include 
assumptions that lead to the existence of a range 
of plausible valuations for financial instruments 
(known as valuation uncertainty). Certain assets are 
subject to a higher degree of valuation uncertainty, 
particularly where valuations are modelled using no 
market inputs or the valuations are affected by other 
factors such as the illiquidity of the asset. 

The Committee evaluated the significant judgements that have an impact on the valuation of insurance 
liabilities for retirement products. This included considering: 

Longevity assumptions – which estimate how long policyholders receiving annuity payments will live. 
The challenge around the setting of longevity assumptions was a particularly significant area for review 
as the judgements made could be expected to have a material impact on the Group’s results. The Committee 
considered the effectiveness of the controls over the accuracy and completeness of the data used in 
determining the longevity assumption and the validity of independent industry data supporting those 
assumptions. The Committee also reviewed available data illustrating recent trends in mortality experience 
in the UK population and the mortality experience on different blocks of our business, taking account of the 
uncertainty in more recent data as a result of Covid-19.

Valuation interest rates – which are used to discount the liabilities. These are sensitive to judgements made, 
for example, on credit default of the backing assets, as well as the investment data used to calculate the 
internal rate of return. The Committee focused on management’s proposed changes to reserving assumptions, 
other modelling changes, and the determination of the credit default assumption. This included analysis 
of internal historical data and external market experience.

Directly attributable expense assumptions – which determine the specific future expenses that are 
incorporated in the calculation of the IFRS insurance liabilities. The Committee considered the allocation 
between servicing new and existing business and the consistency of approach applied.

The Committee concluded that the retirement insurance contract liabilities are appropriate for including 
in the financial statements, reflecting the asset risks and the available data on policyholder longevity.

The Group balance sheet carries exposure to complex investments (typically classified as Level 3 in the fair 
value hierarchy), in line with the Group’s strategy and risk appetite. The valuation of these investments, 
including property assets, lifetime mortgages and private credit, requires the use of complex models and 
management judgement. The Committee seeks to ensure that the valuation process for these investments 
is robust. 

These harder to value assets remain a key area of focus, partially heightened in 2023 as a result of 
macro-economic volatility and geo-political events. The valuation of a number of asset classes is sensitive 
to higher interest rates and inflation, and these have therefore been areas of enhanced challenge and review 
by the Committee.

The Committee has continued to review the processes and controls over investment valuations, and 
in particular the valuation uncertainty policies and governance which include management’s assessment 
of valuation uncertainty by asset type. While we do not currently see any material impact on the valuation 
of our asset portfolio arising from climate change, there is an increased consideration of climate and other ESG 
factors in both internal and third-party valuations. We expect this to be an increasing area of judgement (and 
therefore disclosure) in future years, and it will form a key area of focus in the Committee’s review of this area. 

The Committee concluded that there are appropriate controls surrounding the valuation of complex assets 
and that they are valued appropriately for inclusion in the financial statements.

Valuation of insurance liabilities – protection:

The insurance liabilities for protection contracts are 
an important driver of the profitability for this line of 
business and require judgements to be made 
regarding the assumed rates of mortality and 
persistency. The Company makes extensive use of 
reinsurance to reduce mortality risk.

The Committee has reviewed the methodology for calculating reserves including the allowance made for 
payments to and from reinsurance counterparties. The assumptions for the rate of future mortality and 
morbidity (how many customers will die or become ill during the policy term) and persistency (how many 
customers will discontinue cover) are based on the Company’s internal experience and use judgement about 
how experience may vary in the future. During 2023, the Committee has spent time reviewing the findings and 
judgements in respect of the continuing elevated levels of mortality experience in the UK and the US, reflecting 
indirect impacts of Covid-19 related illness, and potentially reflecting the deferral of diagnostics and medical 
treatments for other conditions. 

The Committee reviewed the judgements underlying the directly attributable expenses included in the 
insurance liabilities and considered the effectiveness of controls in place over valuation models. 

The Committee concluded that the insurance liabilities of the Group’s insurance businesses are appropriate 
for inclusion in the financial statements.

Committee’s response

Alternative performance measures (APMs):

As part of its consideration of whether the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable, the Committee 
has paid particular attention to the use of APMs in reporting the Group’s performance. 

APMs offer investors and stakeholders additional 
information on the Company’s performance and the 
financial effect of ‘one-off’ events, and the Group 
uses a range of these metrics to enhance 
understanding of the Group’s performance.

IFRS 17:

IFRS 17 is a new accounting standard for insurance 
contracts which took effect from 1 January 2023. 
IFRS 17 has had a significant impact on the 
reporting of the Group’s financial performance.

The Committee has reviewed the changes to the definition of adjusted operating profit to reflect the adoption 
of IFRS 17 and its application. Specifically the Committee has considered the inclusion of certain items either 
as part of adjusted operating profit or investment variances, to ensure that they are aligned to both the 
Group’s disclosed policies on these APMs and the underlying principles of fair and consistent reporting. 
Where appropriate the Committee has reviewed additional disclosures provided to enhance transparency 
in respect of the Group’s APMs. 

The Committee concluded that the use and disclosure of APMs, including the clarity of labelling the 
prominence of APMs versus statutory measures, are appropriate for inclusion in the annual report. 

As well as continuing to monitor the preparedness of the Group to implement IFRS 17, the Committee 
has reviewed a number of papers during both 2022 and 2023, covering various areas of policy, methodology 
and assumptions. 

In particular, the Committee reviewed the methodology and assumptions to support the transition to IFRS 17, 
and has reviewed and approved both the impact of that transition on the Group’s balance sheet and equity 
position as at 1 January 2022 and the results of the comparative period ended 31 December 2022. This 
included a particular focus on the assumptions and judgements that have underpinned the calculation of the 
contractual service margin (CSM) at transition, most notably CSM for business transitioned using the fair 
value methodology, and the determination of the compensation required for bearing the uncertainty about 
the amount and timing of the cash flows arising from non-financial risk as insurance contracts are fulfilled. 

The Committee concluded that the disclosures in respect of IFRS 17 (and IFRS 9) included in Note 1 Basis 
of Preparation and the comparative period results are appropriate for inclusion in the annual report.

categories of enterprise, emerging and 
principal risks to which the Group may 
be exposed and providing advice on what 
constitutes acceptable risk taking.

Key responsibilities 
•  Review the Group’s risk profile and 
appetite for risk and assess the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management framework. 

•  Oversee and advise the Board on the 
current risk exposures of the Group 
and oversee the management by the 
executive of those categories of risk.
•  Oversee and advise the Board on the 

governance, operation and performance 
of the Group’s internal model.

Governance

The Risk Committee assists 
the Board with strategic advice 
in relation to current and potential 
future risk exposures. The risk 
management framework supports 
informed risk taking and sets out 
those risks within appetite. 
The Committee conducts 
a thorough review of the risk 
management framework 
on an annual basis to ensure 
it remains fit for purpose.”

I am pleased to present my report as your Chair 
of the Risk Committee. I joined the Committee 
upon appointment to the Board in 2018 and 
assumed the role of Chair in 2022. Since 
becoming Chair of the Committee, I have 
further developed my knowledge and 
understanding of the risk environment in which 
the Company operates and sought to ensure 
that the Committee continues to operate 
effectively. Throughout 2023, I have continued 
to engage with my fellow Committee members 
to understand their views, in particular, on any 
risk areas which they feel require further 
oversight and challenge. This has been 
supported by my active and regular 
engagement with key colleagues in the 
business, with particular emphasis on the 
support received from the Group Chief Risk 
Officer and his team. 

Oversight of risk management
In a challenging macroeconomic and 
geopolitical environment, the Committee has 
continued to oversee, robustly challenge and 
provide advice to the Board, on the Group’s 
current and future risk exposures and profile. 
During the year, geopolitical risks have continued 
to heighten with ongoing conflict and rising 
political tensions. Macroeconomic risks have 
also increased as many major economies 
faced slowing growth against a backdrop 
of high inflation, energy market shocks and 
rising interest rates, abating somewhat in the 
latter part of 2023. The Committee has continued 
to monitor the ongoing global economic 
uncertainties and, with the prospect of several 
important elections in the coming year, this will 
continue to remain an important focus for the 
Committee in 2024. Despite these challenging 
market conditions, the Company has remained 
resilient to a number of risk events and has 
largely continued to operate within risk appetite. 
The Committee, in conjunction with the Audit 
Committee, keeps under review the effectiveness 
of the Company’s risk management and internal 
control systems, which monitors and reviews 
all material controls including financial,

operational and compliance controls. In addition, 
we closely monitor risk appetite and tolerance 
levels and challenge management to ensure 
these are regularly stress tested to ensure they 
are able to withstand wider macroeconomic 
risk events.

2023 activity
Given the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic 
and geopolitical environment, the Committee 
has spent a significant amount of time during 
the year hearing directly from the business, 
alongside risk and compliance colleagues, 
about how they are managing the associated 
risks and what mitigating actions are being 
taken. In addition, the Committee receives an 
update from the Group Chief Risk Officer at each 
meeting which covers an in-depth overview of 
the risk profile, outlook and landscape. During 
the year, the Committee paid close attention 
to the Group’s capital and liquidity position, 
in light of the macroeconomic and geopolitical 
landscape, and received in depth updates on 
credit, insurance, longevity and market risk. 
A particular area of focus for the Committee 
during the year centred around property risk. 
The UK commercial property markets continued 
to reflect the broader uncertainty in the 
economic outlook and the Committee paid 
close attention to the Company’s exposure 
to commercial property, particularly the office 
sector, and the management action being 
taken to mitigate the risks. 

In addition to the geopolitical and 
macroeconomic climate, the Committee has 
continued to focus on the management of the 
Group’s non-financial risks. The Committee 
received regular updates, and challenged the 
progress made by management, on operational 
resilience, embedding the Consumer Duty 
regulations, change management, governance 
controls around technology and data risk and 
operational risks such as those related to 
conduct risk and ensuring appropriate 
mitigations are in place to prevent the 
facilitation of financial crime.

Alongside the Group Chief Risk Officer’s report, 
the Committee is provided with management 
information on risk appetite, comparing actual 
positions relative to the Group’s risk appetite 
statement and quantitative analysis of the 
Group’s exposures to financial and operational 
risks, including risk-based capital requirements 
in relation to the core risks implicit in the 
Group’s businesses. The Committee also 
receives an assessment of the overall profile 
of conduct risks for the Group; analysis and 
trends in complaints data and a suite of 
customer service metrics designed to enable 
the Committee to assess the management 
of the customer journey.

Risk appetite review
In July 2023, the Committee considered the 
risk profile of the Group’s strategic plan and 
its alignment with the Group’s risk appetite. 
The Committee undertook a detailed review 
of the operation of the Group’s strategic risk 
appetite and the key metrics and tolerances 
used to determine acceptable risk taking. 
As part of the review, refinements were 
recommended to the metrics to ensure 
a more reliable and accurate measure of the 
Group’s performance against risk appetite. 
The Committee also conducted an annual 
review of emerging risks and continues to 
encourage management to be alert to areas 
of emerging risk, particularly in light of the 
rapidly evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical 
climate to ensure that the Company remains 
well diversified and robustly protected against 
market shocks.

Risk-based capital model
The Group’s risk-based capital model (internal 
model) is used to determine the capital 
requirements for the Group and forms the 
calculation engine for the Solvency II internal 
model. During the year, the Committee 
reviewed and approved the internal model 
development plan and validation report. 
As part of this review the Committee takes 
into consideration: 

•  key assumptions, methodologies and areas 
of expert judgement used within the model
•  activities undertaken to validate the outputs 

of the model

•  development of the model to ensure that 

it reflects the business lines and risk profile 
of the Group

•  processes to ensure that changes applied 
in the model are undertaken in a controlled 
manner, and in line with model development 
plans.

In addition, the Committee also reviewed and 
approved the 2023 recovery and resolution 
plans as well as ORSA policy and scenarios, 
which are an ongoing assessment of the risks 
to which the Group is exposed and an 
assessment of the capital resources available 
to ensure that the Group is able to sustain its 
business over the plan horizon. 

Climate risk
It is widely recognised that actions taken today 
can influence the likelihood of different climate 
outcomes, and impact on future risk exposures. 
This, alongside climate scenario analysis, 
informs our risk management framework. 
During the year, the Committee considered the 
Group’s climate risk management approach 
and reviewed and approved the 2022 Climate 
report, prepared in line with recommendations 
by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures. In addition, the Committee 
reviewed and approved the Group’s climate 
goals and commitments, including our stated 

journey to net zero, as well as the Company’s 
Climate transition plan, which was presented 
for a shareholder advisory vote at the Annual 
General Meeting in 2023. 

Working collaboratively
The Committee continued to work closely 
throughout the year with the Audit Committee 
on risk and control matters as well as the 
Remuneration Committee so that risk 
management and risk culture are properly 
considered in setting the Remuneration Policy 
and determining remuneration outcomes. 
In addition, the Committee also works closely 
with the Data and Technology Committee 
to consider technology risk. An important 
element of this will be the emerging risk and 
opportunities that Artificial Intelligence presents. 
The Committee also reviewed and approved 
the Group Technology Risk Policy and Technology 
Risk Appetite statements during the year. 

Legal & General has a strong subsidiary 
governance framework in place to support the 
Board in discharging its responsibilities for the 
Group. Directors of the Group’s principal 
subsidiaries (LGAS and LGIM(H)) are members 
of the Risk Committee; this brings valuable 
insight, oversight and challenge to the 
Committee’s discussions on specific aspects 
of the Group’s operations. An overview of the 
Company’s risk appetite and risk management 
approach, as well as our principal and emerging 
risks, can be found on pages 56 to 59.

2024 priorities
The Committee has an important role in 
supporting the Board in the oversight and 
management of the risk framework. During 
2024, the Committee will continue to focus on: 

• 

impacts and associated risks arising from 
the macroeconomic and geopolitical 
environment, regulatory landscape including 
the UK Solvency reforms, and global climate 
change, with a focus on consideration 
of emerging risks

•  management of capital and liquidity risks 
•  oversight of the current and emerging 

• 

non-financial and conduct risk exposures 
of the Group, including operational 
resilience, change management and the 
embedding of the Consumer Duty regulation 
review the output of the Bank of England’s 
system-wide exploratory scenario exercise, 
investigating the behaviours of banks and 
non-bank financial institutions following 
a severe but plausible stress to financial 
markets.

Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the Remuneration 
Committee’s report for 2023. With effect from 
26 February 2024, I have stepped down from 
my role as Chair of the Committee, and have 
been succeeded by fellow non-executive 
director, Laura Wade-Gery. The Board considered 
Laura an excellent successor due to her 
established track record as a UK-listed company 
Remuneration Committee Chair and her strong 
understanding of the Committee’s current 
workings and priorities. Laura fulfills the 
Code requirement for any appointee to the 
Remuneration Committee Chair role to have 
served on a Remuneration Committee 
for 12 months prior to appointment. I have 
maintained my membership of the Committee.

Within this report, we have presented the 
considerations and decisions for the Committee 
throughout 2023.

Link between pay and performance
In 2023, we delivered a further set of good results, 
with adjusted operating profit of £1.7 billion 
and profit for the year of £443 million. Earnings 
per share (EPS) was 7.35 pence compared 
to 12.84 pence in 2022. 

Annual Variable Pay (AVP)
For executive directors, 70% of the bonus 
opportunity is determined by the Group’s 
financial performance, measured against 
pre-determined targets.

Strategic objectives determine the other 30% 
of bonus opportunity, including strategy,

Other information

The Committee has 
continued to be mindful 
of both the immediate 
and long-term financial 
wellbeing of the wider 
workforce, particularly 
in these economically 
uncertain and challenging 
times. We made a one off 
payment of £750 in July 
2023 and approved an 
increase in the employer 
contribution to pension 
of 1% of base pay effective 
from 1 April 2024, with 
a view to aligning employer

with those for senior 
management.”

subject to regulatory approval. Regulatory 
approval for the appointment was confirmed 
in October 2023 and António joined the Board 
as Group CEO on 1 January 2024.

Sir Nigel’s departure was confirmed by the 
Company once regulatory approval for António’s 
appointment had been received and he will 
remain employed for his 12 month notice 
period in order to ensure a smooth transition. 
Consistent with his service contract and the 
executive remuneration policy, Sir Nigel will 
continue to receive his current base pay and 
benefits until his employment ends. Sir Nigel 
will not receive an AVP award for performance 
in 2024 nor will he receive a PSP award in 2024.

Consistent with the remuneration policy and 
the rules of the SBP and PSP, Sir Nigel will 
be a good leaver and as such his outstanding 
share awards will be treated in line with the 
good leaver provisions in the respective plan 
rules. His deferred AVP awards for 2021, 2022 
and 2023 will vest three years from the date 
of grant. His outstanding PSP awards will 
be pro-rated with reference to the proportion 
of the performance period that has elapsed upon 
leaving and will then vest based on performance 
to the end of the performance period and will 
be released, subject to performance, on the 
fifth anniversary of the date of grant.

Sir Nigel will retain a shareholding in 
Legal & General Group of at least 325% 
of base pay for two years post his departure 
from the Board in line with the Director’s 
remuneration policy.

António Simões
Context
As reported previously, following a rigorous, 
global, selection process managed by 
Sir John Kingman, António Simões was 
appointed as CEO in June 2023, and took 
up his post formally on 1 January 2024.

When determining an appropriate remuneration 
package, the Committee considered our current 
remuneration practices and shareholder 
approved remuneration policy, relevant market 
practice and António’s remuneration levels 
at his previous employer. As part of the 
Remuneration Policy renewal last year, 
we made a number of changes to assist 
the Committee in a recruitment scenario. 

This policy was supported by more than 
95% of shareholders and this additional 
flexibility was critical in allowing us to secure 
António’s appointment.

customer and culture, and risk as well as 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
metrics, as described in more detail on page 
106. These act as a moderator to the overall 
AVP outcome.

As in previous years, the Committee chose 
to exclude the beneficial impact of mortality 
assumption changes from the financial results 
when determining bonus awards, resulting 
in bonus outcomes of 52.7% to 53.8% of 
maximum for the executive directors. Targets 
and outcomes are summarised in the ‘Quick 
read’ section on page 99 and in further detail on 
page 105.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The long-term incentive (PSP) awards granted 
in 2021 were subject to EPS growth and Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) growth over the 
three-year period ended 31 December 2023.

EPS growth is determined based on measuring 
the change in EPS over the three-year 
performance period. However, the introduction 
of IFRS 17 from 1 January 2023 prevents EPS 
from being measured on the same basis from 
the start of the period (on an IFRS 4 basis) 
to the end of the performance period (on an 
IFRS 17 basis). In order to fairly measure the 
EPS growth performance, the Committee has 
considered the annual change in each of the 
three years, as the EPS for 2022 has been 
reported on both an IFRS 4 and IFRS 17 basis. 
On this basis, EPS grew by 52.3% over the 
period (15.1% per annum). Further details 
on this are provided on page 107 of the report.

TSR grew by 23.1%, out-performing the median 
of the FTSE 100, but below the median for the 
bespoke comparator group.

This resulted in 61.1% of the 2021 PSP award 
vesting. In accordance with the remuneration 
policy, the Committee assessed the formulaic 
outcome, considering overall performance, risk 
management progress against ESG 
commitments, and other capital and solvency 
measures, and determined that the outcome 
was appropriate in all the circumstances, and 
no downward adjustment was required. Under 
the terms of the PSP plan for executive directors, 
the vested shares will be deferred for a further 
two years and released in 2026. The PSP 
performance targets and outcomes are 
summarised in the ‘Quick read’ section 
on page 99.

Board changes
Sir Nigel Wilson
In January 2023, we announced Sir Nigel Wilson’s 
intention to retire as CEO of Legal & General 
Group. Sir Nigel agreed to continue in the role 
until a successor was appointed and to support 
a smooth transition following their appointment. 
In June 2023, we announced that António 
Simões would be appointed as the new CEO, 

Directors’ report on remuneration

Legal & General Group Plc Annual report and accounts 2023

Directors’ report on remuneration 
continued

The total remuneration package provided to 
António at his previous employer was 
significantly higher than both the previous 
package provided to Nigel Wilson and the 
package António is now receiving at 
Legal & General.

Ongoing remuneration policy
When determining the final remuneration 
package for António, the Committee adopted 
a number of principles. Firstly, in 
acknowledgment of the fact that António’s 
pay would be higher than Nigel’s, we sought 
to deliver the majority of the increase through 
variable pay rather than fixed pay. This ensured 
that a material portion of pay was linked to 
performance, and therefore would only be 
realised if stretching performance targets were 
met. Doing so also means we could moderate 
the level of fixed pay required to secure 
António’s appointment, where we know 
absolute levels of fixed pay are a focus area 
of investors.

The second key principle the Committee 
adopted was to ensure that the remuneration 
package we offered was broadly in line with 
other FTSE 100 companies. This ensured that 
we operated within market norms and 
shareholders’ expectations. With this in mind 
António’s remuneration package consists of:

•  a base salary of £1,175k. This is between 

the median and upper quartile of FTSE 100 
financial services companies

•  pension of 10% of salary, in line with the 

current rate offered to the wider workforce
•  benefits in line with our remuneration policy, 
including relocation support to assist with 
António’s move from Spain, which will be 
provided for 12 months

•  a maximum bonus of 200% of salary and 

maximum PSP of 300% of salary. These are 
the maximum levels of remuneration we can 
offer under our remuneration policy and are 
also broadly in line with the median 
opportunities offered by other FTSE 100 
financial services companies.

This resulted in a total remuneration package 
positioned between the median and upper 
quartile of other FTSE 100 financial services 
companies, which is appropriate in the context 
of Legal & General’s size and complexity.

Replacement award
As is common practice in financial services, 
and particularly in banking, António had 
numerous unvested awards which he would 
forfeit as a result of joining Legal & General. 
In line with our remuneration policy, the 
Committee has agreed to buy out these awards 
with equivalent Legal & General awards, 

ensuring António is immediately aligned 
to the Legal & General share price and 
shareholder interests.

All awards will be bought out on a ‘like for like 
basis’, meaning that:

•  deferred cash and share awards will be 
bought out in cash/shares respectively
•  all replacement awards will have identical 

vesting/deferral periods to the original awards

•  for all awards with performance conditions 

we calculated how performance was 
tracking against targets in order to 
determine a fair value for each award.

The total value of these buyout awards is 
significant, however the Committee is 
comfortable that these represent the genuine 
levels of awards being foregone and that the 
awards were critical to securing António’s 
appointment. The majority of these awards 
will be granted in shares with a grant date 
of 20 March 2024, creating immediate 
alignment to Legal & General’s performance 
and share price. Additionally, all awards will 
be subject to relevant deferral, malus and 
clawback provisions. In line with our 
remuneration policy all awards will be subject 
to forfeiture and clawback if António leaves 
the Company voluntarily within three years.

Implementation of Remuneration 
Policy for 2024 
Base pay
Having reviewed pay and conditions across the 
Group, and considered the broader market and 
overall business performance, the Committee 
have determined to increase base pay for Jeff 
Davies by 4.3% with effect from 1 March 2024. 
For 2024, the average base pay increase for UK 
employees is expected to be around 4.3% but 
with higher increases for lower paid employees. 
The first review of base pay for António Simões 
will be in 2025 and so his base pay will remain 
unchanged during 2024.

Annual Bonus
The proportion of the annual bonus measures 
assessed against financial metrics will remain 
70%, with 30% assessed against non-financial 
objectives. Financial metrics will cover a range 
of KPIs assessing profitability and growth, 
aligned to António’s strategic review.

PSP
In order to place further emphasis on the 
important influence the Company has on 
climate, the Committee have determined 
to include a strategic measure with a 20% 
weighting based on progress against our 
published climate commitments. The remaining 
80% will be split equally between EPS growth 
and relative TSR performance. Further details, 
including the quantitative climate targets, are 
shown on page 108.

Governance

Consideration of the wider workforce
The Committee has regard for the remuneration 
of all employees across the Group. The policies 
and practices applying to executive directors 
are the same as for the wider workforce 
in most instances, although quantum and 
participation by location and grade may vary.

The Committee has continued to be mindful 
of both the immediate and longer term financial 
wellbeing of the wider workforce, particularly 
in these economically uncertain and challenging 
times. We made a one off payment of £750 in 
July 2023 to lower paid employees to mitigate 
inflation pressures, in addition to the £1,500 
payment made in 2022. The Committee also 
reviewed pension provisions for UK employees 
below senior management and approved 
an increase to the employer contribution 
to pension of 1% of base pay effective from 
1 April 2024 with a view to aligning employer 
pension contributions with those for senior 
management over the next 5 years.

In addition, Legal & General continues to 
provide further financial support to all UK 
employees including SmartSaving (the 
employee discount scheme) and preferential 
borrow/save/advance finance facilities through 
our partner organisation, Salary Finance.

For 2024 a stratified approach to base pay 
increases has been adopted with higher 
percentage increases applied to employees 
in lower paid roles, reflecting their 
proportionally greater exposure to price 
inflation, with those in more junior roles 
receiving a base pay increase of 5%.

Most employees are eligible to be considered 
for a bonus payment based on group, divisional, 
individual and/or other specific performance 
metrics, with bonuses for performance during 
2023 paid shortly after the year end, at the 
same time as bonuses for executive directors.

The Committee continues to maintain 
an oversight of progress on continuing 
work on diversity and inclusion and achieving 
a further narrowing of the gender pay gap. 
Further details on this can be found on page 49 
and in our Social impact report. I hope that you 
will find this report a clear account of the 
Committee’s considerations and decisions, 
and the remuneration outcomes for the year.

Summary of remuneration policy

The directors’ remuneration policy was approved by shareholders by way of a binding vote at the 
2023 AGM on 18 May 2023 and applies for three years from the 2023 AGM. The policy table below 
summarises key aspects of the approved policy. The full remuneration policy can be found in the 
2022 annual report, and on the Company’s website.

Base pay

Pension contributions

Benefits

Annual Variable Pay (AVP)

Fixed pay

Purpose 
and link 
to strategy

Provides a fixed level 
of earnings, appropriate 
to the market and 
requirements of the role.

Provides a basis for 
savings to provide an 
income in retirement.

Provides benefits and allowances 
appropriate to the market, and 
to assist employees in efficiently 
carrying out their duties.

Operation

Reviewed annually with 
effect from 1 March, taking 
into account:
•  the individual’s skills, 

In line with other 
employees in the UK, 
executive directors may:
•  participate in a DC 

pension plan
•  receive a cash 

allowance in lieu

•  receive some 

combination thereof.

Non-UK national executives 
may be permitted to 
participate in home-
country pension plans 
where relevant.

Base pay is the only 
element of pensionable 
remuneration.

Pension contributions 
for executive directors 
are aligned to that available 
to the majority of the UK 
workforce (currently 
up to 10% of base pay).

In line with other employees in the 
UK, benefits currently include:
•  private medical insurance
•  life insurance
•  income protection
•  all-employee (ShareSave 

and Share Purchase) plans.

Executive directors may participate 
in voluntary benefits and choose 
to acquire Legal & General products 
which they fund themselves, 
sometimes through salary sacrifice.

In line with other senior managers 
in the UK, executive directors 
receive a non-pensionable cash 
allowance in lieu of a company car.

Where an executive director is 
required to relocate, or perform duties 
outside their home country, additional 
benefits may be provided, (including 
healthcare and assistance for housing, 
school fees, home travel, relocation 
costs and tax compliance advice) 
for a period not exceeding two years.

The maximum amount paid in 
respect of benefits will be the actual 
cost of providing those benefits 
which, particularly in the case 
of insured benefits, may vary from 
year to year, although the Committee 
is mindful of achieving the best 
value from benefit providers.

The maximum opportunity 
for participation in the all-employee 
share plans is the same for all 
employees and takes into account 
prevailing HMRC rules.

There are no performance 
conditions.

There are no performance

experience and 
performance
•  scope of the role
•  external market data, 

including other FTSE 100 
companies and other 
financial and non-
financial institutions
•  pay and conditions 

elsewhere in the Group

•  overall business 
performance.

There is no obligation 
to increase base pay upon 
any such review, and any 
decision to increase base 
pay will take into account 
the associated impact 
on overall quantum. 

There is no set maximum 
base pay, but any increases 
will normally be in line with 
the range of increases 
for other UK employees. 
In specific circumstances, 
the Committee may award 
increases above this level, 
for example where:
•  base pay for a recently 
appointed executive 
director has been set 
with a view to allowing 
progression in the role 
over time

•  there has been a 

significant increase in 
the size or scope of an 
executive director’s role 
or responsibilities
•  there is a significant 

change in the regulatory 
environment.

Personal performance will 
be taken into consideration 
in determining any base 
pay increase.

Legal & General Group Plc Annual report and accounts 2023

Governance

Incentivises and rewards the achievement of annual 
financial performance and delivery of strategic priorities.

50% of any AVP award is deferred into shares, 
reinforcing retention and alignment with shareholders 
by encouraging long-term focus and risk alignment.

In normal circumstances:
•  performance is assessed over a one-year period
•  performance measures and weightings are set 

annually to ensure they are appropriately stretching, 
and aligned with the Group’s strategic priorities
•  performance targets take into account internal 
forecasts, market expectations and prior year 
performance. Target normally equates to the 
forecast in the strategic plan, with maximum set 
at an appropriate stretch above plan, but still within 
the Company’s risk appetite

•  AVP awards are determined after the year end, 
taking into consideration performance against 
targets, individual performance, and overall 
business performance

•  50% of any AVP award is paid in cash, after the year 
end, with 50% deferred into restricted shares (or 
nil-cost options, or phantom equivalent, or other 
forms dependent upon business or regulatory 
requirements) for a further three years

•  dividends or dividend equivalents may accrue 

during the deferral period and vest and are paid 
in shares upon vesting

•  malus and clawback apply to both cash awards 

and deferred awards.

The maximum opportunity in respect of any financial 
year is:
•  up to 200% of base pay for the Chief Executive 
Officer and any executive director appointed 
after the approval by shareholders of the 
remuneration policy

•  150% of base pay for the current Chief 

Financial Officer.

No bonus is payable for threshold performance 
or below, with up to 50% of maximum for target 
performance.

•  The Committee will consider the calculated 
outcome in the context of a range of factors 
(not just the specific performance measures) 
including risk management, behaviours, culture, 
capital generation, Solvency II coverage ratio 
and sustainable financial performance, and may 
apply a ‘moderator’ to reduce (but not increase) 
an AVP award if there are factors that warrant 
such a reduction.

A combination of:
•  financial performance (primary measure with 

at least 70% weighting) – to ensure growth and 
return to shareholders

•  strategic and personal performance – to safeguard 
the future, with the development of future income 
streams, and focus on key metrics including 
customers, culture and ESG.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)

Non-executive directors’ fees

Shareholding requirements

Provides a direct and transparent link between executive pay 
and the delivery of shareholder returns over the longer term.

Compensates non-executive directors for their 
responsibilities and time commitment.

Purpose 
and link to 
strategy

Operation

A conditional award of shares (or nil-cost options, or phantom 
equivalent, or other forms dependent upon business or regulatory 
requirements). In normal circumstances: 
•  subject to a performance period of no less than three years 

and a further holding period of no less than two years following 
the end of the performance period

•  performance measures and targets are set annually by the 
Committee to ensure they are relevant and appropriately 
stretching, and aligned with the delivery of shareholder returns 
over the longer term

•  performance targets take into account internal forecasts, any 
guidance provided to the market, market expectations, prior 
performance, and the company’s risk appetite

•  dividends or dividend equivalents may accrue during the 

performance period based on the number of shares that vest 
but not those that have lapsed

•  malus and clawback apply.

Exceptionally, the Committee may adjust and amend the PSP 
awards in accordance with the rules, including:
•  lengthening the performance period and/ or the holding period 

for future awards

•  reducing (but not increasing) the level of vesting dependent upon 

the performance of the Group.

Opportunity 
or 
requirement

The maximum opportunity for an executive director in respect 
of any financial year is 300% of base pay.
•  15% of the award vests for threshold performance
•  100% of the award vests for achievement of maximum.

The Committee assesses the formulaic vesting outcome, and may 
amend the vesting downwards (but not increase the level of vesting) 
considering a range of factors including overall performance, 
risk management, capital generation, Solvency II coverage ratio, 
and ESG.

Provides alignment with 
shareholder returns and ensures 
the impact on directors’ 
shareholdings moves in line with 
Legal & General’s share price.

Executive directors are expected 
to retain any after-tax vested 
share awards until their 
shareholding requirements 
are met, and maintain that 
shareholding requirement 
(or their actual shareholding 
at the date of leaving, if lower) 
for at least two years after 
leaving employment with 
the Group.

The Committee retains the 
discretion to withhold future 
PSP grants if executive directors 
are not making sufficient 
progress towards their 
shareholding requirement.

Non-executive directors may 
elect to receive a proportion 
of their fees (normally 50%) 
in Legal & General shares until 
their shareholding requirement 
is met.

The sale of shares prior to the 
shareholding requirements 
being met may be permitted 
in extenuating situations, for 
example, a change to personal 
circumstances, ill health, etc.

Shares owned outright 
equivalent to:
•  325% of base pay for 
executive directors
•  100% of base fee for 

non-executive directors.

Fees for the Chair and non-executive directors 
are set at an appropriate level to reflect:
•  time commitment required to fulfil the role
•  responsibilities and duties of the positions
•  typical competitor practice in the FTSE 100 
and other financial services institutions.

Fees comprise a base fee for membership 
of the Board, plus (where applicable) additional 
fees for:
•  Senior Independent Director (SID)
•  Committee Chairship
•  Committee membership (not including 

the Nominations and Corporate Governance 
Committee)

•  Designated Workforce Director.

Additional fees for membership of Committee, 
or Chairship or membership of subsidiary 
Boards, or other fixed fees may apply if justified 
by time or commitment.

The Chair receives an inclusive fee for the role. 
The Chair’s fee is reviewed annually by the 
Committee, and the non-executive directors’ 
fees are reviewed by the executive directors. 
There is no obligation to increase fees upon 
any such review.

Fees are subject to the aggregate limit 
in the Company’s Articles of Association 
or any subsequent shareholder resolution. 
Any changes in this limit would be subject 
to shareholder approval.

The Chair and non-executive directors are not 
eligible to participate in any benefit, pension 
or incentive plan. However, additional benefits 
may be provided if the Board feels this is justified, 
such as tax compliance advice, work permits 
or similar. Expenses incurred in carrying out 
duties (and any associated tax liability) may 
be reimbursed or paid directly by the Company.

Performance

An appropriate mix (normally an equal weighting) of:
•  earnings performance – to incentivise growth in earnings
•  shareholder return – to deliver a competitive return for 

shareholders; and

•  strategic performance including ESG – to incentivise the delivery 

of broader aspects of the Company’s strategy.

The maximum weighting for any strategic measures will be 20%.

No performance conditions.

Recruitment Remuneration

Component

Overall approach

Policy and operation

The Committee will pay no more than it considers necessary to attract appropriate candidates, and it is not contemplated 
that remuneration will need to be different from the structure or exceed the limits set out in the remuneration policy table.

Maximum variable remuneration

The maximum variable remuneration will be in line with that set out in the remuneration policy table, that is 500% of base pay, 
excluding any compensation for awards forfeited on appointment.

Compensation for forfeited awards

As a result of regulations around the globe in the financial services sector, executives are likely to have accrued deferred 
remuneration which may be lost upon a change of employment. Accordingly, to aid the recruitment of a new executive 
director, the Committee may grant deferred cash and share awards to compensate for awards forfeited upon leaving 
a previous employer, taking into consideration relevant factors including:
•  the form of the award
•  any performance conditions
•  the vesting profile and likelihood of vesting
•  relevant regulatory requirements and guidance.

Any awards will reflect the terms and the value of the arrangements forgone, and any such compensation will be subject 
to forfeiture and clawback if the executive leaves the Company voluntarily within a fixed time period determined by the 
Committee, being not less than three years. Where possible the Committee will use existing share-based plans. 
However, in the event these are not appropriate, the Committee retains the discretion to use the Listing Rules exemption 
(LR 9.4.2) for the purpose of making an award to compensate for amounts forfeited upon leaving a previous employer.

For internal appointments, the Committee may continue to honour prior commitments made before joining the Board.

Relocation 

Where a new executive director has to relocate to take up the appointment, either within the UK or from overseas, practical 
and/ or financial support may be provided in relation to relocation or mobility including the cost of any tax incurred for 
a period not exceeding two years.

For appointments from overseas, certain home country benefits may continue to apply. Relocation and mobility support 
may also apply to the recruitment of a non-executive director.

The Committee will normally align the remuneration arrangements for new non-executive directors with those outlined within the policy table.

Termination and payments for loss of office

Component

Fixed pay

Annual Variable Pay (AVP)

Performance Share Plan (PSP)

Other payments

Policy and operation

Any termination payments in lieu of notice would consist solely of base pay and the cost of providing benefits for the 
outstanding notice period. Any statutory requirements will be observed. Our standard practice is to include within executive 
directors’ contractual terms mitigation provisions as regards to payments in lieu of notice.

Eligibility for annual variable pay, deferred annual variable pay awards and performance share awards are governed by their 
respective plan rules, as summarised below:
•  annual variable pay (AVP) – there is no automatic entitlement to an annual bonus in the year of cessation of employment. 
However, for a ‘good leaver’, the Committee may determine that an executive director will receive a bonus pro-rated for the 
period through to leaving based on targets and performance for the full year, and an assessment of overall business and 
personal performance

•  deferred AVP awards – in the event that a participant is a ‘good leaver’ any outstanding unvested deferred awards will 

normally be released in accordance with the ordinary timescale. Exceptionally, the Committee reserves the right 
to accelerate any vesting or payment, for example in the case of terminal illness.

Performance share plan (PSP) – unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that a participant is a ‘good leaver’ 
any unvested PSP awards will be pro-rated for the period through to leaving and vest based on targets and performance to the 
end of the performance period, with awards released at the normal times. Exceptionally, the Committee reserves the right 
to accelerate vesting or payment due, for example, in the case of terminal illness.

The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in connection with a director’s cessation of office/ 
employment where the payments are made in good faith in the discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of 
damages for breach of such obligation) or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of the 
director’s office/ employment, or for any fees for outplacement assistance and/ or director’s legal and/ or professional advice 
fees in connection with his/ her cessation of office/ employment.

‘Good leaver’ circumstances are leaving due to death, disability, ill-health or injury, redundancy, retirement with company agreement, the individual’s 
employing company/ business ceasing to be part of the Group, or other circumstances at the Committee’s discretion. For all other leavers, unvested 
awards lapse.

Awards will generally vest early upon a takeover of the Company, merger or other corporate reorganisation. Alternatively participants may be allowed 
or required to exchange their awards for new awards. If there is a demerger, delisting or special dividend or other transaction which may affect the 
share price, the Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a takeover.

António Simões Remuneration Disclosure

António Simões was formally appointed as Group CEO from 1 January 2024, following the announcement of his appointment in June 2023. As set 
out in the Chair’s letter on page 62, when determining an appropriate remuneration package the Committee considered our current remuneration 
practices and shareholder approved Remuneration Policy, relevant market practice and António’s remuneration levels at his previous employer.

Ongoing remuneration package
On appointment, the key elements of António’s remuneration package will consist of:

•  a base pay of £1,175k, which is between the median and upper quartile of FTSE 100 financial services companies
•  pension of 10% of salary, in line with the rate offered to the wider workforce during 2023
•  benefits in line with our remuneration policy, including relocation support to assist with António’s move from Spain. Relocation support is provided 

for 12 months only

•  a maximum AVP of 200% of base pay
•  a maximum PSP of 300% of base pay.

These are the maximum AVP and PSP levels of remuneration we can offer under our remuneration policy and are also broadly the median 
opportunities of other FTSE 100 financial services companies.

Replacement award
As is common practice in Financial Services, and in particular in banking, António had numerous unvested awards which he forfeited as a result 
of joining Legal & General. Our policy on recruitment remuneration provides, that in these circumstance, the Committee may grant awards 
equivalent to the remuneration arrangements forfeited upon leaving the previous employer, taking into consideration relevant factors including 
but not limited to, the form of the award, any performance conditions attached to those awards, the vesting profile and likelihood of vesting and 
any relevant regulatory requirements and guidance in relation to awards. 

All awards will be replaced on a ‘like for like basis’, meaning that:

•  deferred cash and share awards have been bought out in cash/ shares respectively
•  all buyout awards will have identical vesting/ deferral periods to the original awards
•  for all awards with performance conditions we have calculated how performance was tracking against targets in order to determine a fair value 

for each award.

Accordingly, in accordance with our policy on recruitment remuneration, the following cash and share awards will be granted to António, subject 
to malus and clawback, matching as close as possible both the expected value and timescale to vesting of his forfeited Santander awards.

In recognition of the forfeit of annual bonus for 2023 from António’s previous employer, a payment of £3,079,242 will be awarded of which 50% 
will be paid in cash at the end of March 2024 and 50% will be granted as shares in April 2024, vesting 3 years from the date of grant.

In addition, in recognition of the forfeit of other unvested awards the following cash and share awards will be made:

Strategic objectives comprise a qualitative assessment by the Remuneration Committee of operational performance and risk management, 
customer and culture metrics, and other strategic objectives set by the Committee, including ESG objectives. A qualitative assessment, rather 
than an outcome based only on pre-determined numerical targets, is considered more appropriate for the assessment of strategic objectives, 
as this enables the Committee to consider performance in the context of a range of factors and changing situations during the year.

Key focus areas are identified at the beginning of each year, and strategic objectives may be set individually for each executive director or assessed as their 
individual contribution to joint objectives. Normally, 10% of the total bonus opportunity is allocated to each category encompassing:

•  Strategy: focus on safeguarding the future of the company and developing future income streams.
•  Culture & Customer: based on a range of metrics which reflect the impact of culture on employees and customers, including customer performance scores 

and feedback, employee engagement scores, and progress against gender and other diversity goals.

•  Risk: supported by analysis from the Chief Risk Officer, using quantitative and qualitative metrics, including divisional and group operational performance, 

capital management, prudential risk, IT and cyber risk, and internal audit.

•  Environmental: (moderator*): progress against key environmental commitments as referenced in our 2023 Climate and nature report and increase in the 
prominence of sustainability considerations in commercial decisions taken during the year (including operational, investment and product development 
decisions).  
*ESG metrics are incorporated into the existing strategic and personal performance measures, rather than a separate or additional component. AVP may 
be reduced if insufficient progress is made against ESG metrics.

In addition, the Committee considers the Solvency II coverage ratio (2023: 224%) and sustainable financial performance, and may apply a ‘moderator’ to reduce 
(but not increase) an AVP award if there are factors that warrant such a reduction. For 2023, it was determined that no adjustment was necessary to the 
calculated AVP award.

Risk consideration
The Committee reviewed a comprehensive report from the Chief Risk Officer to ascertain that the executive directors’ objectives had been 
fulfilled within the risk appetite of the Group. In addition, the Committee received feedback from the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance 
function that there were no issues to consider relating to regulatory breaches or customer outcomes that would prevent payment of any AVP 
award or trigger a recommendation that malus should be applied. The Committee was satisfied that the AVP awards should be paid.

Deferral policy
In line with the remuneration policy, 50% of all 2023 AVP awards have been deferred for three years into restricted shares, subject to continued 
employment and with malus and clawback provisions. 

AVP potential 2024
In line with the remuneration policy, for 2024 the target and maximum AVP opportunities for our executive directors will be:

The proportion of the AVP measures assessed against financial metrics will remain 70%, with 30% assessed against non-financial objectives. 
Financial metrics will cover profitability and growth, aligned to António’s strategic review. Group financial targets will be disclosed in the 2024 
annual report. Some strategic and personal targets are considered confidential and will not be disclosed in any future report.

In line with the remuneration policy, 50% of all 2024 AVP awards will be deferred for three years into restricted shares, subject to continued 
employment, with malus and clawback provisions.

Details of how the 2021 PSP award vested
The 2021 PSP award vested at 61.1% of maximum in March 2024 based on a combination of total shareholder return (TSR) out-performance (50%) 
and earnings per share (EPS) growth (50%) over the three-year performance period ended 31 December 2023. A summary of the outcome per 
measure is below, with further detail provided on page 108.

The Committee reviewed the company’s overall performance taking into consideration an assessment of Solvency II performance and progress 
against long-term environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives. The Committee was satisfied that the PSP awards should vest 
in accordance with the TSR and EPS growth outcomes.

Approach to calculation of EPS growth
EPS growth is determined based on measuring the change in EPS over the 3 year performance period. However, as previously indicated, the 
introduction of IFRS 17 prevents EPS from being measured on the same basis from the start of the performance period (where EPS was reported 
based on IFRS 4) to the end of the performance period (where EPS was reported based on IFRS 17). In order to fairly measure the EPS growth 
performance, the Committee has considered the annual change in each of the three years, as the EPS for 2022 has been reported on both an IFRS 4 
and IFRS 17 basis. The basis for the calculation is illustrated in the table below:

1.  TSR is calculated in accordance with the Performance Share Plan rules using the three-month average prior to the start and end of the performance period.

The PSP award will vest on 8 March 2024. As the share price at the date of vesting was not known as of the date of this report, the value included in the ‘single 
figure’ of remuneration on page 104 has been calculated based on the number of shares vesting multiplied by the average share price over the quarter ended 
31 December 2023 (226.3p). The actual share price and value at vesting will be reported in the 2024 annual report.

Performance Share Plan (PSP) 2024 awards: António Simões will be granted an award with a face value of 300% of base pay and Jeff Davies 
will be granted an award with a face value of 250% of base pay

For the 2024 award, the following performance measures will be used:

•  TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100 (20% of award)
•  TSR performance relative to a bespoke comparator group of companies (20% of award), noting that the bespoke comparator group will 

be unchanged from the 2023 PSP

•  EPS growth (40% of award)
•  progress against published commitments in our Climate transition plan, aligned to our three-pillar strategy of Invest, Influence, Operate 

(20% of award) as detailed in the table on the following page.

Vesting of the overall awards will also be subject to assessment against Solvency II objectives.

In setting targets for the 2024 PSP awards the Committee have considered:

the business plan over the next three years, market expectations of performance
the impact of the new IFRS 17 accounting standard on the timing of the reporting of profit

• 
• 
•  progress against our published commitments with the Climate transition plan and projected progress over the performance period.

Based on these considerations the Committee considered it appropriate to for vesting to be based on performance as set out in the table 
on the following page.

In determining the final outcome for the Climate transition measures, the Remuneration Committee may make a downwards adjustment if they are not satisfied 
that positive and sufficient progress has been made against our target of 70% of eligible AUM to be managed in alignment with net zero1.
The Remuneration Committee will also consider material market movements or business composition changes when assessing the final outcome and may 
make adjustments to the outcome as a result.

Performance conditions for PSP awards granted in 2023
The PSP awards were granted on 6 April 2023. 25% of the award will vest based on TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100, 25% of the 
award will vest based on TSR performance relative to a bespoke peer group (comprising Abrdn, Aegon, Ageas, Allianz, Assicurazioni Generali, 
Aviva, AXA, CNP Assurances, Gjensidige Forsikring, Hannover Rueck, Lincoln National, M&G, Mapfre, Metlife, Muenchener Ruck, NN Group, 
Phoenix Group, Principal Financial, Prudential Financial, Prudential, Sampo A, Swiss Re, Talanx and Zurich Insurance Group), and 50% of the 
award will vest based on the EPS growth. Vesting will be based on performance as set out in the table below:

Performance below threshold results in a nil vesting, and performance between threshold and maximum vests on a straight line basis 
between 15% and 100% of maximum.

At the end of the three-year performance period commencing 1 January 2023, the Committee will assess whether the formulaic vesting 
outcome is justified by looking at a number of factors including: whether the result is reflective of overall performance and has been achieved 
within the company’s risk appetite, the Solvency II coverage ratio, the quality of earnings, the nature of any changes in leverage or key 
assumptions and progress against long-term ESG objectives. If such considerations mean that the formulaic outcome of the vesting is not 
considered to be justified, the Committee can amend the vesting downwards (but not increase the level of vesting).

Notes
Shares used for the above calculation exclude those with performance conditions, any unexercised options, those shares subject to a period of deferral and any shares held 
in a private trust where the executive director is not a trustee. They include vested shares where the executive director has beneficial ownership, shares independently acquired 
in the market and those held by a spouse or civil partner or dependant child under the age of 18 years.

Although the shareholding requirement is not contractually binding, executive directors are expected to retain any after tax vested share 
awards until their shareholding requirements are met, and maintain that shareholding requirement (or their actual shareholding at the date 
of leaving, if lower) for at least two years after leaving employment. The Committee retains the discretion to withhold future grants under the 
PSP if executives are not making sufficient progress towards their shareholding requirement. Once shareholding requirements have been met, 
executive directors may sell shares in excess of the shareholding requirement if they wish. The Committee has discretion to allow executive 
directors to sell shares prior to the shareholding requirement being met in extenuating situations, for example, a change to personal 
circumstances or ill health, etc.

Share options exercised during 2023
PSP awards may be granted in the form of nil-cost options with an exercise date no earlier than the normal vesting date. Executive directors

Remuneration for employees below Board
General remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy is designed to reward, motivate and retain high performers in line with the risk appetite of the Group. Remuneration 
is considered within the overall context of the Group’s sector and the markets in which it operates. The policy for the majority of employees is to pay 
around the relevant mid-market range with a competitive package designed to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, and with 
an appropriate proportion of total remuneration dependent upon performance. 

We define core remuneration as base pay, annual bonus and other benefits such as pension. Key employees are also eligible to participate 
in a long-term incentive plan, typically either the Share Bonus Plan (SBP) for the majority of employees or the Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
for the most senior management.

Policy

We aim to attract and retain key employees by paying base pay which delivers competitive total remuneration. 
Factors taken into account when determining salaries include:
•  the individual’s skills, experience and performance
•  scope of the role
•  external market data
•  pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group
•  overall business performance.

As a member of the Living Wage Foundation, base pay is also set with reference to the Foundation’s UK and London living 
wage levels. During 2023 the average increase was around 5.8% but with increases applied on a stratified basis with the 
lowest paid employees (less than £25,000) receiving, on average, the highest increases (generally 7.5%). For 2024 the average 
increase was 4.3%, applied again on a stratified basis with more junior employees receiving increases, on average, of 5%.

All UK employees have access to private medical insurance, life insurance, and a range of family-friendly policies (maternity, 
paternity, adoption and shared parental leave). In addition there are several wellbeing support packages including Unmind 
(a mental health app), childcare and elderly care support. Employees of non-UK business are provided with benefits in line 
with the local market.

All employees are given the opportunity to participate in a group pension scheme. The pension opportunity offered 
to the majority of the UK workforce in 2023 was 10% of base pay. With effect from 1 April 2024 the pension opportunity 
for the majority of the UK workforce was increased to 11%, with further increases planned over the next 5 years to align 
the pension opportunity with that for senior managers. Employees of non-UK business are provided with pension provision 
in line with the local market practice and legislative requirements.

The majority of employees participate in a discretionary bonus plan, unless an alternative plan applies based on role. 
An employee will be considered for a discretionary bonus award based on achievement against objectives, conduct 
and behaviours, the role performed during that year and internal relativities.

The Group operates bespoke bonus plans where business appropriate. However, the Remuneration Committee has ultimate 
discretion over all bonus plans.

Bonuses above a certain threshold are subject to deferral. Deferred awards are normally held in shares for three years 
and are subject to malus and clawback.

The company reserves the right to adjust deferral levels for Material Risk Takers and Code staff as deemed necessary 
to comply with regulatory requirements.

Share bonus plan (SBP)

Key employees, including senior managers, high performing and high-potential individuals and those with critical skills 
may receive SBP awards, typically in the form of restricted shares vesting three years from the grant date.

SBP is also used as the vehicle for deferral of annual bonuses in the majority of cases.

Performance 
share plan (PSP)

Participation in the PSP is offered to a small number of senior management each year in recognition of the strategic 
and influential role that they hold in terms of driving company performance, as well as their individual contribution. 
Participation in the plan for one year does not guarantee participation in future years.

PSP awards were made to around 18 employees during 2023.

Where appropriate, grants under the PSP may also be made for new employees who join the company during the year 
in key roles.

Other

Employee 
share plans

All employees are given the opportunity to participate in a ShareSave plan and an Employee Share Purchase plan. 
These are both HMRC-approved plans which offer all employees the opportunity to share in the success of the business.

Annual equal pay review
The Group seeks to ensure that our pay policies and practices are free from unfair bias. Part of the pay review process is an annual equal pay review 
that reviews pay and bonus decisions by gender, ethnicity, age and full-time versus part-time working. In addition, it considers the application of the 
pay policy more widely, in particular looking at decisions made in the annual pay review across grades, functions and divisions.

Gender pay reporting
The Group has published a new Social impact report, which contains the statutory disclosure of our gender pay gap for 2023.

Pay ratio in relation to the Group Chief Executive Officer
Since 2016 we have voluntarily disclosed details of the pay ratio in relation to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the wider UK employee 
population. From 2018 we made some amendments to how we report the information in order to align with the reporting requirements set 
out by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), which came into effect for financial years starting 1 January 2019.

The tables below provide the ratio between the base pay and single figure total remuneration of the Group Chief Executive Officer and the base 
pay and total remuneration of UK employees at the upper quartile (75th percentile), median (50th percentile) and lower quartile (25th percentile).

Pay ratio commentary
Between 2022 and 2023 the ratio of total remuneration for the Group CEO compared to UK employees has decreased. The decrease is principally 
the result of the lower value of variable remuneration for the Group CEO in 2023, in particular the lower AVP award, which has contributed to around 
a 20% reduction in the single figure total remuneration when compared with 2022. Variable remuneration makes up a greater proportion 
of remuneration for Executive Directors and senior managers compared to the wider workforce and is more directly linked to financial performance.

Methodology
The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 permit different options for calculating the pay ratio. We have chosen option B as our 
method for calculating the pay ratio for 2023, consistent with the methodology for gender pay reporting. The total remuneration figures for the UK 
employees are based on salaries at 1 December 2023. Bonus amounts for 2023 are not able to be determined for some eligible employees until 
after publication of this report, and therefore it is not possible to determine the exact 2023 total remuneration for all UK employees as is required 
for option A within this timescale. For completeness and transparency, we have included the pay ratios based on the option A method for previous 
years and we will also retrospectively disclose the pay ratio for 2023 based on the option A method in the 2024 report. We do not believe that this 
will result in pay ratio figures that are materially different to the 2023 figures disclosed above.

Social impact report
Our 2023 Social impact report is 
available on our Group website.

 The increase in fees for non-executive directors of the company reflects the increases in committee membership fees as well as changes in the membership of the committees.
 Tushar Morzaria and Carolyn Johnson were appointed to the Board on 22 May 2022 and 17 June 2022 respectively, and the percentage increases for these non-executive directors 
are based on the change in annualised fees for 2022 compared with 2023. 

3.   The increase in fees for Laura Wade-Gery reflects her increased committee memberships and the increase in fee for her role as the Chair of the Data and Technology Committee.

As with prior years, the whole UK employee population has been selected as the comparator group. This group was chosen because it includes a wider 
cross section of the Group’s employees. The increase in benefits for the employee comparator group relates to the impact of base pay increases.

Relative importance of spend on pay
The chart opposite shows the relative importance of expenditure on pay 
compared to share dividends, adjusted operating profit and tax for the 
year. Adjusted operating profit has been shown because it is a key 
performance indicator of the business. Further information on tax is on 
pages 233 to 237. No share buybacks were made in 2022 or 2023.

At the invitation of the Remuneration Committee, the Group Chair attends Committee meetings. Where appropriate, the Group Chief Executive, 
the Group HR Director, Group Reward Director, Head of Executive Compensation, Director of Group Finance, Group Chief Risk Officer and Group 
Climate Director also attend meetings. No person is present during any discussion relating to that person’s own remuneration.

At the invitation of the Remuneration Committee, a representative from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) also attends Committee meetings. 
During 2023, PwC principally advised the Committee on external developments affecting remuneration as well as specific matters raised by the 
Remuneration Committee. PwC were appointed by the Committee. The Committee reflects on the quality of advice provided and whether it properly 
addresses the issues under consideration as part of its normal deliberations. The Committee is satisfied that the advice received from the PwC 
engagement team is objective and independent. PwC are signatories to the Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code of Conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The total fees paid to PwC in relation to Remuneration Committee work during 2023 were £198,600 
(excluding VAT). While fee estimates are required for bespoke pieces of work, fees are generally charged based on time with hourly rates in line with 
the level of expertise and seniority of the advisor concerned. During the year, PwC also provided the company with HR consulting services including 
advice to management on regulatory aspects of reward, as well as other professional services including tax, consulting, accounting, regulatory 
compliance, and other advice to the Group.

Considering risk
The Reward Steering Committee (RSC) and the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function make a key contribution to the process of designing 
reward structures and evaluating whether achievement of objectives and any payment from plans have taken into account the overall risk profile 
of the Group.

Reward Steering Committee (RSC)
Reporting to the Remuneration Committee, the RSC helps set the framework within which incentive arrangements are normally reviewed and 
implemented, with a view to supporting business strategy, whilst acting within the Group’s risk appetite. The members of the RSC include the Group 
Chief Risk Officer, Non-financial Risk Director, Regulatory Risk Director, LGIM Chief Compliance Officer, the Director of Group Finance, the Group 
Reward Director and the Head of Executive Compensation.

Where a business unit tables a proposal for consideration, the relevant business manager is required to attend the RSC meeting to explain 
the background and to answer any questions from the RSC.

Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function
The Remuneration Committee also works closely with the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function with respect to remuneration proposals.

In particular, the function reports to the Committee on an annual basis on whether any risks have been taken outside of pre-agreed parameters, 
whether there have been regulatory breaches, or whether they are aware of any other considerations that may lead the Committee to consider 
whether it should impact payments to employees (including in particular the executive directors and Code staff).

The Group Chief Risk Officer also specifically looks at the overall risk profile of the Group and whether executive directors have achieved objectives 
within the Group’s accepted risk appetite, and also reviews the executive directors’ objectives for the forthcoming year to ensure they are in line with 
the risk parameters.

Since the implementation of a new Solvency II remuneration policy in 2016, the scope of the Group Chief Risk Officer’s report has been extended 
to consider whether there are any risk considerations which may warrant adjustments to the overall level of corporate annual variable pay awards.

Engagement with key stakeholders
The Committee seeks to maintain an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate 
governance and any changes to the Group’s executive pay arrangements. During 2022, we reviewed our approach to remuneration in the context 
of future business strategy, updated investor guidelines and evolving best practice, and sought feedback from shareholders and representative 
bodies. The responses that we received helped shape our thinking with respect to the new remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders 
at the 2023 AGM in May 2023.

During 2024 the Committee will continue to closely examine our remuneration principles and policies to ensure they remain appropriate in the 
context of future business strategy, updated investor guidelines and evolving best practice and will consult with the Group’s largest shareholders 
on any proposed changes.

We engaged regularly with our workforce throughout 2023, including via our workforce representative bodies Unite (the trade union) and our 
Management Consultative Forum on a number of topics, including pay, and propose to continue this dialogue in 2024, including in relation 
to our new remuneration policy.

Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are 
described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion and 
matters included in this report are consistent with those discussed and included in our reporting to the Audit Committee. 

We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including 
the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.

2. Overview of our audit

Factors driving our view of risks
Following our 2022 audit, and considering developments affecting the Group 
since then, we have updated our audit risk assessment for Key Audit Matters 
(KAMs) previously identified. 

The risk associated with the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities 
KAM (4.1) is predominantly driven by the inherent subjectivity associated with 
the longevity, expense and credit risk assumptions for UK annuity policyholder 
liabilities. We continue to consider the impact of external factors such as the 
current uncertain economic conditions including high inflation and higher market 
interest rates affecting the credit risk of assets backing annuity liabilities and the 
result of excess deaths on longevity assumptions. The risk in the current year has 
been further elevated due to the first time adoption of IFRS 17 Insurance contracts 
requiring certain methodologies and assumptions to be determined for the first 
time and applied retrospectively.

The risk associated with the valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments KAM 
(4.2) is predominantly driven by the significant estimation uncertainty associated 
with valuing Level 3 investments, specifically UK lifetime mortgages, private credit 
portfolios, and investment property.

We have removed the pre-transition IFRS 17 insurance contract disclosure KAM 
from our 2022 report and included the relevant risks within the valuation of UK 
annuity policyholder liabilities KAM (4.1).

The continuing financial significance of the parent company’s investment in 
subsidiaries drives the identification of recoverability of the parent company’s 
investment in subsidiaries as a key area of focus for the parent company’s audit 
(4.3).

Audit Committee interaction
During the year, the Audit Committee met 6 times. KPMG are invited to attend all Audit Committee meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with the 
Audit Committee in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the Audit 
Committee in Section 4, including matters that required particular judgement.

The matters included in the Audit Committee report on page 86 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings. 

Our independence
We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of 
the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical 
Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.

We have not performed any non-audit services during 2023 or subsequently 
which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.

We were first appointed as auditor by the directors for the year ended 
31 December 2018. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 
6 financial years ended 31 December 2023.

The Group engagement partner is required to rotate every 5 years. As these are 
the first set of the Group’s financial statements signed by Philip Smart, he will be 
required to rotate off after the 2027 audit. 

The average tenure of partners responsible for component audits as set out in 
Section 7 below is 3 years, with the shortest being 1 and the longest being 5.

Materiality (Item 6 below)
The scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and our assessed 
risk of material misstatement. 

Materiality levels used in our audit
Materiality levels used in our audit
Group

We have determined overall materiality for the Group financial statements as a 
whole at £82.9m (2022: £113.0m) and for the parent company financial 
statements as a whole at £33.0m (2022: £45.0m). 

Consistent with 2022, we determined that profit before tax from continuing 
operations (PBTCO) normalised to exclude this year’s investment and other 
variances and losses attributable to non-controlling interests remains the 
benchmark for the Group due to its importance to users of the financial 
statements because the share price is more sensitive to changes in the PBTCO 
than other metrics. As such, we based our Group materiality on the normalised 
PBTCO of which it represents 4.87% (2022: 4.71% with reference to a benchmark 
under IFRS 4). 

In addition, we applied materiality of £3.3bn (2022: £3.3bn) to the unit linked 
assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Income 
Statement and related notes, of which it represents 0.9% (2022: 0.9%) of unit 
linked assets and liabilities, in accordance with FRC Practice Note 20 The Audit 
of Insurers in the United Kingdom.

Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at 
£33.0m (2022: £45.0m), which is the component materiality for the parent 
company determined by the Group audit engagement team. This is lower than 
the materiality we would otherwise have determined with reference to parent 
company net assets (2022: total assets), of which it represents 0.47% (2022: 
0.36%). We selected net assets as the benchmark in the current period due to 
the users of the financial statements focus on the parent entity’s capital and 
distributions.

We have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to determine 
which of the Group’s components are likely to include risks of material 
misstatement to the Group financial statements, the type of procedures to be 
performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from 
our component auditors around the world.

We have performed audit procedures centrally across the Group, set out in more 
detail in Section 7. 

Of the Group’s 16 (2022: 12) in-scope reporting components, we subjected 7 
(2022: 7) to full scope audits for Group purposes, 3 (2022: 1) to audit of account 
balance and 6 (2022: 4) to specified risk-focused audit procedures. The latter 
were not individually financially significant enough to require a full scope audit 
for Group purposes but did present specific individual risks that needed to be 
addressed. We have increased our in-scope reporting components in 2023 as 
a result of the reduction in insurance profits under IFRS 17 as a portion of the 
Group’s profit before tax to ensure we have sufficient coverage over profit 
metrics. The components within the scope of our work accounted for the 
percentages illustrated opposite.

In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining 
components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist 
in those components, set out in more detail in Section 7. For the residual 
components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine 
our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement 
within these.

The Group team visited component locations in London, Edinburgh, and 
Baltimore, USA to assess the audit risk and strategy and the component team 
responses and findings to the identified risks. Video and telephone conference 
meetings were also held with those component auditors that were not physically 
visited. At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to the Group team 
were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team 
was then performed by the component auditor. Further details are set out in 
Section 7.

We consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit Committee, 
to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Legal & General Group Plc continued

On the basis of the risk assessment procedures performed above and taking 
into account the nature of the Group’s assets and basis of the related valuations, 
we concluded that, while climate change may pose a risk to the determination of 
asset values, the risk was not significant in the current year. As a result, there 
was no significant impact from climate change on our KAMs.

We have also read the disclosures of climate related information in the Strategic 
Report as set out on pages 41 to 45 and considered consistency with the 
financial statements and our audit knowledge. We have not been engaged to 
provide assurance over the accuracy of these disclosures.

The impact of climate change on our audit
In planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of climate change 
on the Group’s business and its financial statements.

Climate change, and the associated initiatives and commitments, impact the 
Group in a variety of ways including the potential financial risks which could 
arise from the associated physical and transition risks and the greater narrative 
and disclosure of the impact of climate change risk that is incorporated into the 
Annual report and accounts. The Group’s exposure to climate change is 
primarily through climate related transition risks which potentially impact the 
carrying amount of investments and potential reputational risk associated with 
the Group’s delivery of its climate related commitments. The Group has set out 
its commitments under the Paris objective to achieve net zero carbon emissions 
by 2050 in its Strategic Report on page 45.

As a part of our audit we have made enquiries of management to understand 
the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the Group’s financial 
statements, including how climate is considered as part of the investment 
making and monitoring processes, and the Group’s preparedness for this. 
We have performed a risk assessment of how the impact of climate change 
may affect the financial statements and our audit. This included evaluating the 
impact of management’s stress test scenarios and holding discussions with 
our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment. 

3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties
The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company 
or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group’s and the parent company’s financial position means that this is realistic. 
They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going 
concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”).

Going concern

We used our knowledge of the Group and parent company, its industry, and the 
general economic environment in which it operates to identify the inherent risks 
to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group and 
parent company’s financial resources or ability to continue operations over the 
going concern period. The risks that were considered most likely to adversely 
affect the Group’s and parent company’s available financial resources over this 
period were:

•  Adverse impacts arising from fluctuations or negative trends in the economic 
environment including, but not limited to, wider credit spreads and defaults 
which affect regulatory capital solvency coverage ratios, liquidity ratios, the 
valuations of the Group’s hard to value (Level 3) investments that require 
judgement and valuation of insurance contract liabilities; and 

Our conclusions
•  We consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 

in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;

•  We have not identified, and concur with the directors’ assessment that there is 
not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or 
collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;

•  We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ 

statement in Note 1 (ii) to the financial statements on the use of the going 
concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt over the Group and parent company’s use of that basis for the 
going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in Note 1 (ii) 
to be acceptable; and

•  Severely adverse policyholder lapse or claims experience.

•  The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 267 is materially 

consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.

We also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such 
as the failure of counterparties who have transactions with the Group (such as 
banks and reinsurers), which could result in a rapid reduction of available 
financial resources. 

We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the 
going concern period by comparing severe, but plausible downside scenarios 
that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level 
of available financial resources by the Group’s financial forecasts. 

We considered whether the going concern disclosure in Note 1 (ii) to the 
financial statements gives an accurate description of the directors’ assessment 
of going concern, including the identified risks and related sensitivities.

Accordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors’ use of the 
going concern basis of preparation without any material uncertainty for the 
Group and parent company to be appropriate. However, as we cannot predict all 
future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes 
that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they 
were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the 
parent company will continue in operation.

Our reporting
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to these 
disclosures.

We have concluded that these disclosures are materially consistent with the 
financial statements and our audit knowledge.

Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability 

Our responsibility 
We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material 
inconsistency between the directors’ disclosures in respect of emerging and 
principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our 
audit knowledge.

Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to:

•  the directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on page 56 that they 

have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity; 

•  the risks and uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and how 

emerging risks are identified and explaining how they are being managed and 
mitigated; and 

•  the directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how they have assessed 
the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions. 

We are also required to review the viability statement set out on page 55 under 
the Listing Rules.

Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the 
knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot 
predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in 
outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the 
time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is 
not a guarantee as to the Group’s and parent company’s longer-term viability.

4. Key audit matters

What we mean

KAMs are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: 

•  the overall audit strategy; 
•  the allocation of resources in the audit; and
•  directing the efforts of the engagement team. 

We include below the Key Audit Matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and our results from 
those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

first year of implementation of IFRS 17. 

2023: Acceptable

Transition: Acceptable

Our assessment of risk vs 2022

Our results

The implementation of IFRS 17 has resulted in the entity applying the transitional 
rules in the standard which have a consequential effect on the transition date 
balance sheet, subsequent balance sheets and the period profit and loss 
accounts. The insurance contract liabilities balance now primarily consists of the 
present value of future cash flows, risk adjustment for non-financial risk and 
contractual service margin (CSM) components. 

Subjective valuation: 
The valuation of insurance contract liabilities is an inherently subjective area, 
requiring management judgement in the setting of key assumptions. The 
longevity, credit risk, and expense assumptions involve the greatest level of 
subjectivity. A small change in these assumptions can have a significant impact 
on the estimates of future cash flows. We consider the risk to remain heightened 
in the current year due to the higher degree of estimation uncertainty resulting 
from changes in demographic trends, including those triggered by the 
Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) and ongoing economic uncertainties as a 
result of high inflation and higher market interest rates.

The risk in the current year has been further elevated due to the first-time 
adoption of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts requiring certain methodologies and 
assumptions to be determined for the first time. 

Longevity assumptions 
Longevity assumptions have two main components: mortality base assumptions 
and the rate of mortality improvements. The changing trends in longevity and 
emerging medical trends mean there is a high level of uncertainty in the 
assumptions. This uncertainty continues to be heightened in the current year due 
to the potential medium and long-term impacts of a variety of factors that are 
driving excess deaths. There is also a high degree of reliance on Continuous 
Mortality Investigations (CMI) models. Hence, there is a risk that other mortality 
and health data sources are not appropriately considered under the assumption 
setting methodology. 

Credit assumptions
The Group’s current discount rates are derived by adjusting a reference asset 
portfolio for risks not present in the related insurance liabilities, in particular 
credit risk, such that the discount rate includes a yield above the risk-free rate 
that appropriately reflects the risks in the liabilities, in particular their illiquid 
nature. The credit risk deduction methodology is judgmental and small changes 
in this can have a significant impact on the present value of future cash flows.

The assumptions surrounding this deduction require significant judgement and 
there is a risk that current actual default experience and anticipated trends are 
not appropriately reflected. This is particularly significant during the current 
uncertain economic conditions of high inflation and higher market interest rates.

IFRS 4 did not require entities to discount insurance liabilities in the same way 
that IFRS 17 does and therefore the Group has had to determine the discount 
rates to be applied both in the current and preceding years.

Expense assumptions
Judgement is required in setting the maintenance expense assumption which 
is based on management’s long-term view of the expected future costs of 
administering the underlying policies, and is also informed by the allocation 
between cost centres and determination of costs that are directly attributable 
to the maintenance of annuity insurance contracts.

Like discount rates above, IFRS 4 did not require entities to identify and allocate 
expense assumptions in the same way that IFRS 17 does and therefore the Group 
has had to determine the expense assumptions to be applied both in the current 
and preceding years.

Our response to the risk

We used our own actuarial specialists in order to assist us in performing 
procedures over methodology choice and assumptions in this area. Our 
procedures to address the risk included:

•  Control design and re-performance: testing reconciliation controls designed 
to ensure completeness of data flows from policy administration systems to 
the actuarial models. With the assistance of our IT audit specialists, testing 
controls over the accuracy of data flows and data conversions from policy 
administration systems to the actuarial valuation models.

•  Test of detail: testing the completeness of data used in the valuation of 
annuity liabilities by reconciling the data from the policy administration 
system to the data used in the actuarial models.

•  Test of detail: by utilising data and analytics procedures, testing the accuracy 
of historical data input into the actuarial model by comparing the data used 
for reporting as at 31 December 2023 to the data used for reporting as at 
31 December 2022 in relation to policies that were in force at that time.

•  Test of detail: tracing a sample of new business policyholder data inputs into 

the actuarial valuation model to the underlying policy documents.

•  Test of detail: reconciling the completeness and accuracy of the assets used 
in the calculation of the current discount rate to the assets in the reference 
portfolio.

•  Test of detail: for a sample of assets, validating the accuracy of the asset data 
used to project the cash flows used to derive the yield used in the calculation 
of the current discount rate and, with the assistance of our valuation 
specialists, re-projecting these cash flows. 

•  Historical comparisons: evaluating whether the expense assumptions reflect 

the expected future costs of administering the underlying policies by 
considering the historical accuracy of management’s forecast expenses and 
analysing the allocations of the forecast 2024 costs to directly attributable 
maintenance expenses with reference to the historical allocations.

•  Methodology choice: assessing the appropriateness of the methodology for 
selecting assumptions by applying our understanding of developments in the 
business and expectations derived from market experience, including 
consideration of the effects of uncertain economic conditions on policyholder 
mortality and credit risk. For longevity assumptions, this includes 
consideration of the cause of death modelling performed by management and 
other non-CMI sources alongside the CMI modelling used across the industry.
•  Accounting analysis: assessing whether the Group’s proposed methodology 
for determining the discount rate credit deduction and reference portfolios is 
consistent with the requirements of IFRS 17.

•  Benchmarking assumptions: assessing mortality improvement assumptions 
against industry data on expected future mortality rate improvements and 
industry historic mortality improvement rates and assessing the 
appropriateness of the credit risk assumptions by comparing to industry 
practice and our expectations derived from market experience.

•  Historical comparisons: evaluating the mortality base assumptions used in 
the valuation of the annuity liabilities by comparing to the Group’s historic 
mortality experience.

UK deferred annuity coverage units
•  Accounting analysis: assessing whether management’s proposed UK 

deferred annuity coverage unit methodology is consistent with IFRS 17 and 
related guidance.

•  Our sector experience: evaluating whether management’s proposed UK 

deferred annuity coverage unit methodology is consistent with our 
understanding of the services delivered to the policyholder over the duration 
of the annuity contract. 

•  Scenario analysis: assessing whether under management’s methodology, 

the calculation of coverage units, and their associated weightings, produces 
impacts on the profile of profit recognition that were consistent with our 
expectations based on our understanding of the services delivered to the 
policyholder over the duration of the annuity contract considering the impact 
of possible scenarios.

4.1 Valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities (Group)

Description of the key audit matter

Our response to the risk

Transition fair value approach and expected internal rate of return
•  Our sector experience: evaluating management’s approach to the fair value 
calculation and in particular the assertion that the methodology the Group 
applies in pricing bulk annuity transactions, including the application of a 
pricing IRR, is appropriate to be used in the valuation of the pre-2016 UK 
annuity portfolio given the Group’s participation in the bulk annuity market.
•  Benchmarking assumptions: evaluating and challenging the proposed IRR by 
comparing to the rate implied by recent bulk annuity transactions as at the 
transition balance sheet date.

•  Benchmarking assumptions: validating that the Group’s assumption that the 
primary constraint is Solvency II capital requirements is consistent with the 
market through benchmarking against other annuity writers.

•  Evaluating external valuations: the Group engaged an external expert to 

report on the valuation of the pre-2016 annuity liabilities; we evaluated this 
report including assessing the expert’s competence and objectivity, and 
comparing the Group’s valuation, resulting from the application of the IRR, 
to the valuation range determined by an external expert.

•  Assessing transparency: considering whether the disclosures in relation to 

the assumptions used in the calculation of the valuation of insurance contract 
liabilities are compliant with the relevant accounting requirements and 
appropriately represent the sensitivities of these assumptions to alternative 
scenarios and inputs.

UK deferred annuity coverage units
The CSM recognised at the inception of an insurance contract should be released 
to profit over the duration of the contract to reflect the insurance services 
provided to the policyholder in each period. Under IFRS 17, ‘coverage units’ 
represent those insurance contract services. The amount of the CSM recognised 
as insurance revenue in a period is determined by allocating the CSM at the end 
of a period over the current and future periods by reference to the coverage units 
expected to be provided in those periods. The determination of coverage units for 
UK deferred annuities in the deferral phase, and in particular the relative 
weighting of different services, is highly subjective given the mix of services 
delivered in the different phases of the contract. 

The concept of coverage units did not exist under IFRS 4 and therefore the Group 
has had to determine the coverage units to be applied both in the current and 
preceding years.

Transition fair value approach and expected internal rate of return
The Group has estimated the transition CSM as at 1 January 2022 for annuity 
liabilities written pre-2016 on the basis of the ‘fair value approach’. The 
determination of the fair value of this portfolio of business is inherently 
subjective, particularly in the setting of key assumptions, and small changes in 
certain assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated transition 
CSM within insurance contract liabilities.

The fair value approach is determined by discounting the expected future capital 
releases emerging from the pre-2016 annuity business at the expected internal 
rate of return (IRR). Under IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement, this should be the 
return that another market participant would demand to assume the liabilities. 
In determining this IRR, the Group assumes that the primary constraint is the 
Solvency II capital requirement. Whilst the UK bulk annuity market is relatively 
active, there are no previous transactions of this size, and as such significant 
judgement is applied in setting the IRR assumption.

Data capture 
There is a risk that incomplete and inaccurate data is used in the calculation 
of liabilities resulting from error in input of data into the policy administration 
systems or inaccurate transfer or conversion of aggregate data from the policy 
administration systems into model point files used to value the liabilities in the 
actuarial models. In addition, there is a risk that inaccurate asset data is used 
to calculate the discount rates.

Estimation uncertainty: 
The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined 
that the valuation of insurance contract liabilities has a high degree of estimation 
uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that 
amount. The financial statements disclose the sensitivities (Note 19) estimated 
by the Group.

expense assumptions.

•  The significance of the inputs into the actuarial models and the consequent

•  The approach to determining the fair value of the pre-2016 UK annuity business. 
This is based on the premise that there is an active market for bulk annuities in the 
UK and although the recent transactions were not as large as the LGRI pre-2016 
business, recent transactions are relevant inputs to the calibration of the IRR.
•  The approach and methods applied to determine the discount rates, including

specific guidance from the accounting setters and a lack of consensus 
amongst other annuity writers at the time this approach was being developed.

Our results
We found the resulting estimate of the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities 
within insurance contract liabilities to be acceptable (2022 result: acceptable).

Description of the key audit matter

Subjective valuation: 

6.7% of the investment portfolio as at 31 December 2023 (2022: 6.3%) was 
classified as Level 3 assets, of which we consider the valuation of lifetime 
mortgages, private credit and investment property involve the greatest level of 
subjectivity. The subjectivity of the asset valuations remains heightened due 
to the current economic conditions caused by the ongoing uncertainties as a 
result of high inflation and higher market interest rates. 

For these positions a reliable third-party price from a recent market transaction 
is not readily available and therefore the application of expert judgement from 
management in the valuations adopted is required. 

The key assumptions underlying the valuations are: 

•  UK lifetime mortgages: property price at the valuation date, property price 

inflation, property price inflation volatility, voluntary redemption rate and the 
illiquidity premium added to the risk-free rate.

•  Private credit and US private placements: credit ratings derived from credit 

rating models.

•  Investment property: estimated rental value and yield of the property.

Estimation uncertainty: 
The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we 
determined that the valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments has a 
high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable 
outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, 
and possibly many times that amount.

Our response to the risk

Our procedures to address the risk included:

•  Control design and implementation: testing of the design and implementation 
of key controls over the valuation process for UK lifetime mortgages, private 
credit and investment property investments. 

•  Our valuation expertise: 

•  Using our own valuation specialists to assess the suitability of the valuation 
and credit rating methodologies used by the Group, to independently revalue 
a sample of the private credit investments; and 

•  Using our own actuarial specialists to evaluate the appropriateness of the 

assumptions used in the valuation of UK lifetime mortgages with reference 
to market data and industry benchmarks.

•  Assessing valuers’ credentials: assessing the objectivity, professional 
qualifications and competence of external valuers of private credit, and 
investment property investments and reconciling the valuations provided by 
them to the valuations recorded in the financial statements.

•  Methodology choice: assessing the appropriateness of the credit rating 

methodologies for private credit and investment property investments with 
reference to relevant accounting standards and the Group’s own valuation 
guidelines as well as industry practice.

•  Benchmarking assumptions: evaluating and challenging the key assumptions 
upon which the valuations of lifetime mortgages, private credit and investment 
property investments were based, including consideration of the impacts of 
economic uncertainties, by making a comparison to our own understanding of 
the market, comparable evidence relied on by the valuers used by the Group and 
to industry benchmarks.

•  Assessing transparency: assessing whether the disclosures in relation to the 

valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments are compliant with the relevant 
financial reporting requirements and appropriately present the sensitivities of 
the valuation to alternative assumptions.

of risk relating to Recoverability of the 
parent company’s investment in 
subsidiaries compared to 2022.

Our response to the risk

Description of the key audit matter

Low risk, high value: 
The carrying amount of the parent company’s investments in subsidiaries 
represents 89.2% (2022: 85.4%) of the parent company’s total assets. Their 
carrying amount is not at a high risk of significant misstatement or subject to 
significant judgement. However, due to their materiality in the context of the 
parent company financial statements, this is considered to be the area that 
had the greatest effect on our overall parent company audit.

We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the parent 
company’s controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect 
to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.

Our procedures included:

Test of details: comparing the carrying amount of the parent company’s 
investments, with the subsidiaries’ financial information to identify whether their 
net assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, are in 
excess of their carrying amount and assessing whether those subsidiaries have 
historically been profit-making.

Comparing valuations: for the investments where the carrying amount exceeded 
the net asset value, comparing the carrying amount of the investment with the 
expected value of the business.

5. Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response 

Fraud – identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud

Fraud risk assessment 
To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud 
or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included: 

•  enquiring of directors, the Audit Committee, internal audit, Group Financial Crime Director as to whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged 

fraud and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group’s high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, 
and the Group’s channel for “whistleblowing”;

•  reading Board, Audit Committee and Risk Committee meeting minutes; 
•  considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management; 
•  using our own professionals with forensic knowledge to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussion of the circumstances of the Group; 
•  using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;
•  inspecting correspondence with regulators to identify instances or suspected instances of fraud;
•  reviewing the audit misstatements from prior period to identify fraud risk factors; and
•  reading broker reports and other public information to identify third-party expectations and concerns.

Risk communications
We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included 
communication from the Group audit team to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to full scope component audit 
teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.

Fraud risks
As required by auditing standards and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we perform procedures to address the risk of management 
override of controls, in particular the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting estimates and 
judgements. Accordingly, we identified fraud risks related to the valuation of insurance contract liabilities and valuation of hard to value (Level 3 assets) that require 
management judgement (private credit and lifetime mortgages) given the impact on the Group’s profit, the opportunity for management to manipulate assumptions 
due to the subjectivity involved and given the long-term nature of these assumptions which are more difficult to corroborate. 

We have identified a fraud risk over revenue recognition for UK deferred annuities, as the release of profits requires management to exercise significant judgment 
with respect to the determination of coverage units, which ultimately determines how revenue is released and recorded each period. 

We do not believe there is a fraud risk related to any other Group revenue because there is limited management judgement involved in the recognition of and 
measurement of the transaction price for all material revenue streams.

Link to KAMs
We identified fraud risks related to the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities, and valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments in response to possible 
pressures to meet profit targets. 

Further detail in respect of the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities, and valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments is set out in the two KAM 
disclosures in Section 4 of this report.

Procedures to address fraud risks
We performed procedures including: 

•  instructing full scope components and components completing audit of account balances to identify journal entries to test based on high-risk criteria sent to them 
and comparing the entries to supporting documentation. These included, but were not limited to, journals impacting cash balances that were identified as unusual 
or unexpected in our risk assessment procedures; 

•  evaluating the business purpose of significant unusual transactions; and 
•  assessing whether the judgements made making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias.

Laws and regulations – identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement relating to compliance with laws and regulations

Laws and regulations risk assessment
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial 
and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s 
regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and 
regulations. As the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the Group’s procedures for 
complying with regulatory requirements.

Risk communications
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included 
communication from the Group audit team to full scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for full 
scope component auditors to report to the Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement 
at the Group level.

Direct laws context and link to audit
The potential effect of laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

The Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies’ 
legislation), distributable profits legislation, taxation legislation, and pension legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations 
as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. 

Most significant indirect law/regulation areas
The Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the 
financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group’s license to operate. 

We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such effect: 

•  Specific aspects of regulatory capital and liquidity;
•  Market abuse regulations;
•  Financial crime and customer conduct regulations; 
•  The Consumer Duty; and 
•  Certain aspects of company legislation, recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group’s activities and certain regulated subsidiaries. 

Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management 
and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant 
correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.

Context

Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation
Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, 
even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws 
and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing 
standards would identify it.

In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing 
non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

6. Our determination of materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help 
us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.

Materiality for the Group 
financial statements  
as a whole

£82.9m

(2022: £113.0m)

What we mean
A quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.

Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £82.9m (2022: £113.0m). This was determined with reference 
to a benchmark of profit before tax from continuing operations (PBTCO) normalised to exclude this year’s investment and other 
variances and losses attributable to non-controlling interests disclosed in Note 2 of the financial statements that do not represent 
normal continuing operations of the business.

Consistent with 2022, normalised PBTCO remains the main benchmark for the Group because it is the metric in the primary 
statements which best reflects the focus of the financial statements’ users.

Our Group materiality of £82.9m (2022: £113.0m) was determined by applying a percentage to the normalised PBTCO. When using 
a benchmark of normalised PBTCO to determine overall materiality, KPMG’s approach for listed entities considers a guideline range 
3% - 5% of the measure. In setting overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.87% (2022: 4.71% with reference to a 
benchmark under IFRS 4) to the final year end benchmark.

In addition, we applied materiality of £3.3bn (2022: £3.3bn) to the unit linked assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
Consolidated Income Statement and related notes, which represents 0.9% (2022: 0.9%) of the total unit linked asset balance. This 
materiality was applied in accordance with FRC Practice Note 20 The Audit of Insurers in the United Kingdom.

Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at £33.0m (2022: £45.0m), which is the component 
materiality for the parent company determined by the Group audit engagement team. This is lower than the materiality we would 
otherwise have determined with reference to parent company net assets (2022: total assets), of which it represents 0.47% (2022: 0.36%). 
We selected net assets as the benchmark in the current period due to the users of the financial statements focus on the parent 
entity’s capital and distributions.

Performance materiality

£53.9m

(2022: £84.8m)

What we mean
Our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, 
so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to 
a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.

Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied
We have considered performance materiality at a level of 65% (2022: 75%) of materiality for both the Group financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements as a whole to be appropriate.

We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality based on the additional risk associated with the 
first-year implementation of IFRS 17. 

Audit misstatement  
posting threshold

£3.7m

(2022: £5.7m)

What we mean
This is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We 
may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, 
for example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud.

This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to the Group’s Audit Committee.

Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and judgements applied
We set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 4.5% (2022: 5.0%) of our materiality for both the Group financial statements and 
parent company. The decrease is a result of our assessment of increased aggregation risk, consistent with performance materiality 
above. We also report to the Audit Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. 

The overall materiality for the Group financial statements of £82.9m (2022: £113.0m) compares as follows to the main financial statement

7. The scope of our audit

Group scope
What we mean
How the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.

The Group has 16 (2022: 12 ) in-scope reporting components. In order to determine the work performed at the reporting component level, we identified those 
components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we 
required procedures to be performed to provide us with the evidence we required in order to conclude on the Group financial statements as a whole.

We determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 5% (2022: 5%) of total Group revenue and Group profit before tax, and 10% 
(2022: 10%) of total Group assets. We selected total Group revenue, total Group profit before tax and total Group assets because these are the most representative of 
the relative size of the components. We identified 5 (2022: 6) components as individually financially significant components and performed full scope audits on these 
components.

In addition to the individually financially significant components, we identified 3 (2022: 4) components as significant, owing to significant risks of material 
misstatement affecting the Group financial statements. Of the 3 (2022: 4) components identified as significant due to risk, we performed audits of account balances 
for investment property, cash and cash equivalents and receivables and other assets on 1 component (2022: 1) and performed specific risk-focused audit procedures 
over financial investments, investment property, cash and cash equivalents, receivables and other assets and investment in associates and joint ventures accounted 
for using the equity method on 2 components (2022: 3).

In addition, to enable us to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence for the Group financial statements as a whole, we selected 8 (2022: 2) components on which to 
perform procedures. Of these components, we performed full scope audits for 2 components (2022: 1), performed audits of account balances for financial 
investments, cash and cash equivalents, receivables and other assets, provisions, payables, core borrowings, and other financial liabilities on 2 components (2022: 0) 
and performed specific risk-focused procedures over provisions, cash and cash equivalents, investment return and other expenses on 4 components (2022: 1).

The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group’s results, with the prior year comparatives calculated with 
reference to amounts under IFRS 4 indicated in brackets:

The remaining 10% (2022: 2%) of total Group revenue, 12% (2022: 9%) of Group profit before tax and 7% (2022: 3%) of total Group assets is represented by 68 (2022: 78) 
reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 1% (2022: 1%) of any of total Group revenue, 3% of Group profit before tax (2022: 4%) or 1% of 
total Group assets (2022: 1%). For these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement within these.

The work on 12 of the 16 components (2022: 11 of the 12 components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the parent company, 
was performed by the Group team. For those items excluded from normalised Group PBTCO, the component teams performed procedures on items relating to their 
components. The Group team performed procedures on the remaining excluded items.

The Group audit team has also performed audit procedures on the following areas on behalf of the components: 

•  Entity level controls;
•  General expenses (including accounts payable, payroll, intangible capitalisation and year-end accruals);
•  Intercompany balances;
•  Directors’ emoluments;
•  Foreign exchange rates; and
•  Related parties.

These items were audited by the Group team as they are all centralised processes across the Group. The Group team communicated the results of these procedures to 
the component teams.

The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported 
back. The Group team approved the component materialities, as detailed in the table above, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the 
components.

The scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance upon the Group’s internal control over financial reporting.

Group audit team oversight
What we mean
The extent of the Group audit team’s involvement in component audits.

In working with component auditors, we:
•  Held planning calls with component audit teams to discuss the significant areas of the audit relevant to the components, including the key audit matters in respect of 

KAM 4.1, KAM 4.2 and KAM 4.3.

•  Issued Group audit instructions to component auditors on the scope of their work, including specifying the minimum procedures to perform in their audit, setting out 

the significant areas to be covered including the relevant key audit matters and information to be reported back to the Group audit team. 

•  Held risk assessment update discussions with all component audit teams before the commencement of the final phase of the audit led by the Group engagement 

partner and engagement quality control partner.

•  Of the audits not performed by the Group Team, we visited 9 of 12 (2022: 9 of 11) components in-person, including London, Edinburgh, and Baltimore, USA, as the audit 
progressed to understand and challenge the audit approach and organised fortnightly video conferences with the partners and directors of the Group and component 
audit teams. At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was 
then performed by the component audit teams.

•  Inspected component audit teams’ key work papers in-person and using remote technology capabilities to evaluate the quality of execution of the audits of the 

components with a particular focus on work related to key audit matters and significant risks over the valuation of insurance contract liabilities and valuation of hard 
to value (Level 3) investments. 

8. Other information in the Annual report and accounts
The directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual report and accounts together with the financial statements. Our 
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly 
stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

All other information 

Our responsibility 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is 
materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. 

Our reporting 
Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements or inconsistencies in the other information.

Strategic report and directors’ report 

Our responsibility and reporting
Based solely on our work on the other information described above we report to you as follows:

•  we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors’ report;
•  in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
•  in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Directors’ report on remuneration

Our responsibility 
We are required to form an opinion as to whether the part of the Directors’ report on remuneration to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.

Our reporting
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ report on remuneration to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 

Corporate governance disclosures 

Our responsibility 
We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the financial statements and our audit knowledge, and:

•  the directors’ statement that they consider that the Annual report and accounts and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, and 

provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; 

•  the section of the Annual report and accounts describing the work of the Audit Committee, including the significant issues that the Audit Committee considered in 

relation to the financial statements, and how these issues were addressed; and

•  the section of the Annual report and accounts that describes the review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems.

Our reporting
Based on those procedures, we have concluded that each of these disclosures is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge. 

Our responsibility 
We are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review. 

Our reporting
We have nothing to report in this respect.

Other information

Other matters on which we are required to report by exception 

Our responsibility 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 

•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
•  the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ report on remuneration to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and 

returns; or

•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 

Our reporting
We have nothing to report in these respects.

9. Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 267, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 

Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of the financial statements. 

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

The Group is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 
4.1.17R and 4.1.18R. This auditor’s report provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared in accordance with those 
requirements. 

10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Primary statements and performance  
continued

1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies
Legal & General Group Plc, a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, operates across four broad business areas 
of retirement, investment management, capital investment and insurance through its subsidiaries and associates in the United Kingdom (UK), the 
United States (US) and other countries throughout the world. 

(i) Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, comprising International 
Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), 
and related interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee. Endorsement is granted by the UK Endorsement Board (UKEB). The Group 
financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment property, financial assets 
at fair value through other comprehensive income, and certain assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through 
profit or loss.

The Group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows for a reporting period. 
The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated. 

Financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and 
there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis. Income and expenses are not offset in the Consolidated Income Statement unless 
required or permitted by any accounting standard or International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretation, as detailed 
in the applicable accounting policies of the Group.

(ii) Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position in the current economic 
environment are set out in this Annual report & accounts. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in these consolidated financial statements. Principal risks and uncertainties are detailed on pages 56 to 59.

The directors have made an assessment of the Group’s going concern, considering both the current performance and the outlook for a period of at 
least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, using the information available up to the 
date of issue of this Annual report & accounts. 

The Group manages and monitors its capital and liquidity, and applies various stresses, including adverse inflation and interest rate scenarios, to 
those positions to understand potential impacts from market downturns. Our key sensitivities and the impacts on our capital position from a range 
of stresses are disclosed in section 5.01 of the Full year results in the 2023 Preliminary Management Report1. These stresses do not give rise to any 
material uncertainties over the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. Based upon the available information, the directors consider that 
the Group has the plans and resources to manage its business risks successfully and that it remains financially strong and well diversified.

Having reassessed the principal risks and uncertainties (both financial and operational) in light of the current economic environment, as detailed on 
pages 56 to 59, the directors are confident that the Group and Company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for 
a period of, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and therefore have considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements.

(iii) New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have been adopted by the Group
The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time in its annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2023.

IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments 
The Group has applied IFRS 17, ‘Insurance Contracts’ and IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ for the first time from 1 January 2023. These standards 
have brought significant changes to the accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts and financial instruments respectively, and have had 
a material impact on the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application. 

IFRS 17, ‘Insurance Contracts’ was originally issued in May 2017 by the IASB, and subsequent amendments were issued in June 2020. Endorsement 
for use in the UK was granted in May 2022. The standard replaced IFRS 4, ‘Insurance Contracts’, and has been applied retrospectively, in line with the 
transitional options provided for in the standard. IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive approach for accounting for insurance contracts including their 
measurement, income statement presentation and disclosure. 

IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ was issued in July 2014 by the IASB, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The IASB 
subsequently issued ‘Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts’ which allowed entities that 
met certain requirements to defer their implementation of IFRS 9 until adoption of IFRS 17, ‘Insurance Contracts’ or 1 January 2021, whichever is the 
earlier. In June 2020, the IASB agreed to extend the temporary exemption in IFRS 4 from applying IFRS 9 to annual reporting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2023. The Group qualified for, and made use of this deferral option, and has therefore applied IFRS 9 for the first time on 1 January 
2023. The standard replaced IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. It includes new principles around classification and 
measurement of financial instruments, introduces an impairment model based on expected credit losses (replacing the previous model based on 
incurred losses) and new requirements on hedge accounting. IFRS 9 has been applied retrospectively. 

Section (vii) includes the new accounting policies adopted by the Group for IFRS 17 and IFRS 9.

1.  Section 5.01 of the Full year results in the 2023 Preliminary Management Report is unaudited.

Other information

IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively and prior period comparative information has been restated, with all restatements clearly 
labelled as such throughout this report. 

Prior period comparative information reflecting the implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 was initially provided in the Group’s interim financial 
statements for the period ending 30 June 2023. This information was unaudited. Since that time, and in particular as a result of the detailed work and 
review undertaken to finalise the numbers included in this report, which has now been audited, certain adjustments have been identified which have 
now been reflected in the prior period comparatives. This includes a £154m reclassification between Change in investment contract liabilities and 
Other expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement, with no impact on profit. In total, the impact of these adjustments on equity attributable to 
owners of the parent was an increase of £19m as at 1 January 2022, and a decrease of £45m as at 31 December 2022.

As at the transition date of 1 January 2022, the impacts on the key line items in the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet are set out below.

1.  Net insurance contract liabilities reflect insurance contract assets and liabilities, net of reinsurance contracts.

The adoption of the new accounting standards does not change the total profit recognised over the life of the Group’s insurance contracts, nor the 
underlying economics or cash generation of the Group’s businesses. It does not change the Group’s strategy, solvency position nor dividend paying 
capacity or appetite.

Transition to IFRS 17
On transition to IFRS 17, the Group has applied the full retrospective approach unless impracticable. The full retrospective approach requires the 
Group to:

identify, recognise and measure each group of insurance and reinsurance contracts as if IFRS 17 had always applied;

• 
•  derecognise any existing balances that would not exist had IFRS 17 always applied; and
• 

recognise any resulting net difference in equity.

If it was impracticable to apply a full retrospective approach to a group of contracts then the Group has chosen between the modified retrospective 
approach and the fair value approach. If the Group could not obtain reasonable and supportable information necessary to apply the modified 
retrospective approach, then the fair value approach has been chosen.

The Group has applied the following transition approaches to its material insurance contract portfolios on transition to IFRS 17, by year of issue:

Full retrospective approach
For insurance and reinsurance contracts where the full retrospective approach has been adopted, the best estimate and risk adjustment 
components of fulfilment cash flows have been recognised and measured using the accounting policies set out in section (vii) from the inception 
date of the contracts to the date of transition.

The full retrospective approach has been determined to be impracticable where: the effects of retrospective application are not determinable 
because information required has not been collected (or not with sufficient granularity); application would require the application of hindsight; 
or information is unavailable because of system migrations, data retention requirements or other reasons. Specific examples include:

•  historic calibration of IFRS 17 specific judgements, such as the scale of the risk adjustment;
•  expectations about a contract’s profitability and risks of becoming onerous required for identifying groups of contracts;
• 

information about historical cash flows and discount rates required for determining the estimates of cash flows on initial recognition and their 
subsequent changes on a retrospective basis;
information required to allocate fixed and variable overheads to groups of contracts, because the Group’s current accounting policies do not 
require such information; and
information about certain changes in assumptions and estimates because they were not documented on an ongoing basis.

Modified retrospective approach
The objective of the modified retrospective approach is to achieve the closest outcome to retrospective application possible using reasonable and 
supportable information available without undue cost or effort.

For insurance and reinsurance contracts where the full retrospective approach has been adopted, the best estimate and risk adjustment 
components of fulfilment cash flows have been recognised and measured using the accounting policies set out in section (vii) except for the 
application of a permitted transition modification that, for some groups of contracts issued before 1 January 2021, the risk adjustment for 
non-financial risk on initial recognition has been determined by adjusting the amount at 1 January 2022 for the expected release of risk before 
that date. The expected release has been determined with reference to the release of risk of similar contracts that the Group issued in 2022. 
This modification has been used to avoid the application of hindsight to the calibration of the risk adjustment in prior periods.

Fair value approach
For insurance and reinsurance contracts where the fair value approach has been adopted, the best estimate and risk adjustment components of 
fulfilment cash flows have been determined as at 1 January 2022. The Group has determined the Contractual Service Margin (CSM) of the liability 
for remaining coverage at the transition date, as the difference between the fair value of the group of insurance contracts and the fulfilment cash 
flows measured at that date. In determining fair value, the Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 13, ‘Fair Value Measurement’, except for the 
demand deposit floor requirement. The fair value attributed to the in-scope business is calculated with reference to a price generated using the 
Group’s pricing models and pricing assumptions at the transition date. The pricing models discount the future capital releases emerging at the 
internal rate of return (IRR). The assessment of the valuation includes consideration of:

• 
• 
• 
• 

the most appropriate assumptions for use by a third party market participant;
the contractual terms and expected cash flows of the contracts;
the capital requirements over the contract duration; and
the required internal rate of return.

The fair value calculations at 1 January 2022 used economic assumptions at that date. The most significant judgements for each portfolio were:

• 
• 

the most relevant market participants for the business being valued; and
the IRR and level of required regulatory capital applied in the calculations, which were together calibrated with reference to relevant market 
transactions where available.

The net of reinsurance CSM calculated using the fair value approach at transition was £4.1bn, comprising £3.9bn for annuities and £0.2bn for 
protection. A reasonably possible alternative valuation for the net of reinsurance annuity fair value CSM derived by reducing the required IRR by 1% 
would reduce the transition CSM by £0.3bn.

The Group has aggregated contracts issued more than one year apart in determining groups of insurance contracts under the fair value approach at 
transition, applying the permitted transition simplification. The Group did not have reasonable and supportable information to disaggregate groups 
into those including only contracts issued within one year.

For portfolios of protection contracts, the Group has elected to disaggregate insurance finance income or expenses between amounts included in 
profit or loss and amounts included in other comprehensive income. For these portfolios, transitioned under the fair value approach, the cumulative 
amount of insurance finance income or expense recognised in other comprehensive income at the transition date has been reset to zero in line with 
the transitional provisions of the standard.

Transition assumptions
The Group’s material insurance and reinsurance contract fulfilment cash flow assumptions at the date of transition are set out below.

(i) Mortality and morbidity
Mortality and morbidity assumptions for the UK businesses are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality 
Investigation Bureau (CMI), a subsidiary of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and/or UK death registrations. US assumptions are set with 
reference to standard tables drawn up by the American Academy of Actuaries. Tables are based on industry-wide mortality and morbidity 
experience for insured lives.

3.  Adjustments are made for gender, select period, smoker status, policy size, policy duration and year, issue year and age. 
4.  Mortality rates are assumed to reduce based on CMI 2020 model with a long-term annual improvement rate of 1.5% for males and 1.0% for females. 
5.  Table created by blending PCXA00 with PNXA00 tables. The base table to be used for bulk purchase annuity policies in deferment is PNMA00 up to and including age 55 and 

PCMA00 for age 65 and above for males. The identical method is applied to females using PNFA00 and PCFA00. 

6.  Mortality rates are assumed to reduce according to an adjusted version of the mortality improvement model CMI 2019 with the following parameters: Males: Long-term Rate of 

1.5% p.a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 110. 
Females: Long-term Rate of 1.0% p.a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 110. 
Smoothing is applied to derive initial rates using a smoothing parameter (Sk) value of 7.5 applied to Legal & General bespoke population data up to 2019. The resulting initial rates 
are then adjusted to reflect socio economic class. 
For individual annuities distributed through retail channels, a further allowance is made for the effect of initial selection. 
The basis above is applicable up to age 90. After age 90 the basis is blended towards a bespoke table from age 105 onwards.
Improvement table is MP2018 for Females and MP2019 for Males.

7. 

(ii) Valuation rates of interest and discount rates
The interest rates used to discount the cash flows for the purpose of valuing insurance contract liabilities should reflect the timing and liquidity 
characteristics of those insurance liability cash flows and current market conditions. The valuation interest rate assumptions are derived as interest 
rate curves with full term structure. 

In deriving the discount rate assumptions for annuity business, an explicit allowance for risk is deducted from the yield on the assets backing annuity 
liabilities. The allowance for risk comprises long-term assumptions about defaults and the market risk premiums for taking credit risk. In the case of 
lifetime mortgage assets a best estimate expectation of losses arising from the no negative equity guarantee, and the market risk premiums for this 
risk, are deducted from the yield. For the UK annuity business, the deduction for risk of default for corporate bonds and direct investments equated 
to 43bps. For lifetime mortgages the deductions equated to £0.6bn. 

For US and UK protection business, the yield is calculated based on notional asset portfolios of AA rated corporate bonds and cash, which reflect 
the characteristics of the liability cash flows. An explicit allowance for risk is deducted from the yield, to reflect the default risk associated with the 
notional portfolio assets. 

The discount rate curves used for the material product lines are shown below. The discount rate curves are used to discount the cash flows on the 
underlying contracts and the reinsurance cash flows on those contracts.

(iv) Risk Adjustment
The Group calculates its risk adjustment using a Provision for Adverse Deviations (PADs) approach, where adjustments are applied to best estimate 
non-financial risk assumptions to calculate the risk adjustment required over and above the best estimate liability. These adjustments (which vary 
by risk) are calibrated such that the total Group risk adjustment calculated aligns to the Group’s view of compensation for non-financial risks and the 
risk adjustment at contract level is representative of the compensation required for that contract. For the majority of risks, the Group’s view on the 
compensation required for non-financial risks is determined with reference to an 85th percentile confidence level, calculated using a one-year 
Value-at-Risk (VaR) measure. This VaR measure reflects the Group’s view on how non-financial risks behave (risk distributions), diversification of 
risks across the Group (risk correlations), and the costs and benefits from reinsurance in place (risk mitigation). This is consistent with how risks 
are priced for and managed across the Group. We have estimated the equivalent confidence level for the entire Group on a multi-year basis, using a 
weighted average of the key risks. Overall, the Group risk adjustment as at 1 January 2022 is aligned to a c75th percentile multi-year confidence 
level over the full runoff of the portfolio.

Financial impact of transition
The increase in insurance liabilities on adoption of IFRS 17 at 1 January 2022 can be attributed to the following:

Remeasurement of liabilities: the IFRS 17 cash flows are best estimate and exclude all prudent margins included in the IFRS 4 
liabilities. Removal of these margins coupled with other changes to the insurance contract measurement, including discount rates 
and the exclusion of non-attributable expenses, results in a lower best estimate liability

Creation of a risk adjustment: IFRS 17 incorporates a specific risk adjustment for non-financial risk

Creation of a CSM: determined using the transition approaches described above and reflecting the unearned profit of these contracts

Total

Transition to IFRS 9
On transition, changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively.

(6,133)

In line with IFRS 17 the Group has chosen to restate comparative periods under IFRS 9. While the standard does not apply to financial assets already 
derecognised by 1 January 2023, the Group has applied a ‘classification overlay’ as allowed by the standard. When applying IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 at 
the same time, the classification overlay permits presentation of comparative information as if the classification, measurement and impairment 
requirements of IFRS 9 had been applied to such assets, irrespective of derecognition date. 

For the purpose of classification and measurement, financial assets’ business models have been assessed as at the date of initial application and 
have been applied consistently in all periods presented. If an asset was in scope of the classification overlay described above, the Group aligned the 
classification and measurement of each financial asset in the comparative periods with what it expected it would have been on 1 January 2023. 
Such assessment was performed based on reasonable and supportable information available at 1 January 2022, the transition date. Any difference 
between the IAS 39 carrying amount of a financial asset and the carrying amount at the transition date that results from applying IFRS 9 or the 
classification overlay was recognised in opening retained earnings.

For the purpose of impairment, the Group assessed whether as at 1 January 2023 there had been a significant increase in credit risk as compared 
to the date that a financial instrument was initially recognised, and applied a 12-month or lifetime ECL accordingly. The Group chose to apply the 
impairment requirements of IFRS 9 consistently to all of the applicable financial instruments on its books during the comparative periods. To the 
extent the classification overlay applied and therefore an asset was derecognised by 1 January 2023, any expected credit losses recognised in the 
comparative periods were reversed upon disposal. On transition, the Group made use of a practical expedient available in IFRS 9 whereby it can be 
assumed that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is 
determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date (e.g. investment grade as determined by the Group’s asset managers).

Other information

On transition to IFRS 9, any additional provision recognised when compared to IAS 39 was recognised in opening retained earnings. However, if this 
related to a financial asset at FVOCI, an equal and opposite movement was reflected in the OCI reserve.

Changes to hedge accounting policies have been applied prospectively from 1 January 2023. All hedging relationships designated under IAS 39 at 
31 December 2022 met the criteria for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 at 1 January 2023 and were therefore regarded as continuing hedging 
relationships.

Classification and measurement
The following table explains the original measurement categories under IAS 39 and the new measurement categories under IFRS 9 for each class 
of the Group’s financial assets as at 1 January 2023, including the reasons for any reclassifications out of the FVTPL category. No changes to 
classification and measurement of financial liabilities have resulted from the implementation of IFRS 9.

IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments continued
Remeasurement from FVTPL to amortised cost
As part of the implementation of IFRS 9, the Group has reassessed the classification and measurement of certain financial assets backing annuity 
liabilities, in order to better match interest rate and inflation sensitivities to IFRS 17 liabilities, and reclassified a portion of its portfolio of debt 
securities previously held at FVTPL. This is because, while the best estimate liability and risk adjustment under IFRS 17 for annuities are measured 
with current financial assumptions, the CSM is measured with locked-in discount rates. Therefore, a sub-portfolio of long dated debt instruments 
amounting to £5,603m (including accrued interest, as at 1 January 2023) backing annuity contracts but in surplus to the IFRS 17 best estimate 
liability and risk adjustment, and passing the SPPI test, was separately identified. Starting 1 January 2023 these assets have been used to manage 
interest and inflation rate exposure. They are held to maturity in a ‘held to collect’ business model and accounted for at amortised cost. Other assets 
reclassified in the Group’s Insurance business, notably private placements and commercial mortgage loans in the US business, were previously 
accounted for at FVTPL in order to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch. Following the implementation of IFRS 17 this is no longer required 
as finance income and expense on the insurance liabilities that these assets are held to back are presented in OCI. The assets pass the SPPI test 
and are held in a ‘held to collect’ business model, and are therefore accounted for at amortised cost. 

Had such assets remained at FVTPL after 1 January 2023, the Group would have recorded fair value losses in the Consolidated Income Statement 
of £322m during the year. Interest income recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the year was £209m, and the effective interest rate 
as at 1 January 2023 was 3.59%. The fair value of these assets as at 31 December 2023 is £6,839m.

Remeasurement from FVTPL to FVOCI
Under IAS 39, bonds (including US Treasury bonds) backing certain protection liabilities were held at FVTPL in order to eliminate or reduce an 
accounting mismatch. Following the implementation of IFRS 17 this is no longer required, as finance income and expense on the insurance liabilities 
that these assets are held to back, are presented in OCI. The assets pass the SPPI test and are held in a ‘held to collect and sell’ business model, and 
are therefore accounted for at FVOCI.

Had such assets remained at FVTPL after 1 January 2023, the Group would have recorded fair value gains in the Consolidated Income Statement 
of £15m during the year. Interest income recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the year was £8m, and the effective interest rate as at 
1 January 2023 was 2.75%. The fair value of these assets as at 31 December 2023 is £356m.

Impairment
The following table reconciles the closing impairment allowance under IAS 39 as at 31 December 2022 with the opening loss allowance under IFRS 9

Tax impacts from adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9
The implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 has resulted in a reduction of the Group’s equity of £6,882m before tax as at 1 January 2022. A deferred 
tax credit of £1,356m was recognised in respect of this, resulting in a net impact on adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 of £5,526m. 

Of the deferred tax credit of £1,356m, £1,302m relates to the UK and £54m relates to the US.

The introduction of this new accounting standard impacts the tax the Group pays in the UK, as the UK tax regime is based on the IFRS results of the 
Group’s UK businesses. HMRC consulted widely on how the introduction of IFRS 17 should be treated for tax purposes. The UK tax regime requires the 
reduction in equity on transition to IFRS 17 for UK companies to be treated as a tax loss, which is spread over 10 years and will reduce the cash tax 
payments over this period. This tax loss has been recognised as a deferred tax asset on the Group’s balance sheet, valued at £1.2bn at 1 January 2022. 

The Group’s US businesses’ tax position is based on their regulatory filings rather than on the IFRS result, and therefore the implementation of 
IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 does not impact their local tax position. The Group recognises deferred tax on the difference between the profits and losses 
on which the local tax position is based on, and the IFRS results.

Amendments to IAS 12 – Income Taxes: ‘International Tax Reform — Pillar Two Model Rules’
These amendments, issued in May 2023, were introduced in response to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two model rules, and include:

•  A mandatory temporary exception to the recognition and disclosure of deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional implementation of the Pillar 

Two model rules; and

•  Disclosure requirements for affected entities to help users of the financial statements better understand an entity’s exposure to Pillar Two income 

taxes arising from that legislation, particularly before its effective date.

Other standards
The Group has also applied the following standards and amendments for the first time in the year commencing 1 January 2023, which did not give 
rise to a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

•  Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12);
•  Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8); and
•  Disclosure of Accounting policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2).

The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

(iv) Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards which are not yet effective 
Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements: ‘Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current’
These amendments, issued in January 2020, clarify the existing requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments 
are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.

Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements: ‘Non-current Liabilities with Covenants’
These amendments, issued in October 2022, clarify that only covenants with which an entity must comply on or before the reporting date will affect 
a liability’s classification as current or non-current. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.

Amendments to IFRS 16 – Leases: ‘Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback’
These amendments, issued in September 2022, specify requirements for seller-lessees to measure the lease liability in a sale and leaseback 
transaction. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.

Amendments to IAS 7 – Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures: ‘Supplier Finance Arrangements’
These amendments, issued in May 2023, address the disclosure requirements to enhance the transparency of supplier finance arrangements and 
their effects on a company’s liabilities, cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2024.

(v) Critical accounting judgements and the use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Although 
these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, material adjustments could 
be made to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. The Audit Committee reviews the reasonableness of 
judgements associated with and the application of material accounting policies. The significant accounting matters considered by the Audit 
Committee in respect of the year ended 31 December 2023 are included within the Audit Committee Report on page 86. 

The major areas of critical accounting judgement on policy application are considered below:

Insurance and investment contract liabilities (Notes 20 and 21): Product classification and the assessment of the significance of insurance risk 
transferred to the Group in determining whether a contract should be accounted for as an insurance or investment contract
Contracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the Group are classified as insurance contracts. Contracts that transfer financial risk (e.g. change 
in interest rate or security price) to the Group but not significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts. 

Judgement is required in order to assess the significance of the transfer of insurance risk within a contract. This assessment is based on whether 
the occurrence of an insured event could cause the Group to make significant additional payments, i.e. if the occurrence of the event causes 
significantly higher cash out flows for the Group than its non-occurrence.

Certain contracts, which are both insurance and investment, can contain discretionary features representing the contractual right to receive 
additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits under certain conditions, being:

• 
• 
• 

that the additional benefits are a significant portion of the total contractual benefits;
the timing and amount of the additional benefits is at the discretion of the Group; and
that the additional benefits are contractually dependent upon the performance of an entity, fund or specified pool of assets.

Insurance contracts and investment contracts with such discretionary participation features are accounted for under IFRS 17, while investment 
contracts without discretionary participation features are accounted for as financial instruments under IFRS 9. 

Judgement is therefore required in order to establish whether any additional benefits in an insurance or investment contract meet the above 
requirements for being considered discretionary participation features.

Consolidation (Notes 39 to 41): Assessment of whether the Group controls underlying entities and should therefore consolidate them 
The assessment takes account of various criteria, including decision making ability, equity holding and the rights to a variable return from the entity.

Control arises when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity.

1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
(v) Critical accounting judgements and the use of estimates continued
Consolidation (Notes 39-41): Assessment of whether the Group controls underlying entities and should therefore consolidate them continued
For operating entities this generally accompanies a shareholding of 50% or more in the entity. Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the Group 
owns less than 50% of the ordinary share capital (structured entities), are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from 
special rights attaching to the class of share owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature of 
its relevant activities, voting rights (including potential voting rights) and substantive and protective rights. 

The Group invests in various fund and unit trust entities where it also acts as the asset manager to those entities. In these instances, in determining 
whether the Group controls the entities, the assessment focuses on the aggregate economic interests of the Group (direct interest and expected 
management fees) and on whether the Group acts as a principal or agent. This includes an assessment of the removal rights of other investors 
(their practical ability to allow the Group not to control the fund). Additionally, holdings in such investments can fluctuate on a daily basis according 
to the participation of the Group and other investors in them. As a result, in determining control, we look at an assessment of these factors over a 
longer period to mitigate the impact of daily fluctuations which do not reflect the wider facts and circumstances of the Group’s involvement. This is 
performed in line with the following principles:

•  where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group’s ownership holding in the entity exceeds 50%, the Group is judged to have 

control over the entity;

•  where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group’s ownership holding in the entity is between 30% and 50%, the facts and 
circumstances of the Group’s involvement in the entity are considered, including the rights to any fees earned by the asset manager from the 
entity, in forming a judgement as to whether the Group has control over the entity; and

•  where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group’s ownership holding in the entity is less than 30%, the Group is judged to 

not have control over the entity, but again the facts and circumstances of the Group’s involvement in the entity are considered.

The following sets out information about the critical accounting assumptions made by the Group about the future, and other major sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:

Valuation of insurance contract liabilities (Notes 18-20)
The key judgements around the valuation of insurance contract liabilities relate to the following assumptions:

•  Determination of the longevity, mortality and morbidity assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance contract liabilities; the assumptions 
for the rate of future longevity, mortality and morbidity are based on the Group’s internal experience and judgements about how experience may 
vary in the future. This assessment takes into account market benchmarking, internal experience studies and independent industry data. The 
long-term assumptions are adjusted to reflect the Group’s view on the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on claims experience in the medium to 
long-term, informed by emerging experience and industry studies.

•  Determination of the directly attributable expense assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance liabilities. These represent the expected 
future costs that relate directly to the fulfilment of the underlying insurance policies, and are based on management’s best estimate of these 
future costs, and on an appropriate allocation between servicing new and existing business. 

•  Determination of valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities, which are sensitive to the assumptions made, for example, on credit 

default of the backing assets. These assumptions take into account consideration of market experience and historic internal data. The valuation 
interest rate is also sensitive to the selection of the reference portfolio of assets chosen to back the liabilities.

•  Determination of the compensation required for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows arising from non-financial 

risks as insurance contracts are fulfilled, in the calculation of the risk adjustment.

•  Determination of the weighting of the coverage units, used to calculate the CSM amortisation in the year, between the payment phase and the 

deferral phase for deferred annuities. Judgement is required to combine the different coverage units so that they fairly reflect the services provided.

•  Determination of the transition date contractual service margin under IFRS 17 incorporated judgement. In particular, the transition date CSM for 

business transitioned using the fair value methodology persists into the closing valuation of the CSM until those portfolios expire. These 
judgements are discussed in detail in the Basis of Preparation.

Note 19 includes a sensitivity analysis on post-tax Group profit and Group equity to reasonable alternative assumptions.

Valuation of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property (Note 11)
Determination of fair value of unquoted and illiquid assets, and investment property involves judgements in model valuations, through the 
incorporation of both observable and unobservable market inputs, which include assumptions that lead to the existence of a range of plausible 
valuations for financial assets.

In assessing asset valuation, in line with applicable standards and guidance, the Group has both projected the short-term impact on earnings and 
cash flows of the current market volatility, while continuing to review the assets’ ability to deliver longer term returns aligned to their investment cases.

Note 11 includes a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property to reasonable alternative assumptions.

(vi) Consideration of climate change 
The Group recognises emerging risks from both climate change and the crisis with nature, and the interrelationship between our climate and the 
natural world. Climate change is the Group’s most material sustainability issue, but the Group continues to develop its understanding of its impacts 
and dependencies on nature, concurrently with its consideration of the impacts from climate change.

The Group is exposed to climate change through two broad categories: transition risks from the move to a low-carbon economy and the impact this 
has on asset valuation and the economy; and physical risks from the impact on asset holdings as a result of severe weather events and longer-term 
shifts in climate.

The Group has integrated climate risk management into its governance framework and has carried out a detailed assessment of how we could 
expect climate risk to emerge across our business model. The Group risk mitigation strategy includes setting portfolio carbon intensity targets, 
integrating carbon controls into the investment processes through stock exclusions and high carbon escalation, corporate engagement and 
implementing high energy efficiency standards into the Group’s directly owned commercial property and housing businesses.

The Group is committed to net zero, targeting a 1.5°C ‘Paris’ outcome. In order to meet its environmental goals, the Group has set for itself a number 
of metrics and targets, clearly linked with its business strategy and risk management controls. These are based on a three-pillar climate strategy 
encompassing ‘Invest, Influence and Operate’. Metrics and targets have been defined around the Group’s operational carbon footprint, investment 
portfolio economic carbon intensity, and implied portfolio temperature alignment. These are being targeted through the decarbonisation of the 
Group’s balance sheet, investments in clean energy and start-ups, development of climate friendly investment products, and focus on own 
operations. The Group also continues to use its influence as a large investor to promote the transition.

Scenario analysis is performed to help understand the strategic implications of possible climate pathways, including the key features of a transition 
to a net zero economy. Plausible scenarios have been developed based on estimations of how the energy system may evolve over the next 30 years, 
using the most recent carbon budgets from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) and incorporated 
latest data on technology costs. These include two different pathways to ‘below 2°C’, and a scenario assuming achievement of net zero. Given the 
Group’s long-term climate risk relates to transition risk, a fourth scenario assuming global failure to act on climate change and emissions growth at 
historical rates has been modelled, but the impacts have not been applied to our portfolio. Such impacts are driven by physical risks which tend to 
be highly localised and manifest further into the future and are therefore more uncertain.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate change, and in particular the transition to a lower 
carbon economy, on the valuation of the Group’s assets and liabilities. In the Strategic report, with additional information in the Group’s Climate and 
nature report, we have set out in detail the various risks and opportunities that are created by this transition, and how they may impact the Group 
across various time horizons. In line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we have further 
described the resilience of the Group’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, as described above. There is no one 
single scenario that underpins the financial statements. The scenarios help challenge the Group’s perspectives on the future business and economic 
environment as a result of the transition to a lower carbon economy, including consideration of events that may be only remotely possible. As a 
result, the scenarios covered are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or outcomes and are not the basis on which the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared.

At the current time, the Group does not consider climate risk to represent a significant area of judgement or of estimation uncertainty. As at 
31 December 2023, no material impacts on the Group’s financial position, nor on the valuation of assets or liabilities on the Group’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet as a result of climate change risk have been identified. In arriving at this determination, the Group has in particular taken into account 
the following areas of judgement, which we consider to be those most exposed to the potential impact of climate change in the preparation of the 
financial statements:

Going concern and viability
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are required to assess the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, by taking 
into account all available information related to at least 12 months from the date of their approval. Additionally, the preparation of the viability 
statement takes into consideration the Group’s overall business model and strategy, forecast financial strength and resilience, and the liquidity 
profile over the planning horizon. Climate-related matters have been considered as part of these assessments and have not been deemed to create 
material uncertainties as to their conclusions or to require specific disclosure.

Valuation of Level 3 financial investments and investment property
The valuation of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property has been separately identified as an area of significant estimation uncertainty. 
The assumptions used in the models underpinning these assets’ valuations, such as cash flows forecasts, discount rates, and multiples, are often 
unobservable. Due to the need to apply significant judgements, these assumptions can be impacted by transition risk, with climate-related inputs 
gaining more traction (e.g. construction methods and materials, EPC ratings, ESG credentials and climate resilience). This is particularly relevant for 
the Group’s direct investments portfolio, including alternative assets. Where possible, the Group’s assets are valued using standard market pricing 
sources or appropriately qualified external valuers, and therefore reflect current market sentiments around climate risk. In this respect, market and 
investor expectations have also been evolving, with greater demand towards net zero-aligned assets, and away from traditional carbon-intensive 
methods, impacting expected investor returns and therefore discount rates and multiples. Exposure to the risks of climate change is minimised 
through rigorous assessment of potential investments and active monitoring of the carbon intensity of the current portfolio. Additionally, investment 
properties are being reviewed by independent third parties, where applicable, with regards to potential retrofitting, to help reduce carbon emissions 
and make them more efficient and sustainable for the future. 

Asset impairment and residual economic life
The carrying value of goodwill, intangible and certain tangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet which are subject to impairment testing 
could be affected by climate change risk. For example, inventory may become obsolete or restricted, causing selling prices to decline or their costs 
of completion to increase. If, as a result, the cost of inventories is not recoverable, they would need to be written down to their net realisable value.

Primary statements and performance  
continued

1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
(vi) Consideration of climate change continued
Asset impairment and residual economic life continued
Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill and intangible assets may see their recoverable amount decrease in light of climate 
change, and significant changes in the environment (including for example changes in regulation) in which the Group operates, where adverse 
effects can represent an indication of impairment. The estimation of recoverable amount as ‘value in use’ requires an assessment of future expected 
cash flows based on assumptions potentially affected by climate-related matters, particularly for goodwill and intangible assets, which are subject 
to a higher degree of judgement. Where assets are subject to amortisation or depreciation, consideration needs to be given to whether climate risk 
suggests that the residual economic life is shorter than anticipated, which would give rise to increased charges in the income statement. Due to the 
nature of the Group’s assets, we do not anticipate any material additional impairments or increased amortisation and depreciation charges to arise 
from climate change. Risks will continue to be monitored against judgements and estimates used in the assessment of impairment. 

Insurance contract liabilities
The Group’s insurance contracts are valued using discount rates derived from the backing asset portfolios with deductions made to remove risks 
that are present in the assets but are not relevant to the insurance liability. Climate-related risks could impact on the Group’s exposure to future credit 
losses which would impact on the appropriate yield deductions in the discount rate calculation and therefore the insurance contract valuations.

Provisions and contingent liabilities
The recognition, measurement and disclosure of provisions and contingent liabilities is subject to setting assumptions around future events and the 
probability of their occurrence. Climate-related matters could affect these elements, for example by requiring recognition or disclosure of a legal 
obligation (e.g. levies imposed for failing climate-related targets) or of a constructive obligation (e.g. requirements to remediate environmental 
damage caused by the Group’s operations and investment portfolios). 

Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses and credits, to the extent it is probable that future 
taxable profit will be available, against which those amounts can be utilised. Climate-related matters could affect the Group’s estimate of future 
taxable profits, and therefore it may be required to derecognise deferred tax assets previously on the balance sheet.

Share-based payments
The Group’s performance share plans provide a direct and transparent link between executive pay and the delivery of shareholder returns over the 
longer-term. They are a conditional award of shares subject to a performance period of at least three years. Performance metrics for the Group’s 
share plans are now clearly linked to ESG metrics. As such, the effects of climate change could have an impact on amount and timing, recognition 
and measurement of amounts in the Group’s income statement and statement of comprehensive income. 

Financial instruments
Expected credit losses are required to be recognised on receivables and certain financial investments, representing the counterparty’s probability of 
default over a certain time horizon. Climate-related matters may affect the Group’s exposure to these losses, for example by negatively affecting the 
borrower’s ability to meet their obligations, or by affecting assumptions used in the models adopted to estimate expected credit losses. 

(vii) Material accounting policies 
Consolidation principles
Subsidiary undertakings 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the Company and of its 
subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full. 

Subsidiaries are those entities (including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts) over which the Group directly or indirectly has control 
(i.e. when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the investee) (Note 40). 

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the Group to record the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of the acquired business at fair value on the date of acquisition. The excess of the fair value of acquisition consideration over 
the recorded value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as goodwill. Profits or losses of 
subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of 
gaining control. 

Puttable instruments held by external parties in consolidated investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as 
‘Net asset value attributable to unit holders’ in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Associates and joint ventures 
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but which it does not control. It is presumed that the Group has significant 
influence where it has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights in the investee unless indicated otherwise. Joint ventures are entities where the 
Group and other parties have joint control over their activities. 

The Group has interests in associates and joint ventures (Note 40) which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity vehicles, 
mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities. In accordance with the choice permitted by IAS 28, ‘Investments in associates’, these interests have 
been classified as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement.

Other information

Associates and joint ventures which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of these associates or joint ventures is included within the carrying value of those investments. Their carrying 
amount is increased or decreased to reflect the Group’s share of total comprehensive income after the date of the acquisition. Where the carrying 
amount of an associate or joint venture is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of 
disposal and value in use, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount, with an impairment loss recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.

Insurance contracts 
Long term insurance contracts – initial measurement
Insurance contracts are contracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the insurer at the inception of the contract. This is the case if, and only 
if, an insured event could cause an insurer to make significant additional payments in any scenario, other than a scenario which lacks commercial 
substance. Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire. 

At inception, the Group separates the following components from an insurance or reinsurance contract and accounts for them as if they were 
stand-alone financial instruments: 

•  derivatives embedded in the contract whose economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract, and whose 

terms would not meet the definition of an insurance or reinsurance contract as a stand-alone instrument; and

•  distinct investment components, i.e. investment components that are not highly inter-related with the insurance components and for which 

contracts with equivalent terms are sold, or could be sold, separately in the same market or the same jurisdiction.

After separating any financial instrument components, the Group separates any promises to transfer to policyholders distinct goods or services 
other than insurance coverage and investment services and accounts for them as separate contracts with customers (i.e. not as insurance 
contracts). A good or service is distinct if the policyholder can benefit from it either on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the 
policyholder. A good or service is not distinct and is accounted for together with the insurance component if the cash flows and risks associated 
with the good or service are highly inter-related with the cash flows and risks associated with the insurance component, and the Group provides a 
significant service of integrating the good or service with the insurance component.

Recognition and level of aggregation
An insurance contract is recognised at the earliest of the following:

(a)  the beginning of the coverage period;
(b)  the date when the first payment from a policyholder becomes due; and
(c)  for onerous contracts, when the contract becomes onerous.

The level of aggregation determines the unit of account at which IFRS 17 calculations are performed. This is determined firstly by dividing the 
business written into portfolios. Portfolios comprise groups of contracts with similar risks which are managed together. Portfolios are further 
divided based on expected profitability at inception into three categories: onerous contracts, contracts with no significant risk of subsequently 
becoming onerous, and the remainder. IFRS 17 also requires that no group for level of aggregation purposes may contain contracts issued more 
than one year apart.

All of the Group’s in scope insurance contracts are accounted for under the general measurement model which measures a group of insurance 
contracts as the total of:

•  fulfilment cash flows; and
•  a contractual service margin (CSM) representing the unearned profit the Group will recognise as it provides services under the insurance contract.

Fulfilment cash flows
Fulfilment cash flows comprise unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of future cash flows, discounted to present value to reflect the time 
value of money and financial risks, plus a risk adjustment for non-financial risk. The Group’s objective in estimating future cash flows is to determine 
the expected value, or the probability weighted mean, of the full range of possible outcomes, considering all reasonable and supportable information 
available at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. The Group estimates future cash flows considering a range of scenarios which have 
commercial substance and give a good representation of possible outcomes. The cash flows from each scenario are probability-weighted and 
discounted using current assumptions.

Long term insurance contracts – initial measurement continued
When estimating future cash flows, the Group includes all cash flows that are within the contract boundary. The cash flows include:

investment management costs incurred in the provision of an investment return service or to enhance the benefits of an insurance contract;

•  premiums and related cash flows;
•  claims and benefits, including reported claims not yet paid, incurred claims not yet reported and expected future claims;
• 
•  payments to policyholders resulting from embedded surrender value options;
•  an allocation of insurance acquisition cash flows attributable to the portfolio to which the contract belongs;
•  claims handling costs;
•  policy administration and maintenance costs, including recurring commissions that are expected to be paid to intermediaries for future services;
•  an allocation of fixed and variable overheads directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts; and
• 

transaction-based taxes.

The Group incorporates, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the amount, 
timing and uncertainty of those future cash flows. The Group estimates the probabilities and amounts of future payments under existing contracts 
based on information obtained, including:

information about claims already reported by policyholders;

• 
•  other information about the known or estimated characteristics of the insurance contracts;
•  historical data about the Group’s own experience, supplemented when necessary, with data from other sources (historical data is adjusted to 

reflect current conditions); and

•  current pricing information, when available.

The measurement of fulfilment cash flows includes insurance acquisition cash flows which are allocated as a portion of premium to profit or loss 
(through insurance revenue) over the period of the contract. 

Pre-recognition, insurance acquisition cash flow assets are recognised on the balance sheet prior to allocation to new insurance contracts and are 
considered for impairment at each reporting date.

Risk adjustment 
The risk adjustment for non-financial risk for a group of insurance contracts reflects the compensation that the Group would require for bearing 
uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arise from non-financial risk after diversification. The Group’s risk adjustment is 
calibrated using a Value at Risk (VAR) methodology. In some cases, the compensation for risk on reinsured business is linked directly to the price 
paid for reinsurance. 

Discounting
The insurance contract fulfilment cash flows are discounted at rates that reflect the characteristics of the insurance contract liabilities. These are 
determined by starting from an appropriate asset portfolio with deductions to remove risks in the assets that are not present in the insurance 
liabilities.

Contractual service margin (CSM)
The Group’s CSM is a component of the asset or liability for the group of insurance contracts that represents the unearned profit the Group will 
recognise as it provides services in the future. The Group measures the CSM on initial recognition at an amount that, unless the group of contracts 
is onerous, results in no income or expenses arising from:

initial recognition of the fulfilment cash flows;

• 
•  any cash flows arising from the contracts in the Group at that date;
• 

the derecognition at the date of initial recognition of:
 – any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows; and
 – any other asset or liability previously recognised related to the group of insurance contracts.

Onerous contracts
For groups of contracts assessed as onerous, the Group recognises a loss in profit or loss for the net outflow, resulting in the carrying amount of the 
liability for the Group being equal to the fulfilment cash flows and the CSM of the Group being zero. A loss component is established by the Group for 
the liability for remaining coverage for an onerous group, which represents the losses recognised.

Reinsurance contracts – initial measurement
The initial measurement of reinsurance contracts held follows the same principles as those for insurance contracts issued, with the exception of 
the following:

• 

reinsurance contracts are recognised from the earlier of the following:
 – the beginning of the coverage period; and
 – the date the entity recognises an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts, if the entity entered into the related reinsurance contract 

held in the group of reinsurance contracts held at or before that date.

•  measurement of the cash flows includes an allowance on a probability-weighted basis for the effect of any non-performance by the reinsurers, 

including the effects of collateral and losses from disputes;
the Group determines the risk adjustment for non-financial risk so that it represents the amount of risk being transferred to the reinsurer;

• 
•  both day one gains and day one losses are not recognised at initial recognition in the Consolidated Balance Sheet but are deferred into the CSM 

and released to profit or loss as the reinsurer renders services, except for any portion of a day one loss that relates to events before initial 
recognition; and
if the reinsurance contract is recognised prior to a loss-making underlying contract, the reinsurance CSM can be adjusted to offset a portion of 
the inception loss (the loss recovery component). This offsets a portion of the loss recognised on inception of the underlying onerous contract.

• 

Long term insurance contracts – subsequent measurement
The Group measures the carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts at the end of each reporting period as the sum of: 

(i)  the liability for remaining coverage comprising fulfilment cash flows related to future service allocated to the Group at that date and the CSM of 

the Group at that date; and 

(ii)  the liability for incurred claims for the Group reflecting the fulfilment cash flows related to past service allocated to the Group at that date.

Contractual service margin – measurement
The CSM at the end of the reporting period represents the profit in the group of insurance contracts that has not yet been recognised in profit or loss, 
because it relates to future service to be provided.

For a group of insurance contracts the carrying amount of the CSM of that group at the end of the reporting period equals the carrying amount at the 
beginning of the reporting period adjusted for:

the effect of any new contracts added;
interest accreted on the carrying amount of the CSM during the reporting period, measured at the discount rates at initial recognition;

• 
• 
•  changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service, except to the extent that:

 – such increases in the fulfilment cash flows exceed the current carrying amount of the CSM, giving rise to a loss; or
 – such decreases in the fulfilment cash flows are allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage;
the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the transfer of services in the period, determined by allocation of the contractual service 
margin at the end of the period over the current and remaining coverage period; and
the effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM.

• 

• 

The changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service that adjust the CSM comprise of:

•  experience adjustments that arise from the difference between the premium receipts (net of refunds) and any related cash flows such as 
insurance acquisition cash flows and insurance premium taxes and the estimate, at the beginning of the period, of the amounts expected. 
Differences related to premiums received (or due) in respect of current or past services are recognised immediately in profit or loss while 
differences related to premiums received (or due) for future services are adjusted in the CSM;

•  changes in estimates of the present value of future cash flows in the liability for remaining coverage, except those relating to the time value of 

money and changes in financial risk (which are instead recognised in the profit or loss or in other comprehensive income);

•  differences between any investment component expected to become payable in the period and the actual investment component that becomes 

payable in the period; and

•  changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that relate to future service.

Adjustments to the CSM noted above are measured at discount rates that reflect the characteristics of the cash flows of the group of insurance 
contracts at initial recognition (i.e. the weighted average of the rates applicable at the date of initial recognition of contracts that joined a group over 
a 12-month period).

Onerous contracts
Groups of contracts that were not onerous at initial recognition can subsequently become onerous if assumptions and experience extinguish the 
CSM. In this case, the Group establishes a loss component for the future losses recognised. The loss component is released based on a systematic 
allocation of the subsequent changes in the fulfilment cash flows to: (i) the loss component; and (ii) the liability for remaining coverage excluding the 
loss component. The loss component is also updated for subsequent changes in estimates of the fulfilment cash flows related to future service. 
The systematic allocation of subsequent changes to the loss component results in the total amounts allocated to the loss component being equal 
to zero by the end of the coverage period of a group of contracts (since the loss component will have materialised in the form of incurred claims). 
The loss component ensures that over the duration of the contract, the correct amounts are recognised as insurance revenue and insurance 
service expenses.

Contractual service margin – recognition
The amount of contractual service margin recognised in the income statement for a group of insurance contracts reflects the insurance contract 
services provided. The proportion of the CSM earned is calculated as the amount of coverage units provided in the period divided by the sum of 
all the future and current period coverage units. The Group has elected to discount the future coverage units in this calculation. The table below 
indicates the main insurance contracts services provided under the Group’s insurance contracts and selected coverage unit(s) used to measure 
those services.

Where a specific unit of account contains a mixture of services, and therefore coverage units, it is necessary to weight the coverage units so that 
the resulting profile of CSM release reflects the overall package of benefits provided. This is particularly pertinent to units of account incorporating a 
combination of immediate and deferred annuities. Under IFRS 17, deferred annuities usually provide multiple services, split between the two phases 
of benefit provision (the deferral phase and the payment phase). Judgement is therefore required to combine the different coverage units so that 
they fairly reflect the services provided. The weighting between the deferral phase and the payment phase coverage units is calculated so that the 
services provided in the deferral phase reflect the investment return provided and the probability weighted delivery of any lump sum death benefits, 
both adjusted so that all of the CSM is earned in the deferral phase for all contracts which do not enter the payment phase either through transfer 
out, withdrawal of funds or death.

Investment components
The Group identifies the investment component of a contract by determining the amount that it would be required to repay to the policyholder in all 
scenarios with commercial substance. Investment components are not included in insurance revenue and insurance service expenses.

Insurance finance income and expenses
Insurance finance income and expenses comprise changes in the carrying amounts of groups of insurance contracts arising from the effects of 
the time value of money, financial risk and changes therein. IFRS 17 requires an accounting policy decision as to whether to recognise all finance 
income or expense in profit or loss, or whether to disaggregate the income or expense that relates to changes in financial assumptions into other 
comprehensive income. Finance income and expense has been included in profit or loss for all insurance products except for the Group’s protection 
business where it has been disaggregated between profit and loss and other comprehensive income. Where insurance finance income and expense 
has been disaggregated the amount included in profit or loss is determined by a systematic allocation of the expected total insurance finance 
income or expenses over the duration of the group of contracts, using the discount rates determined on initial recognition. 

Changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk have been disaggregated between insurance service result and insurance finance income 
and expenses.

Reinsurance contracts held – subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of reinsurance contracts held follows the same principles as those for insurance contracts issued except that 
changes in the fulfilment cash flows are recognised in profit or loss if the related changes arising from the underlying ceded contracts are 
recognised in profit or loss.

Derecognition and contract modification of insurance contracts
The Group derecognises a contract when it is extinguished, i.e. when the specified obligations in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled. 

The Group also derecognises a contract if its terms are modified in a way that would have changed the accounting for the contract significantly had 
the new terms always existed, in which case a new contract based on the modified terms is recognised. If a contract modification does not result in 
derecognition, then the Group treats the changes in cash flows caused by the modification as changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows.

Financial instruments 
Recognition and derecognition
Initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities is on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for a financial asset or financial liability not 
measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. When the fair value of financial 
assets and liabilities differs from the transaction price on initial recognition, the Group recognises the difference as follows:

•  when the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (i.e. a Level 1 input) or based on a valuation 

• 

technique that uses only data from observable markets, the difference is recognised as a gain or loss; and
in all other cases, the difference is deferred and the timing of recognition of deferred day one profit or loss is determined individually. It is either 
amortised over the life of the instrument, deferred until the instrument’s fair value can be determined using market observable inputs or realised 
through settlement.

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when the Group transfers substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity. This is the case for cash collateral pledged, where the counterparty has contractual rights to 
receive the cash flows generated, and which is derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a corresponding receivable recognised for its 
return.

The Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, but retains either all or substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Examples of such transactions are 
repurchase agreements and non-cash collateral pledged, unless the Group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement. 

In transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it 
retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to 
which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled. The Group also derecognises 
a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial 
liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. 

On derecognition of a financial asset or financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount at the date of derecognition and the 
consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.

Modification
If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different. 
If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. 
In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. 

Classification and measurement of financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets on initial recognition as measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). 

The classification and measurement of financial assets depends on their contractual cash flow characteristics and how they are managed (the 
entity’s business model). The contractual cash flow characteristics test aims to identify those assets with cash flows consistent with a basic lending 
arrangement, i.e. which are ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI). The business model test refers to how an entity manages its financial 
assets with the objectives of generating cash flows. These factors determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or 
FVTPL. Assets are therefore typically characterised as follows:

•  amortised cost: financial assets with contractual terms that give rise solely to interest and principal cash flows, and which are held in a business 
model whose objective is to hold the assets to collect their cash flows. They are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also 
recognised in profit or loss;

•  FVOCI: financial assets with contractual terms that give rise solely to interest and principal cash flows, and which are held in a business model 
whose objective is achieved by holding the assets to collect their cash flows and selling them. Interest income calculated using the effective 
interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised 
in other comprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss; and

•  FVTPL: all other financial assets. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income and foreign exchange gains and losses, are 
recognised in profit or loss, unless they arise from derivatives designated as hedging instruments in cash flow or net investment hedges.

Notwithstanding the above, on initial recognition the Group may irrevocably designate to FVTPL a financial asset that would otherwise be measured 
at amortised cost or FVOCI if doing so eliminates or greatly reduces an accounting mismatch.

In making the SPPI assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement (that is, 
interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a 
basic lending arrangement). This includes evaluating whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount 
of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. Examples of such contractual terms to be considered are contingent events that 
would change the amount or timing of cash flows, leverage features, prepayment and extension features, non-recourse asset arrangements and 
features that modify consideration for the time value of money (e.g. periodic reset of interest rates). 

The business model reflects how the Group manages assets in order to generate cash flows, i.e. it reflects whether the Group’s objective is solely to 
collect the contractual cash flows from assets or to collect both the contractual cash flows and cash flows arising from the sale of assets. If neither 
of these is applicable (for example, financial assets are held for trading purposes), the business model is ‘other’ and the financial asset is measured 
at FVTPL. Factors considered by the Group in determining the business model for a group of assets include past experience on how the cash flows 
for these assets were collected, how the asset’s performance is evaluated and reported to key management personnel, how risks are assessed and 
managed, and how managers are compensated.

Financial instruments  continued
Modification continued
The objective of the Group’s business model for certain debt instruments, in particular those instruments backing annuity or investment contract 
liabilities, including surplus assets, is to fund its liabilities. Consistent with the Group’s investment strategy their performance is evaluated on a total 
return basis, as significant buying and selling activity is undertaken on a regular basis to rebalance its portfolio and to ensure that contractual cash 
flows from those assets are sufficient to settle the underlying liabilities. These investments do not follow a ‘held to collect’ or ‘held to collect and sell’ 
business model, and are therefore accounted for at FVTPL. This business model is also applicable to reverse repurchase agreements and to 
derivatives. Equity instruments are accounted for at FVTPL.

Certain debt securities are held in separate portfolios for longer-term yield. These include long dated debt instruments backing annuities liabilities, 
but in surplus to the IFRS 17 best estimate liability and risk adjustment, used to manage interest and inflation rate exposure, as well as assets 
backing protection liabilities. These assets represent instruments consistent with the SPPI principles, and are accounted for at amortised cost or 
FVOCI depending on the expected level of trading. 

Receivables are accounted for at amortised cost. 

Classification and measurement of financial liabilities
The Group classifies and subsequently measures financial liabilities at amortised cost or FVTPL. 

Investment contract liabilities
Investment contract liabilities are measured at FVTPL. This is because these liabilities, as well as the related assets, are managed and their 
performance evaluated on a fair value basis. For unit linked liabilities, fair value is determined by reference to the value of the underlying net asset 
values of the Group’s unitised investment funds at the balance sheet date. 

Core and operational borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. The difference between 
the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.

Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities include derivative liabilities, repurchase agreements and trail commission, which are measured at FVTPL, while other 
payable balances are measured at amortised cost. 

Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into. The Group’s derivatives, other than those 
designated as hedging instruments in cash flow or net investment hedges, are instruments held for trading and, are therefore accounted for at FVTPL. 

Derivatives may be embedded in another contractual arrangement. If such a hybrid contract contains a host that is a financial asset, the Group 
assesses the entire contract for classification and measurement purposes. Otherwise, the Group accounts for an embedded derivative separately 
from the host contract when:

• 
• 
• 

its economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract;
the terms of the embedded derivative would have met the definition of a derivative if they were contained in a separate contract; and
the hybrid contract is not measured at FVTPL.

These embedded derivatives are separately accounted for at FVTPL, unless the Group chooses to designate the entire hybrid contract at FVTPL.

A derivative embedded in a host insurance or reinsurance contract is not accounted for separately from the host contract if the embedded derivative 
itself meets the definition of an insurance or reinsurance contract.

Collateral
Collateral received in the form of cash, which is not legally segregated from the Group, is recognised as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
with a corresponding liability for the repayment in Payables and other financial liabilities. However, where the Group has a currently enforceable legal 
right of set-off and the ability and intent to net settle, the collateral liability and associated derivative balances are shown net.

Non-cash collateral received is not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless the transfer of the collateral meets the derecognition 
criteria from the perspective of the transferor. Such collateral is typically recognised when the Group either: (a) sells or repledges these assets in the 
absence of default, at which point the obligation to return this collateral is recognised as a liability; or (b) the counterparty to the arrangement 
defaults, at which point the collateral is seized and recognised as an asset. 

Collateral pledged in the form of cash, which is legally segregated from the Group, is derecognised from the statement of financial position with a 
corresponding receivable recognised for its return. Non-cash collateral pledged is not derecognised from the statement of financial position unless 
the Group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement, and therefore continues to be recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
within Financial investments.

Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss (ECL) associated with its financial assets measured at amortised cost 
and FVOCI, and recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. Expected credit losses are defined as the present value of the 
difference between all contractual cash flows that are due and all cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. the cash shortfall), weighted 
based on their probability of occurrence. The loss allowance recognised under the new standard can be equal to an amount corresponding to a 
12-month ECL or a lifetime ECL. A lifetime ECL is the ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial asset; a 
12-month ECL is the portion of lifetime ECL resulting from default events on a financial asset that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting 
date. For a financial asset that is credit-impaired at the reporting date, but that is not a purchased or originated credit-impaired financial asset, 
expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the asset’s gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as an impairment gain or loss.

The Group defines default on a financial asset as the inability to meet in full and on time an original promise of expected cash flows, the amount and 
timing of which are defined with certainty. Any breach of this promise, by any amount or time (in excess of any potential planned grace period), 
constitutes a default. This is consistent with the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes.

The ECL model is run from the date of initial recognition of a financial asset, and its output updated at every reporting period, even if no actual loss 
events have taken place. The impact of updating the inputs of the ECL model in the reporting period is recognised in profit or loss directly where it 
affects the carrying value of financial assets at amortised cost, while for assets at FVOCI an equal and opposite movement is recorded in other 
comprehensive income. 

In order to determine whether the Group measures ECLs at an amount equal to 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL, at each reporting period the Group is 
required to assess which ‘stage’ a financial asset falls into. Stages reflect the general pattern of deterioration in credit risk of a financial instrument 
that ultimately defaults, as follows:

•  Stage 1 includes financially healthy financial assets that are expected to perform in line with their contractual terms, and which have no signs of 

increased credit risk;

•  Stage 2 includes financial assets for which a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition, but which are not credit-

impaired; and

•  Stage 3 applies to credit-impaired financial instruments.

When financial assets are under Stage 1, 12-month ECLs are recognised. When financial assets are under Stage 2 or 3, lifetime ECLs are recognised. 
An instrument moves down (or up) the stages when a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) has happened (or has reversed). 

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers 
reasonable and supportable information, both qualitative and quantitative, that is relevant and is available without undue cost or effort, including 
forward-looking information at its disposal. Key indicators used in order to determine whether a SICR has occurred (either in isolation or in 
combination) are:

•  deterioration in rating grade between origination date and reporting date. The level of deterioration required by an individual asset is determined 

using a relative rating matrix;

•  exposure is identified on the investment managers’ ‘watchlist’;
•  exposure is identified on internal ‘credit watchlists’; and
•  a manual shift of an exposure to Stage 2 on an exceptional basis (where required, using management judgement).

The provisions of IFRS 9 include a rebuttable presumption that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition 
when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, which is taken into account for this assessment.

The Group makes use of a practical expedient available in IFRS 9 whereby it can be assumed that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not 
increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date (e.g. investment 
grade as determined by the Group’s asset managers). This allows recognition of 12-month ECLs as opposed to, potentially, lifetime ECLs. This is 
deemed to be the case where assets that have been downgraded remain of good credit quality (i.e. investment grade as determined by the Group’s 
asset managers) as at the reporting date, to the extent that, where relevant, the Group’s internal credit risk ratings are considered to be consistent 
with a globally understood definition of ‘low credit risk’.

The Group estimates ECLs on its financial investments at amortised cost and debt instruments at FVOCI which are not credit impaired by using 
the probability of default approach. Based on this method, the ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of the present value of estimated cash 
shortfalls, i.e. the weighted average of credit losses, with the respective risks of a default occurring used as the weightings. For this purpose, the key 
elements to be calculated are the Probability of Default (PD), i.e. the estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon (either 12 months 
or lifetime); the respective Loss Given Default (LGD); and the Exposure at Default (EAD). 

In order to determine 12-month or lifetime PDs the Group’s models utilise historical data obtained from S&P and Moody’s in order to evaluate 
transitions (i.e. the probability that a security changes rating in a given year) and defaults, plus scenario-specific annual scaling factors which adjust 
the PDs for forward-looking information. The final PDs produced by the model are unconditional, i.e. they incorporate both the probability of not 
defaulting until the start of the period, and the subsequent probability of default in that period, conditional on the position not having defaulted to 
that point. This allows them to be summed over 12 months to provide 12-month PD estimates, or over all remaining months to produce lifetime 
PD estimates.

LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default, based on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties, 
and taking into account collateral values where applicable. 

EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group estimates LGD based on the history of recovery rates of claims against 
defaulted counterparties. Appropriate haircuts are applied to baseline unsecured LGDs and used in conjunction with forecast collateral values to 
estimate LGD for assets secured by collateral. 

The Group has adopted a simplified approach for trade receivables, contract assets and finance and operating lease receivables. This allows 
measurement of lifetime ECLs only, thereby removing the need to identify SICRs. For these balances, the Group makes use of provision matrices in 
order to calculate such lifetime ECLs. This is a practical expedient allowed by IFRS 9 whereby historical credit loss experience and fixed loss rates 
are applied to the balances outstanding. Historical loss rates are adjusted to allow for forward looking information.

Hedge accounting
The Group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash 
flow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. Hedge accounting can be applied in order to:

•  hedge the exposure to fair value movements of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or a component of any such 

item, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect the Consolidated Income Statement;

•  hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with all, or a component of, a recognised asset or liability, 

or a highly probable forecast transaction, that could affect the Consolidated Income Statement; and

•  hedge the exposure to the currency risk associated with a net investment in a foreign operation.

The relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking 
the hedge transaction, are documented formally at the inception of the transaction. The documentation includes identification of the hedging 
instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge 
effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging 
relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:

• 
• 
• 

there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;
the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and
the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and 
the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

Currently, the Group hedges foreign exchange translation and interest rate risks on its fixed rate USD denominated borrowings (the hedged items), 
using cross currency interest rate swaps (the hedging items). It recognises the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging items in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and in a separate reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged 
item affects profit or loss.

Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date.

Fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent 
sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Group’s view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. The Group 
utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. 

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price. In certain circumstances, the fair 
value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price. If the fair value is evidenced by comparison to a quoted price in an active market for an 
identical instrument, or is based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, the difference between the fair value at initial 
recognition and the transaction price is recognised as a gain or loss in the Consolidated Income Statement. In all other cases, the difference 
between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is deferred and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the life 
of the instrument to the extent that it arises from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants would take into account when pricing 
the instrument. 

Revenue
Insurance revenue
The Group’s insurance revenue depicts the provision of services arising from a group of insurance contracts, reflecting the consideration the Group 
expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Insurance revenue from a group of insurance contracts is therefore the relevant portion for 
the period of the total consideration for the contracts (i.e. the amount of premiums paid to the Group adjusted for financing effect (the time value of 
money) and excluding any investment components).

Other information

The total consideration for a group of contracts covers amounts related to the provision of services and is comprised of: 

the release of the CSM; 

• 
•  changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk relating to current service; 
•  claims and other insurance service expenses expected at the beginning of the period; 
•  experience adjustments arising from premiums received in the period other than those that relate to future service; 
• 

insurance acquisition cost recovery determined by allocating the portion of premiums related to the recovery of those costs on the basis of 
insurance coverage provided; and 

•  other amounts, including any other pre-recognition cash flow assets derecognised at the date of initial recognition.

Fees from fund management and investment contracts
The Group generates revenue from acting as the investment manager for clients. Fees charged on investment management services are based on 
the contractual fee arrangements applied to assets under management and recognised as revenue as the services are provided.

The Group’s income from investment contracts is primarily derived from fees for administration and managing of funds in pension plans. Revenue 
generated on investment contracts is recognised as services are provided. No significant judgements are applied on the timing or transaction price. 
In the instances of performance fees where revenue is subject to meeting a certain performance threshold, such revenue is not recognised until the 
condition has been met, and it is highly probable that no significant reversal of amounts would occur. Variable costs directly related to securing new 
contracts are capitalised and amortised over the estimated period over which the revenue is earned.

Transaction fees are charged to implement trades for clients. Such fees are charged at the time the transaction takes place and are based on the 
size of the underlying contract. 

Other operational income from contracts with customers
House building
House building revenue arises from the sale of residential properties and land and is recognised net of discounts and sales incentives. It also 
includes sale proceeds of part exchange properties. Sales of private houses are recognised on legal completion. Sales of social housing, where 
multiple units are developed and sold under a contractual agreement with a single customer, typically a housing association, are recognised over 
time in accordance with construction progress. Sales of land and commercial property are recognised on unconditional exchange, namely when 
contracts are exchanged or missives concluded and, where appropriate, construction is complete. The transaction price is determined using 
extensive research and expert judgement, current market values and regional variations. 

Warranties are provided on all properties and range from 2-10 years. Due to their features, these do not represent separate performance obligations. 

Professional services fees
The Group’s professional services fees revenue arises from professional services provided by employed surveyors and third-party providers, panel 
management fees and administration fees. These fees are based on fee scales or contracts. Revenue is recognised when the service has been 
rendered.

In addition, the Group derives professional fees from facilitation of mortgage arrangements and related products such as conveyancing. These are 
based on an agreement/contract and could be tiered based on volume. The obligation in such instances is satisfied on completion of the mortgage/
service, at which point the revenue is recognised. There is no significant judgement applied on the timing or amount of fee recognised.

Insurance broker fees
Fees are charged on each performance obligation offered to the customer as per the agreed structure. Revenue for placement services is 
recognised at the point in time when the intermediary has satisfied its performance obligation, that is when the terms of the insurance policy have 
been agreed contractually by the insurer and policyholder, and the insurer has a present right to payment from the policyholder. No significant 
judgements are applied on the timing or transaction price.

Investment return
Investment return includes unrealised fair value gains and losses on financial investments at fair value through profit or loss, realised gains and 
losses, dividends, rent and interest. Dividends are accrued on an ex-dividend basis. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account 
the effective yield on the investment. Rental income is recognised on an accruals basis, and is generally recognised on a straight line basis unless 
there is compelling evidence that benefits do not accrue evenly over the period of the lease. Interest income for financial assets which are not 
classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) is recognised using the effective interest method.

A gain or loss on a financial investment is only realised on disposal or transfer, and is the difference between the proceeds received, net of 
transaction costs and its original cost or amortised cost, as appropriate. Realised gains or losses on investment property represent the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the property.

Unrealised gains and losses represent the difference between the carrying value at the end of the year and the carrying value at the previous year end 
or purchase value during the year, less the reversal of previously unrealised gains and losses in respect of disposals made during the year.

Insurance service expenses
Insurance service expenses arising from insurance contracts are recognised in profit or loss as they are incurred. They exclude repayments of 
investment components and comprise the following items:

• 
• 
• 
• 

incurred claims and benefits, excluding investment components reduced by loss component allocations; 
incurred directly attributable expenses; 
insurance acquisition cost amortisation; and
insurance acquisition cost asset impairment.

Dividends
Interim dividends on ordinary shares are deducted from retained earnings in the period in which they are paid. Final dividends on ordinary shares 
are recognised as a liability in the period in which they have been approved by shareholders of the Company.

Earnings per share
Earnings per share is a measure of the portion of the Group’s profit allocated to each outstanding share. It is calculated by dividing net income 
attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme 
treasury shares. For this purpose, net income is defined as the profit after tax, attributable to equity holders of the Company, derived from 
continuing operations. 

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted 
to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees. Potential or contingent share issuances 
are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets mainly consist of capitalised software costs and intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination (customer 
relationships and brand). 

Where software costs are separately identifiable and measurable, they are capitalised at cost and amortised over their expected useful life on a 
straight-line basis. Costs incurred to internally develop software are only capitalised if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or 
process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to 
complete such development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, such costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Intangible assets acquired via business combinations are recognised at fair value and are subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful life. 

The estimated amortisation periods for intangible assets with finite useful lives are as follows:

IT development and software: 3 – 10 years

• 
•  Customer relationship: 3 years

Amortisation methods, useful lives and any expected residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. 

The brand balance acquired by the Group is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortised. 

Intangible assets are tested for impairment either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and 
intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested when there are indications of impairment. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 

Investment property
Investment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long-term rental yields and capital growth, as well as right-of-use assets of the 
same nature, and are not occupied by the Group. Completed investment property is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement within investment return. Investment properties under construction are included within Property, plant and 
equipment, and are stated at cost less any impairment until construction is completed or fair value becomes reliably measurable.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, treasury bills and other short-term highly liquid investments with 
maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment includes tangible assets owned by the Group (such as land and office and other buildings) or held under lease 
arrangements (such as office buildings, IT equipment and vehicles). Property, plant and equipment includes owner occupied property held by a fund, 
the units of which determine benefits for its investors. In accordance with IAS 16, ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ the Group has elected to measure 
this asset at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within investment return. 

164

Legal & General Group Plc Annual report and accounts 2023

Strategic report

Governance

Financial statements

Other information

All other assets within Property, plant and equipment are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation, calculated on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful life. Amortisation methods, useful lives and any expected residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and 
adjusted if appropriate. 

An impairment review of Property, plant and equipment not carried at fair value is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, which is 
the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount, with an 
impairment loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 

Leases
Lessee
Where the Group is a lessee, it recognises leases on the balance sheet as ‘right-of-use’ assets and lease liabilities. 

The right-of-use assets’ value is initially recognised as the calculated value of the lease liabilities, initial direct costs and incentives received. The 
right-of-use assets are subsequently accounted for in accordance with the cost model in IAS 16, ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ or as investment 
property under IAS 40, ‘Investment Property’. The Group also assesses right-of-use assets classified as Property, plant and equipment for 
impairment when such indicators exist.

The initial measurement of the lease liabilities is made up of the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, including fixed 
lease payments and excluding lease incentive receivables. The Group uses the incremental borrowing rate as a discount rate for calculating the 
lease liabilities. The lease liabilities are unwound over the term of the lease giving rise to an interest expense. Additionally, the liabilities are reduced 
when lease payments are made. The Group reassesses the carrying amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets if certain events occur that 
modify the original assumptions used to calculate the lease balances upon initial recognition.

The Group leases offices, vehicles, IT equipment and investment properties under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The Group has 
elected to make use of the recognition exemptions as permitted in respect of short-term leases (lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less), 
and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value. Such leases are not recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but the Group 
recognises the associated lease payments as an expense over the lease term.

Lessor
Where the Group is the lessor, leases are classified as finance leases if the risks and rewards of ownership are substantially transferred to the lessee, 
and operating leases if they are not substantially transferred.

The Group leases certain investment properties to third parties. Under these agreements, substantially all the risks and reward incidental to 
ownership are transferred to the lessee, and therefore the contracts have been classified as finance leases. At the lease commencement date, the 
Group derecognises the investment property asset and recognises a receivable asset on its balance sheet to reflect the net investment in the lease, 
equal to the present value of the lease payments. The Group recognises finance income over the lease term to reflect the rate of return on the net 
investment in the lease.

Under other lease agreements the Group is considered to substantially retain all the risks and reward of ownership of the underlying asset, 
therefore these contracts have been classified as operating leases. Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be 
made. Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a 
separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The Group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected 
benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract. 

Defined benefit and defined contribution schemes
The liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, provided any surplus in the Fund and Scheme is not restricted. Plan assets 
exclude insurance contracts issued by the Group. The defined benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows. The discount rate is based on 
market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to 
maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.

The Group pays contractual contributions in respect of defined contribution schemes. The Group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due. Prepaid contributions are 
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.

Tax
Current tax
Current tax comprises tax payable on current year profits, adjusted for non-tax deductible or non-taxable items, and any adjustments to tax payable 
in respect of previous periods. Current tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement unless it relates to items which are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.

continued

1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
(vii) Material accounting policies continued 
Tax continued
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated on differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values. Deferred tax is also 
recognised in respect of unused tax losses to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the losses can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income or charged or credited directly in equity.

Tax attributable to policyholders and equity holders
The total tax expense shown in the Group’s Consolidated Income Statement includes income tax borne by both policyholders and equity holders. 
This has been split between tax attributable to policyholders’ returns and equity holders’ profits. Policyholder tax comprises the tax suffered on 
policyholder investment returns, while equity holder tax is corporation tax charged on equity holder profit. The separate presentation is intended 
to provide more relevant information about the tax that the Group pays on the profits that it makes.

Use of estimates
Tax balances include the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Income 
Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of 
current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.

For tax this includes the determination of assets and liabilities recognised in respect of uncertain tax positions and the estimation of future taxable 
income supporting deferred tax asset recognition.

As the Group operates internationally, it is exposed to uncertain tax positions and changes in legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The 
assessment of uncertain tax positions is subjective and significant management judgement is required. This judgement is based on interpretation of 
legislation, management experience and professional advice. The directors have assessed the Group’s uncertain tax positions and are comfortable 
that the provisions in place are not material individually or in aggregate, and that a reasonable possible alternative outcome in the next financial year 
would not have a material impact to the results of the Group.

Foreign exchange and exchange rates
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. The 
functional currency of the Group’s foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The assets 
and liabilities of all of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into sterling, the Group’s presentation currency, at the closing rate at the date of 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. On consolidation, exchange differences arising 
from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such 
investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow 
or net investment hedges.

Share-based payments
The Group accounts for options and awards under equity compensation plans, until such time as they are fully vested, using the fair value based 
method of accounting. The fair value at the date of grant of the equity instrument is recognised as an expense, spread over the vesting period of the 
instrument. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become 
exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment is made to 
equity. On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the income statement and the actual cost to the Group is transferred 
to retained earnings. Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.

Share capital, share premium and employee scheme treasury shares
An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity. It follows that a financial instrument is treated 
as equity if:

• 
• 

there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms; and 
the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a 
derivative which will be settled only by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a fixed number of its own equity 
instruments.

Where any Group entity purchases the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs 
(net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders. Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed 
of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the 
related income tax effects. Shares held on behalf of employee share schemes are disclosed as such on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Fiduciary activities
Assets associated with fiduciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets 
to customers, are not included in these financial statements. Where the Group acts in a fiduciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has 
no contractual rights over the assets concerned.

This supplementary adjusted operating profit information (one of the Group’s key performance indicators) provides additional analysis of the results 
reported under IFRS, and the Group believes that it provides stakeholders with useful information to enhance their understanding of the performance 
of the business in the year. While the calculation of adjusted operating profit has been updated to reflect the accounting and presentational impacts 
of IFRS 17, the key principles of what is measured by adjusted operating profit, as set out below and except as noted, remain unchanged from the 
prior year.

Adjusted operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes caused by 
changes in market conditions or expectations and exceptional items. Key considerations in relation to the calculation of adjusted operating profit for 
the Group’s long-term insurance businesses and shareholder funds are set out below.

Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition and start-up costs, 
are excluded from adjusted operating profit. 

Long-term insurance 
Adjusted operating profit reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the Group’s retirement and insurance businesses. Variances between 
actual and long-term expected investment return on traded and real assets are excluded from adjusted operating profit, as well as economic 
assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations (e.g. credit default and inflation) and any difference between the 
actual allocated asset mix and the target long-term asset mix on new pension risk transfer business. Assets held for future new pension risk transfer 
business are excluded from the asset portfolio used to determine the discount rate for annuities on insurance contract liabilities. The impact of 
investment management actions that optimise the yield of the assets backing the back book of annuity contracts is now included within adjusted 
operating profit; prior to the implementation of IFRS 17 the impact of such actions was not included in operating profit.

continued

2 Adjusted operating profit information and segmental analysis continued
(i) Adjusted operating profit continued
Long-term insurance continued
For the Group’s long-term insurance businesses, reinsurance mismatches are also excluded from adjusted operating profit. Reinsurance 
mismatches arise where the reinsurance offset rules in IFRS 17 do not reflect management’s view of the net of reinsurance transaction. In particular, 
during a year of reinsurance renegotiation, reinsurance gains cannot be recognised to offset any inception losses on the underlying contracts where 
they are recognised before the new reinsurance agreement is signed. In these circumstances, the onerous contract losses are reduced to reflect the 
net loss (if any) after reinsurance, and future contractual service margin (CSM) amortisation is reduced over the duration of the contracts.

Shareholder funds
Shareholder funds include both the Group’s traded investments portfolio and certain direct investments for which adjusted operating profit is based 
on the long-term economic return expected to be generated. For these direct investments, as well as for the Group’s traded investments portfolio, 
deviations from such long-term economic return are excluded from adjusted operating profit. Direct investments for which adjusted operating profit 
is reflected in this way include the following:

•  Development assets, predominantly in the specialist commercial real estate and housing sectors within the LGC alternative asset portfolio: these 

• 

are assets under construction and contracted to either be sold to other parts of the Group or for other commercial usage, and on which LGC 
accepts development risks and expects to realise profits once construction is complete.
‘Scale-up’ investments, predominantly in the alternative finance sector within the LGC alternative asset portfolio as well as the fintech business 
within Retail: these are investments in early-stage ventures in a fast-growing phase of their life cycle, but which have not yet reached a 
steady-state level of earnings.

Shareholder funds also includes other direct investments for which adjusted operating profit reflects the IFRS profit before tax. Direct investments 
for which adjusted operating profit is reflected in this way include the following:

• 

‘Start-up’ investments: these are companies in the beginning stages of their business lifecycle (i.e. typically less than 24 months) and which 
therefore have limited operating history available and typically are in a pre-revenue stage.

•  Mature assets: these are companies in their final stages of business lifecycle. They are stable businesses and have sustainable streams of 

income, but the growth rate in their earnings is expected to remain less pronounced in the future.

Business segments
The Group reports its results across the following business segments:

•  LGRI represents worldwide pension risk transfer business including longevity insurance.
•  LGC represents shareholder assets invested in direct investments primarily in the areas of specialist commercial real estate, clean energy, 

housing and alternative finance, as well as traded and treasury assets. 

•  LGIM represents institutional and retail investment management.
• 
•  Retail Retirement primarily represents retail annuity and drawdown products, workplace savings and lifetime mortgage loans.

Insurance primarily represents UK protection (both Group and retail) and fintech business, as well as US retail protection business.

Investment variance for LGRI and Retail includes a £318m expense (2022: £167m expense) arising from rate differences on longevity assumption changes in the period.

1. 
2.  Other investment variance includes the £167m one-off settlement cost associated with the buy-out of the Group’s UK defined benefit pension schemes (see Note 23 (iii) for further 
information) along with the current service costs and net interest expense up until that transaction. It also includes costs that LGIM is committed to incur on the extension of its 
existing partnership with State Street announced in 2021, to increase the use of Charles River technology across the front office and to deliver middle office services.

3.  M&A related and other variances includes gains and losses, expenses and intangible amortisation relating to acquisitions, disposals and restructuring as well as business start-up 

costs. The total for the year ended 31 December 2023 includes £181m of costs incurred relating to the announced intent to cease production within the Modular Homes business and 
impairment of the Group’s investment in Onto.

Investment variance includes differences between actual and long-term expected investment return on traded and real assets (including 
development assets and scale-up equity direct investments within LGC and Retail’s Insurance business), the impact of economic assumption 
changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations (e.g. credit default and inflation), the impact of any difference between the actual 
allocated asset mix and the target long-term asset mix on new pension risk transfer business, and the yield associated with assets held for future 
new pension risk transfer business. Changes in non-financial assumptions, including longevity, recalibrate the CSM at locked-in point-of-sale 
discount rates whilst the fulfilment cash flows are measured at current discount rates, thereby creating a component of investment variance 
between these different bases.

The long-term expected investment return is based on opening economic assumptions applied to the assets at the start of the reporting year. The 
assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected returns for traded equity, commercial property and residential property are based on market 
consensus forecasts and long-term historic average returns expected to apply through the cycle.

The long-term expected investment returns are:

Equities

Commercial property

Residential property

2023

7%

5%

3.5%

2022

7%

5%

3.5%

For fixed interest securities measured at FVTPL, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held 
less an adjustment for credit risk (assessed on a best estimate basis). Where securities are measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, the expected 
investment return comprises interest income on an effective interest rate basis.

For equity direct investments, the LGC alternative asset portfolio and Retail’s Insurance business comprise investments in housing, specialist 
commercial real estate, clean energy, alternative finance and fintech. Where used for the determination of adjusted operating profit, the long-term 
expected investment return is on average between 10% and 12%, in line with our stated investment objectives. Rates of return specific to each asset 
are determined at the point of underwriting and reviewed and updated annually. The expected investment return includes assumptions on 
appropriate discount rates and inflation as well as sector specific assumptions including retail and commercial property yields and power prices.

2 Adjusted operating profit information and segmental analysis continued
(vi) Segmental analysis
The Group has five reportable segments, comprising LGRI, LGC, LGIM, Insurance and Retail Retirement, as set out in Note 6. Group central expenses 
and debt costs are reported separately. Transactions between reportable segments are on normal commercial terms, and are included within the 
reported segments.

In the UK, annuity liabilities relating to LGRI and Retail Retirement are backed by a single portfolio of assets, and once a transaction has been 
completed the assets relating to any particular transaction are not tracked to the related liabilities. Investment variance is allocated to the two 
business segments based on the relative average size of the underlying insurance contract liabilities across the year.

Reporting of assets and liabilities by reportable segment has not been included, as this is not information that is provided to key decision makers on 
a regular basis. The Group’s asset and liabilities are managed on a legal entity rather than reportable segment basis, in line with regulatory requirements.

Financial information on the reportable segments is further broken down where relevant in order to better explain the drivers of the Group’s results.

6 Principal products
Product classification 
The Group’s products are classified for accounting purposes as either insurance or investment contracts. The basis of accounting for these 
products is outlined in Note 1. The following table summarises the classification of the Group’s key insurance and investment contracts as well as 
investment products for each applicable business.

A significant part of the Group’s business involves the acceptance and management of risk. 

A description of the principal products offered by the Group’s segments is outlined below. The Group seeks to manage its exposure to risk through 
controls which ensure that the residual exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board. The Group’s risk appetite framework and 
the methods used to monitor risk exposures can be found on pages 52 to 59.

Details of the risks associated with the Group’s principal products and the controls used to manage these risks can be found in Notes 7 and 15 to 17.

Legal & General Retirement Institutional (LGRI) 
Annuity contracts
Pension risk transfer (PRT) represents bulk annuities, whereby the Group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life 
fund. Annuities provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder and may include a guaranteed payment period. 
PRT business consists of both immediate and deferred annuities.

Immediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder and are in payment at the date of the transaction. 

Deferred annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder where the income stream starts at a future date after the transaction. Some 
deferred contracts accepted by the Group contain guaranteed cash options, predominantly minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity 
income into cash at the date of vesting. 

There is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK business with benefits linked to changes in the RPI or for a minority the CPI, but 
with contractual maximum or minimum increases. Impact on profit due to changes in inflation can be found within the IFRS sensitivity analysis note.

Other information

Investment contracts
The Group writes Assured Payment Policies (APP). An APP is a long-term contract under which the policyholder (a registered UK pension scheme) 
pays a day-one premium and in return receives a contractually fixed and/or inflation-linked set of payments over a fixed period of time from the insurer.

Longevity insurance contracts
The Group also provides longevity insurance products for company pension schemes, under which regular payments are made to the scheme 
reflecting their actual longevity experience, while the scheme makes an agreed set of regular payments in return. Some policies contain a 
guaranteed surrender value which is currently immaterial.

Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM)
LGIM offers both active and passive management on either a pooled or segregated basis to clients domiciled globally. Assets are managed in London 
and Chicago on behalf of pension funds, institutional clients, sovereign wealth clients, retail clients and subsidiary companies within the Group. 

The key products provided by LGIM are unit linked institutional pensions, segregated investment management mandates and collective 
investment schemes.

The core strategies applied for managing the products are set out below.

Index fund management
LGIM provides a diversified range of pooled index funds, providing a wide choice and the ability to pursue specific benchmarks efficiently. In addition, 
segregated solutions are offered to institutional clients providing large scale customisation against established market capitalisation weighted and 
alternative indices.

The LGIM Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) business provides clients access to LGIM’s index fund management capabilities via our ETF platform. ETF 
products cover a broad range of traditional and thematic asset classes.

Active strategies
LGIM offers a range of pooled and segregated active fixed income funds. The LGIM liquidity funds offer institutional investors a solution for their 
cash management requirements across a range of core currencies. The liquidity funds aim to deliver competitive returns with a high level of 
diversification, whilst focusing on capital preservation through portfolios of high quality, liquid assets.

Active strategies also includes an active equity management business comprising focused teams managing stock selection across different regions.

Solutions and Liability Driven Investment (LDI)
LGIM provides a range of pooled and bespoke solutions to help de-risk defined benefit pension schemes. These solutions will usually combine 
active or passive underlying portfolios with derivative overlays designed to meet clients’ specific requirements. An allocation strategy service is also 
offered to institutional clients, which may also allocate some of the portfolio to managers other than LGIM.

Multi-asset funds
Multi-asset funds for retail and institutional clients, built using LGIM’s expertise in asset allocation which is informed by an in-house research 
capability. The underlying asset classes may be managed on an active or passive basis within LGIM. 

Real assets 
LGIM offers a range of pooled funds, segregated accounts and joint ventures investing on behalf of UK and overseas investors across physical real 
estate, private corporate debt, infrastructure debt and real estate loans. The business has specialist teams of fund and asset managers and an 
in-house research team. 

Legal & General Capital (LGC)
Investment strategy and implementation
Legal & General Capital manages shareholder assets which are not directly required to meet contractual obligations to policyholders. LGC’s 
investments fall into two distinct categories; direct investments and traded assets. The value of, and income from, both categories is sensitive to 
conditions within investment markets and the broader economy. Potential volatility in returns is managed using a range of techniques, including 
foreign exchange and interest rate hedging, and exposure concentration limits by asset type, sector and geographic region.

Direct investments and structuring
Direct investments are an integral part of the wider Group strategy. LGC’s direct investments are typically illiquid investments entered into through 
acquisition, joint venture with strategic partners or by the creation of new companies. LGC seeks to make direct investments in sectors where there 
are structural funding shortfalls, and is organised into four sectors: specialist commercial real estate, clean energy, housing and alternative finance. 
LGC deploys capital and sector expertise to such investments to target attractive risk-adjusted returns which can deliver higher returns and/or lower 
volatility for our shareholder capital than listed equity.

6 Principal products continued
Retail 
The Retail division comprises Insurance and Retail Retirement businesses. 

UK protection business (Retail and Group)
The Group offers protection products which provide mortality or morbidity benefits. They may include health, disability, critical illness and accident 
benefits; these additional benefits are commonly provided as supplements to main life policies but can also be sold separately. The benefit amounts 
would usually be specified in the policy terms. Some sickness benefits cover the policyholder’s mortgage repayments and are linked to the prevailing 
mortgage interest rates. In addition to these benefits, some contracts may guarantee premium rates, provide guaranteed insurability benefits and 
offer policyholders conversion options. 

US protection business 
US protection represents individual term assurance, which provides death benefits over the medium to long-term. The contracts have level 
premiums for an initial period with premiums set annually thereafter. During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to 
a universal life contract. After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age-related guaranteed premium.

US universal life 
Universal life contracts written by Legal & General America (LGA) provide savings and death benefits over the medium to long-term. The savings 
element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate. LGA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough 
on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate. LGA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of 
assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value. 

Reinsurance is used within the protection businesses to manage exposure to large claims for individual term business and virtually all universal life 
business. These practices lead to the establishment of reinsurance assets on the Group’s balance sheet. Within our US business, reinsurance and 
securitisation are also used to provide regulatory solvency relief (including relief from regulation governing term insurance).

Annuities
Immediate annuities have similar characteristics as products sold by LGRI. The Group also offers products for individuals that provide a guaranteed 
level of income over a chosen fixed period of time, in exchange for an initial lump sum payment from the policyholder. The products can provide a 
fixed lump sum at maturity and/or options to surrender on non-guaranteed terms. 

Deferred annuity contracts written by LGA contain a provision that, at maturity, a policyholder may move the account value into an immediate 
annuity, at rates which are either those currently in effect, or rates guaranteed in the contract.

Lifetime care plan
The lifetime care plan provides a monthly payment to a UK registered care provider that helps meet the cost of care for the policyholder’s life. 
A policyholder can choose to receive a fixed monthly payment or opt to have escalation built in. A death benefit exists within the product so that if 
a policyholder dies within the first 6 months of the start date a percentage of the original premium less any payments already made is payable to 
the estate. 

Lifetime mortgages
Lifetime mortgages are a form of equity release mortgage that provide non-commercial borrowers with a loan secured against their main residence, 
without the need for regular repayments. They are regulated retail mortgages offered only to borrowers over the age of 55 through specialist 
intermediaries. Interest accrues over the term of the loan and is repayable at the time the principal becomes due. Loans can be advanced in a single 
lump sum amount or in several subsequent drawdowns of an agreed facility. All lifetime mortgages provide a ‘no negative equity’ guarantee, which 
means that if the loan is repaid from the sale of the property and if the net sale proceeds are lower than the balance of the loan, the Group will accept 
the net sale proceeds as full settlement. 

Retirement interest-only mortgages
A retirement interest-only (RIO) mortgage is a standard residential mortgage available for non-commercial borrowers above 55 years old. A RIO 
mortgage is very similar to a standard interest-only mortgage, with two key differences: 

• 
• 

the loan is usually only paid off on death, move into long-term care or sale of the house 
the borrowers only have to prove they can afford the monthly interest repayments and not the capital remaining at the end of the mortgage term. 

No repayment solution is required as repayment defaults to sale of property. 

Workplace savings
Workplace savings provides corporate pension scheme solutions to enable companies to meet their auto-enrolment obligations. Workplace savings 
acts as scheme operator and administrator for these products while the customers hold the individual or scheme level pension policies issued by 
Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS).

7 Asset risk
The Group is exposed to the following categories of asset risk as a consequence of offering the principal products outlined in Note 6. 

Market risk
Exposure to loss as a direct or indirect result of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets.

Credit risk
Exposure to loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the Group or suffers a rating downgrade.

Liquidity risk
The risk that the Group, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall 
due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.

The Group is also exposed to insurance risk as a consequence of offering these products – more detail on insurance risk can be found in Note 17.

The Group is not directly exposed to any market risk, credit risk or liquidity risk associated with LGIM’s businesses, and as a result, the detailed risk 
disclosures have not been presented. However, LGIM’s income is related to the value of funds under management, and so they are indirectly exposed 
to market risks that impact the value of assets underlying those funds.

The Group seeks to manage its exposures to risk through controls which ensure that the residual risk exposures are within acceptable tolerances 
agreed by the Board. A description of the risks associated with the Group’s principal products and the associated controls is detailed in the table below.

Market risk

Principal risks

Division

Controls to mitigate risks

Investment performance risk
The Group is exposed to the risk that the income from, 
and value of, assets held to back insurance liabilities and 
capital requirements do not perform in line with investment 
and product pricing assumptions leading to a potential 
financial loss.

LGC, LGRI

LGIM and Retail

LGC and LGRI

For unit linked contracts, there is a risk of volatility in asset 
management fee income due to the impact of interest rate 
and market price movements on the fair value of the assets 
held in the linked funds, on which investment management 
fees are based. There is also the risk of expense over-runs 
should the market depress the level of charges which could 
be imposed.

Property risk 
Lifetime mortgages include a no-negative equity guarantee 
which transfers a potential loss exposure to the Group as a 
result of low house price inflation, and an exposure to 
specific properties which may experience lower house 
price inflation for whatever reason.

LGC businesses build homes across the residential market, 
invest in large commercial and residential development 
projects and along with LGRI manage several developed 
real estate assets. The Group’s revenue streams are 
exposed to residential sales achieved, as well as the 
volume of transactions, both of which may be affected by 
the performance of the housing market. Revenue streams 
may also be impacted by significant increases in the cost 
of raw materials or disruption to supply chains. 
Independent valuations of real estate assets, either in 
development or developed, also depend on an assessment 
of the wider real estate market.

Models are used to assess the impact of a range of future return scenarios on 
investment values and associated liabilities in order to determine optimum 
portfolios of invested assets. For annuities, which are sensitive to interest rate 
and inflation risk, analysis of the liabilities is undertaken to create a portfolio of 
securities, the value of which changes in line with the value of liabilities when 
interest rates change.

The risk is managed through maintaining a diversified range of funds in which 
customers may invest. The performance of linked investment funds relative 
to their investment objectives is subject to regular monitoring. Periodic 
assessment is also made of the long-term profitability to the Group of these 
funds. For some contracts the Group has discretion over the level of 
management charges levied.

To mitigate the risk, maximum loan to value ratios are set for all lending with 
further underwriting criteria setting out acceptable properties for lending 
purposes. Policy terms also require properties to be fully insured and 
maintained, including the right of inspection. The diversification of lending by 
property type and geographic region seeks to control exposures to specific 
aspects in the property market.

Diversification by geographic region and property type avoids concentration 
of exposures to specific areas of the property market. Sites are developed in a 
number of phases to spread the risk to local markets over several years and 
where possible we seek to co-invest with local experts to manage assets. 
The purchasing of new land for development requires approval from LGC’s 
Investment Committee and the Group Capital Committee (the Investment 
Committee from 1 January 2024). Where appropriate, key methods are adopted 
to further manage the risk, such as fixed price construction contracts, forward 
sales and pre-letting. These businesses can also benefit from flexible funding 
arrangements available from the Group. Direct commercial property exposure 
in the LGRI annuity portfolio is relatively limited and is underpinned by 
long-term leases with highly rated counterparties.

Principal risks

Division

Controls to mitigate risks

Currency risk
To diversify credit risk within the annuities business corporate 
bond portfolio, investments are held in corporate bonds 
denominated in non-sterling currencies. LGC also invest in 
overseas assets. Fluctuations in the value of, or income from, 
these assets relative to liabilities denominated in sterling 
could result in unforeseen foreign exchange losses.

LGC, LGRI 
and Retail

To mitigate the risk of loss from currency fluctuations, currency swaps and 
forwards are used to hedge exposures to corporate bonds denominated in 
currencies other than sterling. Hedging arrangements are placed with strongly 
rated counterparties with collateral requirements being subject to regular 
review and reconciliation with the counterparties. The hedges do not eliminate 
all currency risk and the Group retains some residual risk.

Inflation risk
The consolidated international subsidiaries and financial 
instruments of subsidiaries are translated into sterling in 
the consolidated accounts. Changes in the sterling value 
can impact consolidated equity but may be mitigated by 
associated hedging transactions.

Inflation risk
Inflation risk is the potential of realising a loss because of 
relative or absolute changes in inflation rates. Annuity 
contracts may provide for future benefits to be paid taking 
account of changes in the level of inflation. Annuity 
contracts in payment may include an annual adjustment 
for movements in price indices.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is exposed to 
lower returns or loss as a direct or indirect result of 
fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific 
assets and liabilities arising from changes in underlying 
interest rates.

Credit risk

Principal risks

Bond default and rating downgrade risk
A significant portfolio of corporate bonds and 
commercial loans are held to back the liabilities arising 
from writing insurance and annuities business. Whilst 
the portfolio is diversified, the asset class is inherently 
exposed to the risk of issuer default and rating 
downgrade, with the possibility of financial loss.

Reinsurance counterparty risk
Exposure to insurance risk is mitigated by ceding part of 
the risks assumed to the reinsurance market. Default of a 
reinsurer would require the business to be re-brokered 
potentially on less advantageous terms, or for the risks to 
be borne directly resulting in possible financial loss. The 
Group is required to carry an element of associated 
credit risk capital on its balance sheet should the 
business not be re-brokered on the same terms.

Property lending counterparty risk
As part of our asset diversification strategy, we hold 
property lending and sale and leaseback investments. 
We are inherently exposed to the risk of default by a 
borrower or tenant.

Banking counterparty risk
The Group is exposed to potential financial loss should 
banks or the issuers of financial instruments default on 
their obligations to us. We are also exposed to 
counterparty risks in respect of the providers of 
settlement and custody services.

Group

LGRI

To mitigate the risk of loss from currency translation the Company continuously 
monitors its exposure and executes appropriate hedging transactions when 
necessary. Hedging arrangements are placed with strongly rated counterparties 
with collateral requirements being subject to regular review and reconciliation 
with the counterparties.

The investment strategy for the annuities business takes explicit account of 
the effect of movements in price indices on contracted liabilities. Significant 
exposures that may adversely impact profitability are hedged using inflation 
swaps. Annuity contracts also typically provide for a cap on the annual increase 
in inflation linked benefit payments. The hedges do not eliminate all inflation 
risk and the Group retains some residual risk.

Group, LGRI 
and Retail

To mitigate the risk that guarantees and commitments are not met, financial 
instruments are purchased, which broadly match the nature and terms of the 
expected policy benefits payable. The composition of the investment portfolio 
is governed by the nature of the insurance or savings liabilities, the expected 
rate of return applicable on each class of asset and the capital available to meet 
the price fluctuations of each asset class, relative to the liabilities they support.

Portfolio level and specific issuer limits are set by financial strength rating, 
sector and geographic region to limit exposure to a default event. Issuer limits 
are regularly reviewed to take account of changes in market conditions, 
sector performance and the re-assessment of financial strength by rating 
agencies and the Group’s own internal analysis. Exposures are monitored 
relative to limits. Financial instruments are also used to mitigate the impact of 
rating downgrades and defaults. If appropriate, actions are taken to trade out 
investments at risk of default.

When selecting new reinsurance partners for its protection business, the 
Group considers only companies which have a minimum credit rating 
equivalent to A- unless collateralised. For each reinsurer, exposure limits are 
determined based on credit ratings and projected exposure over the term of 
the treaty. Actual exposures are regularly monitored relative to these limits. 
Similarly, for longevity and credit risk syndication transactions, the Group 
targets the use of strongly rated counterparties and seeks to ensure that 
positions are fully collateralised. The adequacy and quality of collateral is 
subject to ongoing monitoring.

Each property lending and sale and leaseback investment transaction is 
subject to a due diligence process to assess the credit risks implicit in the 
transaction and confirm that any risk of default has been appropriately 
mitigated. We also protect our interests by taking security over the underlying 
property associated with each investment transaction.

The Group controls its exposures to banking counterparties and the issuers 
of financial instruments using a framework of counterparty limits. These 
limits take account of the relative financial strength of the counterparty as 
well as other bank counterparty exposures that the Group may have. Limits 
are subject to regular review with actual exposures monitored against limits. 
The Group has defined criteria for the selection of custody and settlement 
services. The financial strength of providers is regularly reviewed.

Controls to mitigate risks

The Group seeks to ensure that it meets its obligations as they fall due and 
avoids incurring material losses on forced asset sales in order to meet those 
obligations. A limited level of contingent liquidity risk is, however, an accepted 
element of writing insurance contracts. It is furthermore a consequence of 
the markets in which the Group operates and the execution of investment 
management strategies. However, the Group’s insurance businesses seek 
to maintain sufficient liquid assets and standby facilities to meet a prudent 
estimate of the cash outflows that may arise from contingent events. The 
level of required liquidity is identified using techniques including stress tests 
for shock events and the profile of actual liquid assets is regularly compared 
to the required liability profile. The Group’s treasury function provides formal 
facilities to other areas of the Group to cover contingent liquidity requirements 
arising from more extreme events and where investment assets may not be 
readily realisable. 

Liquidity requirements to meet potential collateral calls under stressed 
conditions are actively managed and an appropriate pool of eligible assets is 
maintained with counterparties as specified in the associated agreements. 
As at 31 December 2023, LGRI and Retail eligible collateral assets to post 
was more than five times over the actual collateral posted (using the most 
representative definition of collateral contained within the Group’s different 
collateral agreements).

Liquidity risk

Principal risks

Contingent event risk 
Events that result in liquidity risk include a pandemic 
that could lead to significantly higher levels of claims 
than would normally be expected, or extreme events 
impacting the timing of cash flows or the ability to realise 
investments at a given value within a specified 
timeframe.

Group and Retail

Collateral liquidity risk
Within the annuities business, the use of financial 
instruments to hedge default, interest rate, currency and 
inflation risks can require the posting of collateral with 
counterparties at short notice. 

LGC, LGRI and 
Retail

Investment liquidity risk 
Direct lending, sale and leaseback investments and 
lifetime mortgage business are inherently illiquid forms 
of investment, with limited secondary markets to realise 
the value of assets outside agreed redemption terms.

LGC and LGRI

Given the illiquid nature of the annuity and other liabilities the Group is able 
and willing to take advantage of the premium offered by illiquid assets. The 
Group, however, sets limits on the overall exposure to illiquid investments 
taking account of the nature and type of liabilities that the assets are held 
to meet. 

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had £4,235m (2022: £4,834m) of cash and cash equivalents in shareholder funds and a £1.5bn syndicated 
committed revolving credit facility in place, provided by a number of its key relationship banks, maturing in December 2028.

8 Balance sheet analysis
The Group has categorised its assets and liabilities in the following disclosure in accordance with the level of shareholder exposure to market and 
credit risks. Various reinsurance and hedging arrangements are in place as mechanisms to mitigate the risks.

The two categorisations presented are:

Unit linked
For unit linked contracts, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations. Unit linked business is written in both Legal and General 
Assurance Society Limited and Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) Limited. The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the 
policyholders. The Group is therefore not directly exposed to any market risk, currency risk or credit risk for these contracts. As a result, risk 
disclosures have not been presented for unit linked assets and liabilities.

The Group is permitted to sell or repledge collateral as per the International Swap Dealers Association agreements in place, including where there 
has been no default by the owner of the collateral. As at 31 December 2023, the Group had repledged cash collateral with a fair value of £647m 
(2022: £980m) in order to fulfil other collateral requirements in relation to derivatives contracts. The counterparties have an obligation to return 
the cash collateral to the Group. There are no other significant terms and conditions associated with the use of this cash collateral. 

Financial investments include £25,452m (2022: £31,533m) of assets that have been sold but not derecognised and are subject to repurchase 
agreements. Risks and rewards of these assets have been retained within the Group. The related obligation to repurchase the financial assets is 
included within Payables and other financial liabilities (Note 24). 

Financial investments have been allocated between those expected to be settled within 12 months and after 12 months in line with the expected 
settlement of the backed liabilities. Assets in excess of the insurance and investment contract liabilities have been classified as expected to be 
settled after 12 months.

1.  This table includes debt securities and loans which are held at amortised cost on the balance sheet at a total value of £8,045m (2022: £7,846m).

The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows:

Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included 
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

(ii) Fair value hierarchy continued
(a) Level 2 assets measured at fair value
All of the Group’s Level 2 assets have been valued using standard market pricing sources, such as IHS Markit, ICE and Bloomberg, or Index Providers 
such as Barclays, Merrill Lynch or JPMorgan. Each uses mathematical modelling and multiple source validation in order to determine consensus 
prices, with the exception of OTC Derivative holdings; OTCs are marked to market using an in-house system (Lombard Oberon), external vendor (IHS 
Markit), internal model or Counterparty Broker marks. In normal market conditions, we would consider these market prices to be observable market 
prices. Following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not 
from a suitably active market and have therefore classified them as Level 2.

The Group’s policy is to re-assess categorisation of financial assets at the end of each reporting period and to recognise transfers between levels at 
that point in time. At 31 December 2023 debt securities totalling net £0.7bn (2022: £6.0bn) transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

(b) Level 3 assets measured at fair value
Level 3 assets, where modelling techniques are used, comprise property, unquoted securities, untraded debt securities and securities where 
unquoted prices are provided by a single broker. Unquoted securities include suspended securities, investments in private equity and property 
vehicles. Untraded debt securities include private placements, commercial real estate loans, income strips, retirement interest only and other 
lifetime mortgages.

In many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these 
situations, the Group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the 
fair value. As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the Group has classified within 
Level 3.

The Group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available. The Group also 
determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate. As appropriate, fair values reflect 
adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the Group’s credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.

Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker. 
These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee and validated independently as appropriate.

Equity securities
Level 3 equity securities amount to £2,392m (2022: £2,307m), of which the majority is made up of holdings in investment property vehicles and 
private investment funds. They are valued at the proportion of the Group’s holding of the Net Asset Value reported by the investment vehicles. Other 
equity securities are valued by a number of third party specialists using a range of techniques which are often dependent on the maturity of the 
underlying investment but can also depend on the characteristics of individual assets. Such techniques include transaction values underpinned by 
analysis of milestone achievement and cash runway for early/start-up stage investments, discounted cash flow models for investments at the next 
stage of development and earnings multiples for more mature investments.

Other financial investments
Lifetime mortgage (LTM) loans and retirement interest only mortgages amount to £5,766m (2022: £4,844m). Lifetime mortgages are valued using a 
discounted cash flow model by projecting best-estimate net asset proceeds and discounted using rates inferred from current LTM loan pricing. The 
inferred illiquidity premiums for the majority of the portfolio range between 150 and 300bps. This ensures the value of loans at outset is consistent 
with the purchase price of the loan and achieves consistency between new and in-force loans. Lifetime mortgages include a no negative equity 
guarantee (NNEG) to borrowers. This ensures that if there is a shortfall between the sale proceeds of the property and the outstanding loan balance 
on redemption of the loan, the value of the loan will be reduced by this amount. The NNEG on loan redemption is valued as a series of put options, 
which we calculate using a variant of the Black-Scholes formula. Key assumptions in the valuation of lifetime mortgages include short-term and 
long-term property growth rates, property index volatility, voluntary early repayments and longevity assumptions. The valuation as at 31 December 
2023 reflects a combination of short-term and long-term property growth rate assumptions equivalent to a flat rate of 2.8% annually, after allowing 
for the effects of dilapidation. The values of the properties collateralising the LTM loans are updated from the date of the last property valuation to 
the valuation date by indexing using UK regional house price indices.

Private credit loans (including commercial real estate loans) amount to £10,574m (2022: £7,858m). Their valuation is determined by discounted 
future cash flows which are based on the yield curve of the LGIM approved comparable bonds and the initial spread, both of which are agreed by IHS 
Markit who also provide an independent valuation of comparable bonds. Unobservable inputs that go into the determination of comparators include 
rating, sector, sub-sector, performance dynamics, financing structure and duration of investment. Existing private credit investments, which were 
executed as far back as 2011, are subject to a range of interest rate formats, although the majority are fixed rate. The weighted average duration of 
the portfolio is 7.8 years, with a weighted average life of 11.1 years. Maturities in the portfolio currently extend out to 2063. The private credit portfolio 
of assets has internal ratings assigned by an independent credit team in line with internally developed methodologies. These credit ratings range 
from AAA to BB-.

Private placements held by the US business amount to £1,684m (2022: £1,320m). They are valued using a pricing matrix comprised of a public 
spread matrix, internal ratings assigned to each holding, average life of each holding, and a premium spread matrix. These are added to the risk-free 
rate to calculate the discounted cash flows and establish a market value for each investment grade private placement. The valuation as at 
31 December 2023 reflects illiquidity premiums between 20 and 70bps.

Income strip assets amount to £1,306m (2022: £1,414m). Their valuation is outsourced to Knight Frank and CBRE who apply a yield to maturity to 
discounted future cash flows to derive valuations. The overall valuation takes into account the property location, tenant details, tenure, rent, rental 
break terms, lease expiries and underlying residual value of the property. The valuation as at 31 December 2023 reflects equivalent yield ranges 
between 4% and 7% and estimated rental values (ERV) between £18 and £310 per sq.ft.

Commercial mortgage loans amount to £784m (2022: £768m) and are determined by incorporating credit risk for performing loans at the portfolio 
level and adjusted for loans identified to be distressed at the loan level. The projected cash flows of each loan are discounted along stochastic 
risk-free rate paths and are inclusive of an Option Adjusted Spread (OAS), derived from current internal pricing on new loans, along with the best 
observable inputs. The valuation as at 31 December 2023 reflects illiquidity premiums between 20 and 30bps.

Other debt securities which are not traded in an active market amount to £349m (2022: £217m). They have been valued using third party or 
counterparty valuations, and these prices are considered to be unobservable due to infrequent market transactions. 

Investment property 
Level 3 investment property amounting to £8,893m (2022: £9,372m) is valued with the involvement of external valuers. All property valuations in the 
UK are carried out in accordance with the latest edition of the Valuation Standards published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, and are 
undertaken by appropriately qualified valuers as defined therein. Outside the UK, valuations are produced in conjunction with external qualified 
professional valuers in the countries concerned. Whilst transaction evidence underpins the valuation process, the definition of market value, 
including the commentary, in practice requires the valuer to reflect the realities of the current market. In this context valuers must use their market 
knowledge and professional judgement and not rely only upon market sentiment based on historic transactional comparables.

The valuation of investment properties also includes an income approach that is based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts, where the 
uplift and discount rates are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions. These inputs are deemed unobservable. The valuation as at 
31 December 2023 reflects equivalent yield ranges between 3% and 13% and ERV between £5 and £310 per sq.ft.

(ii) Fair value hierarchy continued
(c) Effect of changes in assumptions on Level 3 assets
Fair values of financial instruments are, in certain circumstances, measured using valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not 
evidenced by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument and are not based on observable market data. 

Where material, the Group assesses the sensitivity of fair values of Level 3 investments to changes in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternative 
assumptions. The table below shows the impact of applying these sensitivities to the fair value of Level 3 assets as at 31 December 2023. Further 
disclosure on how these sensitivities have been applied can be found in the descriptions following the table.

1.  Other investments include Level 3 equity securities, income strip assets and other traded debt securities which are Level 3.

The sensitivities are not a function of sensitising a single variable relating to the valuation of the asset, but rather a function of flexing multiple 
factors often at individual asset level. The following sets out a number of key factors by asset type, and how they have been flexed to derive 
reasonable alternative valuations.

Lifetime mortgages
Key assumptions used in the valuation of lifetime mortgage assets are listed in Note 11(ii)(b) and sensitivities are applied to derive the values in the 
above table. The most significant sensitivity by value is -20bps of market spread and overvaluation of property valuations by 10% across the portfolio 
which, applied in isolation produces sensitised values of £152m and £(191)m.

Private credit portfolios
The sensitivity in the private credit portfolio has been determined through a method which estimates investment spread value premium differences 
as compared to the institutional investment market. Individual investment characteristics of each holding, such as credit rating and duration are 
used to determine spread differentials for the purposes of determining alternate values. Spread differentials are determined to be lower for highly 
rated and/or shorter duration assets as compared to lower rated and/or longer duration assets. A significant component of the spread differential 
is in relation to the selection of comparator bonds, which is the potential difference in spread of the basket of relevant comparators determined by 
respective investors. If we were to take an AA rated asset it may attract a spread differential of 20bps on the selection of comparator bonds as 
opposed to 40bps for a similar duration BBB rated asset. Applied in isolation the sensitivity used to reflect the spread in comparator bond selection 
results in sensitised values of £220m and £(220)m.

Investment property
Investment property holdings are valued by independent valuers on the basis of open market value as defined in the appraisal and valuation manual 
of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. As such, sensitivities are calculated through a mixture of asset level and portfolio level methodologies 
which make reference to individual investment characteristics of the holding but do not flex individual assumptions used by the independent expert 
in valuing the holdings. Each method is applied individually and aggregated with equal weighting to determine the overall sensitivity determined for 
the portfolio. One method is similar to that used in the private credit portfolio as it determines the impact of an alternate property yield determined in 
reference to credit ratings, remaining term and other characteristics of each holding. In this methodology we would apply a lower yield sensitivity to a 
highly rated and/or shorter remaining term asset compared with a lower rated and/or longer remaining term asset. If we were to take an AA rated 
asset with remaining term of 25 years in normal market conditions this would lead to a 15bps yield flex (as opposed to a 35bps yield flex for a BBB 
rated asset with 30 year remaining term). The methodology which leads to the most significant sensitivity at the balance sheet date is related to an 
example in case law where it was found that an acceptable margin of error in a valuation dispute is 10% either way, subject to the valuation being 
undertaken with due care. If this sensitivity were to be taken without a weighting it would produce sensitised values of £594m and £(594)m. 

It should be noted that some sensitivities described above are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated 
from these results.

(iii) Interest rate benchmark reform 
GBP LIBOR was replaced by SONIA from the end of 2021, and USD LIBOR was replaced by SOFR at the end of June 2023. Euribor will remain but will 
be administered by the Euro Money Markets Institute (EMMI). 

The Group transitioned away from GBP LIBOR by 31 December 2021, with only a few remaining cross currency positions which matured and rolled 
off in March 2022. As at 31 December 2023, a residual amount of fixed to floating-rate notes remain. The issuers are either planning to call these 
before they convert to floating or the floating rate will be amended via the consent solicitation process. The transition away from USD LIBOR 
completed ahead of June 2023.

12 Derivative assets and liabilities
The Group uses derivatives as a component of efficient portfolio management. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging economic exposure to 
foreign currencies, interest rates, inflation and credit risks. The Group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria in IFRS 9, ‘Financial 
Instruments’ are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash flow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. 

Cross currency swap contracts – cash flow hedges
The Group has entered into fixed rate borrowings denominated in USD and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. In order 
to hedge these risks the Group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps, enabling the exposure to be swapped into a fixed rate in its 
functional currency. These had a net asset fair value totalling £21m (2022: £115m) and a notional amount of £1,099m at 31 December 2023 
(2022: £1,099m). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement in respect of these hedges during 2023.

Other derivative contracts – held for trading
The Group uses certain derivative contracts which are effective hedges of economic exposures in accordance with the Group’s risk management 
policy, but for various reasons are not designated within a formal hedge accounting relationship. Therefore, these contracts must be designated as 
held for trading, and gains and losses on these contracts are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.

15 Market risk continued
(ii) Currency risk
The Group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional 
currencies, nearly all such holdings are either backing insurance contracts in the same currency or are hedged back to GBP. 

The Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various 
currencies. The largest United States dollar currency exposures relate to the Group’s US business, Legal & General America. The majority of currency 
exposures relating to euros are held by Legal & General Investment Management (Europe) Limited, a subsidiary of Legal & General Investment 
Management (Holdings) Limited. The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the 
growth of the Group’s business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.

Businesses aim to maintain sufficient assets in local currency to meet local currency liabilities, however movements may impact the value of the 
Group’s consolidated shareholders’ equity which is expressed in sterling. This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, 
against pre-determined limits. These exposures are managed by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the Group’s 
regulatory capital requirements by currency. Currency borrowings and derivatives may be used to manage exposures within the limits that have been 
set. 

As at 31 December 2023, the Group held net liabilities of £0.5bn (2022: net liabilities of £4.4bn) of its total equity attributable to shareholders in 
currencies, mainly United States dollar and euro, other than the functional currency of the relevant business unit. The exchange risks inherent in 
these exposures may be mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts.

Consistent with the Group’s accounting policies, the profits of overseas business units (reported as functional currencies) are translated at average 
exchange rates and the net assets (reported as functional currencies) at the closing rate for the reporting period. A 10% increase (weakening of 
foreign currencies) or decrease (strengthening of foreign currencies) in these rates would increase or reduce the profit for the year and net assets 
as follows:

16 Credit risk 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from its offering of insurance and investment products. The investments of shareholders’, policyholders’ 
and segregated clients’ monies require credit risks to be taken, as well as the hedging of insurance (including reinsurance) and other financial risks.

Oversight of credit risk management has been delegated by the Board to the Group Risk Financial Risk Committee (GRFRC), the remit of which 
includes proposing the Group’s appetite for credit risk in aggregate, and by issuers, sectors, and geography, and monitoring actual exposures relative 
to appetite. The GRFRC also considers credit risk implicit in new asset classes and corporate transactions, and advises on appropriate counterparty 
risk tolerances. The Group controls its exposure to counterparty credit risk through defining the minimum financial strength of the counterparties 
with which it will deal and setting exposure tolerances for these counterparties, which are monitored and reviewed by operational management on 
a counterparty-by-counterparty basis.

The credit profile of the Group’s assets exposed to credit risk is shown below. This includes both externally and internally rated positions. Unit linked 
assets have not been included as shareholders are not directly exposed to the associated credit risk. Additionally, assets such as equity securities, 
deferred acquisition costs and tax have no exposure to the associated credit risk and therefore have also been excluded.

For externally rated assets, the credit rating bands are provided by independent rating agencies. Unrated traded instruments are assigned a rating 
through a portfolio review process or through a committee, depending on complexity. Certain assets require an internal rating even when an external 
rating is already available, if these constitute material traded exposures or are complex securitisations or direct investments. In these cases, internal 
ratings are assigned by either the LGIM Direct Investment rating team or the asset management firm that originated the transaction. 

The carrying amount of the financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the maximum exposure to credit risk before taking 
account of collateral held. Collateral is held to mitigate credit risk exposures, by virtue of transactions in long-dated derivatives and stock lending 
activities.

Offsetting 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and has the 
intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis, or to realise the asset and liability simultaneously.

The Group has not entered into any financial transactions resulting in financial assets and liabilities being offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The table below shows the financial assets and liabilities that are subject to master netting agreements in shareholder assets and liabilities. Unit 
linked assets and liabilities have not been included as shareholders are not exposed to the risks on these policies.

1.  Related financial instruments represents outstanding amounts with the same counterparty which, under agreements such as the ISDA Master Agreement, could be offset and settled 

net following certain predetermined events.

2.  Cash and securities held may exceed target levels due to the complexities of operational collateral management, timing and agreements in place with individual counterparties.

In the tables above, the amounts of assets or liabilities presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are offset first by financial instruments that 
have the right of offset under master netting or similar arrangements with any remaining amount reduced by cash and securities collateral.

17 Insurance risk
The Group is exposed to insurance risk as a consequence of offering the principal products outlined in Note 6. Insurance risk is the exposure to loss 
arising from insurance risk experience being different to that anticipated. Detailed below are the insurance risks associated with each of the Group’s 
segments along with the mitigating controls operated. They are applicable to all stated products across the Group.

Principal risks

Division

Controls to mitigate risks

Longevity, mortality & morbidity risks 
For contracts providing death benefits, higher 
mortality rates would lead to an increase in 
claims costs. The cost of health related claims 
depends on both the incidence of policyholders 
becoming ill and the duration over which they 
remain ill. Higher than expected incidence or 
duration would increase costs over the level 
currently assumed in the calculation of liabilities.

For annuity contracts, the Group is exposed to 
the risk that mortality experience is lower than 
assumed. Lower than expected mortality would 
require payments to be made for longer and 
increase the cost of benefits provided. Lifetime 
mortgage business also explicitly has some 
exposure to the life expectancy of borrowers.

Persistency risk
In the early years of a policy, lapses may result 
in a loss to the Group, as the acquisition costs 
associated with the contract would not have 
been recovered from product margins.

Expense risk
In pricing long-term insurance business, 
assumptions are made as to the future cost 
of product servicing. A significant adverse 
divergence in actual expenses experience 
could reduce product profitability.

Retail

LGRI and Retail

The pricing of protection business is based on assumptions as to future trends in mortality 
and morbidity having regard to past experience. Underwriting criteria are defined setting 
out the risks that are unacceptable and the terms for non-standard risks presented by the 
lives to be insured. Extensive use of reinsurance is made within the UK retail protection 
business, placing a proportion of all risks meeting prescribed criteria. Mortality and 
morbidity experience is compared to that assumed within the pricing basis with variances 
subject to actuarial investigation. 

Annuity business is priced having regard to trends in improvements in future mortality. 
Enhanced annuities, which are priced taking account of impairments to life expectancy, 
are subject to specific underwriting criteria. Certain annuitant mortality risks, including 
enhanced annuities, are placed with reinsurers. The Group regularly reviews its mortality 
experience and industry projections of longevity and adjusts the pricing and valuation 
assumptions accordingly. In pricing lifetime mortgage business, account is taken of trends 
in mortality rates in setting the amounts that are advanced to borrowers relative to the 
value of the property on which the loan is secured.

Retail

The pricing and valuation assumptions for protection business include provision for policy 
lapses. Actual trends in policy lapse rates are monitored against these assumptions with 
variances being subject to actuarial investigation.

LGRI and Retail

In determining pricing assumptions, account is taken of expected price and wage inflation, 
with stress testing used to evaluate the effect of significant deviations. Actual product 
servicing costs are monitored relative to the costs assumed with the product pricing basis, 
with variances investigated. 

Concentration (catastrophe) risk
Insurance risk may be concentrated in geographic 
regions, altering the risk profile of the Group. The 
most significant exposure of this type arises for 
group protection business, where a single event 
could result in a large number of related claims.

Epidemic (catastrophe) risk
The spread of an epidemic could cause large 
aggregate claims across the Group’s portfolio 
of protection businesses. 

Retail

Retail

Group protection business contracts include an ‘event limit’ capping the total liability under 
the policy from a single event. Excess of loss reinsurance further mitigates loss from the 
exposure. Additionally, exposure by location is monitored to ensure there is a geographic 
spread of risk. Catastrophe reinsurance cover also mitigates loss from concentrations 
of risk.

The pricing basis for protection business includes an assessment of potential claims as a 
result of epidemic risks. Quota share and excess of loss reinsurance contracts are used by 
individual and group protection, respectively, to further mitigate the risk. Depending on the 
nature of an epidemic, mortality experience may lead to a reduction in the cost of claims 
for annuity business. Pricing for new business can also be updated to reflect the change in 
expected claims. 

Accumulation of risks
There is limited potential for single incidents to give rise to a large number of claims across the different contract types written by the Group. 
However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure. The Group’s capital model seeks to measure 
risk correlations particularly those that would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios become more extreme. An example of the 
accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk with mortality and morbidity exposures.

Operational risk
Operational risk is defined as loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events. Potential for exposure 
to such risk extends to all of the Group’s businesses. The Group has constructed a framework of internal controls to minimise material loss from 
operational risk events recognising that no system of internal control can completely eliminate the risk of error, financial loss, fraudulent action or 
reputational damage.

18 Long-term insurance valuation assumptions
The Group’s insurance assumptions, described below, relate to the UK insurance (both annuities and protection) business and material lines of the 
US insurance (both annuities and protection) business. Other non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the Group’s operations 
and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.

For the purpose of producing IFRS 17 best estimate liabilities, the Group seeks to make best estimate assumptions about future experience based 
on current market conditions and recent experience.

31 December 2022 assumptions have been rebased to those used for the preparation of IFRS 17 comparatives and hence differ from the IFRS 4 
assumptions published in the 2022 Annual report and accounts.

(i) Mortality and morbidity
Mortality and morbidity assumptions for the UK business are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality 
Investigation Bureau (CMI), a subsidiary of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and/or UK death registrations. US assumptions are set with 
reference to standard tables drawn up by the American Academy of Actuaries. Tables are based on industry-wide mortality and morbidity 
experience for insured lives.

The Group conducts statistical investigations of its mortality and morbidity experience, the majority of which are carried out at least annually. 
Investigations determine the extent to which the Group’s experience differs from that underpinning the standard tables, and suggest appropriate 
adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions. In particular, the recent mortality experience observed as a result of Covid-19 
and industry studies on its potential endemic effects have been used to derive appropriate adjustments to the assumptions. 

In most cases, mortality rates are set separately for gender and smoker status, and the percentage of mortality table will vary for the first 2 – 5 years 
of the policy’s duration to allow for underwriting selection.

2.  Morbidity rates are assumed to deteriorate at a rate of 0.50% p.a. for males and 0.75% p.a. for females (2022: 0.50% p.a. for males and 0.75% p.a. for females).
3.  Adjustments are made for gender, select period, smoker status, policy size, policy duration and year, issue year, age, and calendar year.
4.  Mortality rates are assumed to reduce based on CMI 2021 model with a long-term annual improvement rate of 1.75% for males and 1.25% for females (2022: Mortality rates are 

assumed to reduce based on CMI 2020 model with a long-term annual improvement rate of 1.5% for males and 1.0% for females). 

5.  Table for male is created by using PMA16_PBO and for female it is PFA16_PBO (2022: PCXA00 and PNXA00). These tables are used for both immediate and deferred annuities. 
6.  Mortality rates are assumed to reduce according to an adjusted version of the mortality improvement model CMI 2021 (2022: CMI 2020) with the following parameters: 

Males: Long-term Rate of 1.75% p.a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 110 (2022: Long-term Rate of 1.50% p.a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 110). 
Females: Long-term Rate of 1.25% p.a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 110 (2022: Long-term Rate of 1.00% p.a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 110). 
Smoothing is applied to derive initial rates using a smoothing parameter (Sk) value of 7.5 applied to Legal & General bespoke population data to 2021. The resulting initial rates are then 
adjusted to reflect socioeconomic class (2022: smoothing parameter (Sk) value of 7.5 applied to Legal & General bespoke population data to 2020). 
For individual annuities distributed through retail channels, a further allowance is made for the effect of initial selection. 
For the finalised improvements, an overlay is applied to the CMI 2021 output by zeroising improvers for 2020, 2021 and 2022 for male and female (2022: no zeroisation). 
The basis above is applicable up to age 90. After age 90 the basis is blended towards a bespoke table from age 105 onwards.

7.  Mortality rates are assumed to reduce according to an adjusted version of the mortality improvement model CMI 2021 (2022: MP2018 for females and MP2019 for males).

18 Long-term insurance valuation assumptions continued
(ii) Valuation rates of interest and discount rates
The interest rates used to discount the cash flows for the purpose of valuing insurance contract liabilities should reflect the timing and liquidity 
characteristics of the insurance liability cash flows and current market conditions. The valuation interest rate assumptions are derived as interest 
rate curves with full term structure.

In deriving the liquidity premium assumptions for annuity business, an explicit allowance for risk is deducted from the yield on the assets backing 
annuity liabilities. The allowance for risk comprises long-term assumptions about defaults and the market risk premiums for taking credit risk. 
In the case of lifetime mortgage assets a best estimate expectation of losses arising from the No Negative Equity Guarantee, and the market risk 
premiums for this risk are deducted from the yield. For the UK annuity business, the deduction for risk of default for corporate bonds and direct 
investments equated to 40bps (2022: 42bps). For lifetime mortgages the deductions equated to £0.4bn (2022: £0.3bn).

For US and UK protection business, the yield is calculated based on notional asset portfolios of AA rated corporate bonds and cash, which reflect 
the characteristics of the liability cash flows. An explicit allowance is deducted from the yield to reflect the default risk associated with the notional 
portfolio assets. 

The discount rate curves used for material product lines are shown below. The discount rate curves are used to discount the cash flows on the 
underlying contracts and any associated reinsurance cash flows. The graph displays the underlying spot rates:

(iii) Persistency
The Group monitors its persistency experience and carries out detailed investigations annually. Persistency experience can be volatile and past 
experience may not be an appropriate future indicator. The Group tries to balance past experience and potential future conditions in setting 
assumptions about expected long-term average persistency levels.

(iv) Expenses
The Group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and 
administering the different products and classes of business. Adjustments may be made for known future changes in the administration processes, 
in line with the Group’s business plan, as well as for changes in allocations. An allowance for expense inflation in the future is also made in line with 
RPI, taking account of both salary and price information.

(v) Risk Adjustment
The risk adjustment is the compensation that the Group requires for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that 
arises from non-financial risk. For the majority of risks, the Group’s view on the compensation required for non-financial risks is determined with 
reference to an 85th percentile confidence level (2022: 85th percentile), calculated using a one-year Value-at-Risk (VaR) measure. This VaR measure 
reflects the Group’s view on how non-financial risks behave (risk distributions), diversification of risks across the Group (risk correlations), and the 
costs and benefits from reinsurance in place (risk mitigation). This is consistent with how risks are priced for and managed across the Group. Where 
the Group has less appetite for a risk (and requires proportionally higher compensation) a higher confidence level is used. The calculation uses a 
capital basis appropriate for the territory, the type of business, and how it is priced. A one percentile increase in the one-year confidence level would 
increase the compensation targeted by c£50m.

We have estimated the equivalent confidence level for the entire Group on a multi-year basis, using a weighted average of the key risks. Overall the 
Group risk adjustment as at 31 December 2023 is aligned to a c.75th percentile multi-year confidence level (2022: 75th percentile) over the full runoff 
of the portfolio.

The Group calculates its Risk Adjustment at contract level using a Provision for Adverse Deviations (PADs) approach, where adjustments are applied 
to best estimate non-financial risk assumptions to calculate the risk adjustment required over and above the best estimate liability for each contract. 
These adjustments (that vary by risk) are calibrated such that the total Group Risk Adjustment calculated aligns to the Group’s view of compensation 
for non-financial risks determined with reference to the 85th percentile (as described above) and the Risk Adjustment at contract level is 
representative of the compensation required by the Group for that contract.

The economic sensitivity tables above show the impacts on Group post tax profit and equity, net of reinsurance, under each sensitivity scenario. 
The impacts on Group post tax profit and equity arising from financial assets and insurance contracts are also shown separately in the tables. 
The economic sensitivity impacts cover long-term insurance business and other Group assets and obligations.

The non-economic sensitivity tables above show the impacts on CSM, Group post tax profit and equity, gross and net of reinsurance, under each 
sensitivity scenario. The non-economic sensitivity impacts cover long-term insurance business only.

The Group impacts may arise from asset and/or liability movements under the sensitivities. The current disclosure reflects management’s view of 
key risks in current economic conditions.

The stresses are assumed to occur on the balance sheet date. Both CSM and current year CSM release into profit are assumed to be affected when 
non-financial assumptions are stressed.

In calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged. In practice, impacts of the Group’s experience may be correlated.

The sensitivity analyses do not take into account management actions that could be taken to reduce the impacts. The Group seeks to actively 
manage its asset and liability position. A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may 
have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities. The analysis also ignores any second order effects of the assumption change, 
including the potential impact on the Group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.

The sensitivity of profit and equity to changes in assumptions may not be linear. They should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order.

The change in interest rate stresses assume a 100 basis point increase/decrease in the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities together 
with the same change in the real yields on variable securities. Interest rates used to discount liabilities are assumed to move in line with market 
yields, adjusted to remove risks in the asset reference portfolios that are not present in the liabilities calculated in a manner consistent with the 
base results.

The inflation stresses adopted are a 0.5% per annum (p.a.) increase/decrease in inflation, resulting in a 0.5% p.a. reduction/rise in real yield and no 
change to the nominal yield. In addition, the expense inflation rate is increased/decreased by 0.5% p.a. The expense inflation assumptions are 
non-financial and therefore recalibrate the CSM under the stresses. These recalibrations are reflected in the impacts shown.

In the sensitivity for credit spreads, corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, government bond yields are unchanged, and there has been 
no adjustment to the default assumptions. All lifetime mortgages are excluded, as their primary exposure is to property risk, and therefore captured 
under the property stress.

The equity stresses are a 25% rise and 25% fall in listed equity market values.

The property stresses adopted are a 15% rise and 15% fall in property market values including lifetime mortgages. Where property is being used 
to back liabilities, interest rates used to discount liabilities move with property yields, and so the value of the liabilities will also move.

The credit default assumption is set based on the credit rating of individual bonds and Moody’s historical transition matrices. The credit default 
stress assumes a +/-10bps stress to the current credit default assumptions, which will have an impact on the interest rates used to discount 
liabilities. Default allowances for assets deemed credit risk free are unchanged. All lifetime mortgages are excluded, as their primary exposure is 
to property risk, and therefore captured under the property stress.

The annuitant mortality stresses are a 1% increase and 1% decrease in the mortality rates for immediate and deferred annuitants with no change 
to the mortality improvement rates.

The assurance mortality stress is a 5% increase in the mortality and morbidity rates with no change to the mortality and morbidity improvement rates.

The maintenance expense stress is a 10% increase in all types of maintenance expenses in future years.

The undiscounted cash flows are calculated in line with the methodology and assumptions used to the determine the best estimate liabilities. 
Where portfolios contain amounts which would be payable on demand the cashflows are determined in line with the best estimates of policyholder 
behaviour. Products which have amounts considered payable on demand are deferred annuities in the UK and universal life in the US.

During the deferral period a policyholder often has the ability to elect to surrender the policy or retire early, at which time the deferred annuity policy 
terminates. The cash value of the surrender is calculated in line with the terms of the agreement and in reference to the duration of deferral. The total 
value considered payable on demand as at 31 December 2023 is £10,210m (2022: £5,921m).

Universal life contracts written in the US provide savings and death benefits over the medium to long-term. The savings element is considered to be 
payable on demand by the policyholder. The total value considered payable on demand as at 31 December 2023 is £436m (2022: £481m).

Amounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the Group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within 
the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due. However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid 
assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predefined periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to 
meet the level of requested redemptions.

Investment contract liabilities include £87m (2022: £901m) of Assured Payment Policies (APP) products, which are classified as Level 2 in the fair 
value hierarchy. The valuation of APP products is determined through a discounted cash flows model, where the discount rate is derived from a 
risk-free rate, a credit benchmark spread and a zero-volatility spread (Z-spread). The credit benchmark rate used is the A-rated credit spread curve 
which reflects the strategic portfolio mix. The Z-spread ensures that the fair value at inception is equal to the transaction price, therefore it is based 
on the premium on origination and remains constant over the life of the policy.

The presented fair values of the remaining investment contract liabilities reflect quoted prices in active markets and they have been classified as 
Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

During the year there have been no transfers of investment contract liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy (2022: no significant transfers 
between levels of the fair value hierarchy).

1.  Unit linked borrowings are excluded from the analysis above as the risk is retained by policyholders.

The maturity profile above is calculated on the basis that a facility to refinance a maturing loan is not recognised unless the facility and loan are 
related. If refinancing under the Group’s credit facilities was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassified 
as repayable between one and five years.

Undiscounted interest payments are estimated based on the year end applicable interest rate and spot exchange rates.

Syndicated credit facility
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had in place a £1.5bn syndicated committed revolving credit facility provided by a number of its key relationship 
banks, maturing in August 2028. No amounts were outstanding at 31 December 2023.

(ii) Other provisions 
Other provisions include costs that Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) is committed to incur on the extension of its existing 
partnership with State Street announced in 2021, to increase the use of Charles River technology across the front office and to deliver middle office 
services going forward. Costs include the transfer of data and operations to State Street, as well as the implementation of the new operating model. 
The amounts included in the provision have been determined on a best estimate basis by reference to a range of plausible scenarios, taking into 
account the multi-year implementation period for the project. As at 31 December 2023, the outstanding provision was £108m (31 December 2022: 
£111m).

(iii) Retirement benefit obligations
Defined contribution schemes 
The Group operates the following principal defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas:

•  Legal & General Group Personal Pension Plan (UK);
•  Legal & General Staff Stakeholder Pension Scheme (UK);
•  Legal & General America Inc. Savings Plan (US); and
•  CALA defined contribution pension scheme.

Contributions of £102m (2022: £93m) were made during the year in respect of defined contribution schemes.

Defined benefit schemes 
The Group operates the following defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas:

•  Legal & General America Inc. Cash Balance Plan (US). The last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2023; and
•  CALA Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme (UK). This scheme closed to new members from 31 December 2007 and closed to future accrual 

on 31 December 2018; the last triennial actuarial valuation was as at 6 April 2021. 

The Group also previously operated the following defined benefit pension schemes in the UK:

•  Legal & General Group UK Pension and Assurance Fund (the Fund). The Fund was closed to new members from January 1995; and
•  Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme (the Scheme). The Scheme was, with a few exceptions (principally transfers from the Fund), 

closed to new members from August 2000 and finally closed to new members from April 2007.

Balance sheet management

23 Provisions continued
(iii) Retirement benefit obligations continued
Certain parts of the liabilities of the Fund and Scheme had previously been secured by way of annuities purchased from the Group, which were 
not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes. In April 2023, Assured Payment Policies (APPs), previously transacted between the Group’s UK 
defined benefit pension schemes and Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS), were surrendered at their carrying value of £839m 
(31 December 2022: £718m) and converted into annuity contracts. An additional top-up consideration of £183m, priced on an arm’s length basis, 
was paid to LGAS by the defined benefit pension schemes as part of the transaction, making a total contribution for new annuities of £1,022m 
(31 December 2022: £61m). This resulted in both pension schemes being fully covered by annuity contracts.

The Trustees completed a buy-out of the Fund and the Scheme in November 2023, and the existing annuity policies were exchanged for individual 
policies between LGAS and members. As a result, all the Group’s obligations under the pension schemes have now been fully extinguished, and the 
defined benefit obligation as at the settlement date of £1,470m was therefore derecognised. On the same date, the Group recognised the direct 
liability to the pensioners within insurance contract liabilities. The difference between the defined benefit obligation at this date and the fair value of 
the insurance contract liabilities recognised under IFRS 17 resulted in £167m being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as settlement 
costs. This reflects measurement differences between IFRS 17 and IAS 19, principally comprising of the associated CSM and risk adjustment. 

The Fund and the Scheme still hold minimal residual assets which are expected to meet the cost of wind-up expenses. Both the Fund and the 
Scheme expect to complete their wind-up in 2024.

1.  The carrying value of payables and other financial liabilities at amortised cost approximates its fair value.
2.  Other financial liabilities have been restated for 31 December 2022.

Derivative liabilities and repurchase agreements are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. 

The fair value of derivative liabilities is derived using broker quotes or models such as option pricing models, simulation models or a combination of 
models. The inputs for these models include a range of factors which are deemed to be observable, including current market and contractual prices 
for underlying instruments, period to maturity, correlations, yield curves and volatility of the underlying instruments.

Repurchase agreements are valued based on the discounted cash flows expected to be paid, using an observable market interest rate, in line with 
the value of the underlying security.

Within other financial liabilities, trail commission is measured at fair value through profit or loss. The balance represents a liability for the present 
value of future commission costs on distribution agreements with intermediaries, recognised in the balance sheet on inception of the contract and 
remeasured at subsequent reporting dates. 

Collateral repayable on short position reverse repurchase agreements and other financial liabilities balances, including FX spots, broker and other 
payables, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying value of these liabilities approximates their fair value. 

Significant transfers between levels
There have been no significant transfers of liabilities between Levels 1, 2 and 3 for the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: no significant transfers).

Other information

Interest expense of £7m (2022: £8m) on lease liabilities is included in finance costs. 

The remaining terms on the Group’s leases range from 1 to 234 years (2022: 1 to 235 years), with approximately 24% of the leases (2022: 30%) 
having extension options and 69% of these leases (2022: 60%) having termination options. Extension and termination options are included in various 
leases across the Group and are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. The 
majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.

At 31 December 2023 the Group had committed to no additional leases which had not yet commenced (2022: committed to no additional leases).

Income from sub-leasing right-of-use assets is reflected in Rental income within Investment return (see Note 27).

Where the Group is a lessor, the future undiscounted minimum lease receivables under operating lease arrangements are disclosed in Note 38(ii). 
The future minimum lease payments under finance lease arrangement, together with the present value, are disclosed in Note 13(i).

26 Management of capital resources
Solvency II
The Solvency II financial information in this note is estimated and unaudited.

The Group calculates its Solvency II capital requirements using a Partial Internal Model. The majority of the risk to which the Group is exposed is 
assessed on the Partial Internal Model basis approved by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Capital requirements for a few smaller entities 
are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds. The Group’s US insurance businesses and Legal & General Reinsurance 
Company No. 2 are valued on a local statutory basis, following the PRA’s approval to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these 
businesses in the Group solvency calculation.

The table below shows the Group Own Funds, Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and Surplus Own Funds, based on the Partial Internal Model, 
Matching Adjustment and Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions (TMTP) as at 31 December 2023.

The Group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a regulatory basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements 
of regulators in each territory in which it operates. The Group complies with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, 
as adopted by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the UK and measures and monitors its capital resources on this basis. The Solvency II 
regulations were amended in the UK in December 2023 to introduce a change to the calculation of Risk Margin. All other Solvency II regulations 
remain unchanged.

As at 31 December 2023, and on the above basis, the Group had a surplus of £9,167m (31 December 2022: £9,915m) over its Solvency Capital 
Requirement, corresponding to a Solvency II Capital Coverage Ratio of 224% (31 December 2022: 236%). The Solvency II capital position is as 
follows:

2.  Solvency II Own Funds do not include an accrual for the final dividend of £871m (31 December 2022: £829m) declared after the balance sheet date.
3.  Solvency II Own Funds allow for a Risk Margin of £1,191m (31 December 2022: £2,753m) and TMTP of £970m (31 December 2022: £2,136m).

Sensitivity analysis
The following sensitivities are provided to give an indication of how the Group’s Solvency II surplus as at 31 December 2023 would have changed in a 
variety of adverse events. These are all independent stresses to a single risk. In practice, the balance sheet is impacted by combinations of stresses 
and the combined impact can be larger than adding together the impacts of the same stresses in isolation. It is expected that, particularly for market 
risks, adverse stresses will happen together.

1.  Assuming a recalculation of the Transitional Measure on Technical Provisions that partially offsets the impact on Risk Margin.
2. 
3.  The spread sensitivity applies to the Group’s corporate bond (and similar) holdings, with no change in long-term default expectations. Restructured lifetime mortgages are excluded 

In the interest rate down stress negative rates are allowed, i.e. there is no floor at zero rates.

as the underlying exposure is mostly to property.

4.  The stress for AA bonds is twice that for AAA bonds, for A bonds it is three times, for BBB four times and so on, such that the weighted average spread stress for the portfolio is 

100 basis points. To give a 100bps increase on the total portfolio, the spread stress increases in steps of 32bps, i.e. 32bps for AAA, 64bps for AA etc.

5.  No stress for bonds rated BBB and above. For bonds rated BB and below the stress is 100bps. The spread widening on the total portfolio is smaller than 1bps as the Group holds less 
than 1% in bonds rated BB and below. The impact is primarily an increase in SCR arising from the modelled cost of trading downgraded bonds back to a higher rating in the stress 
scenarios in the SCR calculation.

6.  Credit migration stress covers the cost of an immediate big letter downgrade on 20% of all assets where the capital treatment depends on a credit rating (including corporate bonds, 

and sale and leaseback rental strips; lifetime mortgage senior notes are excluded). Downgraded assets in our annuities portfolio are assumed to be traded to their original credit rating, 
so the impact is primarily a reduction in Own Funds from the loss of value on downgrade. The impact of the sensitivity will depend upon the market levels of spreads at the balance 
sheet date.

7.  This relates primarily to equity exposure in LGC but will also include equity-based mutual funds and other investments that receive an equity stress (for example, certain investments 

in subsidiaries). Some assets have factors that increase or decrease the stress relative to general equity levels via a beta factor.

8.  Assets stressed include residual values from sale and leaseback, the full amount of lifetime mortgages and direct investments treated as property.
9.  A 10% increase in the assumed unit costs and future costs of investment management across all long-term insurance business lines.

The above sensitivity analysis does not reflect all management actions which could be taken to reduce the impacts. In practice, the Group actively 
manages its asset and liability positions to respond to market movements. Other than in the interest rate and inflation stresses, we have not allowed 
for the recalculation of TMTP.

Other information

The impacts of these stresses are not linear therefore these results should not be used to interpolate or extrapolate the impact of a smaller or larger 
stress. The results of these tests are indicative of the market conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date. The results would be different if 
performed at an alternative reporting date.

Capital management policies and objectives
The Group aims to manage its capital resources to maintain financial strength, policyholder security and relative external ratings advantage. The 
Group also seeks to maximise its financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including 
equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.

Capital measures
The Group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the Group 
operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business. The measures used by the Group include:

Accounting and Economic bases
Management use financial information prepared on both an IFRS and risk-based capital basis to manage capital and cash flow usage and to 
determine dividend paying capacity. 

The Group maintains a risk-based capital model that is used to support the management of risk within the Group. This modelling framework, suitably 
adjusted for regulatory constraints, also meets the needs of the Solvency II regime. 

Regulatory bases
The financial strength of the Group’s insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements (see below).

Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements
In each country in which the Group operates, the local insurance regulator specifies rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital 
which must be held by insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities. The minimum capital requirements have been maintained at all 
times throughout the year. This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due. 

The required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance company’s liabilities in 
specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying fixed percentages to the insurance company’s liabilities and risk exposures. The requirements 
in the different jurisdictions in which the Group operates are detailed below:

Group regulatory basis
The Group is required to comply with the Solvency II capital requirements calculated using the Group’s Partial Internal Model. The vast majority of 
the risk to which the Group is exposed is assessed on the Internal Model basis approved by the PRA. The Group capital requirements for a handful 
of smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds. The Group’s capital requirements in respect of its US 
insurance businesses and Legal & General Reinsurance Company No. 2 (L&G Re 2) are valued on a local statutory basis, following PRA approval of 
the Group’s application to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these businesses in the Group solvency calculation. 

UK regulatory basis
At the balance sheet date, required capital for the life business was based on the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the PRA. All 
material EEA insurance firms, including Legal and General Assurance Society Limited and Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) 
Limited (LGIM’s insurance subsidiary) are required to hold Eligible Own Funds in excess of their Solvency Capital Requirement, calculated on a Partial 
Internal Model basis. These firms, as well as the non-EEA insurance firm (Legal & General Reinsurance Company Limited based in Bermuda) 
contribute over 90% of the Group’s SCR.

US regulatory basis
Required capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital (RBC) based on the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners RBC model. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its 
overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk profile. The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, 
claims, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.

Bermudan regulatory basis
Bermudan regulated insurers are required to hold sufficient capital to meet the Bermudan Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR). The BSCR model 
follows a standard formula framework, capital attributed to each risk is calculated by applying specified stresses to the assets and liabilities.

The individual risk elements (excluding operational risk) are combined using a covariance matrix and then added to an operational risk charge.

3.  The analysis of investment return and finance income/expense has been split between insurance contract portfolios. For annuity insurance liabilities, changes in the discount rate are 
reflected in profit or loss. The backing portfolio of assets is selected to match the liabilities and is predominantly accounted for as FVTPL. A sub-portfolio of assets backing annuity 
liabilities are accounted for at amortised cost as they are in surplus to the IFRS 17 best estimate liability and risk adjustment. Protection insurance liabilities have applied the IFRS 17 
OCI option. Changes in discount rate are therefore reported in OCI, whilst backing assets are classified as either FVOCI or amortised cost.

OCI option. Changes in discount rate are therefore reported in OCI, whilst backing assets are classified as either FVOCI or amortised cost.

The tax shown in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income comprises current and deferred tax.

(i) Implementation of the global minimum tax regime
During the year the UK Government enacted legislation to apply a global minimum tax rate of 15% to multinational businesses headquartered in the 
UK, as well as a new domestic UK minimum tax rate of 15%, in line with the Model Rules agreed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD). These rules apply from 1 January 2024, and will apply to all of the Group’s businesses globally.

The Group has applied the temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the UK top-up tax and will account for it 
as a current tax when it is incurred.

The Group is expected to be liable to UK top-up tax in 2024 in respect of profits arising in our global reinsurance hub in Bermuda. Our Bermudan 
businesses act as an internal hub for the Group and also support the growth of our international pension risk transfer business.

28 Tax continued
(i) Implementation of the global minimum tax regime continued
If the global minimum tax rules had applied in 2023, then additional tax of 15% would apply to profits arising in territories at lower tax rates. The 
reconciliation of the tax expense attributable to equity holders in Note 28 (iii) discloses the impact of overseas profits which are subject to a lower 
or higher rate of tax than the standard UK rate in 2023, which primarily relates to the Group’s Bermudan businesses. 

From 2025, we anticipate that the Group will be liable for local Bermudan corporate income tax at 15%, instead of top-up tax under the global 
minimum tax rules, on Bermudan profits. 

We do not anticipate any other significant liabilities under the global minimum tax rules based on the Group’s current profile. Further guidance on 
the implementation of these new rules is expected in due course and will be kept under review. 

(ii) Implementation of the Bermuda corporate income tax regime
During 2023 the Bermudan Government consulted on introducing a local corporate income tax with effect from 1 January 2025, which would apply 
to our Bermudan reinsurance businesses. This has been substantively enacted as at 31 December 2023 and deferred tax on temporary differences 
and unused tax losses relating to our Bermudan businesses have been re-valued from 0% to 15%. 

This has resulted in a deferred tax asset of £340m as at 31 December 2023. The deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of tax reliefs permitted 
under the Bermuda corporate income tax regime which give rise to deductible temporary differences. The majority of these reliefs are expected to 
unwind from 2025 over 10 years on a straight line basis. The Group expects to have sufficient future taxable profits to offset the unwind of these 
deductible temporary differences. 

The deferred tax asset of £340m is included within the deferred tax disclosure in Note 28 (iv) and is within the line item for the difference between 
tax and accounting value of insurance contracts.

Further guidance on the implementation of these new rules is expected in due course. This and the interaction with the UK rules will be kept under 
review as guidance emerges for any impact.

1.  The Finance Act 2021 increased the rate of corporation tax from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023. The prevailing rate of UK corporation tax for the year has increased to 23.5% (2022: 

19.0%). The enacted tax rate of 25% has been used in the calculation of UK deferred tax assets and liabilities, as the rate of corporation tax that is expected to apply when the majority 
of those deferred tax balances reverse.

2.  The lower rate of tax on overseas profits and losses is principally driven by the 0% rate of taxation arising in our Bermudan reinsurance company, which provides the Group with 

regulatory capital flexibility for both our PRT business and our US term insurance business. This also includes the impact of our US operations which are taxed at 21%.

3.  Double tax relief represents a UK tax credit available for overseas withholding tax suffered on dividend income.
4.  Adjustments in respect of prior years relate to revisions of prior estimates.
5.  The tax credit relates to the introduction of a new corporate income tax regime in Bermuda, which was enacted in December 2023.
6.  The tax credit for the year includes a material one-off tax credit arising from the recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to the introduction of a new Bermuda corporate income tax 
regime. The net tax credit for the year excluding this one-off credit is £27m and reflects the varying rates of tax that we pay on our businesses in different territories and the mixture of 
profits and losses across those territories.

7.  The equity holders’ effective tax rate excluding the impact of expenses arising from rate differences on longevity assumption changes, the one-off settlement cost associated with the 

buy-out of the Group’s UK defined benefit pension schemes and the one-off Bermuda tax credit is 11.9%.

(iv) Deferred tax – Consolidated Balance Sheet
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognised/(provided) for temporary differences and unused tax losses. The recognition of deferred tax 
assets in respect of temporary differences and tax losses is supported by management’s best estimate of future taxable profits to absorb the losses 
in future years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet have been offset to the extent it is permissible under 
the relevant accounting standards. The net movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year is as follows:

1.  Deferred tax assets arising on deferred acquisition expenses relate solely to US balances.
2.  The UK deferred tax asset reflects the impact of transition to IFRS 17 (see Note 1 for further details).
3.  The Bermuda deferred tax asset relates to the introduction of a new corporate income tax regime in Bermuda, which was enacted in December 2023 (see Note 28 (ii)).
4.  This deferred tax asset relates to US operating losses. The losses are not time restricted, and we expect to recover them over a period of 15 to 20 years, commensurate with the 
lifecycle of the underlying insurance contracts. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered past results, the different basis under which US companies are taxed, temporary 
differences that are expected to generate future profits against which the deferred tax can be offset, management actions, and future profit forecasts. The recoverability of deferred 
tax assets is routinely reviewed by management.

5.  The deferred tax liability is comprised of balances of £107m relating to the US (2022: £206m) that are not capable of being offset against other deferred tax assets.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets
The Group has the following unrelieved tax losses and deductible temporary differences carried forward as at 31 December 2023. No deferred tax 
asset has been recognised in respect of these as at 31 December 2023 (or 31 December 2022), as it is not probable that there will be suitable taxable 
profits emerging in future periods against which to relieve them. These tax assets will only be recognised if it becomes probable that suitable taxable 
profits will arise in future periods.

31 Share-based payments
(i) Description of plans
The Group provides a number of equity settled share-based long-term incentive plans for directors and eligible employees.

The Savings Related Share Option Plan (ShareSave) allows employees to enter into a regular savings contract over three and/or five years, coupled 
with a corresponding option over shares of the Group. The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the Group shares on the invitation 
date. 

Nil-cost options can be granted to senior managers under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), based upon individual and Company performance. 
Performance conditions attached to awards before 2018 result in the number of options that vest being equally dependent on the Group’s relative 
total shareholder return (TSR) and Earnings per Share (EPS)/Dividend per Share (DPS) growth. In addition, the awards vest after the end of the three 
year performance period and become exercisable in thirds over three, four and five years. Starting from awards granted in 2018, the number of 
options that vest is equally dependent on the Group’s relative TSR and EPS growth (subject to Solvency II objectives). The majority of awards vest 
after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds in year three, four and five. Awards granted to Executive 
Directors and Persons Delivering Managerial Responsibilities vest after three years but any options that vest will not become exercisable until year 
five.

The Share Bonus Plan (SBP) awards conditional shares, restricted shares, combined awards of CSOP options and restricted shares and combined 
awards of CSOP options and nil-cost options. Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends. Fair value is calculated 
as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reflect the eligibility for dividend payments. Conditional Share awards, which include awards to 
Executive Directors, do not have voting or dividend rights.

Under the HMRC tax-advantaged Employee share plan (ESP), UK employees may elect to purchase Group shares from the market at the prevailing 
market price on a monthly basis. The Group supplements the number of shares purchased by giving employees one free matching share for every 
one share purchased up to the first £20 of the employees’ contributions and one free matching share for every two shares purchased with 
contributions between £20 and £125. There is currently no match on contributions between £125 and £150. From time to time, the Group may make 
an award of free shares. Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years. The fair value of awarded shares is equal to the 
market value on award date.

The weighted average fair value of ShareSave options calculated by using the Black-Scholes model were 44.9p and PSP awards estimated by using 
Monte Carlo simulations were 162.8p.

The fair values of the share awards made during the year have been calculated using the following assumptions:

There is one class of ordinary shares of 2.5p each. All shares issued carry equal voting rights.

The holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to one vote per share at shareholder 
meetings of the Company. 

(ii) Employee share plans
The Group uses the Employees’ Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) and the Legal & General Group Employee Share Plan (ESP) to purchase and hold 
shares of the Group for delivery to employees under various employee share plans. Shares owned by these vehicles are included at cost in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet and are shown as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. They are disclosed as employee plan shares until they vest 
to employees. Share-based liabilities to employees may also be settled via purchases directly from the market or by the issue of new shares.

The ESOT has waived its voting rights and its rights to some of the dividends payable on the shares it holds. Employees are entitled to dividends 
on the shares held on their behalf within the ESP.

33 Restricted Tier 1 convertible notes
On 24 June 2020, Legal & General Group Plc issued £500m of 5.625% perpetual restricted Tier 1 contingent convertible notes. The notes are callable 
at par between 24 March 2031 and 24 September 2031 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and every 5 years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the 
coupon from 24 September 2031 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 5.378%. 

The notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the issuer and mandatory cancellation is 
upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Tier 1 notes are therefore treated as equity and coupon payments are recognised directly in equity 
when paid. During the year coupon payments of £28m were made (2022: £28m). The notes rank junior to all other liabilities and senior to equity 
attributable to owners of the parent. On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the 
issuer at the prevailing conversion price.

The notes are treated as restricted Tier 1 own funds for Solvency II purposes.

34 Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests represent third party interests in direct equity investments, including private equity, which are consolidated in the Group’s results.

As at 31 December 2023, non-controlling interests primarily represent third party ownership in Thorpe Park Holdings, a mixed residential/
commercial retail space in which the Group holds 50%.

37 Contingent liabilities, guarantees and indemnities
Provision for the liabilities arising under contracts with policyholders is based on certain assumptions. The variance between actual experience 
from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them. Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating 
to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them. The extent of these liabilities is 
influenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the PRA, FCA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes 
and court judgments. 

Various Group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time. The relevant 
members of the Group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each 
has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities. The provisions made are regularly reviewed. It is not possible to 
predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigation or issues.

Group companies have given warranties, indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to 
capital market transactions or corporate disposals. Legal & General Group Plc has provided indemnities and guarantees in respect of the liabilities 
of Group companies in support of their business activities. Legal and General Assurance Society Limited has provided indemnities, a liquidity and 
expense risk agreement, a deed of support and a cash and securities liquidity facility in respect of the liabilities of Group companies to facilitate the 
Group’s matching adjustment reorganisation pursuant to Solvency II.

Other information

During the year, the total value of Investment in associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method on the Group’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet increased to £616m (2022: £554m), reflecting a number of additions and disposals, as well as the Group’s share of the profits and 
losses of the respective associates and joint ventures.

40 Related undertakings
The Companies Act 2006 requires disclosure of information about the Group’s subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and other significant holdings. 
Significant holdings are entities in which the Group either has a shareholding greater than or equal to 20% of the nominal value of any share class, or 
a book value greater than 20% of the Group’s assets. 

(i) Subsidiaries
The particulars of the Company’s subsidiaries, mutual funds and partnerships that have been consolidated as at 31 December 2023 are listed below. 
The main territory of operation of subsidiaries incorporated in England and Wales is the UK. For overseas subsidiaries the principal country of 
operation is the same as the country of incorporation. All subsidiaries have a 31 December year end reporting date and are 100% owned, unless 
stated otherwise. The registered office of all subsidiaries in England and Wales is One Coleman Street, London EC2R 5AA, United Kingdom, and in 
Ireland is Dillon Eustace, 33 Sir John Rogerson’s Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, unless otherwise noted. All subsidiaries are held through intermediate 
holding companies unless noted that they are held direct by the Company. Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the Group owns less than 50% 
of the ordinary share capital, are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from special rights attaching to the class of share 
owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature of its relevant activities, voting rights (including 
potential voting rights) and substantive and protective rights. 

The Group reassesses the appropriateness of the consolidation of an investee whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there has been a 
change in the relationship between the Group and the investee which affects control.

41 Interests in structured entities
A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominating factor in deciding who controls the 
entity, such as when voting rights might relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual 
arrangement. The Group has interests in investment vehicles which, depending upon their status, are classified as either consolidated or 
unconsolidated structured entities as described below:

•  Debt securities, consisting of traditional asset backed securities, together with securitisation and debentures and Collateralised Debt Obligations 

(CDOs); 
Investment funds, largely being unit trusts; and 

• 
•  Specialised investment vehicles, analysed between Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles (ICAVs), Open Ended Investment Companies 

(OEICs), Sociétés d’Investissement à Capital Variables (SICAVs), Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs), Authorised Contractual Schemes (ACSs), 
Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund (QIAIF), Liquidity funds, Common Contractual Fund (CCF) and Property unit trusts.

All of the Group’s holdings in the above vehicles are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective investment vehicle’s offering 
documentation and are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of those investment vehicles. The investment 
manager makes investment decisions after extensive due diligence of the underlying investment vehicle, including consideration of its strategy and 
the overall quality of the underlying investment vehicle’s manager.

All of the investment vehicles in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the respective investment 
vehicles for their services. Such compensation generally consists of an asset-based fee and a performance related incentive fee, and is reflected in 
the valuation of the investment vehicles.

(a) Interests in consolidated structured entities
The Group has determined that where it has control over an investment vehicle, that investment is a consolidated structured entity. The Group has 
not provided, and has no intention to provide, financial or other support to any other structured entities which it does not consolidate. 

(b) Interests in unconsolidated structured entities
As part of its investment activities, the Group also invests in unconsolidated structured entities. As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s interest in 
such entities reflected on the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and classified as financial investments held at fair value through profit or loss 
was £23,454m (2022: £19,867m). A summary of the Group’s interests in unconsolidated structured entities is provided below:

Management fees received for investments that the Group manages also represent interests in unconsolidated structured entities, and the Group 
always maintains an interest in those funds which it manages. Where the Group does not manage the investments, its maximum exposure to loss 
is the carrying amount in the Group Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where the Group does manage these investments, the maximum exposure is the 
underlying balance sheet value, together with future management fees.

Company financial statements

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using Financial Reporting 
Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as 
modified by the revaluation of investment property, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and certain assets and 
financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.

There were no material critical accounting estimates used or judgements made by management in the preparation of these financial statements.

The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with 
FRS 101:

•  Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment’ (details of the number and weighted-average exercise price of share options, 

and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined);

•  The requirement of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’, where equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated 

financial statements of the Group;

•  The following paragraphs of IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’:

 – 10(d), (statement of cash flows);
 – 10 (f) and 40A (presentation of a 3rd balance sheet);
 – 16 (a statement of compliance with all IFRS);
 – 38 in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) (outstanding shares comparative);
 – 38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements);
 – 38B-D (additional comparative information);
 – 111 (cash flow statement information); and
 – 134-136 (capital management disclosures).

IAS 7, ‘Statement of cash flows’;
IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instrument Disclosures’;

• 
• 
•  Paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8, ‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’ (requirement for the disclosure of information 

when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective); and

•  The requirements in IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a 

Group and key management compensation.

The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 394 and 396 of the Companies Act 2006 adopting the 
exemption of omitting the income statement conferred by Section 408 of that Act. 

The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. See Note 1 of the Group consolidated financial statements for 
further information on the Directors’ assessment of the going concern basis.

Financial assets
On initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value. Subsequently, they can be measured at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification depends on two criteria: 

(i)  the business model within which financial assets are managed; and 
(ii)  their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI)).

A debt instrument is measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, if it meets the following conditions:

it is held within a business model that has an objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

(i) 
(ii)  the contractual terms of the financial asset result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 

outstanding (SPPI).

A debt security is measured at FVOCI if it meets the following conditions:

it is held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets; and

(i) 
(ii)  the asset’s cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.

Interest income on these debt securities is calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are 
recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses 
accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.

All other assets, including derivative assets which are held for trading are measured at FVTPL. Net gains and losses, including any interest or 
dividend income and foreign exchange gains and losses, are recognised in profit or loss, unless they arise from derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in cash flow hedges.

Strategic report

Governance

Financial statements

Other information

The Company has no equity instruments other than investments in subsidiaries.

Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently accounted for at amortised cost.

Impairment of financial assets
For financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI the Company reviews the carrying value of its assets at each balance sheet date. For such 
assets, the Company determines forward looking expected credit losses (ECL), based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in 
accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to 
the asset’s original effective interest rate.

The Company measures loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk 
at the reporting date and other debt securities for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. In these cases, ECLs are 
based on the 12-month ECL, which is the ECL that results from a possible default up to 12 months after the reporting date. The Company uses relevant 
quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on historical experience, and informed credit assessment including forward-looking 
information in order to evaluate the credit-worthiness of each security at each reporting date, to determine whether a significant increase in credit 
risk since origination occurred. Should this be the case, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL. 

ECLs are calculated by considering the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). The PD is 
determined by reference to third party information on available companies, or using qualitative information available to the Company, and depends 
on whether a financial asset requires determination of a 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL. The LGD is determined with reference to any exposure 
reducing instruments such as collateral or liquid assets that the counterparty may have. The EAD is determined as the amount of the loan balance 
outstanding at the reporting date. The Company has adopted a simplified approach for receivables, which allows measurement of lifetime ECLs only, 
thereby removing the need to identify significant increase in credit risk (SICR). For these balances, the Company makes use of provision matrices in 
order to calculate such lifetime ECLs.

Investment income
Investment income includes unrealised fair value gains and losses on financial investments at fair value through profit or loss, realised gains and 
losses, dividends, rent and interest. Dividends are accrued on an ex-dividend basis. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account 
the effective yield on the investment. Interest income for financial assets which are not classified as FVTPL is recognised using the effective interest 
method.

Distributions
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are authorised and are no longer 
at the discretion of the Company. 

Interest expense
Interest expense reflects the underlying cost of borrowing, based on the effective interest method and includes payments and receipts made under 
derivative instruments which are amortised over the interest period to which they relate. 

Investment in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Where the carrying amount of an investment in subsidiary is 
greater than recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss.

Derivatives and hedge accounting
The Company’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivatives such 
as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures. 

Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, other than those designated as hedging instruments in cash flow or net investment hedges, are 
recognised immediately in the income statement. Currently, the Company hedges foreign exchange translation and interest rate risks on its fixed 
rate USD denominated borrowings (the hedged items), using cross currency interest rate swaps (the hedging items). It recognises the effective 
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging items in a separate reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.

Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs. Borrowings classified as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost. The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the 
effective interest method.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.

A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded 
as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future 
reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.

continued

1 Accounting policies continued
Deferred tax continued
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on an 
undiscounted basis. 

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends 
have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary. 

Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Non-monetary items are maintained at historic rates. Exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.

Pension costs
The Company contributes to defined contribution schemes. The Company charges the costs of its pension schemes against profit as incurred. 
Any difference between the cumulative amounts charged against profits and contribution amounts paid is included as a provision or prepayment 
in the balance sheet.

The assets of the defined contribution schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds, which have been subject to regular valuation every 
three years and updated by formal reviews at reporting dates by qualified actuaries.

Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of share-based payment plans on behalf of its subsidiaries. Full disclosure of these plans is given in Note 31 of the 
Group consolidated financial statements. The costs associated with these plans are borne by all the participating Group businesses where they 
relate to their employees and, where relevant, the Company bears an appropriate charge. As the majority of the charge to the Company relates to 
awards and options issued to the directors, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors’ report on remuneration, no further disclosure is 
provided here.

A summary of the Company’s ordinary share capital, share premium and options over the Company’s ordinary share capital are disclosed in Note 32 
of the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

13 Restricted Tier 1 convertible notes
On 24 June 2020, Legal & General Group Plc issued £500m of 5.625% perpetual restricted Tier 1 contingent convertible notes. The notes are callable 
at par between 24 March 2031 and 24 September 2031 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and every 5 years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the 
coupon from 24 September 2031 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 5.378%. 

The notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the issuer and mandatory cancellation is 
upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Tier 1 notes are therefore treated as equity and coupon payments are recognised directly in equity 
when paid. During the year coupon payments of £28m were made (2022: £28m). The notes rank junior to all other liabilities and senior to equity 
attributable to owners of the parent. On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the 
issuer at the prevailing conversion price.

The Company intends to hold this year’s AGM on Thursday, 23 May 2024

Square, Bloomsbury, London, WC1H 9JZ with facilities to join virtually. 
Full details of the business to be considered at the meeting will be

Board and directors
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended 
by a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. 
The Company’s Articles of Association were last amended 
at its Annual General Meeting held on 20 May 2021.

Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Board has adopted 
a policy and procedure for the disclosure and authorisation (if appropriate) 
of conflicts of interest, and these have been followed during 2023. The 
Board confirms that it has reviewed the schedule of directors’ conflicts 
of interest during the year and that the procedures in place operated 
effectively in 2023. None of the directors had an interest in any contract 
of significance with the Company or any of its subsidiaries during 2023.

Powers of directors
The directors (as detailed on pages 64 to 65) may exercise all powers of 
the Company subject to applicable legislation and regulation and the 
Company’s Articles of Association.

Appointment and removal of directors
With regards to the appointment and removal of directors, the Company 
is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 and 
related legislation. Directors may be appointed by an ordinary resolution 
of the Company or by the Board, in each case subject to the provisions 
of the Company’s Articles of Association. The Company may, by way 
of special resolution, remove any director before the expiration of that 
director’s period of office and may by ordinary resolution, appoint 
another director to act as a replacement. The Company’s Articles 
of Association (in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code) require 
all the directors to retire from office at each Annual General Meeting 
of the Company.

Directors’ interests
The Directors’ report on remuneration on pages 94 to 119 provides

Indemnities
The Company has agreed to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, 
each of the directors against any liability incurred by a director in respect 
of acts or omissions arising in the course of their office. Qualifying 
pension scheme indemnities (as defined in section 235 of the Companies 
Act 2006) apply, to the extent permitted by law, to certain directors of the 
Company’s pension schemes. The indemnities were in force throughout 
2023 and remain so. Copies of the deeds containing the relevant 
indemnity are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office 
and will also be available at the AGM.

Insurance
The Company has arranged appropriate directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance for directors. This is reviewed annually.

Change of control
There are no agreements between the Company and its directors or 
employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
(whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) in the 
event of a takeover bid, except for those relating to normal notice periods. 
The rules of the Company’s share plans contain provisions under which 
options and awards to participants, including executive directors, may 
vest on a takeover or change of control of the Company or transfer 
of undertaking. The Company has a committed £1.5 billion bank 
syndicated credit facility which is terminable if revised terms cannot be 
agreed with the syndicate of banks in a 30-day period following a change 
of control. As at 4 March 2024, the Company has no borrowings under 
this facility. There is no change of control conditions in the terms of any 
of the Company’s outstanding debt securities. The terms of the 
Company’s agreements with its banking counterparties, under which 
derivative transactions are undertaken, include in some instances the 
provision for termination of transactions upon takeover/ merger 
depending on the rating of the merged entity. The Company does not 
have any other committed banking arrangements, either drawn or 
undrawn, which incorporate any unilateral change of control conditions.

Related party transactions
Details of related party transactions are set out in Note 36 to the Group 
consolidated financial statements.

Shares and dividend information 
Share capital
As at 31 December 2023, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 
5,979,578,280 ordinary shares each with a nominal value of 2.5 pence. 
Details of the ordinary share capital can be found in Note 32 to the Group 
consolidated financial statements.

At the 2023 AGM, the Company was granted authority by shareholders 
to purchase up to 597,331,539 ordinary shares, being 10% of the issued 
share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2023. In the year 
to 31 December 2023, no shares were purchased by the Company. 
This authority will expire at the 2024 AGM. As such, a resolution 
is proposed in the Notice of AGM seeking shareholder approval to renew 
this authority.

At the 2023 AGM, the directors were given the power to allot shares 
up to an amount of £49,777,628, being 33% of the issued share capital 
of the Company as at 31 March 2023. This authority will also expire 
at the 2024 AGM. As such, a resolution is proposed in the Notice of AGM 
seeking shareholder approval to renew this authority.

Further resolutions are proposed, as set out in the Notice of AGM, that 
will, if approved by shareholders, authorise the directors to issue shares 
up to the equivalent of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital as 
at 25 March 2024 for cash without offering the shares first to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their holdings. Detailed explanatory notes 
to these resolutions are set out in the Notice of AGM.

the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR 5) of the UK 
Listing Authority is published via a Regulatory Information Service and

 Using the voting rights figure as at 29 December 2023, as announced to the London 
Stock Exchange on 2 January 2024, of 5,979,578,280.

No material changes to the interests have been disclosed between 
31 December 2023 and 4 March 2024.

Dividend
The Company may, by ordinary resolution in a general meeting, declare 
dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members, but 
no dividend can exceed the amount recommended by the Board. The 
directors propose a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2023 
of 14.63 pence per ordinary share which, together with the interim 
dividend of 5.71 pence per ordinary share paid to shareholders on 26 
September 2023, will make a total dividend for the year of 20.34 pence 
(2022: 19.37 pence). Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM, the 
final dividend will be paid on 6 June 2024 to shareholders on the share 
register on 26 April 2024 provided that the Board may cancel payment of 
the dividend at any time prior to payment in accordance with the Articles 
of Association, if it considers it necessary to do so for regulatory capital 
purposes. Our dividend policy is set out on page 4.

Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights and obligations relating to the Company’s ordinary shares 
are set out in the Articles of Association. A copy of the Articles 
of Association can be requested from the Company Secretary at the 
Company’s registered office. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled 
to attend, speak and vote at general meetings. In a vote on a show 
of hands, every member present in person or every proxy present, who 
has been duly appointed by a member, will have one vote and on a poll 
every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every 
ordinary share held. These rights are subject to any special terms as 
to voting upon which any shares may be issued or may at the relevant 
time be held and to any other provisions of the Company’s Articles 
of Association. Under the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of 
Association, directors have the power to suspend voting rights and, 
in certain circumstances, the right to receive dividends in respect of 
shares where the holder of those shares fails to comply with a notice 
issued under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006.

The Board can decline to register a transfer of any share which is not 
a fully paid share. In addition, registration of a transfer of an uncertificated 
share may be refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated 
securities rules and where the number of joint holders exceeds four. 
The Board may also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated 
share unless:

• 

• 
• 

the instrument of transfer is duly stamped and is left at the 
Company’s registered office or such other place as the Board may 
from time to time determine, accompanied by the certificate for 
the share to which it relates and such evidence as the Board may 
reasonably require to show the right of the transfer or to make 
the transfer
the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share
the number of joint holders does not exceed four.

Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, all or any of the 
rights attaching to an existing class of shares may be varied from time 
to time, either with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than 
three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class 
(excluding any treasury shares) or with the sanction of a special 
resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders 
of those shares.

Shares acquired through the employee share plans rank equally with all 
other ordinary shares in issue. Zedra Trust Company (Guernsey) Limited, 
as trustee of the Legal & General Employees’ Share Ownership Trust, 
held 1% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 4 March 2024 
in trust for the benefit of the executive directors, senior executives and 
employees of the Group. The trustee of Legal & General Employees’ 
Share Ownership Trust has waived the right of that trust to receive 
dividends on unallocated shares it holds. The voting rights in relation 
to these shares are exercised by the trustee. The trustee may vote or 
abstain from voting, or accept or reject any offer relating to shares, in any 
way it sees fit, without incurring any liability and without being required 
to give reasons for its decision. Under the rules of the Legal & General 
Group Employee Share Plan (the ‘Plan’), eligible employees are entitled 
to acquire shares in the Company. Plan shares are held in trust for 
participants by Link Market Services Trustees Limited, which held 0.32% 
of the issued share capital of the Company as at 4 March 2024. Voting 
rights are exercised by the trustees on receipt of the participants’ 
instructions. If a participant does not submit an instruction to the 
trustees, no vote is registered. In addition, the trustees do not vote 
on any unallocated shares held in the trust.

The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders 
which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/ or 
voting rights.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and 
accounts (group and parent company), including the Directors’ report 
on remuneration and the financial statements, in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance 
with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law 
and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable law, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 

Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group and the Company for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors are required to:

•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently 
•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable 

and prudent 

•  for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international 
accounting standards

•  for the parent company financial statements, state whether 

applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company financial statements

•  assess the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern
•  use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend 
to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.

Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible 
for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ report, Directors’ report 
on remuneration and Corporate governance statement that complies 
with that law and those regulations. The directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Fair, balanced and understandable
In accordance with the principles of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance 
Code, we have processes and procedures in place to ensure that the

On the advice of the Audit Committee, the Board considers that 
the Annual report and accounts, as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position, performance, business 
model and strategy.

Critical accounting estimates, key judgements 
and significant accounting policies
Our critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant 
accounting policies conform with UK-adopted international accounting 
standards and are set out on pages 151 to 152 of the consolidated 
financial statements. The directors have reviewed these policies and 
applicable estimation techniques and have confirmed them to be 
appropriate for the preparation of the 2023 consolidated financial 
statements.

Disclosure of information to auditors
As far as each of the directors in office at the date of this Directors’ 
report is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by 
section 418 (3) of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware, and each such director has taken all the steps 
that they ought to have taken as a director to make themself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

Going concern
The Strategic report on pages 2 to 59 of this report includes information 
on the Group structure and business principles, the performance of the 
business areas, the impact of regulation and principal risks and 
uncertainties.

The Group performance detailed on pages 22 to 25 includes information 
on the Group financial results, financial outlook, cash flow and balance 
sheet position. The consolidated financial statements include 
information on the Group financial investments and investment property 
(Note 11), derivatives (Note 12), cash and cash equivalents (Note 14),

In line with IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’, and revised FRC 
guidance on ‘risk management, internal control and related financial and 
business reporting’, and as set out in the Basis of preparation (Note 1), 
management has taken into account all available information about the 
future for a period of at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date 
of approval of the financial statements when assessing the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.

Details of the main risks affecting the Group and how we manage and 
mitigate them are set out in ‘Managing risks’ on pages 52 to 54. Having 
assessed the main risks and other matters discussed in connection with

Share fraud warning
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors 
into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless 
or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an 
upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell 
shares in this way you will probably lose your money.

How to avoid share fraud
Have you been:

Contacted out of the blue; or
Promised tempting returns and told the investment is safe.

Called repeatedly
Told the offer is only available for a limited time? If so, you might have 
been contacted by fraudsters.

Reject cold calls
If you’ve been cold called with an offer to buy or sell shares, chances 
are it’s a high risk investment or a scam. You should treat the call with 
extreme caution. The safest thing to do is to hang up.

Check the firm on the FS register at fca.org.uk/register
The Financial Services Register is a public record of all the firms 
and individuals in the financial services industry that are regulated 
by the FCA.

Get impartial advice
Think about getting impartial financial advice before you hand over 
any money. Seek advice from someone unconnected to the firm that 
has approached you.

If you suspect that you have been approached by fraudsters, please 
tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at 
fca.org.uk/scamsmart where you can find out more about investment 
scams. You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 
6768. Alternatively, you can inform Computershare Investor Services, 
on 0370 707 1399 (Computershare are not able to investigate such 
incidents themselves, but they will record the details, pass them 
on to us, and liaise with the FCA).

If you have lost money to investment fraud, you should report it to 
Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online at actionfraud.police.uk. 

If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive 
payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

Alternative Performance  
Measures

An alternative performance measure (APM) is a financial measure of 
historic or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, 
other than a financial measure defined under IFRS or the regulations of 
Solvency II. APMs offer investors and stakeholders additional information 
on the Company’s performance and the financial effect of ‘one-off’ events, 
and the Group uses a range of these metrics to enhance understanding 
of the Group’s performance. However, APMs should be viewed as 
complementary to, rather than as a substitute for, the figures determined 
according to other regulations. The APMs used by the Group are listed in 
this Note, along with their definition/explanation, their closest IFRS or 
Solvency II measure and, where relevant, the reference to the 
reconciliations to those measures.

For the Group’s long-term insurance businesses, reinsurance 
mismatches are also excluded from adjusted operating profit. 
Reinsurance mismatches arise where the reinsurance offset rules in 
IFRS 17 do not reflect management’s view of the net of reinsurance 
transaction. In particular, during a period of reinsurance renegotiation, 
reinsurance gains cannot be recognised to offset any inception losses 
on the underlying contracts where they are recognised before the new 
reinsurance agreement is signed. In these circumstances, the onerous 
contract losses are reduced to reflect the net loss (if any) after 
reinsurance, and future contractual service margin (CSM) amortisation 
is reduced over the duration of the contracts.

The adoption of IFRS 17 by the Group has led to changes in both the 
definition or result of several of the APMs, although the principles 
underlying them have not changed.

The APMs used by the Group may not be the same as, or comparable to, 
those used by other companies, both in similar and different industries. 
The calculation of APMs is consistent with previous periods, unless 
otherwise stated.

APMs derived from IFRS measures
Adjusted operating profit
Adjusted operating profit is an APM that supports the internal 
performance management and decision making of the Group’s 
operating businesses, and accordingly underpins the remuneration 
outcomes of the executive directors and senior management. The Group 
considers this measure meaningful to stakeholders as it enhances the 
understanding of the Group’s operating performance over time by 
separately identifying non-operating items.

Adjusted operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the 
impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes caused 
by changes in market conditions or expectations and exceptional items. 
Key considerations in relation to the calculation of adjusted operating 
profit for the Group’s long-term insurance businesses and shareholder 
funds are set out below.

Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal 
course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition and 
start-up costs, are excluded from adjusted operating profit. 

Long-term insurance 
Adjusted operating profit reflects longer-term economic assumptions 
for the Group’s retirement and insurance businesses. Variances between 
actual and long-term expected investment return on traded and real 
assets are excluded from adjusted operating profit, as well as economic 
assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or 
expectations (e.g. credit default and inflation) and any difference 
between the actual allocated asset mix and the target long-term asset 
mix on new pension risk transfer business. Assets held for future new 
pension risk transfer business are excluded from the asset portfolio 
used to determine the discount rate for annuities on insurance contract 
liabilities. The impact of investment management actions that optimise 
the yield of the assets backing the back book of annuity contracts is now 
included within adjusted operating profit.

Application of IFRS 17 has changed the timing of the recognition of profit 
from insurance contracts. This includes spreading both the day one 
profit arising on new business and the impact of assumption changes 
into the contractual service margin. Accordingly, the application of IFRS 
17 reduced the reported 2022 operating profit from divisions by £0.8bn 
in comparison with the result presented under IFRS 4.

Shareholder funds
Shareholder funds include both the Group’s traded investments portfolio 
and certain direct investments for which adjusted operating profit is 
based on the long-term economic return expected to be generated. For 
these direct investments, as well as for the Group’s traded investments 
portfolio, deviations from such long-term economic return are excluded 
from adjusted operating profit. Direct investments for which adjusted 
operating profit is reflected in this way include the following:

•  Development assets, predominantly in the specialist commercial real 
estate and housing sectors within the LGC alternative asset portfolio: 
these are assets under construction and contracted to either be sold 
to other parts of the Group or for other commercial usage, and on 
which LGC accepts development risks and expects to realise profits 
once construction is complete.
‘Scale-up’ investments, predominantly in the alternative finance 
sector within the LGC alternative asset portfolio as well as the fintech 
business within Retail: these are investments in early-stage ventures 
in a fast-growing phase of their life cycle, but which have not yet 
reached a steady-state level of earnings.

• 

Shareholder funds also includes other direct investments for which 
adjusted operating profit reflects the IFRS profit before tax. Direct 
investments for which adjusted operating profit is reflected in this way 
include the following:

• 

‘Start-up’ investments: these are companies in the beginning stages 
of their business lifecycle (i.e. typically less than 24 months), which 
therefore have limited operating history available and typically are in 
a pre-revenue stage.

•  Mature assets: these are companies in their final stages of business 
lifecycle. They are stable businesses and have sustainable streams 
of income, but the growth rate in their earnings is expected to remain 
less pronounced in the future.

Note 2(i) Adjusted operating profit reconciles adjusted operating profit 
with its closest IFRS measure, which is profit before tax attributable to 
equity holders. Further details on reconciling items between adjusted 
operating profit and profit before tax attributable to equity holders are 
presented in Note 2(v) Investment and other variances. 

Adjusted profit before tax attributable to equity holders 
Adjusted profit before tax attributable to equity holders is equal to profit 
before tax attributable to equity holders plus the pre-tax results of 
discontinued operations. There has been no change in definition as a 
result of the adoption of IFRS 17.

Return on Equity (ROE)
ROE measures the return earned by shareholders on shareholder capital 
retained within the business. It is a measure of performance of the 
business, which shows how efficiently we are using our financial 
resources to generate a return for shareholders. ROE is calculated as 
IFRS profit after tax divided by average IFRS shareholders’ funds (by 
reference to opening and closing shareholders’ funds as provided in the 
IFRS Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the period). In the 
current period, ROE was quantified using annualised profit attributable to 
equity holders of £457m (31 December 2022: £783m) and average 
equity attributable to the owners of the parent of £4,699m (31 December 
2022: £5,014m), based on an opening balance of £5,067m and a closing 
balance of £4,331m (31 December 2022: based on an opening balance 
of £4,960m and a closing balance of £5,067m). The methodology for 
determining the ROE has not changed following the adoption of IFRS 17 
and IFRS 9.

Assets under Management
Assets under management represent funds which are managed by our 
fund managers on behalf of investors. It represents the total amount of 
money investors have trusted with our fund managers to invest across 
our investment products. AUM include assets which are reported in the 
Group Consolidated Balance Sheet as well as third-party assets that 
LGIM manage on behalf of others, and assets managed by third parties 
on behalf of the Group. AUM has not changed following the adoption 
of IFRS 9.

The table below reconciles AUM with Total financial investments, 
investment property and cash and cash equivalents.

4.  Other includes assets that are managed by third parties on behalf of the Group, other

Note 2(i) Adjusted operating profit reconciles adjusted profit before 
tax attributable to equity holders to profit for the year. In absence of 
discontinued operations, adjusted profit before tax attributable to equity 
holders is equal to profit before tax attributable to equity holders.

APMs derived from Solvency II measures
The Group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a 
regulatory basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements 
of regulators in each territory in which it operates. At a Group level, 
Legal & General has to comply with the requirements established by 
the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the PRA.

Solvency II surplus
Solvency II surplus is the excess of Eligible Own Funds over the Solvency 
Capital Requirements. It represents the amount of capital available to 
the Group in excess of that required to sustain it in a 1-in-200 year risk 
event. The Group’s Solvency II surplus is based on the Partial Internal 
Model, Matching Adjustment and Transitional Measures on Technical 
Provisions (TMTP). 

Differences between the Solvency II surplus and its related regulatory 
basis include the impact of TMTP recalculation when it is not approved 
by the PRA, incorporating impacts of economic conditions as at the 
reporting date, and the inclusion of unaudited profits (or losses) of 
financial firms, which are excluded from regulatory Own Funds. This 
view of Solvency II is considered to be representative of the shareholder 
risk exposure and the Group’s real ability to cover the Solvency Capital 
Requirement (SCR) with Eligible Own Funds. It also aligns with 
management’s approach to dynamically manage its capital position.

Further details on Solvency II surplus and its calculation are included 
in Note 26 Management of capital resources – Solvency II. This note 
also includes a reconciliation between IFRS equity and Solvency II 
Own Funds. 

Solvency II capital coverage ratio
Solvency II capital coverage ratio is one of the indicators of the Group’s 
balance sheet strength. It is determined as Eligible Own Funds divided 
by the SCR, and therefore represents the number of times the SCR is 
covered by Eligible Own Funds. The Group’s Solvency II capital coverage 
ratio is based on the Partial Internal Model, Matching Adjustment and 
TMTP. 

Differences between the Solvency II capital coverage ratio and its related 
regulatory basis include the impact of TMTP recalculation when it is not 
approved by the PRA, incorporating impacts of economic conditions as 
at the reporting date, and the inclusion of unaudited profits (or losses) of 
financial firms, which are excluded from regulatory Own Funds. This view 
of Solvency II is considered to be representative of the shareholder risk 
exposure and the Group’s real ability to cover the SCR with Eligible Own 
Funds. It also aligns with management’s approach to dynamically 
manage its capital position.

Further details on Solvency II capital coverage ratio and its calculation 
are included in Note 26 Management of capital resources – Solvency II.

Solvency II operational surplus generation
Solvency II operational surplus generation is the expected surplus 
generated from the assets and liabilities in-force at the start of the year. 
It is based on assumed real world returns and best estimate non-market 
assumptions, and it includes the impact of management actions to the 
extent that, at the start of the year, these were reasonably expected to be 
implemented over the year. 

It excludes operating variances, such as the impact of experience 
variances, changes to valuation assumptions, methodology changes 
and other management actions including changes in asset mix. It also 
excludes market movements, which represent the impact of changes in 
investment market conditions during the period and changes to future 
economic assumptions. The Group considers this measure meaningful 
to stakeholders as it enhances the understanding of its operating 
performance over time, and serves as an indicator on the longer-term 
components of the movements in the Group’s Solvency II surplus. 

Note 26 Management of capital resources – Solvency II includes an 
analysis of change for the Group’s Solvency II surplus, showing the 
contribution of Solvency II operational surplus generation as well as 
other items to the Solvency II surplus during the reporting period.

authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. 

Contract boundaries
Cash flows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they arise 
from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting 
period in which the Group can compel the policyholder to pay the 
premiums or has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder 
with insurance contract services.

Contractual service margin (CSM)
The CSM represents the unearned profit the Group will recognise for 
a Group of insurance contracts, as it provides services under the 
insurance contract. It is a component of the asset or liability for the 
contracts and it results in no income or expense arising from initial 
recognition of an insurance contract. Therefore, together with the risk 
adjustment, the CSM provides a view of both stored value of our in-force 
insurance business, and the growth derived from new business in the 
current year. A CSM is not set up for groups of contracts assessed as 
onerous. 

The CSM is released as profit as the insurance services are provided.

Coverage Period
The period during which the Group provides insurance contract services. 
This period includes the insurance contract services that relate to all 
premiums within the boundary of the insurance contract.

Credit rating
A measure of the ability of an individual, organisation or country to repay 
debt. The highest rating is usually AAA. Ratings are usually issued by a 
credit rating agency (e.g. Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s) or a credit 
bureau.

Deduction and aggregation (D&A)
A method of calculating Group solvency on a Solvency II basis, whereby 
the assets and liabilities of certain entities are excluded from the Group 
consolidation. The net contribution from those entities to Group Own 
Funds is included as an asset on the Group’s Solvency II balance sheet. 
Regulatory approval has been provided to recognise the (re)insurance 
subsidiaries in the US and Bermuda on this basis. 

Defined benefit pension scheme (DB scheme)
A type of pension plan in which an employer/sponsor promises a 
specified monthly benefit on retirement that is predetermined by a 
formula based on the employee’s earnings history, tenure of service and 
age, rather than depending directly on individual investment returns.

Defined contribution pension scheme (DC scheme)
A type of pension plan where the pension benefits at retirement are 
determined by agreed levels of contributions paid into the fund by the 
member and employer. They provide benefits based upon the money 
held in each individual’s plan specifically on behalf of each member. 
The amount in each plan at retirement will depend upon the investment 
returns achieved as well as the member and employer contributions.

Derivatives
Contracts usually giving a commitment or right to buy or sell assets 
on specified conditions, for example on a set date in the future and at 
a set price. The value of a derivative contract can vary. Derivatives can 
generally be used with the aim of enhancing the overall investment 
returns of a fund by taking on an increased risk, or they can be used with 
the aim of reducing the amount of risk to which a fund is exposed.

Direct investments
Direct investments, which generally constitute an agreement with 
another party, represent an exposure to untraded and often less volatile 
asset classes. Direct investments also include physical assets, bilateral 
loans and private equity, but exclude hedge funds.

products and new deals and incremental business on Group protection 
products.

Eligible Own Funds

liabilities, as valued on a Solvency II basis, plus high quality hybrid capital 
instruments, which are freely available (fungible and transferable) to 
absorb losses wherever they occur across the Group.

Employee satisfaction index
The Employee satisfaction index measures the extent to which 
employees report that they are happy working at Legal & General. It is 
measured as part of our Voice surveys, which also include questions on 
commitment to the goals of Legal & General and the overall success of 
the Company.

ETF
LGIM’s European Exchange Traded Fund platform.

Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicle (ICAV)
A legal structure investment fund, based in Ireland and aimed at 
European investment funds looking for a simple, tax-efficient investment 
vehicle.

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
These are measures by which the development, performance or position 
of the business can be measured effectively. The Group Board reviews 
the KPIs annually and updates them where appropriate.

LGC
Legal & General Capital.

Euro Commercial Paper
Short-term borrowings with maturities of up to 1 year typically issued for 
working capital purposes.

Expected credit losses (ECL)
For financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, a loss 
allowance defined as the present value of the difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due and all cash flows expected to be 
received (i.e. the cash shortfall), weighted based on their probability of 
occurrence. 

Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
A financial asset that is measured at fair value in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet and reports gains and losses arising from movements in 
fair value within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 
as part of the total comprehensive income or expense for the year.

Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
A financial asset or financial liability that is measured at fair value in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet and reports gains and losses arising from 
movements in fair value within the Consolidated Income Statement as 
part of the profit or loss for the year. 

Fulfilment cash flows
Fulfilment cash flows comprise unbiased and probability-weighted 
estimates of future cash flows, discounted to present value to reflect the 
time value of money and financial risks, plus the risk adjustment for 
non-financial risk.

Full year dividend
Full year dividend is the total dividend per share declared for the year 
(including interim dividend but excluding, where appropriate, any special 
dividend).

Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)

the fixed leg cash flows discounted at the SONIA curve.

Liability driven investment (LDI)
A form of investing in which the main goal is to gain sufficient assets to 
meet all liabilities, both current and future. This form of investing is most 
prominent in final salary pension plans, whose liabilities can often reach 
into billions of pounds for the largest of plans.

Lifetime mortgages
An equity release product aimed at people aged 55 years and over. It is a 
mortgage loan secured against the customer’s house. Customers do not 
make any monthly payments and continue to own and live in their house 
until they move into long-term care or on death. A no negative equity 
guarantee exists such that if the house value on repayment is insufficient 
to cover the outstanding loan, any shortfall is borne by the lender.

Longevity
Measure of how long policyholders will live, which affects the risk profile 
of pension risk transfer, annuity and protection businesses.

Matching adjustment
An adjustment to the discount rate used for annuity liabilities in Solvency 
II balance sheets. This adjustment reflects the fact that the profile of 
assets held is sufficiently well-matched to the profile of the liabilities, 
that those assets can be held to maturity, and that any excess return over 
risk-free (that is not related to defaults) can be earned regardless of 
asset value fluctuations after purchase.

Morbidity rate
Rate of illness, influenced by age, gender and health, used in pricing and 
calculating liabilities for policyholders of life products, which contain 
morbidity risk.

Mortality rate
Rate of death, influenced by age, gender and health, used in pricing and 
calculating liabilities for future policyholders of life and annuity products, 
which contain mortality risks.

Net zero carbon
Achieving an overall balance between anthropogenic carbon emissions 
produced and carbon emissions removed from the atmosphere.

Onerous contracts
An insurance contract is onerous at the date of initial recognition if 
the fulfilment cash flows allocated to the contract, any previously 
recognised acquisition cash flows and any cash flows arising from the 
contract at the date of initial recognition, in total are a net outflow.

Open Ended Investment Company (OEIC)
A type of investment fund domiciled in the United Kingdom that is 
structured to invest in stocks and other securities, authorised and 
regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

Overlay assets
Derivative assets that are managed alongside the physical assets held 
by LGIM. These instruments include interest rate swaps, inflation swaps, 
equity futures and options. These are typically used to hedge risks 
associated with pension scheme assets during the derisking stage of 
the pension life cycle.

Paris Agreement 
An agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change effective 4 November 2016. The Agreement aims to 
limit the increase in average global temperatures to well below 2°C, 
preferably to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels.

Pension risk transfer (PRT)
Bulk annuities bought by entities that run final salary pension schemes 
to reduce their responsibilities by closing the schemes to new members 
and passing the assets and obligations to insurance providers.

Persistency 
Persistency is a measure of LGIM client asset retention, calculated as a 
function of net flows and closing AUM.

Present value of future new business premiums (PVNBP)
PVNBP is equivalent to total single premiums plus the discounted value 
of annual premiums expected to be received over the term of the 
contracts using the same economic and operating assumptions used for 
the new business value at the end of the financial period. The discounted 
value of longevity insurance regular premiums and quota share 
reinsurance single premiums are calculated on a net of reinsurance 
basis to enable a more representative margin figure. PVNBP therefore 
provides an estimate of the present value of the premiums associated 
with new business written in the year.

Proprietary assets
Total investments to which shareholders are directly exposed, minus 
derivative assets, loans, and cash and cash equivalents. 

Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund (QIAIF) 
An alternative investment fund regulated in Ireland targeted at 
sophisticated and institutional investors, with minimum subscription and 
eligibility requirements. Due to not being subject to many investment or 
borrowing restrictions, QIAIFs present a high level of flexibility in their 
investment strategy.

Real assets
Real assets encompass a wide variety of tangible debt and equity 
investments, primarily real estate, infrastructure and energy. They have 
the ability to serve as stable sources of long-term income in weak 
markets, while also providing capital appreciation opportunities in 
strong markets.

Retail Retirement new business 
Single premiums arising from annuity sales and individual annuity back 
book acquisitions and the volume of lifetime and retirement interest only 
mortgage lending.

Retirement Interest Only Mortgage (RIO)
A standard retirement mortgage available for non-commercial 
borrowers above 55 years old. A RIO mortgage is very similar to a 
standard interest-only mortgage, with two key differences: 

•  The loan is usually only paid off on death, move into long-term care 

or sale of the house. 

•  The borrowers only have to prove they can afford the monthly 

interest repayments and not the capital remaining at the end of the 
mortgage term. 

No repayment solution is required as repayment defaults to sale 
of property.

For insurance, persistency is the rate at which policies are retained over 
time and therefore continue to contribute premium income and assets 
under management.

Return on Equity (ROE)*
Refer to the alternative performance measures section.

Platform
Online services used by intermediaries and consumers to view and 
administer their investment portfolios. Platforms usually provide 
facilities for buying and selling investments (including, in the UK 
products such as Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), Self-Invested 
Personal Pensions (SIPPs) and life insurance) and for viewing an 
individual’s entire portfolio to assess asset allocation and risk exposure.

Risk adjustment
The risk adjustment reflects the compensation that the Group would 
require for bearing uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash 
flows that arises from non-financial risk after diversification. We have 
calibrated the Group’s risk adjustment using a Value at Risk (VAR) 
methodology. In some cases, the compensation for risk on reinsured 
business is linked directly to the price paid for reinsurance. The risk 
adjustment is a component of the insurance contract liability, and it is 
released as profit if experience plays out as expected.

Risk appetite
The aggregate level and types of risk a company is willing to assume 
in its exposures and business activities in order to achieve its 
business objectives.

Single premiums
Single premiums arise on the sale of new contracts where the terms of 
the policy do not anticipate more than one premium being paid over its 
lifetime, such as in individual and bulk annuity deals.

Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR)
The amount of Solvency II capital required to cover the losses occurring 
in a 1-in-200 year risk event.

Specialised Investment Fund (SIF)
An investment vehicle regulated in Luxembourg targeted to well-
informed investors, providing a great degree of flexibility in organisation, 
investment policy and types of underlying assets in which it can invest. 

Société d’Investissement à Capital Variable (SICAV)
A publicly traded open-end investment fund structure offered in Europe 
and regulated under European law.

Total shareholder return (TSR)

Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions (TMTP)
An adjustment to Solvency II technical provisions to bring them into line 
with the pre-Solvency II equivalent as at 1 January 2016 when the 
regulatory basis switched over, to smooth the introduction of the new 
regime. This decreases linearly over the 16 years following Solvency II 
implementation but may be recalculated to allow for changes impacting 
the relevant business, subject to agreement with the PRA.

Yield
A measure of the income received from an investment compared to the 
price paid for the investment. It is usually expressed as a percentage.

Solvency II
These are insurance regulations designed to harmonise EU insurance 
regulation. Primarily this concerns the amount of capital that European 
insurance companies must hold under a measure of capital and risk. 
Solvency II became effective from 1 January 2016. The Group complies 
with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, 
as adopted by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the UK, and 
measures and monitors its capital resources on this basis.

Solvency II capital coverage ratio*
Refer to the alternative performance measures section.

Solvency II capital coverage ratio – regulatory basis
The Eligible Own Funds on a regulatory basis divided by the Group 
solvency capital requirement. This represents the number of times the 
SCR is covered by Eligible Own Funds.

Solvency II new business contribution
Reflects present value at the point of sale of expected future Solvency II 
surplus emerging from new business written in the period using the risk 
discount rate applicable at the end of the reporting period.

Solvency II Operational Surplus Generation*
Refer to the alternative performance measures section.

Solvency II risk margin
An additional liability required in the Solvency II balance sheet, to ensure 
the total value of technical provisions is equal to the current amount a 
(re)insurer would have to pay if it were to transfer its insurance and 
reinsurance obligations immediately to another (re)insurer. The value of 
the risk margin represents the cost of providing an amount of Eligible 
Own Funds equal to the Solvency Capital Requirement (relating to 
non-market risks) necessary to support the insurance and reinsurance 
obligations over the lifetime thereof.

Solvency II surplus*
Refer to the alternative performance measures section.

Solvency II surplus – regulatory basis
The excess of Eligible Own Funds on a regulatory basis over the SCR. 
This represents the amount of capital available to the Company in 
excess of that required to sustain it in a 1-in-200 year risk event.

Forward-looking statements
This Annual report and accounts may contain 
‘forward-looking statements’ with respect 
to the financial condition, performance and 
position, strategy, results of operations and 
businesses of the Company and the Group 
that are based on management’s current 
expectations or beliefs, as well as assumptions 
and projections about future events. These 
forward-looking statements can be identified 
by the fact that they do not relate only to 
historical or current facts. Forward-looking 
statements often use words such as ‘aim’, 
‘ambition’, ‘may’, ‘could’, ‘will’, ‘expect’, ‘intend’, 
‘estimate’, ‘anticipate’, ‘believe’, ‘plan’, ‘seek’, 
‘continue’, ‘milestones’, ‘outlook’, ‘target’, 
‘objectives’ or other words of similar meaning. 
By their very nature, forward-looking statements 
are subject to known and unknown risks and 
uncertainties and can be affected by other 
factors that could cause actual results, and 
the Group’s plans and objectives, to differ 
materially from those expressed or implied 
in the forward-looking statements. Recipients 
should not place undue reliance on, and are 
cautioned about relying on, any forward-
looking statements. 

There are several factors which could cause 
actual results to differ materially from those 
expressed or implied in forward-looking 
statements. The factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from those 
described in the forward-looking statements 
include (but are not limited to): changes 
in global, political, economic, business, 
competitive and market forces or conditions; 
future exchange and interest rates; changes 
in environmental, social or physical risks; 
legislative, regulatory and policy developments; 
risks arising out of health crises and 
pandemics; changes in tax rates, future 
business combinations or dispositions; and 
other factors specific to the Group. Further 
details of risks, uncertainties and other factors 
relevant to the business can be found on pages 
56 to 59. Any forward-looking statement 
contained in this document is based on past 
or current trends and/or activities of the Group 
and should not be taken as a guarantee, 
warranty or representation that such trends 
or activities will continue in the future. 
No statement in this document is intended 
to be a profit forecast or to imply that the 
earnings of the Group for the current year 
or future years will necessarily match or exceed 
the historical or published earnings of the 
Group. Each forward-looking statement speaks 
only as of the date of the particular statement. 
Except as required by any applicable laws 
or regulations, the Group expressly disclaims 
any obligation to revise or update any 
forward-looking statement contained within 
this document, regardless of whether those 
statements are affected as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise.

Caution about climate information
This Annual report and accounts contains 
climate and ESG disclosures which use a large 
number of judgments, assumptions and 
estimates in connection with involved and 
complex issues. The ESG disclosures should 
be treated with special caution, as ESG and 
climate data, models and methodologies are 
often relatively new, are rapidly evolving and 
are not of the same standard as those available 
in the context of other financial information, 
nor are they subject to the same or equivalent 
disclosure standards, historical reference 
points, benchmarks, market consensus 
or globally accepted accounting principals. 
These judgments, assumptions and estimates 
are likely to change over time, in particular 
given the uncertainty around the evolution and 
impact of climate change and around broader 
factors, such as impacts and dependencies 
on nature. In addition, the Group’s climate risk 
analysis and net zero strategy and wider 
sustainability strategy remain under 
development and the data underlying 
the analysis and strategy remain subject 
to evolution. As a result, certain climate and 
ESG disclosures made in this report are likely 
to be amended, updated, recalculated or 
restated in future reports. This statement 
should be read together with the Cautionary 
statement contained in the Group’s latest 
Climate and nature report.

The information, statements and opinions 
contained in this Annual report and accounts 
do not constitute an offer to sell or buy or the 
solicitation of an offer to sell or buy any 
securities or financial instruments nor do they 
constitute any advice or recommendation with 
respect to such securities or other financial 
instruments or any other matter.
