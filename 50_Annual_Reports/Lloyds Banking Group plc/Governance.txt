The UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the Code) applied to 
the financial year ended 31 December 2023. The Code is available 
at www.frc.org.uk.

This directors’ report is set out in a way that helps shareholders 
and investors to evaluate how the Company has applied the 
principles and complied with the provisions of the Code during 
2023. The table below signposts the most relevant parts of the 
Annual Report, in particular where supporting information is not  
in the directors’ report.

The Company confirms that it applied the principles and 
complied with all the provisions of the Code throughout 2023. 

On 22 January 2024, the Financial Reporting Council published  
an updated version of the Code which will apply to financial years 
beginning on or after 1 January 2025. The Company will report 
against that updated version in due course.

Chair’s introduction

Strong governance  
provides the  
foundation  
for all that  
we do 

Sir Robin Budenberg
Chair

Since the Group launched its strategy in February 2022, the 
environment in which we operate has changed significantly.  
The Board is acutely aware that macroeconomic uncertainties, 
societal challenges and geopolitical tensions are having a 
profound impact on people, businesses and society. It is in  
this context that the Group remains committed to its strategy, 
including delivering higher, more sustainable returns for our 
shareholders, aligned to our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper.  
Strong governance provides the foundation for the Group to help 
our customers finance their ambitions and grow whilst navigating 
this challenging external environment. At the same time, 
it ensures we address the environmental, social and economic 
concerns of our wider stakeholders in an effective and 
appropriate manner.

During 2023, the Board has overseen the executive’s continued 
delivery of the Group’s strategic transformation and has focused 
on sound risk management, including a review of operational 
resilience. The strength of our organisation also depends on  
our people and our culture and we are conscious of the impact 
that the strategic implementation is having on our colleagues. 
Listening sessions with colleagues during 2023 provided valuable 
insight on how colleagues are experiencing our culture and, 
crucially, on how our leaders are being empowered to drive  
the fast-paced change required for the successful delivery  
of our strategy.

On the topic of culture at Board level, I have been particularly 
pleased by the open and collaborative relationship the Board has 
continued to develop with the executive. Together with providing 
constructive challenge on strategic implementation, the Board 
encourages the executives to share new plans at an early stage 
in order for the Board to provide feedback as those plans evolve.

Below I highlight some of the governance activities that took 
place during 2023.

Board oversight of strategy 
As I mentioned above, the Board has overseen the continued 
implementation of the Group’s strategy, providing feedback on 
the sequencing of changes and investment priorities, together 
with monitoring key performance indicators – read more  
on page 81.

Focus on risk management
Given the scale of change required to deliver the Group’s 
strategic transformation, the Board, the Board Risk Committee 
and the Group’s Information Technology and Cyber Advisory 
Forum (ITCAF) have each played a vital role in evaluating  
change and execution risk and overseeing operational  
resilience requirements. Read more on risk management  
on pages 101 to 106.

Promoting a healthy culture 
Building on previous years’ commitments to promoting a 
values-led culture, the Board has deepened its understanding of 
colleague and customer sentiment. Further details on the Board’s 
role in overseeing the embedding of a healthy corporate culture 
can be found on page 86.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Diversity, equity and inclusion
Inclusion lies at the heart of the Group’s purpose and increasing 
diversity in the broadest sense, including diversity of thought and 
background, remains a priority for the Board. Further information 
on progress made on diversity, equity and inclusion throughout 
all levels of the organisation is set out on pages 94 to 96 and 107.

Climate ambitions
The Board, through its Responsible Business Committee, has 
overseen the Group’s sustainability strategy. The Group now has 
10 sector-specific Net Zero Banking Alliance targets together with 
its overall banking ambition and investment target. In addition  
to our supply chain ambition, a further three new pledges
for water, waste and nature were announced in November for our 
own operations. Further details can be found on pages 84 and 107.

Board and Committee changes
Succession planning and the composition of the Board are 
important components of good governance. Alan Dickinson and 
Lord Lupton will retire at the 2024 annual general meeting after 
serving nine years and almost seven years respectively on the 
Board. We are deeply grateful to Alan for the wisdom and insight 
he has brought to the Board over a long period as both Deputy 
Chair and formerly as Senior Independent Director and in the 
many important Committee roles he has held and to James for 
his leadership as the inaugural Chair of Lloyds Bank Corporate 
Markets plc and for his significant contribution to the Board. They 
leave with our thanks and best wishes for the future.

Cathy Turner took over from Alan Dickinson as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and as Senior Independent Director 
in September 2023.

Nathan Bostock will be appointed as a non-executive director of 
the Group and, subject to regulatory approval, Chair of Lloyds 
Bank Corporate Markets plc, in each case with effect from 1 August 
2024. Nathan was Chief Executive Officer of Santander UK from 
2014 until 2022 and, prior to that, an executive director and Group 
Chief Financial Officer of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and 
previously its Chief Risk Officer. Nathan’s financial services 
experience and UK banking market knowledge will be invaluable 
to his roles with the Group. 

Read more about Board and Committee changes on page 94.

Ring-fencing governance
Although this is Lloyds Banking Group plc’s corporate governance 
report, I would like to thank Nigel Hinshelwood, Sarah Bentley and 
Brendan Gilligan for their continued and valued contribution as 
non-executive directors of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland 
plc (the Ring-Fenced Banks), which represent the majority of the 
Group’s banking activities. Further details regarding ring-fencing 
governance are set out on pages 76 and 87.

Corporate Governance Code
The Company’s statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018 can be found on page 71.

Stakeholder engagement
Understanding and meeting the Group’s responsibilities and 
duties to shareholders, customers and the communities we serve 
is central to our purpose and remains of utmost importance. Read 
more about Board stakeholder engagement on pages 82 to 83.

Boards of the Ring-Fenced Banks

Since 1 January 2019, UK legislation has required large UK banks to 
separate personal banking services, such as current and savings 
accounts, from riskier activities, such as investment banking,  
in other parts of their business. This is called ring-fencing. 

Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc are the banks within the 
Group which have been included within the ring-fence (together, 
the Ring-Fenced Banks). As the Group’s core focus is on the UK 
and on retail and commercial banking customers, the majority  
of the Group’s banking business is undertaken within the  
Ring-Fenced Banks.

Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors

Each of the directors of Lloyds Banking Group plc is also a director 
of the Ring-Fenced Banks. The boards of the Ring-Fenced Banks 
have three additional independent non-executive directors: Nigel 
Hinshelwood (Senior Independent Director), Sarah Bentley and 
Brendan Gilligan (together, the Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors). 
Read their biographies below. 

These Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors are independent of the 
management and the rest of the Group and their role is to act 
exclusively in the best interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks. They 
play a crucial role in the governance structure, with an enhanced 
role in managing any potential conflicts between the Ring-Fenced 
Banks and the Group.

Read more about the role of the Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors 
and the Group’s structure on page 87.

Board leadership and company purpose

The role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for promoting and assessing
the long-term, sustainable success of the Group, generating 
value for shareholders and contributing to wider society.

The Board is also responsible for ensuring that the Group’s culture 
is aligned with its purpose, values and strategy. Read more about 
how the Board assesses and monitors the Group’s culture on 
page 86. 

The Board establishes the Group’s purpose, values and strategy 
and seeks to ensure that the Group is Helping Britain Prosper. 
The Board approved the Group’s current strategy in February 2022 
and you can read more about how the Board has overseen the 
implementation of the new strategy by the Group Chief Executive, 
supported by the wider executive management team, on page 81.

The Board retains ultimate responsibility for ensuring the 
necessary resources are in place to meet agreed objectives.  
The effective management of risk is central to the Group’s 
strategy, supported by the Group’s enterprise risk management 
framework, which is discussed in the risk management report  
on pages 138 to 196.

The Group’s role as a sustainable and inclusive business is central 
to its purpose. The Responsible Business Committee oversees the 
Group’s sustainability ambitions, with specific reporting and risk 
management responsibility in relation to sustainability-related 
matters (including climate) shared with the Audit Committee  
and Board Risk Committee. This ensures appropriate coordination 
and cooperation on these matters. Read about our sustainability 
governance structure on pages 84 to 85.

The Board recognises that engaging with, and acting on the 
needs of, the Group’s stakeholders is key to achieving the strategy 
and long-term objectives of the Company. Read more about how 
the Board engages with stakeholders on pages 82 to 83 and the 
directors’ statement of how they have carried out their duties 
under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 on pages 03 to 05.

The terms of reference for the Board Committees and the 
matters reserved for the Board can be found on our 
 corporate governance page

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

 
Corporate Governance Framework
The key decisions and matters reserved for the Board’s approval, 
such as the Group’s long-term strategy and priorities, are set  
out in the Group’s Corporate Governance Framework, which is 
reviewed periodically by the Board. The Board is supported by  
its committees which make decisions or recommendations on 
matters as delegated to them under the Corporate Governance 
Framework, including Board appointments, the effectiveness of 
internal controls and the risk management framework, financial 
reporting, governance and remuneration policies. This enables 
the Board to spend a greater proportion of its time on strategic, 
forward-looking matters. Read more about the Corporate 
Governance Framework on page 95. 

Each Board Committee comprises non-executive directors only 
and has an experienced chair. The Committees are managed on 
the same basis as the Board. The structure of each Committee 
seeks to facilitate open discussion and debate and ensure 
adequate time for Committee members to consider all proposals.

The executive directors make decisions within the parameters 
and principles set out in the Corporate Governance Framework, 
which aims to ensure that decisions are made by management 
under the correct authority. However, where appropriate, any 
activity can be brought to the full Board for consideration, even  
if the matter falls within agreed executive parameters.

There are executive committees established to support the Group 
Chief Executive (Group Chief Executive Committees), in particular 
the Group Executive Committee. Read about the Group Chief 
Executive Committees on pages 141 to 142 and see the Group 
Executive Committee members and attendee on page 77.

Board meetings in 2023 
During 2023 there were nine Board meetings. There are separate 
boards and board committees of Lloyds Banking Group plc, Lloyds 
Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc, but most meetings of 
these companies are held concurrently and we refer to this as the 
‘Aligned Board Model’. As most of the Group’s business sits within 
the Ring-Fenced Banks, the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks, 
the Group and HBOS plc are aligned in most circumstances. This 
model is supported by a number of safeguards to enable us to 
operate in this way including the appointment of three Ring-
Fenced Bank only non-executive directors and a Ring-Fenced 

Bank Risk Officer, all of whose primary focus is on protecting the 
interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks. Read more about the Group’s 
governance structure and ring-fencing governance 
arrangements on page 87.

Updates are provided to the Board by the Committee Chairs as 
well as by the Chair, the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, and the Chairs of the Lloyds Bank 
Corporate Markets plc and Scottish Widows Group Limited boards. 
The Chair holds a number of meetings with the non-executive 
directors without the executive directors present.

The Group has a comprehensive and continuous forward agenda 
setting and escalation process in place to ensure that the Board 
has the right information at the right time and in the right format 
to enable the directors to bring their experience and influence to 
make the right decisions. The Chair leads the process, assisted by 
the Group Chief Executive and Company Secretary. The process 
ensures that sufficient time is allocated for strategic discussions 
and business critical items. 

The process of escalating issues and agenda setting is regularly 
reviewed as part of the Board evaluation with enhancements made 
to the process, where necessary, to ensure it remains effective. 

The Chair and the Committee Chairs ensure Board and 
Committee meetings are structured to facilitate open discussion, 
debate and challenge. If directors have concerns about the 
Company or a proposed action which cannot be resolved, their 
concerns are recorded in the Board minutes. Also, on resignation, 
non-executive directors are encouraged to provide a written 
statement of any concerns to the Chair, for circulation to the 
Board. No such concerns were raised in 2023 and up to the date 
of this report.

The non-executive directors also receive regular updates from 
management to give context to current issues.

How governance contributes  
to the delivery of our strategy
Our governance arrangements contribute to the development 
and delivery of our strategy in various ways, including by creating 
accountability and responsibility, information flow and 
independent insight from the non-executive directors.

The Board is responsible for establishing the Group’s strategy and 
reviews the delivery of that strategy by the Group Chief Executive, 
supported by the wider executive management team.

In 2022 the Board approved a new strategy and in 2023 the Board 
reviewed aspects of the strategic transformation including 
opportunities and risks to delivery.

The below diagram illustrates the different ways in which the 
Board oversees implementation of the Group’s strategy.

Board meetings

Strategy has been regularly discussed at Board meetings both as part of the updates from 
the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Chief Operating Officer 
and as specific agenda items. These include updates on the progress made with the Group’s 
strategic transformation and on business-specific strategies such as those for the Consumer 
Relationships, Mass Affluent, and Insurance, Pensions and Investments (IP&I) businesses.

One-to-one discussions with 
management

Non-executive directors have discussed 
the strategy at one-to-one meetings 
with members of senior management 
such as the Group Chief Executive, 
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer 
and the CEOs of the different businesses. 
This provides the non-executive directors 
with the opportunity to explore particular 
matters in greater detail outside of 
Board meetings.

How the  
Board oversees 
implementation  
of the Group’s  
strategy

Board Committees

A number of the Board Committees 
have oversight of aspects of the Group’s 
strategy. For example, the Board Risk 
Committee considers updates on the 
performance of the Group’s change 
programme being undertaken as 
part of the strategy including the 
related execution risks and the Audit 
Committee provides oversight to the 
strategic development of the reporting 
environments and benefits from the 
independent insight provided by internal 
and external audit, supporting rigorous 
review of strategic change.

Strategy offsites

Two strategy offsites gave the Board the opportunity to receive detailed 
updates on topics relating to the Group’s strategic transformation, 
to discuss those topics with the executive management team and 
to provide challenge and feedback to the executive team to inform 
the executive team’s planning and implementation.

June strategy offsite

November strategy offsite

Topics at the June offsite included the Consumer 
Relationships strategy, the Business and Commercial 
Banking strategy, the external environment (including 
artificial intelligence) and its implications for the Group, 
and early views on the IP&I business from its newly 
appointed CEO.

Outcomes of the offsite included feedback to the executive 
team on prioritisation of transformation initiatives and 
on the execution plans for the Consumer Relationships 
strategy and feedback on the early views of the IP&I CEO 
on the IP&I business.

Topics at the November offsite included an update 
on purpose, the external environment (including 
the technology landscape and Generative Artificial 
Intelligence) and its implications for the Group, an update 
on strategic transformation (including on the Group’s 
operational resilience work) and business strategy 
updates for the Consumer Lending business and the 
Business and Commercial Banking business. 

Outcomes of the offsite included feedback to the 
executive team on articulation of the Group’s purpose, 
opportunities to revisit the pace of the strategic 
transformation and digital identification propositions.

Board leadership and company purpose continued

Stakeholder engagement
The non-executive directors undertook tailored engagement 
via the Closer to Customers, Clients and Colleagues Programme, 
allowing them to hear directly from key stakeholders, including 
customers, clients and colleagues.

A number of activities took place under the programme, which 
included meetings with customers and clients and conversations 
with colleagues. The non-executive directors continue to find 
these sessions beneficial, providing valuable insight which helps 
in their consideration of the proposals reviewed by the Board 
during the year. 

The programme was designed to help the directors better 
understand the important issues for our customers, clients 
and colleagues, the role the Group plays in supporting them 
and how the Group is performing in this respect, helping to  
inform the directors’ decision making.

Further engagement by the Board with its stakeholders is 
described below and examples of decision making by the Board 
which had particular stakeholder relevance can be found on 
pages 03 to 05. 

Our stakeholders 

Customers 
and clients

The Group’s customer-centric approach means the Board has 
an ongoing commitment to understanding and addressing 
customer and client needs, which remains central to achieving 
the Group’s strategic ambitions.

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  Non-executive directors attended events to provide deeper 

insight into the issues which customers and clients have faced 
during the year. These events included sessions on the 
challenges of running a small business, the issues faced by 
vulnerable customers, the pressures for customers dealing 
with financial difficulties and the challenges of managing 
finances in retirement 

•  The Board also took the opportunity to meet with clients  
when visiting Group sites in Glasgow, Chester and Bristol

•  Dedicated updates to the Board from across the organisation, 
which identified areas of customer and client concern and 
covered a range of internal and external performance 
measures; in addition, concerns relevant to customers and 
clients were identified for consideration in wider proposals  
put to the Board

•  Regular updates to the Board giving insight into the Group’s 

performance in delivering on its customer and client-related 
objectives and commitments, which assisted in determining 
where further action was required to meet these objectives
•  The Chair and the Group Chief Executive attended customer 
and client engagement events across various regions of  
the UK, providing an important opportunity for customers  
and clients to raise their concerns directly with these  
Board members

Colleagues

Colleagues remain central to the delivery of the Group’s 
strategic ambitions and the Board continues to recognise this  
in its engagement with them. Engagement this year included  
a variety of sessions across the Group to discuss topical issues 
relating to challenges both at and outside of work.

As in 2022, the Board’s Responsible Business Committee has 
been the designated body for workforce engagement, providing 
focus, but with the Board retaining a commitment for individual 
Board members to engage with colleagues directly throughout 
the year. The Board considers these arrangements to be 
effective as they enable a broader range of colleague 
engagement activities, as described in this section.

The Responsible Business Committee reports regularly to  
the Board on all of its activities, including on its colleague 
engagement agenda. The Board will continue to consider  
its arrangements for engaging with the Group’s workforce to 
ensure they remain effective and to encourage meaningful 
dialogue between the Board and colleagues.

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  Review by the Responsible Business Committee of the findings 

of surveys of colleague sentiment, including annual and  
ad hoc surveys and review of the progress being made in 
addressing the matters colleagues have previously raised
•  Regular review by the Responsible Business Committee of 
other workforce engagement reports, covering key issues 
raised, trends on people matters and updates on 
colleague sentiment

•  An annual report, summarising all colleague engagement 
activity, including key themes and issues which colleagues 
have raised during the year

•  Non-executive directors attended a number of colleague 

focus groups, allowing colleagues to share their perspective 
on matters on the Board’s agenda and discuss the Group’s 
progress against its strategic objectives 

•  Members of the Board also visited a number of the Group’s 
sites where they met with colleagues, including Glasgow, 
Chester, Bristol and Halifax and a visit to the Halifax branch  
on Commercial Street, Leeds. Read more on page 85

•  Sessions were hosted by both the Chair and the Group Chief 
Executive, complemented by engagement sessions led by 
other senior leaders with feedback shared with the wider 
Board. The Group Chief Executive also held sessions with 
colleagues from a number of specific business areas across 
the Group

•  Board members attended a range of other events held for the 
Group’s senior leaders and other colleague network events

Shareholders

The Group has one of the largest shareholder bases in the UK, 
which includes most of our colleagues. The Board is committed 
to understanding the needs and expectations of all our 
shareholders, both private and institutional.

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  A number of directors engaged directly with institutional 

shareholders, including the Chair, the Group Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer. In the fourth quarter of 2023 the 
Chair undertook a coordinated programme of meetings 
with approximately 15 major shareholders of the Group, which 
were largely governance focused, including remuneration 

•  The Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer 

undertook numerous meetings covering topics such as the 
Group’s strategy, its purpose and its financial performance

•  Other Board members also attended external investor events
•  Regular updates from Investor Relations on market views 

and shareholder sentiment/feedback, including an annual 
presentation from the Group’s corporate brokers on market 
dynamics and perception of the Group

•  The Board’s Nomination and Governance Committee 

considered correspondence received from institutional 
shareholders and non-governmental organisations, along 
with market feedback

•  The Senior Independent Director and Chair of the 

Remuneration Committee engaged with shareholders 
and proxy agencies on matters relevant to remuneration 
and other topics

•  Overall, the Group undertook approximately 380 meetings 
with institutional investors, many of which were attended 
by management and directors

Communities and 
environment

The Group is present in almost every community in the country 
and the Board places great importance on engagement and 
action to help these communities prosper, while helping to 
build a more sustainable and inclusive future.

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  Updates on climate, environmental and social matters, 

covering aspects of the Group’s business, where the Board 
reviewed progress made against its stated ambitions  
in these areas and agreed any further action it considered 
was required

•  The Board continues to be supported in environmental 
matters by its Responsible Business Committee. The 
Committee considers stakeholder views on all matters 
relating to the Group’s ambition to be a trusted, sustainable, 
inclusive and responsible business. The report of the 
Committee on its work during the year can be found  
on page 107

Regulators and 
government

The Board continues to maintain strong and open relationships 
with the Group’s regulators and with government authorities, 
including key stakeholders such as the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA), the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA),  
HM Treasury and HMRC.

Suppliers

The Group has a number of partners it relies on for important 
aspects of our operations and customer service provision  
and the Board recognises the importance of these supplier 
relationships in achieving the Group’s wider ambitions.

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  The Chair and individual directors, including Chairs of the 
Board’s Committees, held continuing discussions with the 
FCA and PRA on a number of aspects relevant to the evolving 
regulatory agenda

•  The Board reviewed updates on wider Group regulatory 

interaction, providing a view of key areas of focus and also 
progress made in addressing key regulatory priorities

•  A meeting was held between the Board and the PRA in July 
to discuss the outcomes and progress of action relevant to 
the PRA’s Periodic Summary Meeting letter

•  The Chair and individual directors had a number of 

Continuous Assessment meetings with the PRA to discuss the 
Board’s oversight of the Group, key risks and strategic priorities 

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  The Board’s Audit Committee considered reports from the 
Group’s Sourcing and Finance teams on the efficiency of 
supplier payment practices, including those relating to the 
Group’s key suppliers, ensuring our approach continued 
to meet wider industry standards

•  The Board continued to oversee resilience in the supply chain, 
ensuring our most important supplier relationships were not 
impacted by potential material events

•  The Board considered matters relating to ensuring continuity 

in the Group’s customer related print communication, 
throughout turbulence within the supply chain in the second 
half of the year

Sustainability governance 
Given the strategic importance of our sustainability ambitions 
and commitments in managing the impacts arising from climate 
change and broader social issues, the Group’s governance 
structure provides clear oversight and ownership of the Group’s 
sustainability strategy and management of risks and opportunities.

The Responsible Business Committee oversees the Group’s 
delivery of its purpose including the delivery of our sustainability 
strategy (including climate-related matters). Training has been 
provided to Committee members on upcoming sustainability 
regulation and themes of nature and biodiversity. For further 
details see the sustainability report 

. 

Sustainability-related responsibilities at Board level are overseen 
by the Responsible Business Committee, with specific reporting 
and risk management responsibility in relation to sustainability-
related matters (including climate) shared with the Audit 
Committee and Board Risk Committee. This ensures appropriate 
Board level coordination and cooperation on these matters.

Climate risks and opportunities are identified, assessed and 
managed by business unit level teams governed via functional 
and divisional level steering groups and committees.

The Chair of the Scottish Widows Board sits on the Group Board. The Scottish 
Widows CEO sits on the Group Executive Committee and will update the Group 
Executive Committee on relevant insurance matters which can include 
papers for Group Executive Committee approval. 
The Chair of the Responsible Business Committee, Amanda Mackenzie,  
is a non-executive director on the Board, a member of the Remuneration 
Committee, the Nomination and Governance Committee and, as of 1 January 
2024, the Audit Committee, and ensures that sustainability is discussed and 
considered by the Board. Amanda has extensive experience in ESG matters, 
including helping launch the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

3  The Group Net Zero Committee and the Group Risk Committee provide 

oversight from an environmental perspective only.

84

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

One of the key areas of Board level involvement in 2023 was the 
approval of three additional Net Zero Banking Alliance sector 
targets and enhancement of our operational emissions targets. 
The Responsible Business Chair statement provides an overview 
of the Responsible Business Committee’s involvement in the 
Group’s sustainability progress and performance – read more  
on page 107. 

We engage proactively with investors and other key stakeholders 
throughout the year on our sustainability priorities and plans. 
Given net zero and sustainability are at the heart of our purpose-
driven strategy, with ambitious climate targets reflected in 
strategic objectives, the good progress already being made  
in this area and the Group’s existing focus on disclosure, 
transparency and engagement, the Board does not believe it is 
necessary to propose a separate climate vote at the Company’s 
2024 annual general meeting at this time. We will continue to be 
transparent on our sustainability strategy, targets, plans and 
progress. We will continue to consider on a regular basis whether 
to propose a climate vote. 

Executive level governance 
The accountable executive for the Group’s sustainability strategy 
is the Chief Sustainability Officer and Chief Corporate Affairs 
Officer, with relevant teams in place to drive this strategy forward. 
There are three key committees that provide management 
oversight from an executive level: the Group Net Zero Committee, 
the Group Risk Committee and the Group Executive Committee. 
These are supported by a number of divisional and function-level 
teams who consider sustainability topics. 

Group Executive Committee and Group Net Zero 
Committee governance 
Updates on the key areas of the Group’s sustainability strategy 
are provided to the Responsible Business Committee by the 
Group Executive Committee on a quarterly basis. 

The Group Net Zero Committee provides direction and oversight 
of the Group environmental sustainability strategy, including 
particular focus on the net zero transition and nature strategy, 
as well as oversight of the Group’s approach to meeting external 
environmental commitments and targets, including progress  
in relation to the requirements of the Net Zero Banking Alliance. 

Group Risk Committee governance
Responsibility for overseeing the management of financial risks 
from climate change rests with the relevant Chief Risk Officers 
across the Group, who have Senior Management Function (SMF) 
responsibility covering the Ring-Fenced Banks (Lloyds Bank plc 
and Bank of Scotland plc), Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets and 
the Solvency II regulated entities in Scottish Widows Group 
(under Scottish Widows Group, the Finance Director has additional  
SMF responsibilities to manage the risks while the Chief Risk Officer 
has oversight). 

Climate risk is considered through the Group’s monthly risk 
reporting to the Group Risk Committee, in addition to standalone 
updates on a half-yearly basis which inform discussions at the 
Board Risk Committee. Relevant updates are also provided across 
the Group’s key legal entities, as required. Additional engagement 
on relevant climate-related matters is undertaken through the 
existing risk governance structure, for example, sector risks and 
opportunities related to climate are presented and discussed 
at senior credit forums.

Programme governance is also in place for oversight of plans 
to develop the Group’s climate risk management and scenario 
analysis capabilities.

 
Key sustainability topics discussed at the Board’s Committee meetings in 2023

Across the Group’s governance structure, key areas of discussion at Board Committee level are detailed below in relation to the 
Group’s sustainability strategy, targets and approach to managing climate-related risk. These Committees meet at least quarterly 
with sustainability matters, including climate, discussed at a number of these meetings.

Non-executive director visits

Amanda Mackenzie (Chair of the Responsible Business 
Committee) and Lord Lupton (member of the Responsible 
Business Committee) visited West Yorkshire in July 2023. 

Their first stop was Halifax Town Centre and the Group’s Trinity 
Road site, where the Group has recently implemented a new 
energy solution for the site. The Group has removed its natural 
gas reliance there by introducing a ground source heat pump 
utilising the natural water that runs below Halifax Town Centre.

Amanda Mackenzie and Lord Lupton then visited the Halifax 
branch on Commercial Street, Leeds and met with colleagues. 
The branch had recently gone through a full transformation to 
make the branch sustainable, change the internal design and 
layout to the latest style and improve the digital approach in 
branch to support customer education. 

Sir Robin Budenberg (Group Chair and a member of the 
Responsible Business Committee) visited the Group’s office  
on Old Broad Street in London in December 2023 to witness 
first-hand how sustainability is at the heart of the Group’s office 
refurbishment project there. Using the latest air-source heat 
pumps to warm and cool the building, the Group aims to 
reduce energy use on the site by an estimated 63 per cent, 
fully supporting our carbon and energy reduction pledges. 
The Group has been able to recycle or repurpose 99 per cent 
of the waste that came out of the building.

We gathered insight
We looked at data and insights from the following sources:
•  Colleague surveys: 81 per cent of colleagues responded 

to our annual all-colleague survey in November
•  Conducted monthly pulse surveys with 25 per cent  
of the organisation each time to focus on key topics

•  Analysed sentiment from internal and external  

sources including nearly 200,000 comments from  
our annual survey

•  Tapped into sentiment being expressed about the world  

of work online to see external trends and influences

•  Refocused existing metrics to create a culture dashboard 
focusing on the internal and external environment – and 
developed this at an organisation and business area level

Consumer Duty
2023 has seen the implementation of Consumer Duty. This has 
included the design and management of the culture workstream 
for Consumer Duty which was delivered successfully for 
31 July 2023, the date on which Consumer Duty came into force 
for the Group, and continues to be embedded through our 
ongoing Consumer Duty culture work. This work has been in 
multiple phases:
•  All-colleague training and was completed by more than 

99 per cent of colleagues by the end of July 2023

•  Creation of four in-depth modules covering the four Consumer 
Duty outcomes – almost 100,000 module completions recorded 
in aggregate 

•  Design and implementation of workshops for leaders. 

60 workshops delivered and attended by over 1,200 leaders

• 
Board monitoring of culture progress
New for 2023: Culture Dashboard
Our Group Culture Dashboard is a new development introduced 
in November 2023, measuring the connection between high 
performing teams, change readiness and customer outcomes. 
The Culture Dashboard tracks both quantitative and qualitative 
insights and recommends actions to drive progress that will help 
the Group to Grow, Focus and Change.

Board engagement in 2023 and beyond
Our non-executive directors continue to engage with colleagues 
to deepen their understanding of how colleagues experience 
our culture, including through their participation in the Closer to 
Customers, Clients and Colleagues Programme. For the culture 
element of the programme our Board is provided with a range 
of events and listening sessions with colleagues, giving the Board 
valuable insight to inform its decision making. Towards the end 
of 2022, the decision was made to align topics for colleague 
sessions to key themes arising from colleague surveys.

One session focused on leaders, assessing the impact our  
Grow with Purpose Programme has had on them leading the 
transformation of our business. The discussion focused on how 
leaders are communicating the strategic direction and what 
barriers are getting in the way of driving fast-paced change.

Another session focused on our strategy, our colleagues’ 
understanding of it and the impact it is having on customers.  
This session also looked at the cost of living challenges and 
how colleagues feel they are being supported by the Group 
with these challenges.

The Board continues to monitor culture progress and colleague 
sentiment and engagement by drawing insight from colleague 
engagement surveys and monthly pulse surveys.

Group structure and ring-fencing  
governance arrangements
Since 1 January 2019, UK legislation has required large UK banks to 
separate personal banking services, such as current and savings 
accounts, from riskier activities, such as investment banking, 
in other parts of their business. This is called ring-fencing. 
The Group’s structure and governance arrangements meet these 
regulatory requirements. As mentioned on page 76, Lloyds Bank 
plc and Bank of Scotland plc are the banks within the Group which 
have been included within the ring-fence (together, the Ring-
Fenced Banks). The governance structure focuses on ensuring:
•  Independent decision making by the Ring-Fenced Banks’ 
boards – on any matters where there might be a conflict 
between the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks and the 
interests of another part of the Group and that any such 
conflicts are identified and appropriately managed

•  Risks affecting the Ring-Fenced Banks are considered and 

managed from the Ring-Fenced Banks’ perspective – including 
maintenance of the capital adequacy and liquidity of the 
Ring-Fenced Banks

•  Clear and effective governance at both Ring-Fenced Bank 
and Lloyds Banking Group plc level – including second and 
third lines of defence in respect of risk management

The subsidiaries of the Group are structured into the following 
sub-groups under Lloyds Banking Group plc, providing effective 
governance for the business undertaken in each sub-group: 
•  Ring-Fenced Banks sub-group containing Lloyds Bank plc 
and Bank of Scotland plc (including the Halifax and MBNA 
businesses), serving both their UK personal and commercial 
customers 

•  Non-Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group – Lloyds Bank Corporate 

Markets plc – which provides products and services to Group 
customers that are not allowed within the ring-fence, as well 
as serving financial institutions’ customers and holding certain 
of the Group’s subsidiaries and branches outside the UK 
•  Insurance sub-group under Scottish Widows Group Limited 

(including Scottish Widows Limited)

•  Equity sub-group under LBG Equity Investments Limited 

(including Lloyds Development Capital (Holdings) Limited) 

As mentioned on page 76, the boards of the Ring-Fenced Banks 
comprise all of the Group directors plus three additional 
independent non-executive directors: Nigel Hinshelwood  
(Senior Independent Director), Sarah Bentley and Brendan 
Gilligan. These Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors are independent 
of the management and the rest of the Group and their role is 
to act exclusively in the best interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks. 
They therefore play a crucial role in the governance structure, 
with an enhanced role in managing any potential conflicts 
between the Ring-Fenced Banks and the Group.

Getting closer to customers and clients

The Board remains very conscious of the challenges our 
customers and clients continue to face. During the year the 
Board reviewed and discussed an update dedicated to the 
impact of the increased cost of living on customers and 
clients, how the Group had supported, and would support, 
customers and clients and the Group’s engagement with 
the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders’ commitments  
to support borrowers. 

During the year the Board also received additional updates 
from management on the impacts of the increased cost 
of living on customers and clients across our businesses.

During 2023, Board members have attended customer and 
client engagement sessions to deepen their understanding 
of the day-to-day challenges our customers and clients

Division of responsibilities

Board responsibilities
As Chair, Sir Robin Budenberg has overall responsibility for the 
leadership of the Board and for ensuring its effectiveness in all 
aspects of its operation.

The composition of the Board helps ensure that no one individual 
or small group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision 
making. The diversity of skills, experience and background on the 
Board enables the Board to provide constructive challenge and 
strategic guidance and to offer specialist advice.

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership 
of the Board and the executive leadership of the Group – please 
refer to the role summaries below. The responsibilities of the Chair,  
Group Chief Executive, Senior Independent Director, Board and 
Committees are agreed by the Board and publicly available on 
the Group’s website on our corporate governance page 
Chair periodically refreshes membership of the Committees.

. The 

Monitoring independence
The Nomination and Governance Committee monitors whether 
there are any relationships or circumstances which may affect  
a director’s independence. Following the most recent review of 
independence, the Committee concluded that all non-executive 
directors are independent in character and judgement and are 
independent directors for the purposes of the Code. For further 
details of the review in respect of Alan Dickinson, noting his long 
service, please see page 95. Sir Robin Budenberg was 
independent on appointment when assessed against the 
circumstances set out in provision 10 of the Code.

Monitoring time commitments
Non-executive directors are advised of time commitments for the 
Board and relevant Committees prior to their appointment and 
are required to devote such time as is necessary to discharge 
their duties effectively. The time commitments of the directors are 
considered by the Board on appointment and annually thereafter 
and, following the most recent review, the Board is satisfied there 
are no directors whose time commitments are considered to be  
a matter for concern.

External appointments, which may affect existing time 
commitments to the Board and its Committees, must be agreed 
with the Chair and prior Board approval must be obtained. During 
2023, Amanda Mackenzie was appointed a non-executive director 
of The British Land Company PLC. The Board considered the time 
commitment and potential conflicts involved prior to Amanda 
accepting the role and was satisfied that she would continue 
to have sufficient time to commit to her Group Board and 
Committee appointments. The executive directors do not have 
any significant external appointments. Information on directors’ 
attendance at meetings can be found on page 79.

The right information and support
The Chair, supported by the Company Secretary, ensures that 
Board members receive appropriate and timely information. 
All directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary 
and the Group provides access, at its expense, to the services of 
independent professional advisers in order to assist directors in 
their role. Board Committees are also provided with sufficient 
resources to discharge their duties.

Non-executive directors 

The independent non-executive directors challenge management constructively and help develop and set the Group’s strategy. They actively participate 
in Board decision making and scrutinise management performance. The non-executive directors satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information 
and review the Group’s risk exposures and controls. The non-executive directors, through the Remuneration Committee, also determine the remuneration of 
executive directors.

planning and seeks to ensure effective 
communication with shareholders.

As Deputy Chair, Alan Dickinson supports the 
Chair in representing the Board and deputises for 
the Chair. The Deputy Chair may also represent 
the Group’s interests to official enquiries and 
review bodies.

As Senior Independent Director, Cathy Turner is  
a sounding board for the Chair and Group Chief 
Executive. She acts as a conduit for the views of 
other non-executive directors and conducts the 
Chair’s annual performance appraisal. She is 
available to help resolve shareholders’ concerns 
and will attend meetings with major shareholders 
and financial analysts to understand issues 
and concerns.

As Company Secretary, Kate Cheetham advises 
the Board on matters relating to governance, 
ensuring good information flows and that 
comprehensive practical support is provided to 
directors. She is also responsible for maintaining

Composition, succession and evaluation

Composition
The balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
on the Board is the responsibility of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee and is reviewed annually or whenever 
appointments are considered. The Nomination and Governance 
Committee assesses the skills, experience and knowledge of the 
non-executive directors on an individual basis and on a collective 
basis – please see page 73 for the results of the latest collective 
assessment, which was approved on 24 January 2024. Having the 
right balance of skills and experience helps to ensure directors 
discharge their duties effectively.

Appointments are made on merit and due consideration is given 
to diversity in its broadest sense, including gender, social, regional 
and ethnic backgrounds and cognitive and personal strengths.

Succession planning
The Nomination and Governance Committee ensures plans  
are in place for orderly succession to both Board and senior 
management positions and oversees the development of a 
diverse pipeline for succession. More information about the work 
of the Nomination and Governance Committee on succession 
planning can be found on pages 94 to 95.

The Nomination and Governance Committee leads the 
process for Board appointments, which makes recommendations 
to the Board. Open advertising and/or an external search 
consultancy is used for the appointment of the Chair and 
non-executive directors. 

All directors are subject to annual re-election. All directors intend 
to seek re-election at the Company’s annual general meeting in 
2024 except for Alan Dickinson and Lord Lupton, who have notified 
the Board that they do not intend to seek re-election.

Board Committee cross-membership

Non-executive directors sitting on multiple Board Committees enables them to read across matters relevant from one Committee to another and, by 
doing so, enhance the discussion on certain matters. The information below is as at 31 December 2023 and therefore does not reflect Amanda Mackenzie

Composition, succession and evaluation continued

Board evaluation
How the Board performs and is evaluated
The annual evaluation, which is typically facilitated externally at 
least once every three years, provides an opportunity to consider 
ways of identifying greater efficiencies, maximising strengths and 
highlighting areas of further development to enable the Board to 
continuously improve its own performance and the performance 
of the Group. 

The Chair of the Board, with the support of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee, leads the Board in considering and 
responding to the review of the Board’s effectiveness, which 
includes a review of its Committees and individual directors. 
Performance evaluation of the Chair is carried out by the 
non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, 
considering the views of the executive directors.

The Board is committed to independent evaluation of its own 
effectiveness and that of its Committees as recommended by the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2018. An external evaluation was 
carried out by Dr Tracy Long in 2022 and a summary of progress 
against the feedback from that evaluation is set out on page 91.

2023 evaluation of the Board’s performance
The 2023 evaluation was conducted internally between November 
2023 and January 2024 by the Company Secretary and was 
overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee. 

The 2023 review sought the directors’ views on areas of 
development identified in the 2022 review and on a range of 
topics including: board leadership and contribution; purpose  
and strategy; risk and control; and people, skills, culture and 
feedback. The topics were selected by the Company Secretary 
with input from the Chair.

Process and timeline for 2023 review 

Stage 1 
November – December 2023

Stage 2
January 2024

Stage 3
February 2024

The Company Secretary invited all 
directors to complete a questionnaire 
relating to the Board and Committees  
of which they are members. During this 
stage, the Company Secretary met  
with each of the directors to discuss  
their responses.

The findings, based on the questionnaire 
results and discussions with individual 
directors, were considered by the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
in January 2024. Committee-specific 
findings and actions were considered 
by each Board Committee.

Proposed actions based on these 
discussions were discussed at the  
Board’s meeting in February 2024.

Key findings from the 2023 review

The evaluation concluded that the performance of the Board, the Committees, the Chair and each of the directors continues  
to be effective. All directors demonstrated commitment to their roles and contributed effectively. 

The key findings and areas for consideration include the following:

Progress against the 2022 evaluation

The main focus in improvements to Board effectiveness in 2023 has been on creating room for more forward-looking and strategic 
discussions on key matters at Board and Committee meetings. These enhancements have been achieved by encouraging the 
executive team to bring strategic matters to the Board in a phased approach, allowing the Board to bring their challenge, influence 
and experience to the evolution and delivery of the strategy, ensuring that it is aligned with the Group’s purpose and values.

Board training
The Chair is responsible for leading the development, and 
monitoring the effective implementation, of training policies and 
procedures for the directors. On appointment, each director 
receives a formal and tailored induction. There is also a 
programme of ongoing training for directors.

The directors are committed to their own ongoing professional 
development and the Chair discusses training with each non-
executive director at least annually. The Company Secretary 
oversees a training plan for the non-executive directors, with the 
plan for 2023 discussed at the Nomination and Governance 
Committee at the start of the year with the non-executive 
directors encouraged to suggest training topics of interest.

Induction

New non-executive directors receive a tailored induction that 
focuses on the Group’s culture and values, stakeholders, 
strategy, structure, operations and governance with an 
emphasis on ensuring that the induction brings the business 
and its issues alive, taking account of the specific role the 
director has been appointed to fulfil and their skills and 
experience to date.

An induction pack is provided containing key corporate 
documents and information relating to the Group covering 
aspects such as the role of a director (including relevant Group 
policies such as anti-bribery, conflicts of interest, expenses,  
gifts and hospitality and share dealing), the Board and its 
Committees, financials and strategy, governance, risk 
management, culture, shareholders and training.

Group training modules

Committee training

New role training

Other training

Non-executive directors 
are asked to complete 
training modules on a 
quarterly basis. In 2023, 
these modules were on:
•  Modern slavery
•  Fighting economic 
crime – advanced 
anti-bribery

•  Security 
•  Conduct rules
•  Speak Up (the Group’s 

whistleblowing 
programme)

Committee-specific training 
is agreed by Committee 
Chairs as and when needed 
such as that provided to the 
Audit and Risk Committee 
Forum – please read more 
at the bottom of this page.

Directors who take on new 
roles, such as Cathy Turner 
taking over as Senior 
Independent Director and 
Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, or change roles 
during the year attend 
induction or handover 
meetings in respect of  
those new roles. 

Training sessions have been 
offered across a range of 
topics of particular interest that 
were chosen to complement 
the Board agenda and 
facilitate advanced discussion. 
Where training was offered 
online, the sessions have been 
recorded and made available 
to all directors. The topics are 
produced based on the level of 
knowledge and experience of 
Board members. Key topics 
during 2023 included:
•  Group Customer Dashboard
•  Senior Managers and 
Certification Regime
•  Market abuse including 
disclosure of inside 
information
•  Consumer Duty
•  Recovery and resolution 

plans

•  Nature (sustainability  

and climate)

•  Data ethics
•  Tax
In addition to the above, 
a board incident management 
exercise was undertaken.

Audit and Risk Committee Forum for non-executive directors 

In November 2023 there was the second meeting of the 
Audit and Risk Committee Forum, which was attended by 
members of the Group, Insurance and Lloyds Bank Corporate 
Markets Audit Committees and Board Risk Committees  
as well as colleagues from the business. 

The aims of this informal forum were to have interactive 
discussion to gain a shared understanding and appreciation 
of common areas of interest and to network. 

The topics discussed were risk and control environment,  
model risk management, supplier risk management and 
climate data.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Audit, risk and internal control

Audit and risk
There are formal policies and procedures in place designed 
to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the internal 
and external audit functions. Group Internal Audit is a single 
independent internal audit function, reporting to the Audit 
Committee. Further detail can be found in the sections headed 
‘Group Internal Audit’ and ‘Auditor independence and 
remuneration’ on page 100.

The Board has delegated a number of responsibilities to the  
Audit Committee, including monitoring and reviewing financial 
reporting, the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk 
management framework, whistleblowing, the internal audit 
process and the external auditor’s process. The Audit Committee 
reports regularly to the Board on its activities and its report for 
2023, confirming how it has discharged its duties, can be found  
on pages 97 to 100.

Requirements that the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable are considered during the drafting and reviewing 
process and the Board has concluded that the 2023 annual 
report meets this requirement. The Board is supported in this by  
its Audit Committee and a sign-off process involving different 
sections of the annual report being approved for inclusion 
by senior management, with additional review by the Group 
Disclosure Committee. The statement of directors’ responsibilities 
can be found on page 136 and the statement of the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements can 
be found on page 209. Related information on the Company’s 
business model and strategy can be found on pages 1 to 45.

The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management and 
internal controls systems, including the determination of the 
nature and extent of risk the Company is willing to take. Risk is 
further managed through the Board-approved risk management 
framework, as discussed in the risk management report on 
pages 138 to 196. The Board Risk Committee assists the Board 
in fulfilling its risk governance and oversight responsibilities, 
including by the provision of advice to the Board on risk strategy 
and overseeing the development, implementation and 
maintenance of the Group’s overall risk management framework, 
strategy, principles and policies and its risk appetite. The Board 
Risk Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities and 
its report for 2023, confirming how it has discharged its duties,  
can be found on pages 101 to 106.

Internal control
Board responsibility
The Board is responsible for, and monitors, the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems. These are designed  
to facilitate effective and efficient operations and to ensure the 
quality and integrity of internal and external reporting and 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and for the 
determination of the nature and extent of the principal risks the 
Group is willing to take in order to achieve its strategy. The 
directors and senior management are committed to maintaining 
a robust control framework as the foundation for the delivery of 
effective risk management. The directors acknowledge their 
responsibilities in relation to the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems and for reviewing their effectiveness.

In establishing and reviewing the risk management and internal 
control systems, the directors carried out a robust assessment of 
the emerging and principal risks facing the Company, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity and reputation, the likelihood of a risk event 
occurring and the costs of control. The process for identification, 
evaluation and management of the emerging and principal risks 
faced by the Group is integrated into the Group’s overall 
enterprise framework for risk. The risk identification, evaluation 
and management process is designed to also identify whether 
the controls in place result in an acceptable level of risk. At Group 
level, a consolidated risk report, risk appetite dashboard and 
report by the Chief Risk Officer are reviewed and regularly 
debated by the Group Risk Committee and the Board Risk 

Committee, with formal updates provided to the Board to  
ensure that they are satisfied with the overall risk profile, 
risk accountabilities and mitigating actions. The report and 
dashboard provide a view of the Group’s overall risk profile,  
key risks and management actions, together with performance 
against risk appetite and an assessment of emerging risks  
which could affect the Group’s performance over the life of  
the operating plan. Information regarding the main features  
of the internal control and risk management systems in relation  
to the financial reporting process is provided within the risk 
management report on pages 138 to 196.

Best practice in relation to risk management continues to evolve 
and throughout 2023 the Group has identified a number of 
enhancements to its risk management arrangements that are 
proposed to be implemented as part of continuous improvement. 
To support the Board’s approval, the Board Risk Committee  
has reviewed the 2023 plan and recommended approval  
of the proposals. 

The Board Risk Committee and the Board concluded that the 
Group’s risk management arrangements throughout 2023  
were adequate overall and provided assurance that the risk 
management systems put in place were responsive to the 
Group’s risk profile and strategy. The Board is confident that  
the enhancements proposed will ensure that the Group’s risk 
management arrangements will be sufficiently robust to meet 
developing risk management best practice for the future.

Control effectiveness review
All material controls are recorded and assessed on a regular 
basis in response to triggers or at least annually. Control 
assessments consider both the adequacy of their design and 
operating effectiveness. Where a control is not effective, the root 
cause is established and action plans implemented to improve 
control design or performance. Control effectiveness against  
all residual risks is aggregated by risk category, reported and 
monitored via the monthly Key Risk Insights or Consolidated  
Risk Report (CRR). The Key Risk Insights/CRR are reviewed and 
independently challenged by the Risk division and provided to  
the Risk Division Executive Committee and the Group Risk 
Committee. On an annual basis, a point in time assessment 
is made for control effectiveness against each risk category 
and across the sub-groups. The Operational Risk System,  
Key Risk Insights or CRR are the sources used for this point  
in time assessment and a year-on-year comparison on  
control effectiveness is reported to the Board Risk Committee  
and the Board.

Reviews by the Board
The effectiveness of the risk management and internal control 
systems is reviewed at least annually by the Board, the Board Risk 
Committee and the Audit Committee, which also receive reports 
of reviews undertaken by the Risk division and Group Internal 
Audit. The Audit Committee receives reports from the Company’s 
auditor, Deloitte LLP (which include details of significant internal 
control matters that they have identified) and has a discussion 
with the auditor at least once a year without executives present 
to ensure that there are no unresolved issues of concern. The 
Group’s risk management and internal control systems are 
regularly reviewed by the Board Risk Committee and the Board 
and are consistent with the Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council. There is also an annual 
independent Control Effectiveness review by Group Internal Audit 
which is reviewed by the Board Risk Committee and the Audit 
Committee. These reports have confirmed they have been in 
place for the year under review and up to the date of the approval 
of the annual report. The Group, Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group and 
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets have achieved full compliance 
with BCBS 239 risk data aggregation and risk reporting 
requirements and actively continue to maintain this status.

Nomination and Governance Committee report 

A persistent focus on succession  
planning helps ensure continuity  
of strong leadership

Sir Robin Budenberg
Chair, Nomination and 
Governance Committee

Driving an increase in inclusion and 
diversity across the Board and executive 
remains a priority.

Key activities in 2023

•  Board succession planning and recruitment
•  Board and Committee composition, skills and training
•  Senior executive succession planning
•  Board evaluation outcomes
• 

Inclusion and diversity

Q &A 

Q   How have the activities of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee (the Committee) helped strengthen inclusion 
and diversity across the membership of the Board and 
its Committees?

A   The Committee is responsible for overseeing the development 

of a diverse pipeline for succession at both Board and executive 
level. Inclusion continues to lie at the heart of the Group’s 
purpose and, in its ongoing assessment of the composition of 
the Board and its Committees, inclusion and diversity remain 
key considerations. Continuing to meet and exceed industry 
targets for Board diversity demonstrates our commitment, 
with the Committee’s role central to achieving this. Details  
of the Board diversity policy are set out on page 96.

Q   What aspects of succession planning have the Committee 

focused on in 2023?

A   Last year’s report highlighted that September 2023 would see 

Alan Dickinson having served nine years on the Board. 
Consequently, a key focus has been the succession 
arrangements for Alan’s roles, which led to Cathy Turner being 
appointed as Senior Independent Director during the year and 
the appointment of Nathan Bostock as a non-executive director 
to replace Alan’s core banking experience on the Board. Further 
consideration continues to be given to Board Committee 
membership as well as non-executive director recruitment. 
The Committee also considered succession planning for senior 
executives, building on the additional focus on this during 2022. 
See page 95 for more details.

Q   What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2024?

A   In addition to succession planning, the year ahead will see a 

focus on seeking to continue enhancing inclusion and diversity 
at both Board and executive levels. Composition of the Board 
and its Committees, and overseeing implementation of actions 
arising from the Board evaluation, will also be given 
appropriate attention.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Introduction
As highlighted in my introduction to the corporate governance 
report on page 72, Cathy Turner was appointed as Senior 
Independent Director during the year. Cathy’s appointment to 
this role helps demonstrate not only our commitment to diversity 
across the Board’s senior roles, but also how strong succession 
planning can, amongst other things, play its part in providing 
candidates for different Board roles. 

Beyond Board and executive succession planning, other key areas 
of focus for the Committee this year have included Board 
effectiveness and training, composition of the Board’s Committees 
and implementation of actions arising from the 2022 externally 
facilitated Board evaluation process. All of these areas are covered 
in more detail throughout this report.

Committee purpose and responsibilities 
The purpose of the Committee is to keep the Board’s governance, 
composition, skills, experience, knowledge, independence and 
succession arrangements under review and to make appropriate 
recommendations to the Board to ensure the Company’s 
arrangements are consistent with the highest corporate 
governance standards.

Board and Committee changes
Alan Dickinson and Lord Lupton have notified the Board that they 
do not intend to seek re-election at this year’s annual general 
meeting having served nine and almost seven years respectively 
on the Board. Nathan Bostock will be appointed as a non-
executive director and, subject to regulatory approval, Chair of 
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, in each case with effect from 
1 August 2024. Cathy Turner succeeded Alan Dickinson as Senior 
Independent Director and also as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee on 13 September 2023, at which point Alan ceased to 
be a member of the Remuneration Committee. At the same time, 
Cathy was appointed as a member of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee and, as announced on 25 January 2024, 
Cathy was appointed as a member of the Board Risk Committee 
with effect from 1 February 2024. Details of the selection process 
for Cathy’s appointment as Senior Independent Director can be 
found on page 96. As announced on 18 December 2023, Amanda 
Mackenzie was appointed as a member of the Audit Committee 
with effect from 1 January 2024.

Succession planning
Consideration has been given to tenure of Board members and 
potential future Board retirements and the impact of these on 
membership of the Board and its Committees, with particular 
attention given to succession arrangements for Alan Dickinson 
and Lord Lupton, as detailed above. The Committee’s ongoing 
review of the structure, size and composition of the Board and its 
Committees helps ensure that the appropriate mix of knowledge, 
skills, experience and diversity is maintained. A summary of Board 
and Committee composition and attendance can be found on 
page 79.

The Committee also continues to consider the overall health and 
diversity of the executive talent pipeline, together with detailed 
executive succession planning. Key considerations include, for 
example, cultural and strategic capabilities which will help deliver 
the strategic aims of the Group’s transformation programme. 
Further details on the Committee’s approach to succession 
planning can be found on page 95.

Board effectiveness and training
An internally facilitated Board evaluation has been conducted this 
year, overseen by the Committee. Full details of how the review 
was undertaken, and its outcomes, are provided on page 90, 
together with a summary of progress against the actions arising 
from the 2022 external Board evaluation process carried out by 
Dr Tracy Long on page 91. The Committee considered the 
outcomes of the review and agreed, and recommended to the 
Board for approval, the actions arising from the review. During 
2024, the Committee will continue to oversee implementation  
of the remaining actions from the 2022 review, together with 
outcomes from the 2023 review. The Committee has also 
undertaken an annual review of its effectiveness, the findings  
of which, together with the outcomes of the Board evaluation 
process as relevant to the Committee, were considered by the 
Committee at its January 2024 meeting; it was considered that 
the performance of the Committee continues to be effective.

The Committee also oversees training undertaken by the 
non-executive directors. The Chair discusses training with each 
non-executive director at least annually and, as set out in the 
summary of Board training on page 92, training sessions have 
been offered across a range of topics which complement the 
Board agenda, in addition to mandatory training requirements. 
Learning and engagement opportunities have been undertaken
by all non-executive directors in relation to material aspects of 
the Group’s business.

Independence and time commitments 
Based on its assessment for 2023, the Committee is satisfied  
that, throughout the year, all non-executive directors remained 
independent1 in character and judgement, and are independent 
directors for the purposes of the Code. Having served nine years  
on the Board in September 2023, the Committee gave specific 
and particularly rigorous consideration to Alan Dickinson’s 
independence. On the basis of the continued robust and 
constructive challenge and oversight provided in his role, 
facilitated by his deep knowledge of the Group and significant 
retail and commercial banking experience, the Committee 
confirmed Alan’s continued independence as a non-executive 
director. During the processes leading to the appointment of 
Cathy Turner as Senior Independent Director, consideration was 
given to Cathy’s independence and overall time commitments  
to ensure that her other appointments could continue to be 
appropriately accommodated. Nathan Bostock’s independence 
was considered as part of the appointment process and it was 
determined that he would be independent for the purposes of the 
Code. As discussed on page 88 of the corporate governance 
report, consideration is also given to time commitments when 
directors seek to take on any additional external appointments.

In recommending directors for re-election at the annual general 
meeting, the Committee has reviewed the performance of each 
non-executive director and their ability to continue meeting the 
time commitments required, taking into consideration individual 
capabilities, skills and experiences and any potential conflicts of 
interest that have been disclosed. The external roles held by all 
directors were considered to be appropriate. Fuller details of any 
conflicts of interest can be found on page 133.

The Group’s Corporate Governance Framework
The most recent annual review of the Corporate Governance 
Framework was finalised in April 2023. This review continued to 
build upon the simplification of the framework achieved during 
2022, while ensuring it remains compliant with relevant 
obligations and best practice.

As part of its broader governance responsibilities, the Committee 
considered regular updates on developments in corporate 
governance during the year, including the Edinburgh Reforms, 
the Financial Reporting Council’s consultation on proposed 
changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code, FCA and PRA 
consultations on Diversity & Inclusion in the financial sector 
and the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. 
The Committee also considered correspondence with 
shareholders on governance issues.

UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company applied the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 
for the year ending 31 December 2023 and complied with all the 
provisions. A table in relation to the Company’s compliance can 
be found on page 71.

The Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges its 
responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board,  
all of which have been accepted during the year. The 
Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the  
corporate governance page 

 on our website.

Committee composition, skills and experience
To ensure a broad representation of experienced and 
independent directors, membership of the Committee currently 
comprises the Chair, Deputy Chair, Senior Independent Director 
(who is also the Chair of the Remuneration Committee) and the 
Chair of the Responsible Business Committee, together with a 
further independent non-executive director (who is the Chair of 
Scottish Widows Group). 

1 

The Chair was independent on appointment. Under the Code, thereafter 
the test of independence is not appropriate in relation to the Chair.

The Senior Independent Director of the Ring-Fenced Banks also 
attends meetings as an observer in order to provide insights on 
matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks when required and as 
part of his role in the Group’s overall governance structure.

The Group Chief Executive attends meetings as appropriate. 
Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance 
during the year can be found on page 79.

Succession planning 

Succession planning, at both Board level and across key senior 
management roles, continued to be a core area of consideration 
for the Committee during 2023, with a particular focus on 
succession arrangements for Alan Dickinson. 

Effective succession planning assists the Group in delivering on its 
strategic objectives over the medium and longer term by ensuring 
the desired mix of skills and experience of Board members and 
executives, this being particularly important as we continue to 
drive forward delivery of the Group’s strategic and cultural 
transformation. The Board remains committed to ensuring the 
development of a diverse pipeline of current and future leaders 
across the Group’s executive and management levels, through 
the provision of a range of development opportunities.

At an executive level, the Chair is responsible for developing and 
maintaining a succession plan for the Group Chief Executive who 
is, in turn, primarily responsible for developing and maintaining 
succession plans for key leadership positions in the senior 
executive team. As part of its regular oversight and review of the 
adequacy and effectiveness of succession arrangements for 
executive directors and members of the senior executive, the 
Committee received and discussed regular updates from the 
Group Chief Executive covering executive succession planning 
arrangements. These demonstrated the continuing strength 
and effectiveness of the Group’s senior management succession 
planning, through the depth and diversity of the succession 
plans covering key senior management roles.

The Committee also supports the Chair in keeping the composition 
of the Board and its Committees under regular review and in 
leading the appointment process for nominations to the Board. 
This helps ensure continued focus on increasing the overall 
diversity of the Board and capacity for future succession planning, 
bearing in mind tenure of Board members and potential future 
retirements from the Board. The appointment process set out on 
the following page helps illustrate how this works in practice. 
In contemplating succession arrangements for Alan Dickinson 
as Senior Independent Director, the Committee considered both 
external and internal candidates, before making the 
recommendation to the Board that Cathy Turner be appointed 
as Senior Independent Director. Cathy’s breadth of executive and 
non-executive experience was a key factor, helping demonstrate 
the strength of our succession planning arrangements and 
recruitment processes. In addition to the appointment of Nathan 
Bostock, the Committee continues to give consideration to the 
appointment of further non-executive representation to the Board. 

The Chair leads an ongoing assessment of the Board’s technical 
and governance skill set, on both an individual and collective basis, 
using a Board skills matrix to track the Board’s strengths and to 
identify any gaps in the desired collective skills profile of the Board. 
Consideration is given to a range of factors such as the Group’s 
future strategic direction and helping to ensure that due weight 
is given to diversity in its broadest sense. The skills matrix is 
considered in the appointment of all Board members. The Group’s 
diversity commitments and outcomes of the Board evaluation 
process are also taken into consideration.

Succession planning also plays a key role in the recognition and 
promotion of diversity across the Board and senior management, 
further supported by a range of policies across the Group which 
promote the engagement of under-represented groups within the 
business in order to help continue to build a diverse talent pipeline. 
Further details can be found on page 31.

Nomination and Governance Committee report continued

Appointment process – non-executive directors 

The Committee leads the process for the appointment of non-
executive directors, making recommendations to the Board for the 
appointment of preferred candidates. The process involves open 
advertising and the engagement of an external search firm to assist 
with the identification of potential candidates, based on criteria 
identified by the Committee. This generates a list of potential 
candidates for consideration, from which a short list of candidates 
is selected who are then interviewed by the Chair, with further 
interviews and meetings then being held with other members of the 
Board, as deemed appropriate. After further consideration the 
Committee makes its recommendations to the Board for formal 
approval. This is a formal, rigorous and transparent process, leading 
to appointments being made on merit and objective criteria, with 
due consideration being given to a broad range of factors such 
as diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive 
and personal strengths and the Group’s future strategic direction.

There were no additional non-executive directors appointed  
to the Board during 2023. The process described above has  
been followed in the appointment of Nathan Bostock; the Group  
will report further on that appointment process in its 2024  
annual report.

The Committee gave particular consideration to the Senior 
Independent Director role recognising that, by September 2023, 
Alan would have served nine years on the Board. The Committee 
delegated authority to the Chair to lead the formal interview  
and selection process for this role and, supported by Alan, 
consideration was given to both external and internal candidates 
against criteria identified by the Committee. Russell Reynolds 
Associates, who were engaged in the process of identifying 
external candidates for consideration, as well as the process which 
resulted in Nathan Bostock’s recruitment, have no connection with 
the Group or individual directors other than conducting leadership 
search and succession planning services and facilitating 
leadership performance services. The Committee was kept 
informed on progress and discussions were held with other Board 
members, from which the consensus view was a preference for an 
internal candidate, unless a significantly stronger external 
candidate was identified. The Chair subsequently canvassed all 
directors for their views and interviewed the candidates for the role, 
before the matter was further discussed by the Committee. This led 
to the Committee’s recommendation, and the Board’s approval, of 
the appointment of Cathy Turner as Senior Independent Director. 
Further information on this process can also be found on page 4.

Board diversity policy
The Board diversity policy (the Policy) sets out the Board’s 
approach to diversity and provides a high-level indication  
of the Board’s approach to inclusion and diversity in senior 
management roles which is governed in greater detail through 
the Group’s policies.

The Board places great emphasis on ensuring that its 
membership reflects diversity in its broadest sense. Consideration 
is given to the combination of demographics, skills, experience, 
race, age, gender, educational and professional background and 
other relevant personal attributes on the Board to provide the 
range of perspectives, insights and challenge needed to support 
good decision making.

New appointments are made on merit, taking account of the 
specific skills and experience, independence and knowledge 
needed to ensure a rounded Board and the diverse benefits  
each candidate can bring to the overall Board composition.

Objectives for achieving Board diversity are reviewed on a regular 
basis. On gender diversity, the Board is committed to maintaining 
at least four women Board members and over time will aim to 
reach 50 per cent representation of men and women on the 
Board to match the 50 per cent ambition that the Group has set 
for women in senior roles. Reflecting these aspirations, the Board 
will also aim to meet the recommendations set out by the 
FTSE Women Leaders. Currently, this Policy is not applied to Board 
Committees individually, although we strive to apply similar 
representation across the Committees. The Board is comfortable 
that the diversity of the Board is reflected across Committee 
memberships and that this remains an ongoing consideration. 
The representation of women on the Board is currently 45 per cent 
(based on five directors being women and six directors being 
men). As at 31 December 2023, the Group meets the three board 
diversity targets identified under Listing Rule 9.8.6R(9), namely that 
the Board comprises at least 40 per cent women, at least one of 
the chair, the chief executive, the senior independent director or 
the chief financial officer is a woman and at least one member 
of the Board is from a Minority Ethnic background. Further 
information disclosed in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(10) 
and (11) can be found on page 136.

The Group has also set a target of 13 per cent of senior roles to 
be held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic executives by 2025. 
The Board will therefore aim to reflect this goal with regard to 
Board members. As at 31 December 2023, the Board continues to 
meet the Board level recommendation of the Parker Review with 
two Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Board members. As noted, 
the Board places high emphasis on ensuring the development 
of diversity in the senior management roles within the Group 
and supports and oversees the Group’s ambition of achieving 
50 per cent of senior roles held by women by 2025 and of 
13 per cent of senior roles held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic 
colleagues by 2025 (including a minimum of 3 per cent of senior 
roles being held by Black Heritage colleagues). This is 
underpinned by a range of policies within the Group to help 
provide mentoring and development opportunities for women 
and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues and to ensure 
unbiased career progression opportunities. Progress on this 
objective is monitored by the Board and built into its assessment 
of executive performance.

As at 31 December 2023, the representation of women within 
the Group Executive Committee and their direct reports was 
46.2 per cent in total (with 46.7 per cent for the Group Executive 
Committee and 46.2 per cent for their direct reports). The 
representation of women across all senior roles was 40.1 per cent, 
and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation in senior roles 
was 11.3 per cent. The Group’s Race Action Plan, which was 
launched during 2020, aims to drive cultural change, recruitment 
and progression across the Group. This includes a goal to 
increase Black representation in senior roles from 0.6 per cent 
to at least 3 per cent by 2025. As at 31 December 2023, we have 
increased the representation of Black Heritage colleagues in 
senior roles to 1.7 per cent. Further details of the Race Action Plan, 
and the Group’s further achievements in championing inclusion 
and diversity in its widest sense, can be found on page 31.

A copy of the Policy is available on the social sustainability page 
on our website and further information on the Board’s broader 
approach to inclusion and diversity as part of its strategic 
priorities and continued investment in being a leading inclusive 
employer can be found on pages 30 to 32.

Audit Committee report

The integrity of our financial disclosures 
and the effectiveness of the internal control 
environment are key priorities for 
the Group

Sarah Legg
Chair, 
Audit Committee

The Group’s IFRS 17 transition and the 
impacts of external volatility have been 
key priorities during the year.

Key activities in 2023

•  Reviewing and approving the Group’s IFRS 17 transition 
document published in April 2023 and the new IFRS 17 
disclosures included within the Group’s annual report 
and accounts

•  Supporting the close working of the Committees of the 

Board on matters relevant to sustainability
•  Assessing the effects and action required on 

matters relevant to the remit of the Audit Committee 
(the Committee) as a consequence of external volatility

Q&A

Q  What role has the Committee played in supporting 

transformation within the Finance function?

A  The Committee has had the opportunity to review and challenge 
the plans and progress made with the Finance transformation 
and strategy, a multi-year programme that is critical to the 
success of Finance and the wider Group. The Committee has 
received regular updates from management on progress with 
the Finance transformation and has also heard from Internal 
and External Audit. The Committee has also had the opportunity 
to consider further areas which are key to supporting the 
transformation, including finance talent and succession plans.

Q  How has the Committee supported the Group’s sustainability 

reporting during the year?

A  Throughout the year, the Committee has remained close to the 
developments in narrative reporting and how this is continuing 
to translate into financial statement disclosures. Progress on 
enhanced reporting processes and control environment across 
the social and environmental spectrum has been monitored, 
alongside development of new targets through to internal 
monitoring and external disclosure. The Committee supports 
the commitment to continuous improvement in sustainability 
reporting, which will remain a priority in 2024 given the pace of 
change with external standards.

Q  Why has the work of the Committee been important in managing 

the impact of uncertainty on the Group’s pension schemes? 

A  With an uncertain economic environment, including increased 
interest rates, the Committee continued to focus on the key 
valuation inputs to the accounting presentation of the Group’s 
pension schemes. This included consideration of the underlying 
assumptions, in particular those relating to demographics and 
rates of inflation. The Committee noted the results of the 
triennial valuation of the main schemes as at 31 December 2022, 
which were also shared with the Board.

Introduction
I am pleased to report on how the Committee has discharged
its responsibilities during what has been another busy year  
and I would like to start by thanking Committee members for  
their ongoing contributions to and continued support of the 
Committee’s work. The Committee has also benefited from the 
participation of Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors, who attend the 
Committee as observers, bringing insight on matters relevant to 
the Ring-Fenced Banks. Also, I would like to welcome Amanda 
Mackenzie, who became a member of the Committee on 
1 January 2024.

The Committee has again during 2023 worked closely with other 
Board Committees, in particular in matters relating to the Group’s 
sustainability ambitions and climate-related disclosures. I am 
pleased to report that the joint Audit and Risk Forum, which was 
formed in 2022 to discuss governance topics of common interest, 
met again in 2023 providing an opportunity for both Committees 
to share thinking on areas of common interest. 

Looking forward to 2024, in addition to our core responsibilities,  
the Committee will continue to monitor areas of continuous 
improvement on an end-to-end basis, and the audit plan to 
deliver focus from a risk perspective. 

Committee purpose and responsibilities
The purpose of the Committee is to monitor and review the formal
arrangements established by the Board in respect of the integrity 
of the financial reporting and narrative reporting of the Group 
and the Company. The Committee also monitors and reviews  
the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external 
audit functions, the effectiveness of the internal controls and the 
risk management framework and the adequacy and security of 
the arrangements for whistleblowing.

This includes the statutory audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and the independence of the statutory external 
auditor. The Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges 
its responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board, 
all of which have been accepted during the year. A full list of 
responsibilities is detailed in the Committee’s terms of reference, 
 on the 
which can be found on our corporate governance page 
Group’s website. 

In satisfying its purpose, the Committee undertakes the functions 
detailed within Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 7.1.3R. 
During the year the Committee considered a number of matters 
relating to the Group’s financial reporting. These matters are 
summarised on the following pages, including discussion of the 
conclusions the Committee reached, and the key factors 
considered in reaching these conclusions. 

In addition, the Committee considered a number of other  
matters not related directly to financial reporting, including 
internal controls, internal audit and external audit. These matters 
are also discussed in detail on the final page of the report.

Audit Committee report continued

Committee composition, skills,  
experience and operation
The Committee acts independently of the executive to ensure
the interests of shareholders are properly protected in relation 
to financial reporting and internal control.

The Committee undertook an annual review of its effectiveness, 
the findings of which, together with the outcomes of the Board 
evaluation process as relevant to the Committee (which, for 2023, 
was internally facilitated) were considered by the Committee at
its January 2024 meeting. It was considered that the performance 
of the Committee continues to be effective. 

All members of the Committee are independent non-executive 
directors with competence in the financial sector, and their 
biographies can be found on pages 74 to 75. Sarah Legg is a 
Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants 
and of the Association of Corporate Treasurers, with extensive 
knowledge of financial markets, treasury, risk management and 
international accounting standards. She is a member having 
recent and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and is the Audit Committee 
financial expert for SEC purposes.

During the course of the year, the Committee held separate 
sessions with the internal and external audit teams, without 
members of the executive management present. 

Matters considered during 2023

While the Committee’s membership comprises the non-executive
directors noted on page 79, all non-executive directors may
attend meetings as agreed with the Chair of the Committee.

The Group Financial Controller, Chief Internal Auditor, the external
auditor, the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and
the Chief Risk Officer also attend meetings as appropriate. Details
of Committee membership and meeting attendance can be
found on page 79.

Financial reporting
During the year, and in relation to the year ended 31 December 2023, the Committee considered the following issues in relation
to the Group’s financial statements and disclosures, with input from management, the Risk division, Group Internal Audit and the
external auditor.

Committee review and conclusion

Allowance for 
impairments on loans 
and advances

31 December 2023: 
£4,084 million

31 December 2022: 
£4,903 million

The Group’s impairment 
provision is dependent  
on management’s 
judgements on matters 
such as future interest 
rates, house prices and 
unemployment rates, 
as well as its assessment 
of the current financial 
position of its customers. 

During the year, the Committee has reviewed the level of provision held for 
expected credit losses (ECL) by the Group and the judgements and estimates 
used to calculate the provision. The most significant judgemental adjustment  
in 2023 has been in respect of inflationary pressures and interest rate risk. 
The Group continues to benefit from investment in ECL models, overseen by 
the Committee, to deliver impact assessments and sensitivity analysis more  
quickly and accurately. This has been particularly relevant given the constantly 
changing economic outlook in 2023. Note 24 to the financial statements 
includes details of the Group’s ECLs allowances, including those resulting from 
judgemental adjustments (31 December 2023: £28 million; 31 December 2022: 
£330 million), and a discussion of the improvements the Group has made  
to its consideration of climate risk on the ECL The Committee has reviewed 
management’s rationale for these provisions and has challenged whether their 
inclusion and quantification are appropriate. It also considered management’s 
assessment of climate risk impacts on ECL and the conclusion that no 
adjustment was required. 

Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that the impairment provision 
and the disclosures provided in the financial statements were appropriate.

Key issues

Committee review and conclusion

The directors are required 
to confirm whether they 
have a reasonable 
expectation that the 
Company and the Group 
will be able to continue 
to operate and meet their 
liabilities as they fall due 
for a specified period. 
The viability statement 
must also disclose the 
basis for the directors’ 
conclusions and explain 
why the period chosen 
is appropriate.

The Group has open tax 
matters which require it to 
make judgements about 
the most likely outcome 
for the purposes of 
calculating its tax position.

The value of the Group’s 
defined benefit pension 
plan obligations is 
determined using both 
financial and 
demographic 
assumptions.

Determining the value 
of the Group’s liabilities 
arising from insurance 
and participating 
investment contracts 
requires management 
to make significant 
estimates for both 
economic and non-
economic actuarial 
assumptions.

Management judgement 
is used to determine the 
expected costs of 
remediation and, where 
appropriate, the related 
administration costs.

The Committee assisted the Board in determining the appropriateness 
of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and in performing the 
assessment of the viability of the Company and the Group. These assessments 
were based on the Group’s operating, funding and capital plans which included 
consideration of climate-related matters on the Group’s performance and its 
projected funding and capital position. The Committee also took into account 
the results of the Group’s stress testing activities (page 143), its principal risks 
(page 40 to 43) and its emerging risks (page 44).

Conclusion: The Committee determined that the going concern basis of 
accounting was appropriate and advised the Board that three years was  
a suitable period of review for the viability statement and that the viability 
statement could be provided. The viability statement is disclosed within the 
directors’ report on page 45.

The Committee reviewed management’s assessment of the Group’s uncertain 
tax positions, which took into account the views of the relevant tax authorities 
and any external advice it received. In particular, it considered the Group’s claim 
for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary.

Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that the provisions and disclosures 
made in respect of uncertain tax positions were appropriate.

The Committee reviewed the process used by management to determine 
appropriate assumptions to calculate the Group’s defined benefit liabilities. 
These included the discount rate, the future rate of inflation and expected 
mortality rates.

Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that management had used 
appropriate assumptions that reflected the Group’s most recent experience 
and were consistent with market data and other information.

The Committee considered updates from management and from the Group’s 
Insurance Audit Committee summarising its activities, which included a review 
of the economic and non-economic assumptions made by management to 
determine the carrying value of Group’s liabilities arising from insurance and 
participating investment contracts. The assumptions discussed were in respect 
of workplace pension persistency, annuitant longevity and expenses.

Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that the assumptions used to 
calculate the Group’s liabilities arising from insurance and participating 
investment contracts were appropriate.

The Committee has received regular updates on the Group’s conduct risk 
matters and the progress it has made including updates on HBOS Reading 
and in relation to the recently announced FCA review of historical motor finance 
commission arrangements. 

Conclusion: The Committee has considered management’s assessment 
of the Group’s provision for conduct-related matters and was satisfied that 
the provisions were appropriate, noting a high level of uncertainty in relation 
to these estimates.

Other significant matters
The following matters were also considered by the Committee.

The Committee was satisfied that internal controls over financial 
reporting were appropriately designed and operating effectively.

Risk management and internal control systems
Full details of the internal control and risk management systems 
in relation to the financial reporting process are given within the 
risk management section on pages 138 to 196. Specific related 
matters that the Committee considered for the year included:

•  The effectiveness of systems for internal control, financial 

reporting and risk management

•  The extent of the work undertaken across the Group to ensure 
that the control environment continued to operate effectively

•  The major findings of internal investigations into control 
weaknesses, fraud or misconduct and management’s 
response, along with any control deficiencies identified 
through the assessment of the effectiveness of the internal 
controls over financial reporting under the US Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act (SOX). Specifically the Committee continued to closely 
monitor the deficiencies identified in respect of privileged  
and user access across certain business applications and 
associated IT infrastructure and the Group’s plans to address 
the control findings identified

Risk-weighted assets (RWA) and regulatory reporting
The focus on the quality of regulatory reporting continues to be 
high on the PRA’s agenda. To date, a number of skilled person 
independent reviews have been commissioned across the 
industry to review the governance, controls and processes 
supporting the regulatory reporting framework within firms.
Across the first, second and third lines of defence management 
continue to focus on strengthening the control environment in 
regulatory reporting with a link to longer-term and strategic 
initiatives also being considered. 

The ongoing programme of external assurance on regulatory 
reporting commissioned by the Committee has to date focused 
on risk-weighted assets. Management have provided regular 
updates to the Committee over the year to highlight progress 
made in improving the reporting control environment across  
a number of regulatory reports.

Audit Committee report continued

IFRS 17
The Committee has received updates throughout the year on 
both the financial and controls impact of the Group’s adoption  
of IFRS 17. It reviewed the Group’s transition document published  
in April 2023, which included the significant judgements and 
estimates, including those relating to the drawdown feature 
added to some of the Group’s pension products, that affect the 
reported amounts and the accounting policy choices made  
by the Group.

Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance
During the year the Committee has received updates on the 
responses of the Government and the Financial Reporting Council 
(FRC) to the white paper ‘Restoring trust in audit and corporate 
governance’. The Committee recognises the importance of  
an effective corporate reporting and governance framework  
that is proportionate and does not significantly impact the 
attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business. The Committee 
is supportive of the Government’s decision to withdraw the draft 
Companies (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2023 so that it can deliver a more targeted, simpler 
and effective framework for both businesses and investors.

The Group notes that on 22 January 2024 the FRC issued a revised 
UK Corporate Governance Code which will be effective from 
1 January 2025 apart from the updates to the provision on  
the monitoring and review of a company’s risk management  
and internal control framework which are effective from  
1 January 2026. 

Speak Up (the Group’s whistleblowing service)
The Committee received and considered reports from 
management on the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements.  
The Committee reviewed the reports to ensure there are 
arrangements in place which colleagues can use in confidence 
and without fear of retaliation. In addition, colleagues are able  
to report concerns about inappropriate and unacceptable 
practices; these arrangements are well publicised and there  
is proportionate and independent investigation of such matters 
or appropriate follow-up. The Committee reported on its 
consideration of whistleblowing arrangements to the Board.

Sustainability reporting 
The Committee discussed and challenged the Group’s progress 
with sustainability related reporting. Developments in UK 
companies regulation requirements for climate-related financial 
disclosure alongside emerging environmental sustainability 
reporting frameworks have been considered, assessing the near 
term and future impacts on external disclosures. As previously, the 
Committee benefited from a dedicated teach-in session focusing 
on the Group’s capabilities and progress with the production of 
climate and sustainability reporting and associated data, the 
enhanced control environment, and the developments with 
governance and assurance. Further discussion on sustainability 
governance can be found on pages 84 to 85. 

Group Internal Audit
In monitoring the activity, role and effectiveness of the internal 
audit function and their audit programme the Committee:
•  Approved the annual audit plan and budget, including resource
•  Reviewed progress against the plan through the year with 

updates including quarterly reports on the activities 
undertaken and six-monthly updates as a result of reviews  
by the internal audit Quality Assurance team

•  Considered the major findings of significant internal audits, 

and management’s response

•  Monitored the progress of internal audit’s coverage of key risk 
themes across the Group, including strategic delivery, cultural 
transformation, cost of living, Consumer Duty, supplier 
partnerships, capital efficiency, transition to net zero and  
data quality

•  Continued to monitor completion of enhancements identified 

by the third party who assessed the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function in 2021

100 Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Finance strategy and transformation
Significant investment has been committed to transform  
the Finance function, including the near-term deliverables  
of a new General Ledger across the Group in 2025 in addition  
to the transformation of processes and procedures across  
the financial data landscape and costs and investment 
management. This multi-year transformation journey 
incorporates significant improvements and efficiencies to the 
Group, with the Committee receiving timely updates with regard 
to the proposed plans, progress with them, and the associated 
financial and non-financial benefits.

Auditor independence and remuneration
The Committee is responsible for establishing the Group’s policies 
and procedures designed to protect the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor. In April 2023, the Committee 
reviewed its non-audit services policy; no substantive changes 
were made to the policy.

The policy details those services that the auditor is permitted 
to carry out and pre-approves certain of these services provided 
the fee is below a threshold; all other permitted services must  
be specifically approved in advance by the Committee. Prior  
to the engagement of the auditor for a permitted service, the 
policy requires that senior management confirms whether the 
Committee has pre-approved the service or specific approval is 
required. The total amount of fees paid to the auditor for both audit 
and non-audit related services in 2023 and further information 
on the policy is disclosed in note 17 to the financial statements.

External auditor
Following an external audit tender in 2018, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) 
was appointed as auditor of the Company and the Group with 
effect from the 2021 financial year. Mike Lloyd is the statutory audit 
partner for the Group and attends all meetings of the Committee.

The Committee oversees the relationship with the external  
auditor including its terms of engagement and remuneration  
and monitors its independence and objectivity. During 2023,  
the Committee reviewed Deloitte’s audit plan, including the 
underlying methodology, and Deloitte’s risk identification 
processes. In its assessment of Deloitte’s performance and 
effectiveness, the Committee has considered: Deloitte’s 
interactions with the Committee; the responses to a questionnaire 
issued to the Group’s businesses, Finance, Risk and Internal Audit; 
and the FRC’s Audit Quality Inspection Report published in 
July 2023. The Committee concluded that it was satisfied with 
the auditor’s performance and recommended to the Board a 
proposal for the reappointment of the auditor at the Company’s 
annual general meeting.

Statutory Audit Services compliance
The Company and the Group confirm compliance with the 
provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, 
which relates to the frequency and governance of tenders for the 
appointment of the external auditor and the setting of a policy  
on the provision of non-audit services, for the year to 31 December 
2023. There are no plans as at the date of this report to conduct  
a tender exercise for external audit services.

Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard
While not mandatory the Group is broadly compliant with Audit 
Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard published 
by the FRC in May 2023.

Board Risk Committee report 

Operational resilience and sound risk 
management are fundamental to the 
strength of the Group

Catherine Woods
Chair, Board Risk 
Committee

management of change and execution risks

•  Considered the impacts of the rising cost of living, higher 

interest rates and inflation, macroeconomic uncertainties, 
and geopolitical risks on both the Group and its customers
•  Overseeing the embedding of the Group’s operational risk  
and control framework and discussing evolution of the 
broader risk framework

•  Assessing the management of operational resilience risks, 

including cyber, supply chain management and technology 
risks, data risks and artificial intelligence

strategic risks

Q &A 

Q   How has the Board Risk Committee (the Committee) assessed 
the challenges and uncertainties of the external environment, 
and the potential impacts of these on the Group’s strategy 
and its customers?

A   The Committee is acutely aware of the breadth of challenges 

which the external environment and ongoing macroeconomic 
and geopolitical uncertainties continue to present. The 
Committee continues to use deep dives to focus on specific 
topics of interest. Areas such as credit and market risk, and the 
associated impacts of continued high interest rates and 
inflation, climate risk, cyber and data risks and economic crime 
prevention have all featured highly on the Committee’s agenda 
during the year, with consideration being given to actions being 
taken by management to not only mitigate risks, but to ensure 
appropriate support for customers and businesses. Further 
information is set out on the following pages, within the 
commentary on each risk type.

Q   In recognition of the external environment, what further 

consideration has the Committee given to progress with 
implementation of the Group’s strategic transformation and how 
successful delivery of the transformation could be impacted? 

A   The Committee received regular progress updates on the 

roup’s strategic transformation throughout the year. It also 
G
onsidered a number of deep dives on the Group’s control 
c
nvironment, together with a range of areas core to ensuring 
e
he Group’s operational resilience is maintained. This ensures 
t
he Committee has an appropriate view of overall progress  
t
nd visibility of core areas such as the Group’s critical business 
a
rocesses and important business services. These updates  
p
nd deep dives provide the Committee with the opportunity to 
a
hallenge management on progress and action being taken  
c
o mitigate risks. Further information on a number of these areas 
t
s covered throughout this report.
i

Q  What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2024?

A   The Committee will continue to focus on broadly the same 

areas as have been central to its discussions this year. As part of 
the Committee’s forward planning of activities, regular reviews 
are undertaken of areas that the Committee wishes to give 
additional focus to through, for example, the use of deep dives. 
This provides an appropriate balance between forward 
planning and flexibility, helping ensure focus on the Group’s 
most material risk types and any other areas of specific interest. 
The year ahead will see a broad range of topics covered, 
with these anticipated to include areas such as operational 
resilience, the Group’s control environment, credit reviews in  
key sectors, climate risk and people risks, amongst others.

Introduction
I am pleased to report on how the Committee has discharged  
its responsibilities during the year and would like to thank fellow 
Committee members for their valued contributions throughout 
the year. I also take this opportunity to welcome Cathy Turner, 
who was appointed as a member of the Committee with effect 
from 1 February 2024. The external environment continued to 
present a variety of challenging, and evolving, considerations for 
the Committee, with areas such as cost of living and continued 
high interest rates, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic 
uncertainties which notably included the failure of a small 
number of banks, driving impacts across the broader economy. 

The Committee has continued to focus on risks related to delivery 
of the Group’s strategy, including various aspects of operational 
and technology resilience, data and cyber risks, people risks and 
supply chain management, together with overall change and 
execution risk. Additional oversight is also given to a number of 
these areas through the IT and Cyber Advisory Forum, which 
supports the Committee. 

Consideration has also been given to credit risk, with deep dives 
across various areas of the business, alongside regular reporting 
and updates from the Chief Risk Officer assessing the overall 
credit environment and economic crime where the Committee 
considered the impacts and mitigating actions being taken.  
The Committee was also kept updated on progress with 
implementation of the Group’s Consumer Duty Programme 
and progress on new prudential modelling requirements relating 
to credit risk capital models and market risk models. Each of these 
areas is covered in more detail throughout this report.

Committee purpose and responsibilities
The Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk governance 
and oversight roles and responsibilities. The Committee is also 
responsible for ensuring the risk culture is fully embedded and 
supports at all times the Group’s agreed risk appetite, including 
the extent and categories of risk which the Board considers as 
acceptable for the Group to bear. A review and update of the 
Committee’s terms of reference was completed during the year, 
with no material changes being made. 

The Committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting its 
conclusions to the Board on the Group’s risk management 
framework, which captures risk principles, policies, 
methodologies, systems, processes, procedures and people.

Board Risk Committee report continued

This also includes the review of new, or material, amendments to 
risk principles and policies and overseeing any action resulting 
from material breaches of such policy. During the year, the 
Committee discussed the development of the Group’s broader 
risk management framework and risk taxonomy, which will be 
an area of further focus in 2024.

More details on the Group’s wider approach to risk management 
can be found in the risk management section on pages 137 to 196. 
Full details of the Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its 
terms of reference, which can be found on the corporate 
. on our website.
governance page 

Committee composition, skills, experience and 
operation
There were no changes to the membership of the Committee 
during the year. As announced on 25 January 2024, Cathy Turner, 
Senior Independent Director, was appointed as a member of the 
Committee with effect from 1 February 2024. Two of the three 
designated independent non-executive directors of the Ring-
Fenced Banks also attend meetings as observers in order to 
provide insights on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks 
when required and as part of their role in the Group’s overall 
governance structure. The Chief Risk Officer has full access to  
the Committee and attends all meetings. The Chief Internal 
Auditor and members of the executive also attend meetings as 
appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting 
attendance can be found on page 79.

The Committee undertook an annual review of its effectiveness, 
the findings of which, together with the outcomes of the Board 
evaluation process as relevant to the Committee (which, for 2023, 
was led by the Company Secretary), were considered by the 
Committee at its January 2024 meeting; it was considered that 
the performance of the Committee continues to be effective. 
Details of the Board evaluation process can be found on page 90.

As the most senior risk committee in the Group, the Committee 
interacts with other related risk committees, including the 
executive Group Risk Committee. These interactions help ensure 
the appropriate escalation of relevant matters to the Committee 
for review and consideration.

Matters considered by the Committee
During 2023, the Committee considered a wide range of risks 
facing the Group and its Ring-Fenced Banks, both current 
and forward-looking, across all key areas of risk management,  
in addition to risk culture and risk appetite. The Committee 
continues to focus on key risk topics through, for example,  
the use of deep dives to provide greater analysis of particular  
topics and associated risks.

The following pages provide a summary of the risks considered  
by the Committee, together with an outline of the material factors 
considered and the conclusions which were ultimately reached. 
The Committee continues to be supported by the IT and Cyber 
Advisory Forum, which dedicates additional time and resource to 
reviewing and challenging risks associated with IT infrastructure, 
IT strategy, IT resilience and cyber risks. The Chair and other 
members of the Committee attend this Forum.

The Board Risk Committee Chair is a member of the Audit 
Committee, in addition to the Audit Committee Chair being  
a member of the Board Risk Committee; this close interaction 
continues to help ensure that common issues of interest are 
addressed appropriately. A further Group-wide Audit and Risk 
Committee Forum was held during the year, following a similar 
forum in 2022. This provided an opportunity for members of  
both Committees to discuss key areas of common interest  
and enhances interaction across these Committees. Further 
information about this Forum can be found on page 92. There 
continues to be regular interaction with other Board Committees, 
in particular, with the Responsible Business Committee on  
climate risk and Consumer Duty, and with the Remuneration 
Committee on the alignment of remuneration to risk 
performance. This is further illustrated in the table of Board 
Committee cross-membership set out on page 89 of the 
corporate governance report. 

The Committee also reviewed regular updates from the non-
Ring-Fenced Bank and Insurance sub-groups, headed up by 
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and Scottish Widows Group 
Limited respectively, summarising key discussions and decisions 
taken at the relevant entities’ risk committees.

Rectifications  
and complaints 

The Group’s management 
of customer rectifications; 
resolving customer 
complaints in a timely 
and fair manner, together 
with eradicating the 
complaint causes 
through root cause 
analysis.

During 2023, the Committee received updates on the Group’s complaints and 
rectifications performance. For rectifications, the Committee has been kept 
informed of progress in dealing with customer remediation and process 
improvement activity as well as any new rectifications being identified. The 
Committee has also been appraised of key themes and progress against 
complaint-related appetite metrics, performance relative to peers and the 
challenges faced in the current landscape. Further investment has been 
allocated to improving the efficiency and efficacy of complaint handling. 
The Committee has also considered regular updates in relation to historical 
motor finance commission arrangements.

Conclusion: This will continue to be a key area of focus for the Committee. In 
particular, supporting the actions being taken to improve time taken to handle 
complaints and rectifications, deliver good outcomes for customers and to 
ensure that lessons are learned to minimise future events.

Committee review and conclusions

Consumer Duty

Implementation and 
embedding of the FCA’s 
new Consumer Duty 
rules across the Group.

The Committee has received updates on the Consumer Duty Programme  
during 2023. The Group’s implementation plan was approved by the Responsible 
Business Committee in July in line with FCA requirements. As a critical element  
of Consumer Duty, it is vital that focus remains on the delivery of the key cultural 
initiatives, the development of Group management information reporting, 
enhancing customer communication and third party requirements. There  
will be ongoing engagement and transparency with regulators through 
quarterly meetings.

Conclusion: The Committee recognises the significance of the embedding 
of the Consumer Duty requirements and will monitor the ongoing delivery 
and evolution as well as the closed book July 2024 delivery date.

Financial risks – covering credit and market risk 

Commercial credit 
quality 

Risks and external threats 
to commercial credit 
performance, including 
impacts related to a 
higher interest rate 
environment, together 
with sectors potentially 
exposed to climate risks.

The Committee provided oversight of the Commercial Banking portfolio via 
regular credit quality papers, sector deep dives and spotlight reviews, including 
large single name exposures. Specific consideration is given to topics on a risk 
profile basis and this year there were deep dives on the Group’s Agriculture 
portfolio and exposures to both the shadow banking sector and Liability-Driven 
Investments (LDIs). Discussion was also held regarding progress against 
roadmaps to fully embed risk-adjusted returns into active portfolio 
management as well as credit strategies for new origination flow. Detailed 
reviews allowed the Committee to assess risk levels and credit exposures,  
as well as clients requiring closer risk management. This includes the active 
engagement of the Business Support teams with Commercial customers. 

The Committee also reviewed emerging risks across a range of sectors, 
including those considered more vulnerable to the wider economic backdrop  
or structural change and those exposed to increased levels of physical and 
transitional climate risk; specific spotlights focused on utilities and real estate 
office exposures.

Conclusion: While recognising the risks in the portfolio, the Committee was 
satisfied that management was continuing to take appropriate action to 
mitigate and address current and horizon risks, while preparing to manage  
an expected increase in defaults in 2024 as a result of economic headwinds 
including inflation and higher interest rates.

Consumer credit 
quality 

Risks relating to 
Consumer lending, 
including impacts of 
higher cost of living,  
a higher interest rate 
environment and  
climate risks. Customer 
affordability and 
indebtedness is  
a key focus.

The Committee reviewed the performance of the Consumer portfolio via regular 
credit quality updates. Consideration is given to topics on a risk profile basis 
and this year additional focus was given to the Homes and Transport portfolios, 
as well as progress against the roadmap to fully embed risk-adjusted returns 
into active portfolio management as well as credit strategies for new origination 
flow. Enhanced monitoring is in place to provide early warning of any adverse 
trends requiring further action and the Group continues to closely monitor and 
manage higher risk segments, such as customers with higher indebtedness 
levels or lower incomes. Specific attention has been given to mortgages, given 
the impact of increased interest rates on variable rate customers and those 
coming to the end of fixed rate periods. 

Conclusion: The Committee is satisfied that appropriate lending controls and 
monitoring are in place to control risks across the Consumer lending portfolios 
and that there is an effective framework in place for ongoing risk management 
as well as significant support for customers in financial difficulty.

Balance sheet 
management and 
structural hedge

Management of the 
Group’s balance sheet, 
liquidity and structural 
hedging programme 
in an environment of 
uncertain customer 
behaviour, high interest 
rates and high-profile 
market events.

A key focus for the Group in 2023 has been the management of the balance 
sheet and resulting market and liquidity risks through periods of significant 
volatility driven by higher interest rates and uncertainty over customer 
behaviour in a world of increasing digitalisation. Updates were presented to the 
Committee on the LDI crisis, bank failures and the growth of the shadow banking 
sector, as well as the monitoring and management of risks due to changes in 
the volume and mix of customer deposits. The Committee discussed the risks 
associated with the current strategy, the management of those risks and the 
lessons that the Group has learned from the events of the year.

Conclusion: Close monitoring of the associated risks continues and any 
relevant lessons learned were incorporated into the measurement and 
management of market and liquidity risk. The Committee was satisfied that 
management was taking the appropriate actions to monitor and mitigate  
the risks, while recognising that this will remain a key priority in 2024 as the 
macroeconomic outlook and global political environment continue to evolve.

Key activities for the year continued 

Risk type

Key issues

Committee review and conclusions

Model risk 

Model risk continues to  
be an area of significant 
activity and importance, 
both internally and 
externally.

The Committee continued to receive updates on the progress to satisfy  
new prudential modelling requirements relating to credit risk capital models 
(primarily the new Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) IV regulations) and 
market risk models within Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition activities. 
Committee oversight was also focused on wider issues such as the model risk 
management and governance approach and the increased resources required 
for these as we proactively enhance the framework and capabilities to meet 
increasing internal and external demands, including those relating to Supervisory 
Statement 1/23. The Committee was also kept abreast of model risk management 
activity relating to advanced analytics (such as machine learning/artificial 
intelligence) models and associated aspects such as data ethics and climate, 
as the Group continues to develop its capability in these areas.

Conclusion: The Committee is comfortable that the development of new model 
types is subject to appropriate risk control and will continue to oversee the 
development of the management and control framework for model risk,  
as required by the Supervisory Statement 1/23. The Committee will continue  
to oversight CRD IV and IBOR prudential change related submissions.

Climate risk

Climate risk

Risks associated with the 
Group’s role in supporting 
the transition to net zero 
and evolving regulatory 
expectations.

The Committee continues to be engaged on the Group’s progress in developing 
climate risk capabilities, particularly in relation to current and developing 
regulatory requirements, as well as the key choices faced as part of the Group’s 
environmental sustainability strategy. Regular updates and periodic deep  
dives are provided to support the Committee’s oversight.

In 2023, the Committee was provided with an overview of activity across the 
Group to meet climate-related regulation requirements. Regular climate risk 
updates have also included management information covering key physical 
and transition risks across the Consumer, Commercial and Insurance portfolios. 
The Committee also discussed the Group’s implementation of its net zero strategy 
and the key strategic levers and participation choices facing different areas  
of the business. 

Conclusion: The Committee recognises the challenges associated with net zero 
and dependencies on the wider external landscape, however, maintains the 
importance of the need to support the transition as part of the Group’s wider 
purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. This will require difficult choices, which will 
continue to be monitored and discussed, as well an ongoing capability 
development, building on further progress made over the last 12 months.

Operational risk

Operational risk 
management 
framework

Completing the 
embedding of  
One Risk and Control 
Self-Assessment 
(One RCSA) to strengthen 
risk culture, simplify  
the risk and control 
environment, achieve 
better customer 
outcomes, increasing 
the pace of change and 
operational efficiency.

The Committee was provided with regular updates on embedding of One RCSA 
ahead of completion by year-end 2023. The Committee noted the emerging 
benefits, with greater self-identification of issues by business teams, fewer 
repeat audit findings and continued reduction in the number of material events. 
One RCSA laid the foundations for a broader evolution of the Group’s risk 
management framework. The evolution has been a key area of Committee 
focus in 2023. Defined targets were cascaded on the automation of controls 
over a three-year time horizon, with each business unit CEO presenting 
individual plans to the Committee.

Whilst it is fit for purpose, the Committee has also discussed the evolution  
of the broader risk framework, to ensure it truly enables the Group’s strategic 
ambitions. Proposals to change the Group’s risk taxonomy and reimagine the 
‘three lines of defence’ operating model were discussed and will shape activity 
into 2024.

Conclusion: The Committee recognises efforts to embed One RCSA and 
achieve a significant milestone in the Group’s risk and control management 
journey. This represents a strong foundation from which the Group can maintain 
ongoing control over its key risks, while seeking to optimise the associated 
people, processes and technology, to ensure risk and control can become  
a true enabler for the Group’s strategic ambitions.

Committee review and conclusions

Operational resilience 
(IT resilience, cyber, 
and supplier 
management)

Operational resilience 
remains one of the 
Group’s most important 
non-financial risks. 
We continue to enhance 
our resilience to better 
serve customers and 
to address regulatory 
priorities.

The Committee has received reports on the Group’s overall maturity against a 
suite of operational resilience capabilities and on the refinement of the impact 
tolerances of important business services. The Committee has also reviewed 
Group-wide self-assessments covering progress on the enhancements needed 
to ensure our important business services can be recovered within impact 
tolerance by March 2025 (in response to regulatory policy statements on 
operational resilience published in March 2021). Close attention has been  
paid to the Group’s management of its contracts with its suppliers to ensure 
resilience of services to customers. Given the significance of the risk to the 
Group, the Committee is supported by the IT and Cyber Advisory Forum 
specifically focused on IT and cyber risks.

Conclusion: The Committee has requested further specific updates on the 
progress of the Group-wide Operational Resilience Programme, the impact  
of investment on operational resilience and the way in which data is used to 
support management decisions around operational resilience.

Data risk 

Data strategy plans to 
remediate legacy and 
emerging risk challenges 
in the Group’s data 
control environment 
to enable strategic 
objectives.

Data risk continues to be an area of significant regulatory and media attention, 
particularly relating to new technologies such as artificial intelligence. Frequent 
updates have been provided to the Committee on the progress of the data 
strategy in response to legacy and emerging data risk challenges including  
on data quality and lineage controls and enhancing the Group’s governance 
framework e.g. around Data Ethics.

Conclusion: The Committee continues to be supportive of the data strategy  
and approach, recognising the complex roadmap of initiatives planned over  
a number of years. Delivery of the data strategy is critical, given data is a key 
enabler for good customer outcomes and the overall Group strategy.

People and health 
and safety risk

Managing people risks 
arising from the cultural 
transformation of the 
workforce will be critical 
to ensure we attract and 
retain the right skills and 
capabilities to deliver  
our strategy. 

People risk remains a key focus of the Committee, reflecting the scale and 
complexity of change required to the skills composition and size of our 
workforce. The Committee considered the current, emerging and horizon risks 
arising from the people plan and how these would be effectively monitored and 
managed with continued focus on culture, capability and capacity, colleague 
proposition, health and safety and wellbeing. The Committee also considered  
a deep dive on health and safety which highlighted enhancements to the 
framework, bringing more rigour and management focus to ensure we create  
a safe and healthy workplace.

Conclusion: The Committee supports the people plan and acknowledges that 
delivering the plan is critical to increasing our capability and capacity to deliver 
change faster as we move purposefully towards a high performing culture. 
People risk will remain a key area of focus in 2024 as the transformation  
journey continues.

Strategic 
transformation 
oversight

Risks associated with the 
extensive current and 
future Group strategic 
change agenda, 
recognising challenges 
faced in ensuring both 
successful delivery  
and implementation  
of change.

The Committee has reviewed the portfolio performance on a regular basis, 
focusing on the Board metric outcomes and underlying deliverables, which 
supports the Group’s strategic growth ambitions. The focus for 2023 has centred 
on embedding the new platform-based operating model and ensuring 
management is learning from the root causes of any delivery delays. The 
Committee, with the IT and Cyber Advisory Forum, also increased its monitoring 
of the safe delivery of change for important business services with dedicated 
deep dives undertaken throughout 2023, which is critical to ensure we avoid 
customer harm and minimise operational incidents. 

Conclusion: The Committee will continue to focus on the management of 
change and execution risk within appetite and on monitoring the outcomes 
being achieved. The Committee will review how the expected evolution of the 
platform model and agile change delivery approach is undertaken in 2024. 
Enhancing resilience in relation to our important business services remains 
a priority, ensuring that any strategic transformation delivered does not cause 
customer harm or compromise our operational resilience posture.

Key activities for the year continued 

Risk type

Key issues

Committee review and conclusions

Fraud

The Group’s management 
of fraud risk, while 
continuing to minimise 
the impact on genuine 
customer journeys.

Money laundering 
and financial crime 

The Group’s management 
of financial crime risks 
and compliance with 
the UK’s anti-money 
laundering regime.

Other categories

Regulatory and 
legal risk

Managing regulatory  
and litigation risk is a key 
focus within the Group.

Fraud, accounting for over 40 per cent of all crime in the UK according to the 
Home Office policy paper (Fraud Strategy: stopping scams and protecting the 
public) published in May 2023, remains a priority for the Group. Updates were 
provided to the Committee in 2023 related to the Consumer fraud programme 
and the Group’s preparations for new Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) reforms. 
Committee members acknowledged the progress made and supported the 
ongoing focus on and investment into improved detection capabilities and 
customer fraud remediation. The Committee noted the investment ring-fenced 
to ensure the Group meets new PSR policy requirements coming into force  
in 2024. 

Conclusion: The Committee welcomed the progress made and supports the 
forward plan for 2024 to improve detection capabilities and customer fraud 
response and remediation. The Committee will continue to be updated in 2024 
on the delivery of the PSR policy requirements.

Financial crime continues to be a source of significant external threats and 
remains a regulatory priority. Updates have been provided to the Committee 
throughout 2023 including the annual Money Laundering Reporting Officer’s 
Report, an update on the Group’s Ongoing Know Your Customer programme 
and a Group-wide Economic Crime deep dive review. Committee members 
have been supportive of the actions being taken by management; and  
noted that as financial crime risks continue to evolve and increase there is  
a continued need to prioritise investment to maintain an effective, risk-based 
and threat-led control environment. 

Conclusion: The Committee is supportive of the actions being taken to manage 
financial crime risks and supports management’s continued investment to 
remain effective in the face of increasing threats. The Committee will continue 
to be updated in 2024 on key deliverables across the programme.

The Committee has provided oversight to ensure effective controls are in place  
to comply with existing regulatory obligations, including consideration of these  
at an individual legal entity level. The Committee considered regular updates  
on emerging regulatory and legal risks. In addition, the Committee has continued 
to closely monitor a number of significant regulatory change and oversight 
programmes, such as risk-free rates transition; model risk management and 
ring-fencing reforms. In particular, the Committee has also reviewed regular 
progress updates on the enhancements to the Group’s Recovery and Resolution 
planning, including fire drill activities.

Conclusion: The Group places significant focus on complex regulatory changes 
and litigation risk, as well as ensuring effective horizon scanning of upcoming 
trends and evolving risks. The Committee has discussed the topics raised and  
will continue to closely monitor compliance with regulatory requirements in 2024.

Emerging and 
strategic risk 
categories

Continued evolution of 
the Group’s emerging  
risk landscape and 
methodology with greater 
focus on geopolitical risks. 
Incorporation of strategic 
risk themes into the 
Group’s business 
planning process.

The Group’s focus on the emerging risk landscape and assessment approach 
has continued to be refined during 2023. A series of deep dives on the top 
emerging risk themes from 2022 have taken place during the year. In addition, 
geopolitical risks have been a focus and how these may generate second order 
impacts for the Group. The 2023 emerging risk landscape has been simplified, 
combining emerging and strategic risks into a single view. The Committee  
is supportive of the updated approach and approved the revised emerging  
risk themes.

Conclusion: Ensuring the Group understands the emerging risk landscape  
and its level of preparedness remains a key priority. In 2024, the Committee  
will continue to monitor the emerging and strategic risk trends, supported by 
targeted deep dives, considering their potential impacts and mitigating actions.

Chair, Responsible  
Business  
Committee

Responsible business means delivering  
good outcomes for our customers and 
building a more sustainable and inclusive 
future for people and businesses.

Key activities in 2023

•  Becoming a purpose-driven organisation
•  Tackling social and environmental challenges
•  Engaging our employees to deliver cultural change 
•  Delivering on our duty to customers and stakeholders

Q &A 

Q     What are the Responsible Business Committee’s (Committee) 

priorities for 2024?

A   W  e made significant strides in transforming the Group and 

embedding purpose in our decision making and behaviours in 
2023. The next year will be important in ensuring we continue to 
support colleagues, customers and communities and deliver 
on our focus areas of providing access to quality housing, 
unlocking regional development, greening the built 
environment and promoting financial resilience and inclusion. 

Q     What role does nature play in your environmental 

sustainability ambitions?

A    P  rotecting and restoring nature goes hand-in-hand with 
supporting the low carbon transition and Helping Britain 
Prosper. We’ve made strong progress this year, building an 
expert team and hiring our first Group Head of Nature. In 2024, 
we will be working with colleagues, customers and clients to 
manage our nature-related risks, capitalise on opportunities 
and embed nature into our decision making.

Introduction
I am pleased to report on the Committee’s work in 2023 and 
I would like to thank members for their contributions. We will 
continue to review progress against our inclusion and diversity 
aspirations and rigorously support our sustainability plans in 2024. 
The strong foundations we have laid will continue to shape how 
we do business to create a more sustainable and inclusive future. 
This is a key part of how we will grow our business profitably 
and provide long-term, sustainable value for shareholders  
and other stakeholders.

Committee purpose and responsibilities 
The purpose of the Committee is to support the Board in 
overseeing the Group’s policies, performance and priorities  
as a responsible business. We will continue our oversight of the 
Group’s work in 2024, as well as reacting to key emerging topics 
for our industry, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics. 
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on our  
corporate governance page 

 on the Group’s website. 

Environmental sustainability 
The Committee provides oversight of the Group’s environmental 
sustainability strategy, sharing responsibility with the Audit 
Committee and Board Risk Committee. In 2023, we recommended 
to the Board an updated environmental sustainability strategy and 
three new sector targets for road passenger transport, agriculture 
and commercial & residential real estate. We have also launched 
enhanced operational emissions goals, including a more 
ambitious direct carbon emissions reduction target alongside new 
water, waste and nature pledges. More detail on our sustainability 
progress can be found in the sustainability report 

.

Consumer Duty
The Committee is the designated body that fulfils the Board’s 
responsibility for Consumer Duty oversight. As the Board 
Consumer Duty champion, I worked alongside the Committee to 
provide oversight of the Group’s Consumer Duty implementation 
plan to meet the first of the FCA’s two Consumer Duty deadlines 
in July 2023 for new and open products. Consumer Duty sits at the 
heart of everything we do and we will continue our close work 
with the business as we approach the FCA’s second deadline for 
closed products in July 2024. 

Colleagues and culture 
Our colleagues play a vital role in the delivery of the Group’s 
strategic ambitions. The Committee, as the designated body for 
workforce engagement, supports the Group’s wider engagement 
strategy, reporting at least annually to the Board on the key 
themes and issues we’re hearing from our colleagues. This year 
we discussed the long-term journey we are on to transform 
our culture, with change readiness a key theme. Engaging our 
colleagues in our transformation is key to driving the Group’s 
success. Please refer to page 82 for more details on our colleague 
engagement activities. 

Diversity, equity and inclusion 
The Committee received regular updates on our diversity, 
equity and inclusion performance in 2023 and are pleased by 
the continued progress in increasing the representation of 
women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues in senior 
roles. The latest FTSE Women Leaders Review report confirmed 
women are represented in over 40 per cent of our senior roles, 
meeting the review’s recommendation. In April 2023, we also 
announced a further goal to double the representation of senior 
colleagues with a disability by 2025. We have asked the executive 
to continue to progress towards our commitments as we work to 
build a more inclusive organisation.

Committee composition, skills, experience  
and operation 
The Committee met on four occasions in 2023 and is composed 
of independent non-executive directors and is attended by the 
Group Chief Executive. It benefits from a range of perspectives, 
insight and experience, with representatives from Group Internal 
Audit and the Chief Operating Office attending meetings as 
appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting 
attendance can be found on page 79. Sarah Bentley joined the 
Responsible Business Committee of each of the Ring-Fenced 
Banks in January and I joined our Audit Committee to support  
the Committee’s sustainability-related reporting responsibilities. 

The findings of the internal annual review of effectiveness were 
considered by the Committee at its January 2024 meeting. 
Based on the evaluation, the feedback was that the performance 
of the Committee continues to be effective.

Remuneration Committee
Chair’s statement

Cathy Turner
Chair, Remuneration 
Committee

Throughout 2023 we have continued to 
support our people with the rising cost  
of living. We recognise the continued 
commitment of our colleagues and 
announced changes to our reward 
package providing greater certainty in 
what remains a fast-changing economic 
environment. This latest two-year pay  
deal means that between August 2022  
and April 2025 we will have provided  
a minimum £5,0001 pay award and £2,0001

Supporting our colleagues 

•  Agreed a multi-year pay proposal for 2024 and 2025 

reflecting our continued desire to support colleagues during 
uncertain times

•  Made a £5001 payment in December 2023 to around 44,000 

colleagues recognising immediate cost challenges

•  Consolidated a significant portion of our Group Performance 
Share (annual bonus) into base salary for around 32,000 
colleagues giving more certainty and delivering reward faster

108 Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Board, it is my pleasure to present the directors’ 
remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2023. I would 
also like to take this opportunity to thank Alan Dickinson for his 
commitment and contribution to the work of the Remuneration 
Committee (the Committee) during his time as Chair.

Supporting our customers and colleagues in 2023
Helping Britain Prosper has been central to all that the Group has 
done in 2023, focusing on delivering for customers, clients and 
shareholders. This has meant providing support through a tough 
and uncertain economic period which, whilst inflationary 
pressures have eased somewhat, remains an uncertain outlook 
for 2024 for many of our customers and colleagues. Our 
colleagues have worked tirelessly to support our customers, 
clients and communities as they continue to navigate this 
fast-changing environment. 

We remained committed to our ambition to be the Best Bank for 
Customers; we proactively targeted support for customers facing 
economic uncertainty, directly contacting around 675,000 
mortgage customers to encourage a review of their options, 
contacted 7.5 million customers since April 2022 to offer support 
and enhance financial resilience and, contacted more than  
15 million customers on their savings options.

The Group delivered a robust financial performance in 2023 
enabling a total ordinary dividend of 2.76 pence per share for 
2023 and its intention to implement an ordinary share buyback  
of up to £2.0 billion in 2024, benefiting our 2.2 million shareholders, 
including most of our employees.

Recognising the continued commitment of our colleagues, the 
Committee has reflected on how our overall reward package 
meets both their needs and the needs of the Group and, as a 
result, we have made a number of changes over 2023. For our 
more senior colleagues, including our executive directors, we  
are introducing greater performance differentiation in variable 
reward, including the return to a performance-based Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) for our Group Executive Committee members 
which will deliver stronger alignment and accountability for the 
delivery of our purpose-driven strategy. For our junior colleagues 
we’ve kept things simple, giving more certainty and delivering 
reward faster, with a continuing focus on supporting those 
impacted most by increased day-to-day living costs. 

Recognising the importance of certainty of earnings for many 
employees, in July 2023, we consolidated a significant portion of 
our annual bonus, the Group Performance Share (GPS) into base 
salary for around 32,000 colleagues. We also consolidated our  
4 per cent Flex cash allowance into base salary for the majority  
of colleagues, further simplifying their reward package.

Over the course of 2023 we have worked closely with our 
recognised unions, Accord and Unite, to agree an industry-
leading, multi-year pay deal for 2024 and 2025, reflecting our 
continued commitment to support colleagues and to help them 
plan for the future. To recognise the immediate cost of living 
challenges, we made a further £5001 payment in December 2023 
to around 44,000 colleagues who, including this payment, will 
receive average pay increases of between 9.1 per cent and  
14.4 per cent cumulatively over the two years. The overall increase 
to our total pay costs over this two-year period will be lower at  
8.2 per cent, as we continue to direct spend to our lowest paid 
colleagues. As part of our multi-year pay commitment, we will 
also raise our minimum salary across the Group to £25,0001  
by April 2025, all part of delivering on our purpose of Helping 
Britain Prosper.

Our two-year pay deal means that between August 2022 and 
April 2025, we will have provided a minimum £5,0001 pay award 
and £2,0001 in cash support, worth a total of around 35 per cent  
of salary, for our colleagues at lower grades.

2023 variable reward outcomes
In 2023, we are seeing real evidence of strategic progress as  
we transform the business and have increased our confidence  
in delivering the 2024 and 2026 commitments and growth.  
As a result of our robust financial performance this year, the 
Committee has approved a GPS pool of £384 million. This is a 
lower absolute pool than in 2022 because of the consolidation 
referred to above. On a like-for-like basis, including the 
consolidation of variable pay, the 2023 pool would be higher  
than 2022. Ensuring colleagues share in the success of the  
Group is an important element of our remuneration approach.

The approved pool includes the impact of a provision for the 
potential impact of the recently announced FCA review into 
historical motor finance commission arrangements.

In 2021, Long Term Share Plan (LTSP) awards were granted to 
around 600 colleagues and the Committee has determined that 
these should vest in full. In making this decision, the Committee 
considered several elements to satisfy itself that the vesting is 
appropriate. It noted that, during the ‘pre-grant test’ this award 
was reduced by up to 40 per cent to reflect the Group’s 
performance in 2020, the share price at the time of award and the 
wider experience of our shareholders. Furthermore, the vesting is 
subject to a ‘pre-vest test’ consisting of three financial underpins 
and four key questions. Finally, there was careful consideration 
whether an adjustment for windfall gains would be appropriate 
and it was concluded that given the award was initially reduced 
by up to 40 per cent, granted at a share price of 39.3015 pence 
which is higher than the 31.2 pence over the pandemic period  
and consistent with our share price range over the performance 
period (33-55 pence), no windfall gain has arisen and therefore 
no further adjustment would be appropriate. More detail is 
provided on page 115.

Executive directors’ remuneration outcomes
Charlie Nunn, Group Chief Executive (GCE) continues to show 
strong leadership in all aspects of the business and consistently 
demonstrates the Group’s values. He has led the strategic and 
cultural transformation which has maintained momentum 
whilst the Group has also navigated a challenging external 
environment. Once again, Charlie has overseen the Group’s 
robust financial performance and achievement of broader Group 
balanced scorecard (BSC) targets whilst maintaining a strong 
regulatory and risk environment.

Likewise, William Chalmers, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), 
has played a critical role in the development, communication 
and execution of our new strategy, as well as embedding and 
delivering a strong commercial, capital and investment  
discipline across the Group.

The Committee determined that the GPS (annual bonus)  
awards for the GCE and CFO should be in line with the Group’s 
performance as assessed by the Group BSC of 80.3 per cent of 
maximum, with resultant awards of £1,277,372 and £920,658 
respectively. This BSC outcome was inclusive of a downward 
adjustment in recognition of the external factors which benefited 
the ‘reduction in carbon emissions’ measure. Further details are 
outlined on page 113.

In 2021, William Chalmers was granted an LTSP award of 
75 per cent of salary, a reduction of 40 per cent versus the typical 
award recognising the Group’s performance in 2020. In line with 
the outcome for other participants set out above, William’s award 
will vest in full. 2021 LTSP awards were granted prior to Charlie Nunn 
joining the Group and therefore he did not receive an award.

The 2023 Group BSC outcome also acts as part of a ‘pre-grant 
test’ for our 2024 LTIP awards. Given our robust 2023 performance, 
the Committee has determined to grant LTIP awards to the GCE 
and the CFO of 300 per cent of salary in line with the policy 
approved at the last AGM. 

The vesting outcome of the LTIP award will be subject to the 
achievement of stretching performance targets (see page 124) 
measured over the period 2024 to 2026.

Strengthening the Group’s performance culture
The pivot towards a more demanding, high-performance  
culture is critical in delivering against the ambitious strategy  
we announced in 2022; returning to a performance-related LTIP 
directly aligns with that objective. We appreciated your 
overwhelming support having achieved 96 per cent support  
for the Remuneration Policy at the AGM in 2023.

Our principal reason for reintroducing an LTIP is to deliver stronger 
alignment between variable reward outcomes and the creation 
of shareholder value through the delivery of our strategy and the 
deepening of our relationships with our customers. Accordingly, 
the Committee has given careful consideration to the choice of 
LTIP performance measures ensuring that they are both stretching 
and transparent.

As set out in our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (DRP) approved  
at the 2023 AGM, 50 per cent of the LTIP outcome will be weighted 
to robust measures directly linked to our financial performance  
as we build to higher and more sustainable returns – Return  
on Tangible Equity, Capital Build and relative Total Shareholder 
Return (rTSR).

Recognising that the delivery of our refreshed strategy is critical to 
the creation of value for shareholders and our purpose of Helping 
Britain Prosper, a further 35 per cent of the LTIP will depend on 
performance against our four strategic growth pillars – Deepen 
and innovate in Consumer, Create a new mass affluent offering, 
Digitise and diversify our SME business and Target our Corporate 
and Institutional offering.

Our strategy is purpose driven and we continue to aspire towards 
a more sustainable and inclusive future through support for areas 
in which we can make a difference, such as our commitment  
to sustainable financing and the transition to net zero. 15 per cent 
of the LTIP outcome will therefore depend on the extent to which 
we deliver on our Sustainable Finance and Investment 
commitments and make progress towards our 2030 Net Zero 
Banking Alliance (NZBA) sector targets and Scottish Widows’ 
overall 2030 net zero ambition.

Full details of our new LTIP can be found on page 124.

For the last two years, our priority has been pay for our most junior 
colleagues and we did not award pay increases to our executive 
directors in 2023. For 2024, we will be increasing the fixed pay of 
our executive directors by four per cent consistent with the pay 
rise awarded to the majority of the wider colleague population  
as part of our unique two-year commitment on pay.

We will also be recommending a resolution to the AGM to ensure 
our governance remains aligned with the PRA’s updated Policy 
Statement on the setting of variable to fixed pay ratios for large UK 
institutions; the variable pay opportunity of our executive directors 
is determined by our Directors’ Remuneration Policy and will not 
be impacted.

Finally, together with my Committee members, I would like to 
thank our shareholders for their continued support and our 
colleagues for delivering another robust set of results in 2023. 

On behalf of the Board

  Cathy Turner,
Chair, Remuneration Committee

Group Chief Executive Charlie Nunn

Group Chief Executive
The single total figure of remuneration for the Group Chief 
Executive during 2023 was £3.7 million. This is a decrease  
of 2 per cent compared to 2022 largely driven by the  
lower short term variable award in 2023 given the Group 
balanced scorecard performance of 80.3 per cent versus 
2022 at 84.1 per cent.

 The single total figure of remuneration for the Chief

decrease of 6 per cent compared to 2022 which was driven 
by a lower long-term incentive payment for 2023. The 2021 
LTSP award was reduced by 40 per cent upfront at the time 
of grant, showing restraint based on 2020 Group 
performance.

The Remuneration Committee has considered the 
Group’s performance in 2023 and other factors as part of 
the ‘pre-grant test’ as well as the individual contribution 
of the executive directors and will grant 2024 Long Term 
Incentive Plan awards of 300 per cent of salary to the 
Group Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer

2023 Group Performance Share (GPS) pool 

2021 Long Term Share Plan (LTSP) outcome 

£384m

The Committee determined a GPS pool for 2023 of  
£384 million, reflecting the Group’s strong financial and 
overall business performance. While the pool is down 
from 2022, the 2023 outcome reflects the consolidation 
from GPS to fixed pay to provide greater certainty for 
our colleagues as described on page 108. 

The award level for the 2021 LTSP was appropriately set 
at grant in March 2021. Vesting was subject to a ‘pre-vest 
test’ which has been assessed as ‘met’. For full details on 
the ‘pre-vest test’ please see page 115.

The Fixed Share Award is part of fixed remuneration and is not subject to any performance conditions (see page 129).

1 
2  Awards for Charlie Nunn and William Chalmers will be made in March 2024 in a combination of cash and shares.
3  The 2021 Long Term Share Plan (LTSP) vesting (see page 115) at 100 per cent was confirmed by the Remuneration Committee at its meeting on 15 February 2024. 

The total number of shares vesting will be 1,547,340 for William Chalmers. The average share price between 1 October 2023 and 31 December 2023 of 
43.564 pence has been used to indicate the value. The shares were awarded in 2021 based on a share price of 39.3015 pence and as such 11 per cent of the 
reported value is attributable to share price appreciation.

4  The long-term incentive figures for 2022 have been adjusted to reflect the share price on the date of vesting (7 March 2023) of 51.764 pence instead 

of the average price of 44.04 pence reported in the 2022 report.

5  The 2021 LTSP awards were granted prior to Charlie Nunn joining as Group Chief Executive from 16 August 2021.
6  Other remuneration payments comprise income from all employee share plans, which arises through employer matching or discounting 

of employee purchases.

Our 2023 balanced scorecard
Our balanced scorecard provides transparency on how 
our performance directly aligns with remuneration outcomes 
for 2023 GPS. 

Strong performance across financial, customer and ESG 
measures has resulted in an overall outcome of 80.3 per cent  
as set out in the scorecard assessment table below. Our 2023 
employee engagement index score is somewhat reflective 
of implementing some necessary but tough changes in  
the operation of flexible working. Further commentary on  
non-financial performance is described on page 114. 

For 2023, ESG metrics aligned to our public commitments on 
climate change and promoting inclusion and diversity accounted 
for 17.5 per cent of the scorecard.

Our 2023 balanced scorecard

In determining the scorecard outcome for 2023, the Committee 
concluded that the mechanical outcome for reducing our 
operational carbon emissions benefited significantly from 
external factors including changes in government policy and a 
milder winter compared to the ten year average. Therefore, while 
the measure outcome is 93.3 per cent, a downward adjustment  
to 50 per cent has been applied as shown below reducing the 
measure outcome to 2.5 per cent.

(45%) commentary
The scorecard that the Committee used in determining the 
annual Group Performance Share awards for the executive 
directors, along with the assessment of performance against  
the scorecard, is detailed on page 113. The table below outlines 
the Committee’s assessment of the non-financial elements  
of the scorecard.

Non-financial measures commentary

Measure

Commentary

Group customer 
dashboard
Our assessment of how effectively 
we are serving customers across 
all brands, products and services.

•  The 2023 Group customer dashboard contains 195 targeted measures relating to customer 

• 

satisfaction, including; customer complaints, NPS and peer benchmarks
In 2023, 86 per cent of Group customer dashboard measures achieved target (compared to  
80 per cent in 2022), supported by ongoing strong performance relative to peers. Continued focus 
is required to maintain strong customer performance and to further improve scores in the context 
of our growth strategy

•  Score reflects the percentage of Group customer dashboard measures achieving target in 2023

Reducing operational 
carbon emissions
Reported vs 2018/19 baseline. 
Includes Scope 1, Scope 2 and 
Scope 3 carbon emissions. 
Reporting year is October to 
September.

•  A 30.2 per cent reduction has been achieved in 2023 from our 2018/19 baseline. Year on year 

reductions in gas and refrigerants have been delivered, although increases continue to be seen  
in commuting and business travel emissions as colleagues increase their presence in the office 
as part of the new approach to flexible working

•  A downward adjustment to 50 per cent of maximum has been applied to reflect that a significant 

proportion of the 2023 reduction has been driven by external factors including changes in 
government policy and a milder winter compared to the ten year average

•  Metric supports our external commitments to achieve net zero carbon operations by 2030  

and maintain travel emissions below 50 per cent of 2018/2019 levels

Sustainable financing 
and investment1

•  We have continued strong performance with our sustainable finance and investment metric 
across all contributing business lines – Commercial Banking, Consumer Lending Mortgages, 
Consumer Lending Transport and Scottish Widows Investments

•  Our robust performance continues to be driven by the positive uptake of electric vehicles  

and the acquisition of Tusker, along with our expanded product range for EPC A/B properties. 
Our performance was bolstered by Hybrid/EV Clean Growth Finance Initiative transactions and 
Debt Capital Markets activity, along with an increase in sustainable financing, for example across 
solar financing, battery storage and EV charging. Performance of our investments in climate-
aware strategies has been driven by allocations to ESG Property and Group Environmental 
Solutions, as well as into the BlackRock Climate Transition Global Equity Fund

Increasing our gender 
and ethnic representation 
in senior roles

•  We have increased the representation of women within our senior population by  

0.7 percentage points since the end of 2022, moving from 39.4 per cent to 40.1 per cent
•  We have increased the representation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues  

by 1.1 percentage points since the end of 2022, moving from 10.2 per cent to 11.3 per cent

Culture
and colleague
engagement
Our employee engagement 
index score.

•  Our employee engagement index (EEI) encompasses pride and satisfaction working for 

Lloyds Banking Group, and also recommending Lloyds Banking Group as a great place to work
•  Our 2023 EEI score has been impacted by changes to flexible working arrangements, made to 

ensure flexible working is available to all colleagues in moments that matter. Not all colleagues 
welcomed the changes necessary to transform the Group. Despite this our in-year advocacy 
measure is moving in a positive direction

  1 

Includes sustainable finance for: Corporate and Institutional, Business and Commercial Banking clients, EPC A/B mortgage lending (full year estimate based on 
September 2023 actual position), financing for EV and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and Scottish Widows discretionary investment in climate aware strategies.

2021 Long Term Share Plan
A Long Term Share Plan award was granted in relation to 2020 
performance under the terms of the previous Remuneration Policy. 

It is an important feature of the LTSP that performance is 
assessed and appropriately recognised upfront in the award 
size during the ‘pre-grant test’.

A final ‘pre-vest test’ of financial underpins and consideration  
of four key questions takes place prior to vesting to ensure 
performance over the period has been sustainable. The 
Committee has completed the full assessment and there  
is nothing known now which, had it been known at the time  
of grant, would have changed the initial award levels.

Pre-vest test – additional consideration by the Committee

In conjunction with the assessment of performance against the 
financial underpins above, the Remuneration Committee considered 
the four questions below to satisfy itself that there is nothing known 
now which, had it been known at the time of grant, would have 
changed the initial award levels:

Q  Has the bank lived up to its ambition to be the Best Bank 

f
or Customers?

Q  Do the Group’s financial results and capital position adequately 
reflect risk, conduct and any other non-financial considerations, 
including ESG?

Q  Has the Group made meaningful progress in supporting the UK’s 

transition to net zero? 

Q  Has the Group suffered a serious conduct event or has severe 

reputational damage arisen from the Group not living its values?

A  The Group has maintained its strong capital position, strong 
reputation and support for customers and businesses since 
making awards in 2021. Risk management has remained a key 
element in shaping our business model, with a focus on safely 
progressing strategic ambitions whilst supporting customers 
impacted by the rising cost of living.

The Group continues to make meaningful progress against our 
environmental commitments including reducing our operational 
carbon emissions by around 30 per cent from the 2018/19 
baseline, delivering over £40 billion1 in sustainable financing  
and investment since 2022, becoming a founding member of the 
Net Zero Banking Alliance and publishing 10 sector-based 2030 
emissions reduction targets for our most carbon-intensive sectors 
tracked through our system-led transition plans.

The Committee noted in the 2020 pre-grant test that there was 
still work to do towards achieving the Group’s gender and 
diversity goals but felt comfortable that these were reflected in 
stretch targets in the 2021 balanced scorecard. In each 
performance year from 2021 to 2023 we have continued to 
improve our gender and ethnicity representation in senior roles. 
From year-end 2020 we have increased women in senior roles 
from 37 per cent to 40.1 per cent at year-end 2023 and from 
year-end 2020 we have increased Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic 
representation by 47 per cent from 7.7 per cent to 11.3 per cent at 
year-end 2023.

The Committee concluded that performance considered in the 
‘pre-grant test’ has been sustainable and therefore no discretion 
has been applied. The 2021 LTSP awards will vest at 100 per cent, 
as the outcome represents a fair reflection of performance during  
the period.

1 

Includes: Corporate and Institutional, Business and Commercial Banking clients, EPC A/B mortgage lending (cumulative to September 2023),  
financing for EV and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and Scottish Widows discretionary investment in climate aware strategies.

In determining the final vesting outcome of the 2021 Long Term 
Share Plan, the Committee carefully considered alignment 
with shareholder experience and whether adjustments were 
required for windfall gains.

Awards were granted in March 2021 at 39.3015 pence. The  
share price used to calculate indicative value is 43.564 pence  
(page 112). While 10.8 per cent higher, the Committee considers 

it reasonably represents performance over the period. 2021 LTSP 
awards, including the award for the CFO, were reduced by up to 
40 per cent upfront at the time of grant, showing restraint based 
on 2020 Group performance. The GCE did not receive a 2021 LTSP 
award as he was not in role at the time of grant. The Committee 
concluded there was no windfall gain over the period and as such 
no additional adjustment was required.

1  When Charlie Nunn joined the Group on 16 August 2021 as Group Chief Executive and executive director he was granted deferred share awards and deferred 
cash to replace unvested awards from his previous employer, HSBC. Options vested on the 14 March 2023 and were exercised on 21 March 2023. Charlie Nunn 
retained all the shares apart from 586,558 shares which were sold at 48.16 pence to meet income tax and National Insurance contributions withholding 
obligations. The remaining 660,990 shares are subject to holding periods that mirror the shares replaced from HSBC of no hold, six months and  
12 months holds.

2  All GOS and LTSP awards have a three-year performance period ending 31 December. Awards were made in the form of conditional rights to free shares.
3 

LTSP awards (in the form of conditional share awards) in 2023 were made over shares with a value of 150 per cent of salary for Charlie Nunn (3,283,896 shares 
with a value of £1,704,375) and a value of 150 per cent for William Chalmers (2,366,848 shares with a value of £1,228,418). Vesting is subject to underpin 
thresholds applicable for the first three years from grant as detailed on page 121 of the 2022 Directors’ remuneration report. Each year the Remuneration 
Committee will monitor the Group’s progress in relation to the underpins. The share price used to calculate the value is the average price over the five days 
prior to grant (27 February 2023 to 3 March 2023), which was 51.901 pence.

4  The second tranche of the 2021 GPS deferred award vested on 7 March 2023. The closing market price of the Group’s ordinary shares on that date was  

51.360 pence. The award was settled in shares net of tax, with the resulting shares subject to a one-year holding period.

5  Half of the 2022 GPS is deferred into shares (in the form of conditional rights to free shares). The value of the shares awarded in respect of GPS granted in 

March 2023 was £668,911 (1,288,821 shares) for Charlie Nunn; and £344,367 (663,507 shares) for William Chalmers. As the awards represent deferral of awarded 
GPS they are not subject to further performance conditions. The share price used to calculate the value is the average price over the five days prior to grant 
(27 February 2023 to 3 March 2023), which was 51.901 pence.

6  The first tranche of the 2022 GPS award vested on 7 March 2023. The closing market price of the Group’s ordinary shares on that date was 51.360 pence.  

The award was settled in shares net of tax, with the resulting shares subject to a one-year holding period.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Shareholding requirement
Executives are expected to build and maintain a shareholding 
in the Group in direct proportion to their salary in order to align 
their interests to those of shareholders. 

The minimum shareholding requirements applicable to executive 
directors at 31 December 2023 are 350 per cent of salary for the 
GCE and 250 per cent of salary for the CFO.

Under the Policy applicable at 31 December 2023, the GCE has until 
15 August 2026 to meet the requirement of 350 per cent of salary 
and the CFO has until 2 June 2024 to meet the requirement of 
250 per cent of salary (in both cases five years from appointment). 
The CFO has met the requirement of 250 per cent of salary and 
currently holds 467 per cent of salary at 31 December 2023.

In recognition of the increased variable opportunity offered by 
the implementation of the LTIP and to further strengthen alignment 
with shareholders, from 1 January 2024 the shareholding 
requirement applicable to the GCE will increase from 350 per cent 
to 400 per cent of salary and from 250 per cent to 300 per cent 
for the CFO.

Post-employment shareholding requirement
Executive directors are contractually bound to a post-
employment shareholding requirement of two years at a level 
equal to the lower of the shareholding requirements immediately 
prior to departure or the actual shareholding on departure.
The post-employment requirement will be maintained through 
self-certification, with the Committee keeping this approach 
under review.

None of those who were directors at the end of the year had  
any other interest in the capital of Lloyds Banking Group plc  
or its subsidiaries.

As reported in the 2022 Annual Report, following approval at the 2023 AGM, from 1 January 2024 the shareholding requirement applicable to the GCE 
will increase to 400 per cent of salary and to 300 per cent for the other executive directors.

2  Calculated using the average share price for the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 (45.864 pence). Includes ordinary shares, net of tax where 

appropriate, acquired through the vesting of the deferred Group Performance Share plan, Fixed Share Awards as the shares have no performance conditions, 
awards in the form of options which have vested but have not been exercised, unvested performance tested Executive Group Ownership Share awards and 
Long Term Share Plan awards, shares held in the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) Trust, i.e. Free, Partnership, Matching and Dividend shares which are no longer 
subject to forfeiture, as defined in the SIP Rules. Shares held by Person Closely Associated, as defined by the Companies Act, but broadly meaning spouse 
or partner and children, are also included.

3  2022 shareholding has been recalculated using the average share price for the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 (45.864 pence). Salary as at 

31 December 2022 has been used to calculate the percentage.

Non-executive directors may receive more than one of the above fees.

Percentage change in remuneration levels 

The table below sets out the change in the directors’ base salary/fees, taxable benefits and annual bonus compared with the change 
in our UK-based colleagues’ pay. Lloyds Banking Group plc is not an employing entity, and therefore the disclosure below is made on 
a voluntary basis to compare any change with all employees of the wider Group based in the UK. This population has been chosen as 
the majority of our workforce are based in the UK and is considered to be the most appropriate group of employees. The same 
population is used for the purposes of the Chief Executive Officer pay ratio disclosure on page 122 of the report.

Lloyds Banking Group is not a contracting entity but considers all UK-based employees to be appropriate for purposes of an ‘All employees’ calculation.

1 
2  Charlie Nunn became the Group Chief Executive in August 2021. Figures for 2021 have been annualised based on the single total figure table.
3  William Chalmers was the Interim Group Chief Executive from May to August 2021 and received a deputisation payment for this period.
4  No Group Performance Share (bonus) was paid for 2020 performance.
5 

In some instances, non-executive directors may change membership or become the Chair of a Committee during the year, resulting in large year-on-year 
percentage changes in fees.

6  Some non-executive directors have received other benefits that relate to reimbursement for expenses incurred in the course of duties. Reimbursements 

of these expenses do not provide an accurate comparison to benefits received by colleagues and are therefore not included.

7  Cathy Turner was appointed on 1 November 2022. Figures for 2022 have been annualised based on the single total figure table. Cathy was appointed Chair 

of the Remuneration Committee and Senior Independent Director in September 2023.

8  Scott Wheway was appointed on 1 August 2022. Figures for 2022 have been annualised based on the single total figure table.
9  2022 to 2023 variance was impacted by the consolidation of variable pay and Flex cash allowance into base salary as described on page 108.

Lloyds Banking Group has committed to becoming a 
leader in gender diversity. We recognise that companies with 
proportionate gender diversity see increased performance, 
and make better decisions. We are working towards an 
ambition of 50 per cent of senior leadership roles being held 
by women by 2025. At the end of April 2023 we were at 
39.8 per cent, an increase from when we first set our original 
gender goal in 2014 when we were at 28 per cent.

Continued progress has been made in closing the Gender  
Pay Gap, with the gap reducing by 2.6 percentage points to  
26.7 per cent, the largest improvement since we started 
reporting. This improvement demonstrates that our actions 
are moving us in the right direction, however, we remain 
committed to accelerating our progress.

As part of our commitment to Helping Britain Prosper, we 
believe it is essential for us to make an impact beyond our 
organisation. We therefore co-sponsor the FTSE Women 
Leaders review, which has set a target of a minimum of 
40 per cent women on boards and in leadership teams. 
Our ongoing work to improve gender balance in our 
organisation has resulted in us being named in the 2023 
Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fifth consecutive 
year, and in The Times 2023 Top 50 Employers for Gender 
Equality for the 12th consecutive year. 

Further information is available in our pay gap report 

.

We know that diversity of our workforce is important, and 
that representation is a key driver to close the gaps that exist. 
For this reason, we made a public commitment to increase 
Black Heritage representation in senior roles to 3 per cent by 
2025 and increase our overall senior Black, Asian and Minority 
Ethnic representation to 13 per cent by 2025. At the end of April 
2023, 10.5 per cent of senior manager roles were held by Black, 
Asian or Minority Ethnic colleagues, and 1.6 per cent held by 
Black Heritage colleagues.

When it comes to Ethnicity Pay Gap reporting, there is no 
legislative requirement on UK organisations to publish these 
figures. However, for the past three years we have published 
our Ethnicity Pay Gap on a voluntary basis. As a leading UK 
employer, we’ve chosen to publish this data because we 
recognise the importance of transparency in encouraging 
focus and inspiring purposeful, action-led change. It holds  
us accountable, helps us to learn, and we believe will lead  
to positive improvement.

Encouragingly, our disclosure rate has increased from  
85.1 per cent in April 2022 to 88.2 per cent in April 2023  
(of those colleagues who have chosen to disclose their 
ethnicity with us). We’re pleased to see that our overall 
representation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic talent  
has increased. This is due to higher volumes of inclusive 
recruitment and a greater proportion of colleagues sharing 
their ethnicity data with us at the more junior levels of our 
business. This has, however resulted in an increase in our 
ethnicity pay gaps from 4.6 per cent to 5.7 per cent because 
our junior colleagues hold lower paid positions within our 
business. Whilst we have also seen improvements within the 
representation of our senior leadership teams this remains 
lower, affecting our efforts to close the gaps further and 
we recognise we have more to do to achieve this.
