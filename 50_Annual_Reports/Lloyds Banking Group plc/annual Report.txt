Our culture
Throughout 2023, the Board has listened to our people to better 
understand how it feels to work for the Group, the role our culture 
plays and what improvements could be made. While we have 
seen a drop across some of our employee engagement metrics 
in 2023, reflecting uncertainty created by our transformation, 
there continues to be positive feedback about the Group’s  
culture, with our colleagues feeling the Group is inclusive, safe  
and respectful. 

We were pleased to be the first FTSE 100 company to set targets  
to increase both gender and ethnic diversity at senior levels and 
we maintain our commitment to these stretching targets. In 2023, 
the Group also announced an additional target, to double the 
representation of senior colleagues with disabilities, the first 
public commitment of its kind to be launched by a UK bank. 

Directors
I would like to thank Alan Dickinson and Lord Lupton, who will  
both retire at the 2024 annual general meeting, for the significant 
contributions that they have made over many years. I am pleased 
to report that Nathan Bostock will be appointed as a non-
executive director of the Group and, subject to regulatory 
approval, Chair of Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, in each 
case with effect from 1 August 2024. Read more on Board changes 
on page 72.

We aim to ensure that the composition of the Board represents  
a diverse mix of experiences and backgrounds, enhancing the 
quality of Board deliberations and decisions. I am pleased to  
say that we meet the FTSE Women Leaders and Parker Review 
recommendations. 

Remuneration 
Our approach to remuneration aims to provide a clear link to 
delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives whilst delivering 
higher, more sustainable returns for our shareholders. We have 
also carefully considered how best to support our colleagues. 
In 2023, we announced a two-year pay proposal for 2024 and 
2025 to provide greater certainty to our colleagues. In light of 
the immediate cost of living challenges, there has also been an 
additional cash award for c.44,000 colleagues to support our 
most junior colleagues. We believe our reward package is fair  
and competitive. More information can be found in the directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 108 to 132. 

Summary
I am immensely proud of how Lloyds Banking Group colleagues 
have supported our customers and made a positive contribution 
across our communities, while setting about the change we  
need for our long-term success. I am confident that the Group’s 
purpose, customer focus and unique business model, alongside 
our continued strategic delivery will ensure the Group can deliver 
higher, more sustainable returns for our shareholders, alongside 
serving the interests of our broader stakeholders.

   Sir Robin Budenberg, 

  Chair

Chair’s statement

Helping Britain 
Prosper provides 
us with a great 
opportunity for 
future success

Overview
As a financial services provider with more than 27 million 
customers, we have a financial relationship with over half of all 
adults in the UK and a strong presence in communities around 
the country. We play an integral role in the UK financial system 
and are in a unique position to deliver on our purpose of Helping 
Britain Prosper, whilst delivering long-term, sustainable returns for 
our shareholders. During 2023, our purpose has been more visible 
in our actions than ever before. We remain focused on helping 
people and businesses finance their ambitions and grow whilst 
proactively supporting our customers, colleagues and society  
to navigate the current environment. 

Shareholder returns
Generating strong and sustainable earnings in the long-term is 
imperative. We have made good progress on our strategy, whilst 
continuing to deliver a robust financial performance in 2023.  
We continue to feel that our share price does not fully reflect  
the financial performance and outlook of the Group.

The Board recognises the importance of returns for our shareholders 
both through share price appreciation and capital returns. I am 
pleased to announce that the Board has recommended a total 
ordinary dividend of 2.76 pence per share for 2023, an increase  
of 15 per cent on 2022, in line with our progressive and sustainable 
dividend policy. The Board has also announced its intention to 
implement an ordinary share buyback of up to £2.0 billion in 2024. 
Implementation of the buyback helps us grow dividend per share  
in future periods. Based on the total ordinary dividend and the 
intended ordinary share buyback, the total capital return for 2023 
equates to £3.8 billion. The mix of capital return between dividends 
and buybacks aims to meet the needs of all shareholders.

Our purpose and strategy
While the external environment remains uncertain, our ambitious 
strategy announced in February 2022 remains the right one, 
underpinned by a strengthened connection between our 
strategic goals, clear financial targets, purpose and culture.  
I am pleased with the Group’s strategic achievements in 2023.  
Our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper means addressing social 
issues impacting our customers, investing in regional productivity 
and creating long-term, sustainable growth for the country. 
Building an inclusive and sustainable future is at the heart of this. 

While more progress needs to be made on the transition  
to net zero, our progress will create significant opportunities  
for the Group, enabling us to share the benefits with all of our 
stakeholders. During 2023, the Group partnered with the charity 
Crisis to call for one million more social homes to be built over  
the next decade. Safe, affordable and sustainable homes are a 
fundamental human need and an important part of supporting 
the transition in a way that is fair and inclusive.

Governance in action

Overview
Effective stakeholder engagement is fundamental to good 
governance. Stakeholder engagement takes place at all levels 
within the Group and is an important part of how we are 
delivering on our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. The Board 
continues to engage both directly and indirectly with many of 
its stakeholders. This engagement helps to provide a better 
understanding of stakeholders’ points of view and the impact 
the Group has on their day-to-day lives. Read more about 
the engagement of Board members with stakeholders on 
pages 82 and 83. 

The Board requires stakeholder implications to be considered 
by senior management in all proposals submitted to the Board 
from across the Group, both within the papers and as part of 
the accompanying presentations. 

Senior management routinely provides the Board with details 
of stakeholder interaction and feedback through their regular 
business updates and in their interactions both inside and 
outside of the board room. Managing stakeholder interests 
also forms a key part of the Board’s delegation of the day-to-
day management of the business to senior management.

Throughout 2023 the Board’s key stakeholders remained the 
same as they were in 2022.

Cost of living

Stakeholder impact

The rising cost of living, including high levels of inflation and higher 
interest rates, was a key area of concern for many customers, clients 
and colleagues during 2023. The Board continued to consider the 
impacts upon these stakeholders, including the impacts on the 
Group’s mortgage customers and clients with lending facilities and 
the action being taken to provide them with the necessary support.

This section (pages 03 to 05) is our Section 172(1) statement for 
the purposes of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), describing 
how the directors have had regard to the matters set out in 
section 172(1) (a) to (f) of the Act when performing their duty to 
promote the success of the Company under section 172. Further 
detail on key stakeholder interaction is also contained within the 
directors’ report on pages 82 to 83.

The directors remain mindful in all their deliberations of the 
long-term consequences of their decisions, as well as the 
importance of the Group maintaining a reputation for high 
standards of business conduct and the Board engaging with, 
and taking account of the views of, key stakeholders. 

The five key Board decisions outlined in this section (cost of living, 
Consumer Duty, Senior Independent Director appointment, the 
Tusker acquisition and environmental sustainability) evidence 
how the Board is engaged in key decisions. 

The Group’s support to customers and clients has been driven  
by our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper and has evolved as  
the Board and the Group have sought to better understand the 
varying impacts of the rise in the cost of living. The support 
provided included the offer of interest free overdraft facilities in 
certain circumstances, facilitating specialist third party support 
and forbearance options.

The Board was keen that particular support be provided to our 
mortgage, business and corporate clients. There has been a 
number of tailored means of assistance developed accordingly, 
with the understanding that the right support will help these 
customers become more financially resilient in the long-term, 
which is good for the business. This included the Group’s 
participation in the Government-led Mortgage Charter,  
a sector-wide initiative to support those struggling with  
mortgage repayments.

The Board was also very aware of the feedback from colleagues 
on the impact of the current cost of living pressures on their 
personal finances. In order to provide colleagues with greater 
certainty while the economic environment remains uncertain, the 
Board was pleased to support the Group’s commitment to a two 
year pay deal. This provided guaranteed minimum pay awards in 
2024 and 2025 for the majority of our colleagues. In addition, we 
had a particular focus on colleagues in more junior roles who also 
received a further ad hoc cash award in December 2023.

The Board will continue to monitor the challenges which the rising 
cost of living causes our stakeholders as the Group continues  
to work with our regulators and our peers to ensure the most 
appropriate support can be provided to customers, clients  
and colleagues.

Consumer 
Duty 

Stakeholder impact

The Board and its Board Risk Committee supported the Group 
in working towards the introduction in July 2023 of the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s (FCA) new Consumer Duty requirements. 
In doing so, the Board acknowledged the strong alignment 
between the Group’s purpose, values and existing customer-
centric approach and the regulator’s ambition to assist 
customers in achieving their financial objectives, while 
preventing customer harm.

The Board received several updates during the year on 
progress with meeting the regulator’s requirements. This 
included reviewing the regulator’s feedback and the steps 
taken by senior management in fully embedding the 
approach and ensuring improved customer outcomes. 

The Board was mindful of the scale of the programme of  
work and the resulting risks to delivery and considered the 
approach to potential actions to mitigate those risks. The 
Board was pleased with the Group’s successful delivery of the 
initial stages of the programme. The Board also considered 
the approach the Group would take as the programme moves 
into its second implementation period ending in July 2024 and 
also the approach which would be taken to ensure that focus 
remains strong in this area as it transitions into ‘business as 
usual’, which will be supported by the Group’s strong focus on 
purpose. The Board will continue to be updated on progress 
prior to July 2024.

Senior 
Independent 
Director 
appointment

Stakeholder impact

The Board started a search for a successor to Alan Dickinson in the 
role of Senior Independent Director in early 2023. In doing so the 
Board was mindful of its obligations to, and the needs of, the Group’s 
external stakeholders and its ambitions to build an organisation truly 
driven by Helping Britain Prosper when making the decision for this 
important role.

The appointment process was led by the Chair, with input from  
the wider Board and the support of the Board’s Nomination and 
Governance Committee. The suitability of candidates was 
considered against agreed criteria, including the range of skills and 
prior related experience potential candidates would bring. A final 
recommendation was then made to the Board for its agreement. 

After an extensive review of both external and internal candidates, 
the decision was made for Cathy Turner to succeed Alan Dickinson 
in the role of Senior Independent Director. In doing so the Board 
recognised Cathy’s broad ranging executive and non-executive 
experience. This included her extensive experience in dealing with 
investors and with the sometimes competing interests of a variety  
of stakeholder groups. 

The Board agreed that Cathy would provide invaluable support  
to the Chair and undertake the other aspects of the role to a  
high standard.

Building a more sustainable future is a core part of our purpose-
driven strategy and how we are Helping Britain Prosper. It is a key 
source of opportunity for the Group as well as risk management.  
As such, the Board has considered the importance of the Group’s 
commitments to net zero, including both our emissions reduction 
targets and our role as a member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance. 
The Board received regular updates on the progress made in all 
areas related to our sustainability ambitions and has provided 
valuable challenge as we work towards meeting our commitments. 

The Board is keenly aware of the importance of the Group’s own 
ambitions as we support our customers and our clients through  
their transitions to net zero and the vital link this represents to 
delivering on the Group’s climate ambitions. The Board has therefore 
encouraged further action to fully embed climate considerations 
into all of the Group’s decision making, recognising the breadth of 
the action which needs to be taken and the importance of moving 
from target setting to action at scale. This recognises that there are 
many growth opportunities in helping our customers and clients 
transition to a net zero economy, while future-proofing our  
balance sheet.

The Board has encouraged clarity in the role that all areas of  
the Group will take as we transition to net zero. This has included 
ensuring cross-Group capabilities are fully utilised and emphasising 
the importance which bold decision making will play. In doing so the 
Board recognises the particularly important role which financial 
services organisations will take in supporting low carbon ambitions, 
including in key areas such as the housing and transport markets.

The Board is very aware of the challenges and risks to delivering  
on our commitments and has considered these throughout the 
course of the year. Further detail of the role of the Board in this area 
can be found in the report of its Responsible Business Committee  
on page 107.

Tusker  
acquisition

Stakeholder impact

The Group’s strategy is principally organic however the Board 
and senior management will always keep under review 
inorganic opportunities which can deliver sustainable profit  
and growth for the Group in strategically consistent areas while 
supporting our purpose. In early 2023 the opportunity to acquire 
Tusker, a business providing salary sacrifice car schemes for 
ultra-low emission vehicles, was presented to the Board. 

The Group is committed to helping Britain build a more 
sustainable society. The Board therefore considered how the 
acquisition would align with the Group’s existing business at 
acceptable risk and enable the Group to offer a bespoke 
product to its commercial clients to support those clients in their 
own transitions to net zero. The acquisition would also support 
the Group’s ambitions to achieve its net zero emissions targets 
by 2050 or sooner through promotion of the use of electric and 
ultra-low emission vehicles as well as its growth ambitions for 
financing of electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

From an investor perspective, the Board considered a number  
of factors, including how Tusker was positioned for growth, the 
projected return on the Group’s investment and the potential 
synergies with the Group’s existing business, including supplier 
relationships. Other stakeholder considerations included the 
Group’s regulators, with the FCA and Prudential Regulation 
Authority briefed in advance of the transaction.

The Board was pleased to support the transaction and provided 
final approval with the acquisition being announced on 
22 February 2023.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Group Chief Executive’s review

Robust 
performance  
in a challenging 
environment

2023 was an important year for our Group. We continued to 
deliver on our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, supporting  
both our customers and shareholders. We are seeing real 
evidence of strategic progress as we transform the business  
and have increased confidence in delivering the 2024 and 2026 
strategic commitments. Our purpose-driven strategy is helping 
people and businesses across the UK finance their ambitions  
and grow whilst enabling us to build a more sustainable and 
inclusive business. This progress has been underpinned by 
continued strategic investment and contributed to a financial 
performance that has driven strong capital generation and 
increased shareholder distributions.

The Group delivered a robust financial performance in 2023, 
meeting our guidance. Income growth has been supported by  
a higher banking net interest margin and good momentum in 
underlying other income. We continued to manage costs tightly 
despite ongoing inflationary pressures. Asset quality remained 
strong. As a result, we delivered strong capital generation, 
enabling the Board to recommend a final ordinary dividend of 
1.84 pence per share, implying a total dividend for the year of  
2.76 pence. This is 15 per cent up year-on-year and in line with  
our progressive and sustainable dividend policy. In addition,  
the Group has announced a share buyback programme of up  
to £2.0 billion. In combination, this is a total capital return of up to 
£3.8 billion, or c.14 per cent of the Group’s market capitalisation.

With continued cost of living pressures we know that 2023 was 
challenging for many. We were proactive in providing support.  
By using data and insights to gain a deeper understanding of 
customer needs, we contacted 7.5 million customers and around 
600,000 businesses to help with their financial resilience. 
Alongside, we contacted more than 15 million deposit customers 
to ensure they are aware of their savings options, supported  
by our enhanced propositions, including attractive rates and 
products. We also recognise the importance of supporting our 
colleagues. We have agreed a two-year pay deal and paid an 
additional cash award to around 44,000 colleagues. This is 
alongside refreshed flexible working policies that balance the 
needs of our people and the strategic aims of the Group.

We remain fully focused 
on supporting customers, 
whilst delivering strong 
strategic progress and 
sustainable returns, guided  
by our purpose of Helping 
Britain Prosper.

Robust financial performance,  
in line with guidance
Statutory profit after tax was £5.5 billion. The significant  
year-on-year increase was because of both robust 2023 
performance and in particular a 2022 restatement in line with IFRS 
17 accounting changes. Strong net income of £17.9 billion was up  
3 per cent, driven by a higher banking net interest margin in line 
with guidance and 10 per cent growth in underlying other income, 
offset by higher operating lease depreciation. Operating costs of 
£9.1 billion increased in line with guidance, reflecting higher 
planned strategic investment, severance charges, new 
businesses and inflationary pressures. Remediation increased to 
£675 million and included a £450 million provision for the potential 
impact of the recently announced FCA review into historical motor 
finance commission arrangements. This charge includes 
estimates for costs and potential redress. There remains 
significant uncertainty as to the extent of any misconduct and 
customer loss, if any, the nature of any remediation action, if 
required, and its timing. Hence the impact could materially differ 
from the provision, both higher or lower. We saw strong asset 
quality with credit performance across portfolios broadly at or 
favourable to pre-pandemic levels. The impairment charge of 
£308 million includes a significant write-back and improved 
economic assumptions. Excluding these the asset quality ratio 
was 29 basis points, still in line with our guidance.

The Group’s balance sheet was resilient in the face of a 
challenging operating environment. Excluding the impact  
of securitisations, loans and advances were flat. Within the 
mortgage book strong customer retention in fixed products was 
more than offset by continued roll-off from reversionary products. 

There was also growth in unsecured Retail lending and Motor 
Finance. The Group saw growth of over 12 per cent in assets  
under administration within Insurance, Pensions and Investments, 
including £5.1 billion of net new money. Customer deposits 
decreased £3.9 billion to £471.4 billion, although were largely 
stable in the second half of the year. Retail deposits were down 
£2.4 billion, which included an £11.3 billion reduction in Retail 
current accounts, and a £12.4 billion increase in Retail savings 
balances supported by an enhanced savings proposition and 
proactive customer communications. In Commercial Banking, 
deposits were 1 per cent lower at £162.8 billion, reflecting targeted 
growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking offset by  
a reduction in Small and Medium Businesses.

Delivery of our purpose-driven strategy
We have a clear strategic vision to become a customer-focused 
digital leader and integrated financial services provider able to 
capitalise on new opportunities at scale. Our strategy is purpose-
driven, with a clear focus on areas where we can profitably grow 
and make the greatest impact in Helping Britain Prosper in a 
sustainable and inclusive way. We believe our day-to-day 
business activities that are helping customers finance their 
ambitions and growth are underpinned by our purpose. In that 
context, we also have particular initiatives that highlight the 
alignment of purpose and strategy.

In 2023, we launched a partnership with Crisis, the national charity 
for people experiencing homelessness. This is a hugely important 
cause for us given our business focus and unique ability to enact 
change. We have launched a cross-industry initiative to back our 
joint call for 1 million additional social and affordable homes. 
Since 2018 we have supported more than £17 billion of new 
funding to the social housing sector, including £2.7 billion in 2023. 
We are also aware of the importance of creating a fully inclusive 
organisation within our Group that is representative of modern-
day Britain. We have pledged to double the representation of 
senior colleagues with disabilities by 2025, in addition to our 
existing significant commitments on gender and race.

Key examples on our 
social and environmental 
progress have been 
highlighted throughout 
this report with more 
detailed information  
in our supplementary 
sustainability report 
.

Our strong 
commitment 
to sustainability

Lloyds Banking Group is committed to Helping 
Britain Prosper by identifying profitable solutions  
to building a more inclusive and sustainable  
future for people and businesses in the UK. 

We believe that focusing on our purpose and  
doing right by our customers, colleagues and 
communities will help us identify new areas of 
growth, build a more resilient and profitable 
business and deliver higher, more sustainable 
returns for shareholders.

Group Chief Executive’s review continued

In December, I joined global businesses and policy makers at  
COP 28 to discuss how to accelerate the environmental transition. 
Reaching net zero relies on government, industry and society 
acting together with certainty, pace and focus. We are realistic 
that insufficient progress in policy commitments will limit the 
Group’s ability to achieve the net zero ambitions to which we 
remain committed. 

We have made significant headway on our sustainability  
agenda in 2023, in particular exceeding our target for £15 billion  
of sustainable financing within our Corporate and Institutional 
Banking franchise, originally set for the end of 2024. We are 
continuing to challenge ourselves and have set a new 
Commercial Banking target of £30 billion of sustainable financing 
for 2024 to 2026, which will take the cumulative total within the 
division to £45 billion by 2026. This is alongside new emissions 
reduction targets for Commercial and Residential Real Estate, 
Road Passenger Transport and Agriculture lending.

Within our Retail business we have continued to support 
customers in reducing their emissions by growing our low carbon 
transport business through the acquisition of Tusker. We now 
finance 1 in 8 ultra low emission vehicles on UK roads. We have 
also launched a solar panel proposition with Effective Home to 
expand our home retrofitting ecosystem. 

We increasingly recognise the need to expand our sustainability 
strategy to broader environmental goals and have launched our 
first pledge to halt and reverse nature losses in our own green 
spaces. Overall, our sustainability strategy represents a  
significant strategic and commercial opportunity, consistent  
with our purpose. 

Stepping back, in the context of a fast changing external 
environment, it is clear that our purpose-driven strategy remains 
the right one. By focusing on Helping Britain Prosper we can 
deliver our strategic goals and produce higher, more sustainable 
returns to the benefit of all of our stakeholders. To achieve this,  
we are investing significantly in the transformation of the 
business. In February 2022 we committed to £3 billion of 
incremental investment in the three years to 2024 and  
£4 billion to 2026. 

During 2023, the Group invested a further £1.3 billion as part of this 
plan and delivered tangible growth and cost outcomes that leave 
us well placed to meet our 2024 and 2026 financial commitments. 
We have started to demonstrate this successful execution to the 
market with two strategic seminars last year and two further 
seminars planned in the first half of 2024 as we continue to build 
confidence around our progress.

Driving revenue growth and diversification
Around two-thirds of our strategic investment is weighted towards 
growth and our ambition to generate c.£0.7 billion of additional 
revenues by 2024 and c.£1.5 billion by 2026. The Consumer 
business will deliver approximately 30 per cent of these 
incremental revenues and, as shown in the seminar in October, 
we are making strong progress in deepening and innovating 
within this business. We are the UK’s largest digital bank, and now 
have 21.5 million digitally active users, up 17 per cent since 2021 
and significantly exceeding our 2024 target of more than 10 per 
cent growth. This creates significant opportunities to deepen our 
customer relationships using data and insights. For example, we 
have personalised our communications to make them more 
targeted, with 18 million customers registered for marketing. We 
have also launched new propositions such as our mobile-first 
home onboarding journey and our home ecosystem, both of 
which are improving our retention of customers and our ability  
to offer complementary products such as protection insurance.

In 2023 we completed our acquisition of Tusker, a stand-out 
business in the salary sacrifice market for predominantly 
ultra-low emission vehicles helping us both meet our net zero 
ambitions and deliver capability and growth in an area in which 
we were underweight. Tusker has already grown its fleet by 
around 60 per cent since acquisition. 

We have made good progress on our mass affluent business in 
2023, launching ‘Lloyds Bank 360’, a mobile-first proposition that 
includes a holistic view of wealth, educational materials and 
financial coaching. In addition, we launched Ready-Made 
Investments, a proposition made possible through Embark, which 
we acquired in 2022. The mass affluent customer base continues 
to grow, now at more than 2.5 million customers, from just over  
2 million at the end of 2021.

From a Commercial Banking perspective we continue to 
transform the business to help companies finance their growth 
and navigate an increasingly tough environment. Within our 
Small and Medium Businesses franchise we have made 
significant strides in our multi-year journey to build a front-to-
back digital business, including mobile-first onboarding and 
personalised cash flow insights. We are continuing to deliver 
targeted growth in our Corporate and Institutional Banking 
business through serving additional client needs, particularly 
by extending our competitive advantage in transaction banking, 
and expanding our institutional footprint. This has helped deliver 
more than 20 per cent growth in Corporate and Institutional 
Banking underlying other income since full year 2021 as we build 
momentum with sustainable and capital efficient growth.

Investing in efficiency and enablers to improve delivery
Strengthening cost and capital efficiency in the context of 
growing and diversifying our revenues is crucial. We have guided 
to c.£1.2 billion of gross cost savings by 2024, an increase from  
the original £1 billion as we look to mitigate inflationary pressures. 
In 2026 we are targeting a below 50 per cent cost:income ratio. 
We have made strong progress against our 2024 cost saving 
target, and have now realised around 60 per cent of the savings. 
This has been achieved through continued investment in digital 
solutions and improving cost-to-serve by, for example, reducing 
our office footprint by more than 20 per cent since the end  
of 2021 and optimising our branch footprint. This active cost 
management is helping us deliver our guided cost outcomes 
at a time of heightened inflationary pressure.

In respect of capital efficiency we have continued to demonstrate 
risk-weighted assets discipline and careful balance sheet 
management whilst pursuing new growth opportunities through 
investments in capital-lite and fee generating business. We are 
also reducing the claims on our use of capital, including for 
example eliminating our pension deficit, with no further deficit 
contributions in this triennial period.

We are investing in maximising the potential of people, technology 
and data, the key enablers of our strategy. Investing in the talent, 
skills and capabilities needed for long-term growth is critical. 

We have made more than 2,500 new hires in technology and  
data roles in 2023 and we have completed a senior leadership 
development programme centred around the organisational 
shifts we need in order to successfully execute our strategy. We 
are transforming our change process in the pursuit of increased 
efficiency and responsiveness. Since the start of our strategy,  
we have decommissioned more than 400 legacy technology 
applications and more than doubled the number of APIs we have 
created as we continue to migrate onto cloud-based platforms.

In conclusion, our purpose-driven strategy and strong business 
model ensures that we can continue to support customers and 
achieve our societal and strategic goals whilst delivering against 
our financial targets. We are successfully transforming the bank 
and will thereby continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders.

Grow with purpose
Our colleagues are fundamental to the delivery of the Group’s 
growth strategy which includes our ambition to be a purpose-
driven business. 

We recognise our culture is a fundamental enabler. Throughout 
the year, we have been further embedding our purpose and 
values across the organisation, helping colleagues understand 
how our values guide not only the way we work together, but 
also how we make decisions.

In 2023, we completed a senior leadership development 
programme centred around the organisational shifts we need 
to make to Grow with Purpose. 340 leaders were brought 
together in sessions throughout the year, and immersed in our 
purpose, strategy and behaviours that we need to role model, 
setting clear expectations of our senior leadership population.

In driving the change, senior leaders are supported by a 
movement of more than 6,300 Catalysts across the business. 
These changemakers role model our values and purpose, share 
stories and drive improvements by challenging the status quo.

2024 guidance
We are progressing well towards our ambition of generating 
higher, more sustainable returns for shareholders and are on 
track to achieve our 2024 strategic financial outcomes. Based  
on our current macroeconomic assumptions the Group expects: 
•  Banking net interest margin of greater than 290 basis points
•  Operating costs c.£9.3 billion
•  Asset quality ratio of less than 30 basis points
•  Return on tangible equity c.13 per cent
•  Capital generation of c.175 basis points
•  To pay down to a CET1 ratio of c.13.5 per cent 

2026 guidance
Based on the expected macroeconomic environment 
and confidence in our strategy, the Group is maintaining 
its medium-term guidance for 2026:
•  Cost:income ratio of less than 50 per cent
•  Return on tangible equity of greater than 15 per cent
•  Capital generation of greater than 200 basis points

The Board continually reviews the appropriate level of ongoing 
capital to hold. Based on regulatory, economic and business 
considerations, the Group now expects to pay down to  
c.13.0 per cent by the end of 2026.

Our external environment

Economy

•  Given our focus on UK customers, 
the Group’s prospects are closely 
linked to developments in the  
UK economy 

Market context
The UK economy saw modest but resilient performance in 2023, 
with initial estimates indicating growth of 0.1 per cent. This was 
despite a large increase in interest rates intended to prevent 
elevated inflation becoming an entrenched problem after the 
surge in global energy and food prices caused in large part by 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Two elements were key to this 
resilience – government support to households, via an energy 
price cap, credits to energy accounts and ‘cost of living’ 
payments to lower-income households; and an unusually tight 
labour market after the pandemic, which enabled pay growth  
to accelerate to broadly match inflation.

While inflation fell rapidly in the second half of 2023, the cost of 
living squeeze is still ongoing. Energy prices are still around 50 per 
cent higher than 2021, and food prices broadly 30 per cent higher. 
As the UK imports a significant proportion of both, these cost 
increases reduce UK spending power by around 3 per cent. 
Government support protected households from some of the 
impact across 2022 and 2023, but this is not planned to continue 
through 2024. The reduction in living standards has been spread 
out to make it more manageable but with further impact to come. 
Also, interest rate rises to date have not yet had their full impact, 
with many households yet to refinance fixed-rate mortgages  
at higher rates.

The UK economy in 2024 is thus expected to echo its 2023  
growth performance. GDP growth is likely to remain subdued,  
the unemployment rate is likely to continue drifting upwards  
by around 1 percentage point, and house prices are expected to 
edge downwards by around 2 per cent. Inflation should continue  
to fall, returning much closer to its target level of 2 per cent than 
its 7 per cent average of 2023, allowing the Bank of England to 
start reducing Bank Rate during the year. There are, of course, 
significant risks to this view, not least via consequences of any 
escalation of wars in Ukraine or the Middle East.

Weak economic growth and high interest rates in 2023 translated 
into subdued growth in our key markets. Housing transactions 
were around 14 per cent lower than normal levels, and mortgage  
and household deposit balances broadly flat. Consumer credit 
balances have only partially recovered their fall during the 
pandemic. SMEs continued to pay down debt after the large 
increase under the government-guarantee schemes during the 
pandemic, so non-financial companies’ deposits declined for  
a second year. Financial companies’ deposits also declined, as 
they purchased gilts sold by the Bank of England as it reverses 
‘quantitative easing’ undertaken during the pandemic. Growth  
in our markets in 2024 is expected to follow these trends, albeit 
slightly improved. 

Our response
Given our UK focus, the Group’s prospects are closely linked to  
the performance of the UK economy. Despite this, our business 
model and strategy, in particular the strength and resilience of 
our customer franchise, balance sheet and prudent approach  
to risk, position us well. 

In line with our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper and a clear 
customer focus, we are helping people and businesses finance 
their ambitions and growth whilst proactively providing support 
to those most affected by changes to the economic environment. 

In addition to revenue benefits from higher interest rates, our 
strategy and transformation will deliver growth and diversification, 
even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, 
improving the sustainability of returns. At the same time, we are 
accelerating efficiency measures to offset inflationary pressures 
on our cost base, consistent with our ongoing discipline in  
this area.

Customers

•  Customers and clients continue to  
feel the impact of higher inflation  
and interest rates 

•  Use of digital services is high in 

financial services, reflecting the 
broader shift to digital across 
daily life

Market context
Our customers and clients continue to be affected by the cost  
of living pressures, with higher interest rates feeding through to 
households’ and businesses’ finances. Despite falling inflation, 
these challenges will continue to be a factor in the coming year, 
with many customers refinancing fixed rate mortgages into  
a higher rate environment. Customers are adapting to these 
changes and we continue to support our customers’ and  
clients’ financial resilience. 

Use of digital services and platforms remains high in financial 
services context, responding to customers’ underlying needs  
for convenient and personalised experiences. Customers’ 
expectation of seamless, simple and relevant digital financial 
services continues to be set by their experiences from across  
their lives. Customers’ underlying focus on good service and  
value is reflected in changes in deposit behaviour, which has  
seen a movement from current accounts to higher yielding  
term deposits as customers seek greater returns. 

Our response
We continue to support our customers enabling them to invest 
and grow. We have proactively contacted 7.5 million customers 
most in need of support since April 2022. We have also contacted 
more than 15 million savings customers to inform them about 
their savings options. We have also innovated our product 
offering with limited withdrawal products, which balances 
customers’ desire for greater returns with flexibility in accessing 
funds should they need it. Given our market presence and the 
financing opportunities available, we continue to develop our 
propositions to support customers in managing their finances 
and our Your Credit Score feature has seen 3.2 million new 
customers, to reach 8.8 million customers registered. 

Our strategy seeks to respond to customers’ growing digital 
preferences and maintain our position as the UK’s largest digital 
bank, serving our 21.5 million digital active users. Recognising the 
importance of customer engagement and satisfaction, we will 
trial new branch formats (such as kiosks) during the coming  
year to enable more efficient and flexible points of presence to 
continue to serve our customers. Furthermore, we have made 
significant progress in digitising our SME business, for example 
launching a new digital invoice finance platform.

Society and 
environment

•  With complex environmental and societal 
issues, companies are expected to play an 
increased role in supporting the country  
and its people

•  Our focus on Helping Britain Prosper enables 
us to deliver value for all stakeholders and 
sustainable returns for shareholders

Market context
The UK economic environment has implications on society and 
people’s lives, including the ability to access quality housing amid 
rising rates and living costs. To deliver across diverse stakeholder 
needs, it remains critical for organisations to be representative  
of modern-day Britain, and create an inclusive environment. 
Alongside, the UK continues to focus on climate change and the 
integrated approach to sustainability, moving beyond climate 
and recognising the importance of nature and biodiversity.  
There is continued regulatory focus on the impact of climate risk, 
demonstrating progress through understandable, relevant and 
reliable sustainability disclosures. 

Our response
Creating an inclusive and sustainable future is core to our 
purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. Building on our scale and 
position in recognising the sustainable financing opportunities, 
we are aiming to make a meaningful and positive difference  
for our stakeholders and through this deliver profitable growth 
and long-term value for our shareholders. We are focused on 
supporting our customers in building financial resilience, 
enhancing digital capabilities and strengthening the growth  
in our customer propositions. Given our UK housing market 
presence, we have the capabilities and external relationships  
to drive positive change and support the growth in delivering 
sustainable quality housing. 

Our success is dependent on our colleagues and how we 
represent communities we serve. Continued progress against  
our diversity targets allows us to create more inclusive products, 
services and solutions. Environmental sustainability is 
fundamental to our purpose. We have set three new targets for 
our agriculture, commercial and residential real estate and road 
passenger transport portfolios, complementing our existing 
sector targets to better assess the risk to our business. We are 
actively working with clients through our new credible transition 
plan initiative and have launched the Group’s first sustainable 
financing framework to support our growth in sustainable lending.

Our external environment continued

Technology 
and data

•  New technologies enable improvement  

to business models and financial  
services infrastructure 

•  Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)  
is rapidly advancing and is beginning 
to be deployed across a range of use cases

•  The need to modernise our technology 

remains important to reduce cost, increase 
agility and get the full customer and 
commercial benefits of our data assets

Market context
New technologies enable changes to the business models and 
infrastructure of the financial system, posing both opportunities 
and challenges for banks. Customers and clients are able to 
interact with platforms that have financial services embedded 
within them, with new technology intermediaries such as 
payments providers connecting these customer interfaces  
with banking providers. 

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has developed at  
rapid pace over the year and has seen rising prominence.  
Firms across industries are seeking to deploy GenAI to realise 
potential customer experience improvements and productivity 
efficiencies. There is also a continuing debate about the risks 
that development of GenAI poses, with high relevance to financial 
services, for example through new types of customer fraud. 

In the longer term, technologies such as tokenisation and 
distributed ledgers could reshape the core activities of banks, 
including activities in storing and transferring value. These 
technologies are beginning to see greater use within the  
existing financial system. This is primarily in capital markets, for 
example through digital bond issuance and more efficient repo 
transactions. Furthermore, the Bank of England, alongside other 
central banks, continues to explore development of a digital 
currency, which could have implications for the financial system. 

Our response
We are investing in our consumer mobile app and will launch 
an enhanced version in 2024. This will provide improved customer 
experience with interactive tools, personalised insights and 
conversational prompts. We continue to develop value adding 
services around our core strengths. For example, our home 
ecosystem has seen strong customer usage and we are targeting 
10 per cent growth in active users as we continue to build out 
functionality. In parallel, in responding to the changing ways  
in which our products reach our customers, we will launch an 
embedded lending proposition in partnership with NewDay. We 
continue our multi-year journey to build a front-to-back digital 
franchise for our SME business, improving client experience with 
enhanced app functionality.

We continue to invest in the technology transformation of our 
business to fully realise the value of our customer data assets  
and improve organisational agility. For example, since full year 
2021, we have decommissioned more than 10 per cent of legacy 
applications. Continued investment has realised business and 
customer benefits, with interactions with our enhanced mobile 
messaging service more than doubling to 6 million. Further, as 
technology evolves we are engaging with the Bank of England  
as it explores the development of digital currencies.

Competitors

•  We operate in evolving, competitive  
markets across our business units

•  The interest rate environment is  
changing competitive dynamics

•  New peers are broadening propositions  

and expanding across geographies

Regulation

•  The UK financial services sector 
is expected to remain highly 
regulated

•   New regulation and market 

reviews continue to be issued, 
with further regulatory changes 
anticipated

Market context
The UK financial services sector is highly competitive. Regulation, 
new technologies and customer adoption of digital has 
supported the development of new competitors and business 
models in recent years. Competition with traditional incumbent 
banks remains high. Higher interest rates has spurred significant 
competition in deposits and current account switching as 
customers and clients seek better returns, and mortgages 
competition remains elevated given the smaller market. 

New and increasingly profitable neo banks, serving both retail and 
small business clients, continue to broaden their propositions and 
scale across markets, including international banks growing their  
UK presence. 

The growth in digital platforms presents new opportunities for 
accessing customers outside of the traditional financial services 
journeys, spanning both consumer and business segments. 
Regulations such as Open Banking are enabling new providers, 
including the Big Tech firms, to integrate financial services into  
their own digital services, providing customers with convenience 
and new distribution channels.

Our response
We continue to invest to deepen and innovate in Consumer,  
with 21.5 million digitally active users and strong participation in 
intermediary led markets. Our strong foundations of customer 
relationships, combined with innovation, enable us to meet a 
broader range of customer needs, in particular growing in higher 
value segments by creating a new mass affluent offering. For 
example, during the year we launched ready-made investments 
through Embark, offering customers simple and affordable 
investments. We have evolved our products and pricing in 
deposits, resulting in more customers trusting us with their 
savings and balances increasing in the year. 

In our SME business, we are focused on diversifying and digitising  
our business front-to-back. For example, we have launched a 
mobile-first onboarding journey for sole traders and limited 
companies that has reduced account opening time by up to  
15 times. Furthermore, new payments solutions have supported 
more than 20 per cent growth in new merchant services clients. 

Disciplined sector focus and enhancements to our Corporate and 
Institutional business’ Lending, Transaction Banking and Markets 
propositions have strengthened our competitive positioning and  
we have grown underlying other income by more than 20 per cent 
since full year 2021. We are focused on connecting our clients to 
wider Group solutions, such as workplace pensions and transport. 
For example, the acquisition of Tusker has allowed us to extend 
our salary sacrifice car schemes to our clients.

Market context
The UK financial services sector remains highly regulated with 
continued regulatory reform anticipated in 2024. 

Customer treatment: Fair treatment of customers remains a 
priority for the FCA, and the introduction of Consumer Duty in 2023 
requires an outcomes focused approach to prioritise customers’ 
needs. We’re also continuing to liaise closely with the FCA and 
Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) on historic motor 
commission arrangements. 

Capital regulation: In December 2023, the PRA published the first 
tranche of near-final rules on implementing the Basel 3.1 reforms, 
with the remaining rules to be published in 2024; these will lead 
to significant changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets. 
CRD IV models also remain subject to further development and 
PRA approval.

Payments and technology: The HM Treasury commissioned 
‘Future of Payments Review’ was published in November 2023, 
making several recommendations including a national strategy 
for the future of payments to be published in 2024. 

ESG: We continue to enhance our sustainability reporting in 
line with the FCA listing rules and Companies Act requirements. 
Our 2023 progress is highlighted on pages 30 to 38, as well  
as within our non-financial and sustainability information 
statement on page 46.

Ring-fencing: The Government has proposed changes to the 
framework, reflecting the recommendations made in the 
ring-fencing and proprietary trading independent review. 

HMT’s Smarter Regulatory Framework: In July 2023, HM Treasury 
published its delivery plan, prioritising a number of reforms 
including Solvency II, Securitisation and Prospectus Regulations; 
many of these form part of the Government package of  
Edinburgh Reforms. 

Other: A number of other initiatives are in progress or expected 
which seek to address, amongst other things: access to cash, 
capital markets reforms, the boundary between advice and 
guidance, and sustainable financing. 

Our response
As a Group we always seek to comply with all applicable
regulation and engage with regulators on all aspects to  
improve outcomes. Given the Group’s customer-focused, 
sustainable and low risk business model, it is well placed  
to meet these requirements.

Our strategy continued

Growth is a core focus of our strategy.  
Around two thirds of our £3 billion strategic 
investment over 2022 to 2024 is aligned to 
growing and diversifying revenue.  

There are four primary pillars of growth  
being developed:  
1.   Deepen and innovate in Consumer 
2.  Create a new mass affluent offering  
3.  Digitise and diversify our SME business 
4.  Develop our Corporate and Institutional business

1. Deepen and  
innovate in Consumer 

We aim to deepen and innovate in Consumer to bring more  
of our products and services to our existing customers, as well 
as broaden our product offerings and make it easier for 
customers to access them through our intermediary partners.

Progress in 2023
•  We remain the UK’s largest digital bank and in 2023 grew our 
digitally active users to 21.5 million. The Group’s market 
leading1 mobile app has seen interactions with the mobile 
messaging service more than double to over 6 million. Banking 
on the go is now even easier as customers can open a new 
account in the app and use innovative features such as chip 
based passport scanning to open their account more easily
•  We have enhanced our mortgage customer journey, including 
mobile-first onboarding, enabling customers to more easily 
navigate the mortgage journey through a seamless digital 
experience. We continued to make strong progress towards  
our sustainability targets, including £7.5 billion of sustainable 
mortgage lending since 2022

•  Following roll-out of a new tool for advisors, we have seen  

a 5 percentage point increase in our protection proposition 
take-up rate by our new mortgage customers in branch
•  We have been transforming customer affordability through 
Your Credit Score, offering easy access to credit scores, 
education on ways to improve scores, providing different 
borrowing options, and building eligibility confidence through 
likelihood messaging. In 2023, 3.2 million new users registered, 
bringing us to over 8.8 million in total and facilitated an 
improvement to other journeys which resulted in a  
10 percentage point increase in loans conversion rate2
•  We completed our acquisition of Tusker, a leading ultra-low

2. Create a new mass 
affluent offering

We are creating a new mass affluent offering to grow  
in this attractive and underserved market segment across 
banking, protection and investments.

Progress in 2023
•  Growth in our mass affluent customer base to over 2.5 million1
•  Banking balances1 from customers meeting mass affluent 
criteria have grown by around 10 per cent since 2021 as we 
continued building our integrated and digitally led banking, 
insurance and investments propositions

•  In September we launched Lloyds Bank 360 to an initial group 
of 50,000 customers. This mobile-first proposition includes  
a holistic view of wealth, educational materials and financial 
coaching. These can offer clarity and support around various 
products and services to help customers to get the most from 
their money

•  We launched ready-made investments through Embark,  

which makes it easier for customers who want to start investing, 
with affordable options and simple terminology designed  
for those with little or no investment experience. Around  
45 per cent of the customers we have helped start their 
investment journey are younger than 35, with 50 per cent 
making regular contributions

2024 implementation
•  Our Lloyds Bank 360 proposition will be extended across mass 
affluent customers, with additional products and features in 
plan, including goals functionality within the app

•  We will continue to expand and enhance our product offerings, 

including the scale-up of digital advice for ready-made 
investments

Progress in 2023
•  We have made significant strides in our multi-year journey 

Progress in 2023
•  We continued to be a leading provider of sustainable 

to build a front-to-back digital franchise. In 2023 we launched  
a new mobile-first business current account onboarding 
journey for sole traders and limited companies along 
with personalised business customer cash flow insights. 
Our transformed customer experience has increased levels 
of automation with account opening times reducing by  
up to 15 times

•  We exceeded our target of 20 per cent growth in new merchant 

services clients, supported by a new point-of-sale card 
payments solution for micro businesses integrated into the 
onboarding journey, enabling clients to transact more quickly
•  Our digital capability strengthened with the launch of a new 
digital invoice finance platform, digitisation of our asset 
finance journey and improved mobile payment functionality. 
These enhance customer experiences, support our product 
development plans and reduce risk

•  We continue to enhance our digital servicing capabilities, 

including moving more than 600,000 accounts to paperless 
statements, with an annual reduction of 6 million letters, and 
over half of all business address changes fulfilled digitally

financing2, supporting clients’ net zero journeys and reducing 
the Group’s financed emissions. We achieved our £15 billion 
sustainable financing2 commitment one year early. We have 
supported the UK’s transition to net zero with continued 
investment in regional development by providing financing 
to infrastructure projects across the UK, including wind farms, 
solar panels, and investments in new technologies

•  We improved our US and EU debt capital markets capabilities, 
outperforming the market in key product lines across our main 
currencies. We were a top five franchise in bond issuance for UK 
issuers (EUR, USD and GBP), number one in structured finance 
and ranked third in sustainable bond issuance

•  We saw similar strength in our financial markets business, with 
new digital functionality in FX driving significantly increased 
executed volumes since 2021, well above market growth, and 
deepened our share of wallet. Similarly, in inflation-linked gilts, 
our volumes grew above the market and in GBP interest rate 
swaps we improved our ranking

•  The momentum on digitising the onboarding journey will 

continue as we shift focus to also enabling for larger SMEs, 
ensuring most customers are onboarded in two working days 
or less

•  We will launch a new omni-channel merchant services 

payment solution, leveraging our existing partnerships. We will 
also extend the roll out of our innovative card terminals which 
help our SME clients accept payments and better run their 
business through integrated software apps

•  We will further improve customer experience through 

enhancements to day-to-day servicing, including more 
self-serve journeys and improved app functionality

2024 implementation
•   To support our strategy of deepening client relationships, we 
are developing our capabilities to gain market share. This is 
being supported by a redesign of our markets architecture, 
broadening our proposition across Rates, FX and Repo. This 
will enable us to deliver a wider range of solutions to meet a 
greater proportion of our clients’ risk management needs

•  We will continue to support our clients as they transition to net 

zero. After achieving our 2024 target one year early, we have set 
a new target to provide a further £30 billion of sustainable 
financing2 over the next three years. We are increasingly 
recognised as a leader in this space, supporting our clients’ 
journeys to becoming more sustainable businesses

Our strategy continued

As we invest to grow and diversify our 
revenue, it is essential to maintain our 
disciplined cost management approach.  
We will also look to further improve capital 
efficiency as we maintain our strong balance 
sheet with a disciplined risk approach, 
pursuing growth in capital-lite, fee generating 
businesses and generating capital.

Progress in 2023
•  We further refined our service model, resulting in branch 

rationalisation alongside our continued investment in digital 
propositions. These have increased the number of customers 
served per distribution FTE by over 10 per cent since end 2021

•  Cost discipline has been a key strength for the Group and 
remains a key focus in enabling capacity for investment in 
growth initiatives as well as offsetting inflationary pressures. 
Around 60 per cent of our 2024 gross cost savings target has 
been realised 

•  We agreed the triennial pensions review with the trustee, 
with no further fixed or variable contributions required this 
triennial, thereby demonstrating the significant progress 
we have made

•  In line with our focus on capital efficiency, we achieved 
risk-weighted asset reductions of more than £7 billion 
through optimisation initiatives, helping mitigate increases 
in risk-weighted assets from business growth and regulatory 
change, and delivering capital generation

Focus2024 implementation

Strengthen  
cost and capital 
efficiency

•  Our disciplined approach to cost and capital efficiency  

will remain unchanged as we focus on generating further 
efficiencies to mitigate inflationary pressures and create 
the necessary capacity for investment

•  We will continue to invest in technology to deliver improvements 

in our self-service capabilities and end-to-end journey 
digitisation

•  Our office footprint will further reduce in 2024 as we transform 
our workplaces by modernising our estate and embracing 
hybrid ways of working

•  Our capital efficiency will be supported by our growth 

initiatives in capital-lite, fee generating businesses, as we 
optimise and recycle risk-weighted assets into higher returning 
businesses and sustain capital generation

We have introduced three new operational
climate pledges which are committing us
to be zero waste and water neutral by 2030
and to bring nature closer to our people
and places, taking action to help achieve
nature positive operations. This creates
good places to work for our colleagues
whilst reducing our impact and associated

At the end of 2019, our triennial valuation showed 
a pension deficit of £7.3 billion. Since then we 
have made pension contributions of more than 
£5 billion, helping to eliminate the deficit during 
2023. Our capital generation will no longer 
be impacted by pension contributions in this 
triennial period. It also helps protect the pension 
savings of our current and former colleagues.

have launched new financed 
emissions targets for our

Our strategy continued

Delivering our strategy requires the Group 
to accelerate the pace at which we use 
digital technologies and data to support 
customers. Our colleagues’ expertise and 
skills are instrumental to our success. It is 
our people who offer the most distinctive 
customer experience, will innovate, take 
thoughtful risk and enable change at  
greater pace, delivering for our customers.

Technology & data 
Progress in 2023
•  We continued to progressively transform or improve our 

technology stack, with more than 10 per cent of our legacy 
technology applications decommissioned since 2021
•  We delivered an internal API marketplace and a suite of 

contemporary API products, increasing reuse and 
standardisation to improve operational efficiency

•  Interactions with our enhanced in-app mobile messaging 
increased to over 6 million, more than double the prior year

2024 implementation
•  We will continue to modernise our technology estate and drive 
technology change savings in line with our ambitious targets

•  Operating model enhancements will enable greater agile 

technology delivery to accelerate the pace of change
•  Expansion of our new Lloyds Technology Centre in India  
will also accelerate transformation and enhance digital 
experiences

These include measures for assessing financial and non-financial 
performance and balancing the interests of various stakeholders 
including customers, shareholders and colleagues.

To ensure colleagues act in the best interests of customers  
and shareholders, variable remuneration at all levels across the 
Group is aligned to these priorities and takes into account the 
Group’s financial performance and specific conduct and risk 
management controls. Within this year’s report we have updated

Non-financial performance: 

Colleagues 

We will continue to support our 
colleagues and create a fully inclusive 
organisation that is representative of 
modern-day Britain, where differences 
are embraced, and everyone can reach 
their potential. Getting this right is at 
the heart of our purpose of Helping 
Britain Prosper.

This section provides an overview of key performance 
measures for colleagues and progress within the year.

Colleague engagement
The Group understands that listening is a two-way process, so  
each year we ask colleagues to share their views via our colleague 
surveys. In 2023, we continued to capture a more regular and 
complete picture of sentiment. 

Our regular pulse surveys, which focus on timely topics, gave us 
insights into the processes and bureaucracy that hamper effective 
working, and also sentiment around change. In May we heard from 
almost 60 per cent of our colleagues on our new flexible working 
arrangements, and we used this data to inform our flexibility offering.

Our annual autumn survey was completed by 81 per cent of the 
colleagues and gave us a complete view on our progress with 
purpose, strategy and culture. Despite engagement declining by 
12 points compared to 2022 due to changes to our flexible working 
arrangements, our in-year advocacy measure (employee net 
promoter score) is moving in a positive direction. Additionally, 
perceptions of our line managers remain strong and the cultural 
changes we had made have been received positively by colleagues. 

During the year the Group communicated directly with colleagues 
detailing Group performance, changes in the economic and 
financial environment, and updates on key strategic initiatives. 
Meetings were held throughout the year between the Group and our 
recognised unions. Please see page 82 for further examples of how 
the Board engages with the Group’s workforce and why the Board 
considers those arrangements to be effective.

For 2023, the Remuneration Committee approved Group 
Performance Share awards for colleagues, and colleagues are 
eligible to participate in HMRC-approved share plans which promote 
share ownership by giving employees an opportunity to invest in 
Group shares. The vast majority of our colleagues hold shares  
in the Group.

that reflects the society it serves to best achieve our purpose, 
Helping Britain Prosper.

In September 2023, we launched our Inclusive Everyday campaign 
which brings to life our Group values and how inclusion is central 
to creating conditions for success and increased productivity. 
We know that raising awareness and education are the key levers 
which will help us unlock future progress. Our colleagues have 
now completed mandatory training promoting how to create an 
inclusive workplace and around 2,500 colleague Mental Health 
Advocates have been identified and trained.

Our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is a source of
pride for our colleagues with a large participation of colleagues
as members of one or more of our colleague diversity
networks. This success is reflected in our latest colleague 
engagement survey results, where 76 per cent of colleagues 
agreed that the Group is an inclusive place to work.

Our approach to flexible working
Flexibility Works is an important part of our transformation,  
as we strive to create a place where people love to work and  
feel supported in the moments that matter, while ensuring  
we are set up in the right way to meet the needs of our customers. 
All colleagues have access to a range of flexible working options, 
depending on their role. These include everyday flexibility, flexible 
bank holidays, compressed working, hybrid working, and  
reduced hours.

We also provide support for families of different shapes and sizes, 
through paid family leave, foster carers leave and support during 
extremely challenging times for colleagues such as fertility, 
miscarriage, stillbirth, and loss of a child. Our flexible working 
approach helps colleagues who need ongoing support either 
for their own health or as a carer to a family member.

Gender diversity
We have seen an increase in women in senior roles to 40.1 per  
cent during 2023, showing progress towards meeting our 2025 
ambition of 50 per cent. We set our ambition to achieve gender 
diversity in our senior leadership knowing it was stretching and 
ambitious. We recognise that the journey will be challenging and 
we may not reach total parity by 2025, but we remain focused on 
actions that support this ambition and which will help us achieve 
this as soon as we can.

We continue to publish our Gender Pay Gap annually. Continued 
progress has been made in closing the Gender Pay Gap, with the 
gap reducing by 2.6 per cent to 26.7 per cent (April 2022 to 
April 2023), the largest improvement since we started reporting. 

We continue to be proud co-sponsors of the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review and have exceeded their target to have at least 
40 per cent women on boards and in leadership teams. In 2023, 
we are compliant with the FCA Listing Rule 9.8.6R(10) and (11). 

Further information on the diversity of our Board  
can be found on page 73 of this report.

Ethnic diversity
In 2023 we have shown progress towards meeting our goals of 
increasing the representation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic 
colleagues to 13 per cent, and Black representation in senior 
roles to at least 3 per cent by 2025. In 2023, we have increased 
the representation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues 
in senior roles from 10.2 to 11.3 per cent and the representation of 
Black Heritage colleagues in senior roles from 1.4 to 1.7 per cent. 
The Board continues to meet the Parker Review recommendation 
of at least one Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic Board member.

Our Race Action Plan, launched in 2020 to drive recruitment,
progression and cultural change across the Group, continues  
to drive focus. As part of this plan, we also work beyond our own 
internal boundaries by actively supporting Black Heritage 
communities through our partnerships with Foundervine and the 
Black Business Network. As a Group we have continued to meet 
our commitment to publish our Ethnicity Pay Gap report and our 
race advisory panel continues to play a critical role in helping us 
to shape our initiatives.

More information on our Race Action Plan progress can be found 
on page 63 of the 2023 sustainability report

Disability
Our aim is for the Group to be a leader in disability inclusion  
and to create an inclusive and accessible working environment 
in which all colleagues have access to a psychologically safe 
environment and equal opportunities, and where everyone is 
supported to reach their full potential. 

In April 2023, we committed to doubling the number of 
colleagues with disabilities in senior management roles by 2025.
Since launching our goal, we have seen a significant uplift in 
colleagues sharing their disability data with us. We believe the 
announcement of our goal has played a key role in this, raising 
awareness and encouraging colleagues to share their disability 
data with us. 

At the time of setting our goal, 6 per cent of our senior 
management colleagues had shared that they had a disability, 
making our ambition to double representation feel like the  
right first step. At the end of 2023, 12.4 per cent of our senior 
management colleagues had shared their disability, meaning 
that we have achieved our representation of senior colleagues 
with disabilities goal earlier than anticipated. We will continue to 
encourage our colleagues with disabilities and neurodiverse 
conditions to share their data with us across the course of 2024, 
helping us to build a true picture of the diversity of colleagues 
within our organisation, whilst continuing to strive for greater 
representation.

We are proud to be recognised as an inclusive employer for 
people with disabilities. The Group continues to hold the Business 
Disability Forum Gold Standard, in addition to being recognised 
as a Disability Confident Leader by the Department for Work and 
Pensions. We offer specific career development opportunities, 
and workplace adjustments for colleagues with disabilities, in 
addition to opportunities to join our colleague network, Access. 

Sexual orientation and gender identity 
We continue to focus on building an inclusive and open working 
environment for our LGBTQ+ colleagues. Our LGBTQ+ colleague 
network, Rainbow, continues to play a pivotal role in our 
approach to supporting our LGBTQ+ colleagues.

Climate

Creating a sustainable future is core to 
our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. 
Guided by our Group strategy, we are 
focusing on areas where we can have 
impact, supporting the UK’s transition 
through our lending, investments, 
products and services.

Our environmental sustainability strategy aligns with the 
Group’s strategic priorities of Grow, Focus, Change, with 
sustainability embedded into how we as a Group operate.  
In developing targets, our first transition plan and assessing  
the Group’s risks and related opportunities to support our 
customers, the need to move from a sector focus to a  
system-led approach has become clear. The Group sees 
climate strategy as both an opportunity for the business  
to grow in support of our customers and a means of risk 
management in pursuit of our strategy.

Our sustainability objectives

We have four systems where we believe we can leverage our 
scale and reach in the market and the different financial services 
that we offer to consider climate and environmental issues across 
and between each system. These systems are focused on where 
we live through greening the built environment, how we move 
through low carbon transport, how we farm with a more 
sustainable farming and food system, and through the energy  
we use with an energy transition fundamental to broader 
decarbonisation. The delivery of our strategy and oversight of  
the related risks and opportunities is governed through our Board 
and executive committees; further details of our sustainability 
governance structure can be found on page 84.

We continue to evolve how we identify, assess and manage 
climate-related risks and opportunities. While we are progressing 
on all ambitions to date, there are significant challenges and 
external dependencies in many of our sectors and systems that 
will need to be addressed for us to achieve our targets and our 
overall ambition to reduce the emissions we finance by more  
than 50 per cent by 2030.

Climate resilience
We have undertaken scenario analysis to assess the resilience  
of the Group’s strategy, building on the lessons learnt from the 
Bank of England’s 2021 Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario 
(CBES). This included an initial assessment of the sectors most 
exposed to climate-related risks. This exercise has demonstrated 
that the Group has relatively low commercial lending exposure to 
some of the main sectors most negatively impacted by climate 
change. Similar analysis has also been undertaken on the Group’s 
investment portfolio. This assessment has supported the focus for 
the Group’s environmental sustainability strategy and emission 
reductions targets. This analysis has also informed consideration 
of climate risk in the Group’s calculation of expected credit losses. 
This has included a top-down sector-level assessment for our 
commercial clients, as well as assessment of flood risk and 
affordability impacts relating to retrofitting costs based on energy 
performance certificates (EPCs) for our Homes portfolio. These 
estimated impacts are below the Group’s materiality thresholds; 
therefore, no adjustments have been made to the expected credit 
losses measured as at 31 December 2023. On this basis, the 
Group’s business model is also considered to be resilient against 
the risks from climate change. 

Further details on this analysis can be found in the Climate Risk 
Scenario Analysis update in Risk Management pages 154 to 157.

Climate risks and opportunities
Climate risk is a key area of focus for the Group, specifically  
the risk of experiencing losses and/or reputational damage, 
either from the impacts of climate change and the transition  
to net zero or as a result of the Group’s response to tackling 
climate change.

We consider this risk to arise through two channels, physical  
or transition risks: 
•  Physical risks arising from changes in climate or weather 
patterns. These can either be acute (event driven such as 
floods or storms), or chronic (longer-term shifts such as 
rising sea levels or droughts)

•  Transition risks due to the changes associated with moving 

towards a low carbon economy, including changes to policy, 
legislation and regulation, technology and market, or legal 
risks from failing to manage the transition

The impacts from climate risk largely manifest through other 
principal risks that the Group faces, therefore consideration  
of climate-related risk is integrated into some of our wider risk 
management processes. Further information on climate-
related risks and how we identify, assess and manage them  
can be found on pages 154 to 157 in Risk management. 

How we identify, assess and manage 
opportunities 
One of the main risks facing the Group is the failure to 
adequately support the transition to net zero. We have the 
responsibility to manage our own operational emissions  
and the opportunity to support our colleagues and customers 
to transition, noting our biggest opportunities are in relation to  
the areas where we have the largest lending including residential 
mortgages and our real estate sector. The identification, 
assessment and management of these opportunities is 
undertaken on a regular basis by our functional-level and 
divisional teams, and approval of new initiatives governed  
in line with our sustainability governance structure. 

The time frames applied for considering the impact of climate-
related opportunities is aligned with those used for business 
planning: short term: 0-1 year, medium term: 1-5 years, long 
term: 5+ years. We note that the timing is partly dependent on 
external factors such as UK government policy and regulation, 
technology developments, as well as our customers’ response. 
The following is an indicative list of the climate-related 
opportunities that we have incorporated or will aim to 
incorporate in the medium to long term across the Group.

products including in relation to our pension

We have identified opportunities to:
1.  Respond to increasing customer preference for sustainable 

products. We recognise the growing sentiment for 
sustainability-linked products as a key opportunity and are 
progressing against our sustainable financing and investment 
targets to deliver against our identified opportunities. 

2.  Support investment in climate-related technology, mobilising 
our net zero origination programme to monitor and identify  
the most significant transition technologies.

3.  Develop products to promote climate resilience, engaging in 

this opportunity though the Build Back Better scheme for home 
insurance and our efforts in greening the built environment 
through our products and services.

4.  Embrace the opportunity to reduce emissions from our own 

operations; we remain focused on removing all use of natural 
gas from our estate, replacing gas boilers with low-carbon 
heating technologies and creating more sustainable branches 
in communities across the UK.

5.  Develop industry partnerships, such as with the Soil Association 
Exchange and Octopus Energy, which help build knowledge on 
how we can further support our customers and suppliers  
to transition.

Further details of our opportunities can be found within the 
sustainability report

Our emissions and financing targets drive the delivery of  
our environmental strategy. With these targets supporting 
management of our climate-related risks and opportunities, 
notably the risk ‘failure to support the transition to net zero’.  
Our 2023 balanced scorecard applies a meaningful 10 per cent 
weighting to environmental measures, having key performance 
measured by assessing the progress against our targets and 
sustainable financing and investments. From 2024 the Long  
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) will include a weighting of 15 per cent 
against environment measures, reflecting that the transition to  
a low carbon economy is core to the Group strategy. Further 
details on the balanced scorecard and LTIP process can be  
found on page 124. 

Our emissions targets
Bank ambition
Work with customers, government and the market to help reduce 
the carbon emissions we finance by more than 50 per cent by 
2030 on the path to net zero by 2050 or sooner.

2030 target

Our overall bank emissions reduction ambition is supported by 
10 sector-specific targets covering our highest emitting sectors. 
These targets are supported by sector-specific transition plans 
which detail how we are supporting our customers and clients  
to transition in these areas. 

Scottish Widows
Target halving the carbon footprint1,2 of all of our investments 
by 2030 on the path to net zero by 2050. 

One year on from announcing our ambition to reduce supply 
chain emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 on our path to net zero 
by 2050, or sooner, we have seen an increase of 16 per cent in 
our disclosed supply chain emissions. This increase has been 
driven by business growth and investment that has resulted in 
a 21 per cent increase in spend with suppliers from £4.0 billion 
to £4.9 billion compared to our baseline year. 

This highlights the limitations of a spend based methodology 
which relies on average carbon emission factors per £1 of 
spend and supports our objective of moving towards  
supplier-specific carbon emissions data. This will allow us  
to more readily assess the progress of our suppliers against 
our ambition by decoupling spend from emissions,  
reflecting the actions taken by suppliers to decarbonise  
their business activities. Further details are found within the 
sustainability report 

.

Own operations
Demonstrating our commitment to managing our own 
operations emissions, this year, we have also reviewed and 
redefined our operational net zero target for 2030. We have 
increased our commitment to reduce operational Scope 1 and 
2 carbon emissions from 75 per cent to at least 90 per cent by 
2030, based on our 2018/19 baseline. We recognise that there is 
more that we can do to minimise the environmental impact of 
our direct operations, and have introduced a new pledge for 
nature across our operations. Further details can be found 
within the sustainability report

5   We refined our methodology and approach to calculating our supply chain 

emissions in 2023 and have recalculated our baseline emissions for the period 
October 2021 to September 2022. A key refinement was the exclusion of VAT from 
our spend data used to calculate supplier emissions. 

In 2022/23, our overall market-based carbon emissions were 
123,499 tonnes CO2e, 30.2 per cent lower since 2018/19 and a 
5.0 per cent increase since 2021/22, mainly driven by higher 
business travel and commuting related carbon emissions.

Our sustainable financing and 
investment targets
In 2022 we set sustainable finance targets through to 2024 
totalling £33 billion across the bank and for up to £25 billion of
investments in climate aware strategies for our Scottish Widows 
business from 2020 through to 2025. We have made great 
progress against these targets and have already reached  
our Commercial Banking target for our corporate and  
institutional customers.

We have built on our existing targets across the Group with a new 
2024 to 2026 target for Commercial Banking which is in addition 
to our existing targets set out below.

Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations
We comply with the FCA’s Listing Rule 9.8.6R(8). Set out  
in the following table are our climate-related financial disclosures 
which are consistent with the 2021 TCFD recommendations and 
recommended disclosures across all four of the TCFD pillars: 
strategy; governance; risk management; and metrics and targets. 

In addition to the compliance below, in-scope entities within  
our Insurance, Pensions and Investments business, which  
are incorporated as part of Scottish Widows Group, are required 
to report in compliance with FCA ESG Sourcebook (set out via 
FCA PS21/24) reporting requirements for the period ending 
31 December 2023. This additional compliance will be met 
through Entity and Product level reporting to be published  
on the Scottish Widows website in June 2024. 

Further detail on our progress against the TCFD recommendations 
can be found in our sustainability report 
supplement ensures we can provide a comprehensive response 
to the TCFD framework that is presented in a decision-useful

Risk overview

Effective risk 
management 
and control

Risk management is a key element in shaping our business model 
and delivering the Group’s strategy to enable sustainable growth. 
A strong risk management culture is crucial to keep the Group, 
our colleagues and our customers safe and secure from existing 
and emerging risks.

Our approach to risk
The Group’s business model is based on a prudent approach 
to risk, which guides participation decisions while safeguarding 
our colleagues, customers and the Group. An overview of risk 
management is included in this section, with the detailed risk 
management section from pages 138 to 196, which provides:
•  A detailed overview of how risk is managed within the Group, 

including the approach to risk appetite

•  The framework by which these risks are identified, managed, 

mitigated and monitored

Risk profile and performance
The Group has remained committed to maintaining support for  
its customers despite challenges with the rising cost of living and 
economic uncertainties in the global and domestic markets.

The Group’s loans and advances continue to be well positioned 
and heightened monitoring is in place to identify signs of 
affordability stress. The mortgage book remains resilient with 
arrears below 2019, with the new Mortgage Charter providing 
additional enhanced support to customers during 2023.

Unsecured and Commercial Banking portfolios continue to exhibit 
stable new to arrears and default trends broadly at, or below, 
pre-pandemic levels. Commercial Real Estate is demonstrating 
resilience and is well diversified with no speculative commercial 
development lending.

As part of the Group’s strategy, there will be continuing investments 
in technology and infrastructure. The Group’s operational resilience 
risks remain a key area of focus, particularly relating to cyber risk 
and supply chain management.

The Group has overseen the embedding of its operational risk
and control framework during 2023 and its oversight of 
management of financial crime risks and consumer fraud.

The Group has enhanced the monitoring of progress against  
its strategic ambitions, alongside ongoing development of 
capabilities for measuring and managing key risks.

Our enterprise risk management framework
The enterprise risk management framework (ERMF) is the 
foundation for the delivery of effective and consistent risk control 
across the whole Group. It enables proactive identification, active 
management and monitoring of the Group’s risks, which is 
supported by our risk and control self-assessment approach. 

The ERMF is regularly updated to ensure it remains in line with 
regulation, law, corporate governance and industry good 
practice. The Board and senior management are responsible for 
the approval of the ERMF, together with Group-wide risk principles 
and policies. The effectiveness of the ERMF is assessed annually 
with the results reported directly to the Board.

The Board and senior management set and embed a positive 
culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. The Group’s Code of 
Ethics and Responsibility and our established values, reinforce 
colleagues’ accountability for the risks they take, their 
responsibility to explore customers’ needs and consistently  
deliver good customer outcomes.

Risk appetite is defined within the Group as the amount and type 
of risk that the Group is prepared to seek, accept or tolerate in 
delivering its strategy. The Board is responsible for approving the 
Group’s Board risk appetite statement annually. Board level risk 
appetite metrics are augmented further by executive-level 
metrics and cascaded into detailed business metrics and limits. 

The Group adopts a continuous risk management approach, 
from identifying the risks through risk and control self-
assessment, and managing the risks through to producing 
appropriate, accurate and focused risk reporting. The Group 
ensures that the appropriate risk resources and capabilities are  
in place, with colleagues provided with the necessary training 
to give them the skills they need.

Governance is maintained through delegation of authority from 
the Board down to individuals. Senior executives are supported  
by a committee-based structure which is designed to ensure 
open challenge and enable effective Board engagement and 
decision making.

The three lines of defence model defines the responsibilities  
and accountabilities for risk management, with effective 
independent oversight and assurance. Business lines have 
primary responsibility for the identification and management of 
risks, Risk division provides oversight and challenge, and Group 
Internal Audit provide independent assurance to the Board and 
Audit Committee.

Climate risk remains a key priority for the Group, with positive 
progress in 2023 and a commitment to continued focus in 2024.

More information on the Board’s responsibilities can be found on 
page 93 and our executive and Risk committees on pages 141 to 142.

Risk overview continued

Principal risks
The principal risks outlined in this section are used to monitor 
and report the risk exposures posing the greatest potential 
impact to the Group.

The Group is in the process of conducting a detailed review of 
the enterprise risk management framework to ensure it remains 
in line with regulatory expectations, corporate governance and 
industry good practice, which will result in a reclassification of  
our principal risks in 2024. 

All of the principal risks are Board-approved enterprise-wide 
risk categories which are reported to the Board Risk Committee 
and the Board regularly. 

The Board Risk Committee report on pages 101 to 106 outlines its 
purpose, structure and responsibilities in addition to activities 
during the year.

In the risk management section, a summary of the Group’s 
principal and secondary risks is on page 145, with further 
information on how each principal risk is managed from  
pages 146 to 196.

Risk performance
The Group maintained its strong capital position in 2023 with a CET1 
capital ratio of 13.7 per cent on a pro forma basis, after absorbing 
regulatory headwinds and the acquisition of Tusker. 

This remains significantly ahead of minimum capital requirements and in 
excess of the Group’s revised ongoing target of 13.0 per cent (previously 
13.5 per cent), which includes a management buffer of around 1 per cent. 
Downside risks from economic and regulatory headwinds, including the 
impact of further Retail secured CRD IV model updates, are being closely 
monitored. This is in addition to the potential impact from the FCA review 
of historical motor finance commission arrangements.

Change and execution risk

Risk trends 
Elevated risk

Link to strategy
See page 24

Risk performance
The Group’s change and execution risk has remained elevated in 2023. 
Whilst change continues to be carried out safely and the new platform 
operating model has enhanced the change controls, the scale and 
complexity of the Group’s strategic change agenda is significant. 
Further development of the model, change framework and the 
associated controls is expected in 2024. 

Risk appetite
The Group maintains capital levels commensurate with a prudent level 
of solvency to achieve financial resilience and market confidence. 

Key mitigating actions
•  Capital management framework that includes the setting of capital 

risk appetite, capital planning and stress testing activities

•  Regular refresh and monitoring of a suite of early warning indicators 
and maintenance of a Capital Contingency Framework, designed to 
identify and act on emerging capital concerns at an early stage

Risk appetite
The Group has limited appetite for negative impacts on customers, 
colleagues, or the Group as a result of change activity.

Key mitigating actions
•  Measurement and reporting of change and execution risk, including 

critical elements of the change portfolio through appropriate 
governance

•  Providing sufficient skilled resources to safely deliver and embed 

change and support future transformation plans

•  Continued evolution and enhancement of the Group’s change 

operating model including the underpinning policy, method and 
associated controls

Risk performance
The Group is continuing to develop its capabilities for measuring 
and managing key climate risks including monitoring progress against 
its net zero ambitions. 

However, the external landscape presents further challenges,  
both in relation to the policy changes required to support the transition  
to net zero, as well as increasing regulatory expectations.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Risk appetite 
The Group takes action to support the Group and its customers’ 
transition to net zero, and maintains its resilience against the risks 
relating to climate change.

Key mitigating actions
•  Further embedding of climate risk policy, providing a framework for 

consideration of climate-related risks across the Group

•  Established targets to reduce emissions across key areas of activity, 
as well as developing appropriate plans and strategies to support 
our transition to net zero

•  Enhancing consideration of physical and transition risks within the 

credit risk process, including assessment of clients’ credible 
transition plans

•  Continuing to build an understanding of how greenwashing could 
impact the Group, including training for all colleagues to ensure  
it is avoided

Conduct risk

See page 20

Risk appetite
The Group delivers good outcomes for its customers.

Risk performance
Conduct risk has remained stable in 2023, however there are several 
areas of emerging risks due to regulatory changes and areas of focus. 
The Group’s focus is on supporting customers impacted by the rising cost 
of living, culture and diversity, mindset shift to embed the FCA’s 
Consumer Duty requirements and ensuring good customer outcomes, 
amid the transformation of its business and technology. We are also 
continuing to liaise closely with the FCA and FOS on historical motor 
commission arrangements.

Key mitigating actions
•  Robust policies in place to support good customer outcomes 
•  Active engagement with regulatory bodies and key stakeholders to 
ensure that the Group’s strategic conduct focus continues to meet 
evolving stakeholder expectations

Risk trends
Stable risk

Link to strategy
See page 20

Risk performance
The Group’s credit portfolio continued to be resilient with only modest 
evidence of deterioration to date. UK Mortgages new to arrears were 
relatively stable throughout 2023, having increased slightly at the  
start of the year, with other unsecured portfolios performing broadly  
at or favourable to pre-pandemic levels. Impairment was a net charge  
of £308 million, compared to £1,510 million for 2022 and includes a 
significant write-back following the full repayment of debt from  
a single name client in the fourth quarter and improvements in the 
Group’s macroeconomic outlook. The Group’s expected credit loss 
allowances have decreased to £4,292 million (2022: £5,222 million).

Risk appetite
The Group has a conservative and well-balanced credit portfolio 
through the economic cycle in line with the Group’s target return on 
equity in aggregate. The Group’s approach focuses on origination 
quality and levers at Board level while dynamically adapting to the  
risk environment, business growth strategy, industry practices and 
regulatory expectations.

Key mitigating actions
•  Extensive and thorough credit processes, strategies and controls  
to ensure effective risk identification, management and oversight
•  Significant monitoring in place, including early warning indicators
•  Selective credit tightening reflective of forecast changes in the 

macroeconomic environment, including updates to affordability 
lending controls for forward-looking costs

Data risk

Risk trends
Stable risk

Link to strategy
See page 24

Risk performance
Data risk remained stable in 2023 with investment in end-to-end data  
risk management and capabilities. The Group’s data strategy will  
support managing data risk and remediation to achieve the Group’s 
growth objectives.

Risk appetite
The Group has zero appetite for data-related regulatory fines 
or enforcement actions.

Key mitigating actions
•  Delivering against the data strategy and uplifting capability  

in data management and privacy

•  Embedding data by design and ethics principles into the  

data science lifecycle

•  Oversight of the data supply chain, emerging technologies,  

and data controls and processes

Funding and liquidity risk

Risk trends
Stable risk

Link to strategy
See page 24

Risk performance
The Group maintained its strong funding and liquidity position in 2023. 
The loan to deposit ratio decreased slightly to 95 per cent (2022: 96 per 
cent). The Group’s liquid assets continue to exceed the regulatory 
minimum and internal risk appetite with a monthly rolling 12-month 
average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 142 per cent (2022: 144 per cent). 
The Group maintains its access to diverse sources and tenors of funding.

Risk appetite
The Group maintains a prudent liquidity profile and a balance  
sheet structure that limits its reliance on potentially volatile sources  
of funding. 

Key mitigating actions
•  Management and monitoring of liquidity risks and ensuring  

that management systems and arrangements are adequate  
with regard to the internal risk appetite, Group strategy and 
regulatory requirements

•  Significant customer deposit base, driven by inflows to 

trusted brands

•  Participation in term issuance programmes

Risk overview continued

Insurance underwriting risk

Risk trends
Stable risk

Link to strategy
See page 20

Risk appetite
The Group has an appetite to take on insurance underwriting risks 
where they fit with our strategic objectives. 

Risk performance
Insurance underwriting risk remained broadly stable. Life and Pensions 
present value of new business premium reduced to £17.4 billion 
(2022: £19.0 billion), the reduction driven mainly by higher discounting 
rates. General Insurance total gross written premium increased to 
£579 million (2022: £486 million) due to improved trading.

Key mitigating actions
•  Significant reinsurance of mortality, morbidity and General Insurance 

weather risk

•  Robust processes for underwriting, reinsurance, claims 

management, pricing, product design and product management

•  Management through diversification and pooling of risks

Market risk

Risk trends
Stable risk

Link to strategy
See page 24

Risk appetite
The Group has effective controls in place to identify and manage  
the market risk inherent in our customer and client-focused activities. 

Risk performance
Market conditions in 2023 remained volatile creating an uncertain 
environment for the management of market risk. However, the Group 
remains well hedged ensuring near-term interest rate exposure is 
appropriately managed. 

The Group’s structural hedge decreased to £247 billion (2022: £255 billion) 
mostly due to the changing mix of customer deposits, from current 
accounts into fixed savings products. In 2023 the pensions triennial 
valuation completed and following final contributions of £250 million  
in December, the pension schemes funding deficit was cleared.  
The IAS 19 accounting surplus remained broadly unchanged at 
£3.5 billion (2022: £3.7 billion).

Key mitigating actions
•  Structural hedge programmes implemented to stabilise earnings
•  Close monitoring of market risks and, where appropriate, 
undertaking of asset and liability matching and hedging

•  Monitoring of the credit allocation in the defined benefit pension 

schemes, as well as the hedges in place against adverse 
movements in nominal rates, inflation and longevity

Model risk

Risk trends 
Elevated risk

Link to strategy
See page 24

Risk appetite
Material models perform in line with expectations.

Risk performance
Model risk remained elevated in 2023, following the pandemic-related 
government-led support schemes weakening the relationships between 
model inputs and outputs in 2022. The economy has steadied somewhat 
compared to 2022, now being more typical of the environment used to 
build the models, reducing need for judgemental overlays to account for 
this, but many of the effects of the pandemic and other stresses to the 
economy are still working their way through. The control environment for 
model risk continues to be strengthened to meet revised internal and 
regulatory requirements.

Key mitigating actions
•  Robust model risk management framework for managing 

and mitigating model risk within the Group

Operational risk

Risk trends 
Elevated risk

Link to strategy
See page 20

Risk performance
Operational risk has elevated in 2023. Overall, operational loss event 
volumes have slightly increased due to fraud instances, but financial 
losses have reduced compared with 2022. 

Key operational risk areas for the Group are security, technology and 
fraud, with an uplift in supplier issues over the last 12 months, although 
these have not been material in impact.

Risk appetite
The Group has robust controls in place to manage operational losses, 
reputational events and regulatory breaches. It identifies and assesses 
emerging risks and acts to mitigate these.

Key mitigating actions
•  Review and investment in the Group’s control environment, with  

a particular focus on automation, to ensure the Group addresses  
the inherent risks faced

•  Deployment of a range of risk management strategies, 

including avoidance, mitigation, transfer (including insurance) 
and acceptance

Operational resilience risk

Risk trends
Stable risk

Link to strategy
See page 24

Risk performance
Operational resilience remained stable in 2023. Enhancing the Group’s 
resilience for serving customers has been a key focus. The Group has 
used operational resilience scenario testing to shape a programme 
to deliver enhanced resilience of important business services by 2025. 

The Group recognises the prominence of cyber security protection  
and the role that resilience of our suppliers plays in delivering resilient 
customer experiences. Technology resilience remains a focus area,  
with dedicated programmes to address key risks.

Risk appetite
The Group has limited appetite for disruption to services to customers 
and stakeholders from significant unexpected events. 

Key mitigating actions
•  Operational resilience programme in place to deliver against new 
regulation and improve the Group’s ability to respond to incidents 
while delivering key services to customers
Investment in technology improvements, including enhancements 
to the resilience of systems that support important business services

People risk

Risk trends 
Elevated risk

Link to strategy
See page 20

Risk performance
People risk remains a key focus for the Group given the scale and pace 
of the transformation underway. The strategic focus of the leadership 
team continues to focus on colleague wellbeing and resilience, driving 
an inclusive, diverse and customer-centric culture, recruiting the required 
skills of the future and enabling colleague performance through 
enhancing their skills and capabilities. This is together with the Group’s 
revised pay offering which aims to support colleagues facing cost of 
living pressures.

Risk appetite
The Group leads responsibly and proficiently, manages people 
resource effectively, supports and develops colleague skills and talent, 
creates and nurtures the right culture and meets legal and regulatory 
obligations related to its people.

Key mitigating actions
•  Delivery of strategies to attract, retain and develop high-calibre 
people with the required capabilities, together with a focus on 
creating a strong and resilient talent pipeline

•  Continued focus on the Group’s culture by developing and delivering 

initiatives that reinforce inclusivity and appropriate behaviours 

•  Focus on providing a working environment which promotes 

colleague safety and enhances their wellbeing and resilience

Regulatory and legal risk

Risk trends
Stable risk

Link to strategy
See page 24

Risk performance
The regulatory and legal risk profile has remained stable, although 
we are conscious of upcoming regulatory changes and the ongoing 
implementation of Consumer Duty. Legal risk continued to be impacted 
by the evolving legal and regulatory landscape, changing regulatory 
and other standards and uncertainty arising from the current and future 
litigation landscape.

Risk appetite
The Group interprets and complies with all relevant regulation and  
all applicable laws (including codes of conduct which could have  
legal implications) and/or legal obligations.

Key mitigating actions
•  Policies and procedures setting out the principles and key controls 
that should apply across the business which are aligned to the 
Group risk appetite
Identification, assessment and implementation of policy and 
regulatory requirements by business units and the establishment  
of local controls, processes, procedures and resources to ensure 
appropriate governance and compliance

emerging risks can be found on pages 44 and 144.

Risk appetite
From 2024 strategic risk has been incorporated into emerging 
and horizon risk, and risk appetite is not set.

Key mitigating actions
•  Considering and addressing the strategic implications of  

emerging trends

•  Embedding of strategic risk into business planning process  

and day-to-day risk management

Risk overview continued

Emerging and horizon risks
The Group continues to focus on horizon scanning activity to 
inform and support identification of the most pertinent internal 
and external trends and developments.

Evolution of the Group’s methodology for 
assessing and prioritising emerging risks 
A series of deep dives on the 2022 emerging risk themes have 
taken place during the year. In addition, individual emerging risks 
themes have been taken to key executive-level committees 
throughout 2023, including the Board Risk Committee, with actions 
assigned to monitor more closely their future manifestation and 
potential opportunities. 

The emerging risk themes were also considered as part of the 
annual financial planning cycle. Geopolitical risks, and how these 
may generate second order impacts for the Group, have been  
a focus.

Many emerging and horizon risk topics are reviewed on a 
recurring basis, alongside ongoing activity addressing their 
impacts. However, it is acknowledged that the nature of the 
emerging risks will evolve and could drive future trends in the  
long term which the Group will need to prepare for. 

The 2023 emerging risk landscape has been simplified,  
combining emerging and strategic risks into a single view  
(see below), enabling greater management concentration on 
developing the appropriate responses. The Group will continue  
to monitor emerging and horizon risks, exploring how they may 
impact its future strategy, and how it can continue to best protect 
its customers, colleagues and shareholders.

For further information on the Board Risk Committee’s Chair 
Report, see pages 101 to 106.

For further information on how the Group is managing key 
emerging risks through its strategy, see page 144.

Emerging risks

Customer propositions and  
societal expectations
The potential impacts of a failure to adapt our propositions  
to the continually evolving expectations and demographic  
of consumers, the evolution of and expectations relating to 
cybercrime, the threats posed by technology-enabled 
players and the risk of market disintermediation.

Environmental, social  
and governance expectations
Investor, shareholder and public perception of the Group’s  
i) awareness of the ecological and environmental impacts 
associated with its operations and investments, ii) ability  
to offer sustainable financing options and services at pace, 
against a continuously evolving environmental and 
regulatory backdrop, and iii) role in supporting the UK  
to transition to a low carbon economy.

Global macroeconomic  
and geopolitical environment
Inability to navigate changing international regulations, 
including sanction and trade compliance, economic 
fragmentation, deglobalisation, and geopolitical events  
that may impact operations, customers and suppliers.

Digital currencies  
and tokenisation
Failure to keep pace with the potential expansion of 
decentralised financial systems, launch of private sector or 
government-backed digital currencies, growth of blockchain 
technologies and asset tokenisation and adoption of 
technologies which support the mainstream utilisation  
of blockchain technologies. 

Generative AI and ethical  
data practices
Failure to keep pace with technological advancements 
relating to Generative AI and machine learning whilst 
balancing the competing requirements to i) maximise 
customer opportunities through adoption, ii) maintain trust 
and confidence in customer data privacy, iii) protect our 
customers from fraud and economic crime, iv) ensure 
transparency on data ethics practices, v) adhere to evolving 
data protection regulations and vi) prepare for potential 
business model disruptions caused by adoption of  
the technology.

Operational elasticity
Failure to adequately prepare for the aggregate threat 
posed by cyber-attacks, disruption of service, third- or 
fourth-party supplier failure, technology outages or severe 
data loss. 

Strategic workforce vision
Failure to evolve the structure and skill set of a dynamic 
workforce in line with the Group’s strategy, whilst  
maintaining pace with the industry and delivering  
strong customer outcomes. 

UK political and macroeconomic 
environment
Failure to anticipate the longer-term impacts of a weak 
UK economy, quantitative tightening, change in government 
and the resulting policy and regulatory shifts (a bank levy,  
for example) and the potential consequences of the UK 
becoming less attractive to external investors.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Viability statement and going concern

Viability statement
The directors have an obligation under the UK Corporate
Governance Code to state whether they believe the Company
and the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet
their liabilities as they fall due over a specified period determined
by the directors, taking account of the current position and the
principal risks of the Company and the Group.

In making this assessment, the directors have considered a wide
range of information, including:
•  The principal and emerging risks which could impact the 

performance of the Group

•  The 2022 Strategic Review which sets out the Group’s customer 

and business strategy for the period from 2022 to 2026

•  The Group’s operating plan which comprises detailed financial, 
capital and funding projections together with an assessment 
of relevant risk factors for the period from 2024 to 2026 inclusive

Group, legal entities and divisional operating plans are produced 
and subject to rigorous stress testing on an annual basis. 
The planning process takes account of the Group’s business 
objectives, the risks taken to seek to meet those objectives and 
the controls in place to mitigate those risks to ensure they remain 
within the Group’s overall risk appetite.

The Group’s annual planning process comprises the following
key stages:
•  The Board reviews and agrees the Group’s strategy, risk appetite 
and objectives in the context of the operating environment and 
external market commitments

•  The divisional teams develop their operating plans, ensuring 

that they are in line with the Group’s strategy and risk appetite

•  The financial projections and the underlying assumptions in 

respect of expected market and business changes, and future 
expected legal, accounting and regulatory changes, are 
subject to rigorous review and challenge from both divisional 
and Group executives

•  In addition, the Board obtains independent assurance from the 
Risk division over the alignment of the plan with Group strategy 
and the Board’s risk appetite. This assessment performed by 
the Risk division also identifies the key risks to delivery of the 
Group’s operating plan

•  The planning process is also underpinned by a robust capital 
and funding stress testing framework. This framework allows 
the Group to assess compliance of the operating plan with 
the Group’s risk appetite 

Going concern

The going concern of the Company and the Group is dependent 
on successfully funding their respective balance sheets and 
maintaining adequate levels of capital.

In order to satisfy themselves that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue to operate for the 
foreseeable future, the directors have reviewed the Group’s 
operating plan and its funding and capital positions, including  
a consideration of the implications of climate change. 

The scenarios used for stress testing are designed to be severe 
but plausible, and take account of the availability and likely 
effectiveness of mitigating actions that could be taken by 
management to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the 
underlying risks. The Group conducts internal stress testing and 
completes the PRA regulatory exercises. In 2023, stress tests have 
considered a range of economic conditions covering multiple 
outlooks and differing economic paths, including persistently high 
interest rates, and falling interest rates. Group stress results are 
segmented to provide insight, inform risk appetite, and allow for 
development of mitigating actions. In considering the likely 
effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the Board’s 
regular monitoring and review of risk and internal control systems, 
as discussed on pages 138 to 196, is taken into account. Further 
information on stress testing and reverse stress testing is provided 
on page 143.
•  Stress testing outputs are presented to the Board Risk 

Committee for review and challenge. All regulatory exercises 
are approved by the Board

•  The final operating plan, Risk division assessment and the 
results of the stress testing are presented to the Board for 
approval. Once approved, the operating plan drives detailed 
divisional and Group targets for the following year

The directors have specifically assessed the prospects of the
Company and the Group over the current plan period. The
Board considers that a three-year period continues to present
a reasonable degree of confidence over expected events and
macroeconomic assumptions, while still providing an appropriate
longer-term outlook. Information relevant to the assessment  
can be found in the following sections of the annual report  
and accounts:
•  The Group’s principal activities, business and operating models 
and strategic direction are described in the strategic report on 
pages 02 to 46

•  Emerging risks are disclosed on page 44
•  The principal risks, including the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing credit, capital, liquidity and funding, 
are provided in the risk management section on pages 138  
to 196

•  The Group’s approach to stress testing and reverse stress 
testing, including both regulatory and internal stresses,  
is described on page 143 

Based upon this assessment, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due  
over the next three years to 31 December 2026.

The directors have also taken into account the impact of further 
stress scenarios as well as a number of other key dependencies 
which are set out in the risk management section under principal 
risks and uncertainties: funding and liquidity on page 41 and 
pages 180 to 185 and capital position on pages 147 to 153. 
Additionally, the directors have considered the capital and 
funding projections of the Company.

Accordingly, the directors conclude that the Company and  
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of  
the approval of the financial statements and therefore it is 
appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the accounts.

Summary of Group results

Statutory results
The Group’s statutory profit before tax for 2023 was £7,503 million, with the increase on the prior year materially driven by the 
restatement of earnings for the IFRS 17 accounting change in 2022. In addition, 2023 has benefited from higher net income and a 
significantly lower impairment charge, partly offset by increased operating expenses as expected. Statutory profit after tax was 
£5,518 million.

The Group’s statutory income statement includes income and expenses attributable to the policyholders of the Group’s long-term 
assurance funds, investors in the Group's non-participating investment contracts and third party interests in consolidated funds. These 
items materially offset in arriving at profit before tax but can, depending on market movements, lead to significant variances on a 
statutory basis between total income and net finance income in respect of insurance and investment contracts from one period to the 
next. In 2023, due to market conditions, the Group recognised net gains on policyholder investments within total income, which were 
materially offset by the corresponding net finance expense in respect of insurance and investment contracts.

Total income, after net finance income in respect of insurance and investment contracts for the year was £18,629 million, an increase of 
20 per cent on 2022, largely reflecting an exceptional charge in the prior year under IFRS 17 from contract modifications in Insurance, 
Pensions and Investments. Net interest income of £13,298 million was up 3 per cent on the prior year, driven by stronger margins and 
higher average interest-earning assets, including growth in the open mortgage book, Retail unsecured and European retail business. 
Other income amounted to a gain of £22,107 million in 2023, compared to a loss of £18,268 million in 2022. Net finance income in respect 
of insurance and investment contracts was a loss of £16,776 million in the year compared to a gain of £20,887 million in 2022, reflecting 
improved equity and debt markets.

The Group maintained its focus on cost management, whilst increasing strategic investment as planned. Total operating expenses of 
£10,823 million were 17 per cent higher than in the prior year. This reflects higher planned strategic investment, severance charges, new 
business costs and inflationary effects. In 2023 the Group recognised remediation costs of £675 million (2022: £255 million) relating to 
pre-existing programmes and a provision for the potential impact of the recently announced FCA review into historical motor finance 
commission arrangements. The higher operating lease depreciation charge reflected the declines in used car prices (notably in the 
fourth quarter), impacting portfolio valuations and gains on disposals, the depreciation cost of higher value vehicles and the Tusker 
acquisition in the first quarter and its subsequent growth.

Impairment was a net charge of £303 million in 2023 (2022: £1,522 million). The decrease includes a significant write-back following the 
full repayment of debt from a single name client, in addition to a credit from modest revisions to the Group’s economic outlook 
compared to the deterioration in the economic outlook captured last year.

The Group recognised a tax expense of £1,985 million in the year, compared to £859 million in 2022, reflecting increased profits. The prior 
year included a £222 million benefit in relation to tax deductibility of provisions made in 2021.

Loans and advances to customers fell by £5.2 billion during 2023 to £449.7 billion, in the context of securitisations of £5.2 billion, including 
£2.5 billion of legacy Retail mortgages (£2.1 billion in the closed mortgage book) during the first quarter and £2.7 billion of Retail 
unsecured loans in the fourth quarter. Excluding these movements, loans and advances to customers were stable. During the fourth 
quarter, loans and advances to customers reduced by £2.4 billion, mainly due to the impact of the securitisation of £2.7 billion of Retail 
unsecured loans. 

Customer deposits at £471.4 billion decreased by £3.9 billion (1 per cent) since the end of 2022. This includes a decrease in Retail current 
account balances of £11.3 billion as a result of higher spend and a more competitive savings market, including the Group’s own savings 
offers. In Retail savings and Wealth, balances have increased by a combined £8.9 billion, with a significant proportion transferred from 
the Group’s current account customer base given attractive customer offers. Commercial Banking deposits were down £1.0 billion 
during 2023, reflecting targeted growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking offset by a reduction in Small and Medium Businesses. 
The trend of customer deposit mix change within the Group was slower in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.

Total equity of £47,365 million at 31 December 2023 increased from £43,911 million at 31 December 2022. The movement reflected 
attributable profit for the year, movements in the cash flow hedge reserve and the issuance of other equity instruments, partially offset 
by market movements impacting pensions, alongside dividends paid and the impact of the share buyback programme. In February 
2023, the Board decided to return surplus capital in respect of 2022 through a share buyback programme of up to £2 billion. This 
commenced in February 2023 and completed on 25 August 2023 with c.4.4 billion (c.7 per cent) ordinary shares repurchased.

Underlying results
The Group’s underlying profit for 2023 was £7,809 million, an increase of 11 per cent compared to £7,028 million in the prior year. Growth 
in net income and a lower underlying impairment charge was partly offset by expected higher operating costs and remediation. 
Underlying profit in the fourth quarter was down 14 per cent compared to the third quarter, with the impairment credit more than offset 
by lower underlying net interest income, higher operating lease depreciation and higher total costs, impacted by the bank levy, 
severance charges and remediation.

2  Net of profits on disposal of operating lease assets of £93 million (2022: £197 million).

Net income of £17,932 million was up 3 per cent on the prior year, with higher net interest income and underlying other income, partially 
offset by an increased charge for operating lease depreciation. Net interest income in the year of £13,765 million was up 5 per cent, 
driven by a stronger banking net interest margin of 3.11 per cent (2022: 2.94 per cent), in line with guidance and higher average interest-
earning banking assets. The net interest margin benefited from UK Bank Rate increases and higher structural hedge earnings from the 
rising rate environment, partly offset by expected headwinds due to deposit mix effects and asset margin compression, particularly in 
the mortgage book. Average interest-earning banking assets at £453.3 billion modestly increased compared to 2022 although slightly 
lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 as expected. The increase in average interest earning assets in the year was due to the open 
mortgage book, Retail unsecured and the European retail business, offset by closed mortgage book run-off and continued repayments 
of government-backed lending in the Small and Medium Businesses portfolio. Net interest income in 2023 included non-banking 
interest expense of £311 million (2022: £111 million), which continues to increase as a result of higher funding costs and growth in the 
Group’s non-banking businesses.

Net interest income in the fourth quarter of £3,317 million was lower than the third quarter, with a lower net interest margin of 2.98 per 
cent (three months to 30 September 2023: 3.08 per cent) from mortgage pricing and deposit mix headwinds, including in Small and 
Medium Businesses, partly mitigated by the structural hedge and a modest reduction in average interest earning assets. The Group 
expects the banking net interest margin for 2024 to be greater than 290 basis points with average interest-earning assets over 2024 
expected to be greater than £450 billion.

The Group manages the risk to earnings and capital from movements in interest rates by hedging the net liabilities which are stable or 
less sensitive to movements in rates. The notional balance of the sterling structural hedge was £247 billion (31 December 2022: 
£255 billion, 30 September 2023: £251 billion) with a weighted average duration of approximately three-and-a-half years (31 December 
2022: approximately three-and-a-half years), representing a modest notional balance reduction in the second half of the year, 
consistent with guidance. The Group expects a further modest reduction in the notional balance during 2024, stabilising over the 
course of the year. The Group generated £3.4 billion of total income from sterling structural hedge balances in 2023, representing 
material growth over the prior year (2022: £2.6 billion). The Group expects sterling structural hedge earnings in 2024 to be c.£0.7 billion 
higher than in 2023.

Underlying other income in 2023 of £5,123 million was 10 per cent higher compared to £4,666 million in 2022. This was driven by growth 
across Retail, Commercial Banking and Insurance, Pensions and Investments. Underlying other income was broadly stable in the fourth 
quarter versus the third, with consistent business unit performance and some impact from severe weather event claims in the 
Insurance business.

Retail underlying other income was up 25 per cent on 2022, due to higher current account and credit card activity, improved Lex 
performance and growth from the acquisition of Tusker. Within Commercial Banking 8 per cent growth in the year reflected improved 
performance in capital markets financing and trading. Insurance, Pensions and Investments underlying other income was 26 per cent 
higher than the prior year driven by business growth, favourable market returns and the accounting unwind benefit of adding a 
drawdown feature in 2022 to existing longstanding and workplace pension business. In Equity Investments and Central Items underlying 
other income was impacted mainly by higher funding costs on structured medium term notes in issue (offset by interest income 
earned on the placement of the funds raised) and to a limited extent by subdued exit markets affecting the Group’s equity investment 
businesses.

The Group delivered good organic growth in Insurance, Pensions and Investments and Wealth (reported within Retail) assets under 
administration (AuA), with combined £5.4 billion net new money in open book AuA over the year. In total, open book AuA now stand at c.
£179 billion.

Operating lease depreciation of £956 million increased compared to the prior year (2022: £373 million). This reflects the declines in used 
car prices (notably in the fourth quarter), impacting portfolio valuations and gains on disposals, the depreciation cost of higher value 
vehicles and the Tusker acquisition in the first quarter and its subsequent growth. The £371 million charge in the quarter is elevated due 
to a sharp reduction in used car prices and updated residual value provisions. Before the provision increase the charge would have 
been c.£270 million in the fourth quarter, from which modest further increases are expected in 2024 as this charge nears normalisation 
and growth continues.

2022 comparatives have been restated to reflect the impact of IFRS 17. See note 1 on page 218.

Total costs, including remediation, of £9,815 million were 10 per cent higher than in the prior year. Operating costs were in line with 
guidance at £9,140 million, up 5 per cent, with higher planned strategic investment, severance charges, new business costs and 
inflationary impacts, partially mitigated by continued cost efficiency. Operating costs were higher in the fourth quarter than in the third, 
impacted by the bank levy as well as severance charges. The Group’s cost:income ratio, including remediation, for the year was 
54.7 per cent, compared to 51.1 per cent in the prior year. Operating costs are expected to be c.£9.3 billion in 2024, reflecting severance 
charges and slightly higher than expected inflation. This does not include a potential cost increase of around £0.1 billion, driven by a 
sector wide change to the way in which the Bank of England charges for supervisory costs. If enacted, this will result in an equivalent, 
offsetting net interest income gain and have a net neutral profit impact.

The Group recognised remediation costs of £675 million in the year (2022: £255 million), with £541 million in the fourth quarter, in relation 
to pre-existing programmes and the potential impact of the recently announced FCA review into historical motor finance commission 
arrangements. There have been no further charges relating to HBOS Reading and the provision held continues to reflect the Group’s 
best estimate of its full liability, albeit uncertainties remain.

The Group has recognised a charge of £450 million for costs and potential redress in light of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
section 166 review of historical motor finance commission arrangements and sales across several firms announced in January 2024. 
The review follows the recent decisions by the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) in favour of the customer in relation to motor 
finance commission complaints. The charge includes estimates for operational and legal costs, including litigation costs, together with 
estimates for potential awards, based on various scenarios using a range of assumptions, including for example, commission models, 
commission rates, applicable time periods (between 2007 and 2021), response rates and uphold rates. Costs and awards could arise in 
the event that the FCA concludes there has been misconduct and customer loss that requires remediation, or from adverse litigation 
decisions. However, while the FCA review is progressing there is significant uncertainty as to the extent of misconduct and customer 
loss, if any, the nature and extent of any remediation action, if required, and its timing. The ultimate financial impact could therefore 
materially differ from the amount provided, both higher or lower. The Group welcomes the FCA intervention through an independent 
section 166 review.

Impairment charges excluding the impact from updated economic outlook taken each quarter.

Asset quality remains strong with credit performance across portfolios relatively stable in the quarter and remaining broadly at, or 
favourable to pre-pandemic experience. Underlying impairment was £308 million (2022: £1,510 million), resulting in an asset quality ratio 
of 7 basis points. The fourth quarter impairment credit of £541 million includes the impact of a significant write-back following the full 
repayment of debt from a single name client. The charge for 2023 also benefits from a net £257 million multiple economic scenarios 
(MES) release (2022: £595 million charge), including a £188 million release in the fourth quarter, reflecting modest revisions to the Group’s 
economic outlook. Given this outlook and ongoing portfolio resilience, the Group now expects the asset quality ratio to be less than 
30 basis points in 2024.

The pre-updated MES impairment charge was £565 million (2022: £915 million), including a net £487 million release in Commercial 
Banking largely driven by the significant write-back in the fourth quarter. Excluding this, the equivalent asset quality ratio for the year 
was 29 basis points, also in line with guidance of less than 30 basis points. Compared to the prior year, while performance has been 
resilient, there has been modest deterioration from a low base, primarily in legacy variable rate UK mortgage portfolios. The impairment 
charge also includes the impact of higher discount rates reducing the value of future recoveries, as well as the expected credit loss 
(ECL) allowance build from Stage 1 loans rolling forward into a deteriorating economic outlook.

In UK mortgages, new to arrears were relatively stable throughout 2023, having increased slightly at the start of the year. Flows to 
default increased through the year, also largely driven by legacy variable rate customers as mentioned above, with trends stabilising in 
the second half. Unsecured portfolios continue to exhibit stable new to arrears and default trends broadly at, or below pre-pandemic 
levels. The Commercial Banking portfolio’s credit quality remains resilient with limited deterioration. 

The ECL allowance of £4.3 billion (31 December 2022: £5.3 billion) continues to reflect a probability-weighted view of economic scenarios 
built out from the base case and its associated conditioning assumptions. Consistent with prior years, a 30 per cent weighting is 
applied to the base case, upside and downside scenarios and a 10 per cent weighting to the severe downside. GDP growth remained 
subdued at 0.5 per cent in 2023 and is expected to remain low in future years with unemployment expected to rise modestly to 5.2 per 
cent by the end of 2024. House prices proved more resilient in the second half of the year than previously assumed and as a result the 
latest base case assumes a more modest fall in 2024 of 2.2 per cent (30 September 2023: 2.4 per cent).

Overall, judgemental adjustments to ECL at £0.1 billion have reduced by £0.3 billion in the year. Notably, reductions related to 
adjustments now captured within models and the impact of taking a larger negative adjustment reducing ECL to reflect resilient 
corporate insolvency rates within the portfolio. Key judgemental adjustments remain in place to cover continued risks from higher base 
rate and inflationary pressures in the Retail portfolios as well as risks from current valuations in certain Commercial Real Estate 
segments.

Stage 2 assets have reduced in the year to £56.5 billion (31 December 2022: £65.7 billion), with 91.3 per cent of Stage 2 loans up to date 
(31 December 2022: 92.7 per cent). Stage 3 assets at £10.1 billion have reduced in the fourth quarter and relative to the end of 2022 
(31 December 2022: £10.8 billion). These reductions in Stage 2 and Stage 3 include the impact from asset transfers from Stage 2 to Stage 
1 as a result of improvements in the economic forecasts and the securitisations of legacy Retail mortgages in the first quarter and 
Retail unsecured loans in the fourth quarter, as well as the full repayment of debt from a large single name client in Stage 3.

Restructuring costs for the year were £154 million (2022: £80 million) and include costs relating to the integration of Embark and Tusker, 
as well as one-off costs to ensure the continuity of some customer communication services following the administration of a key 
supplier. Volatility and other items were a net loss of £152 million for the year (2022: net loss of £2,166 million). This comprised £35 million 
positive market volatility and asset sales, £80 million for the amortisation of purchased intangibles (2022: £70 million) and £107 million 
relating to fair value unwind (2022: £118 million). Market volatility and asset sales included positive banking volatility, partly offset by 
negative impacts from insurance volatility. Volatility and other items in 2022 included an exceptional charge under IFRS 17 from contract 
modifications in Insurance, Pensions and Investments, predominantly in the second half, following the addition of a drawdown feature 
to existing longstanding and workplace pensions as a significant customer enhancement.

The return on tangible equity for the year was 15.8 per cent (2022: 9.8 per cent), reflecting the Group’s robust financial performance. The 
Group expects the return on tangible equity for 2024 to be c.13 per cent. Earnings per share were 7.6 pence for the year (2022: 
4.9 pence).

Tangible net assets per share as at 31 December 2023 were 50.8 pence, up from 46.5 pence at 31 December 2022. The increase resulted 
from higher profits, cash flow hedge reserve unwind and a reduction in the number of shares following the share buyback programme 
announced in February 2023, partly offset by a negative market impact on the pensions accounting surplus, and capital distributions. 
Tangible net assets per share were 3.6 pence higher than at 30 September 2023 given continued profitability and an increase in the 
cash flow hedge reserve following interest rate movements, partly offset by pensions surplus changes. The share buyback programme 
in respect of 2022 completed on 25 August 2023, with c.4.4 billion (c.7 per cent) ordinary shares repurchased.

Tax
The Group recognised a tax expense of £1,985 million in the year (2022: £859 million) reflecting the increased profits. The prior year 
included a £222 million benefit in relation to tax deductibility of provisions made in 2021. The Group expects a medium-term effective 
tax rate of around 27 per cent, which includes the impact of the reduction in the rate of banking surcharge and the increase in the 
corporation tax rate from 19 per cent to 25 per cent, both of which came into effect on 1 April 2023. An explanation of the relationship 
between the tax expense and the Group’s accounting profit for the year is set out in note 19 on page 252.

Loans and advances to customers fell by £5.2 billion during 2023 to £449.7 billion, in the context of securitisations of £5.2 billion, including 
£2.5 billion of legacy Retail mortgages (£2.1 billion in the closed mortgage book) during the first quarter and £2.7 billion of Retail 
unsecured loans in the fourth quarter. Excluding these movements, loans and advances to customers were stable, with £4.7 billion 
growth across unsecured, UK Motor Finance and European retail lending, offset by a £0.7 billion reduction in the open mortgage book, a 
£1.8 billion reduction in the closed mortgage book and a £4.7 billion reduction in Small and Medium Businesses, principally from 
repayment of government-backed lending. During the fourth quarter, loans and advances to customers reduced by £2.4 billion, mainly 
due to the impact of the securitisation of £2.7 billion of Retail unsecured loans. Securitisation activity is conducted to manage risk on the 
balance sheet and to offset regulatory capital pressures, where market opportunities allow net present value positive transactions for 
the Group.

Customer deposits at £471.4 billion decreased by £3.9 billion (1 per cent) since the end of 2022. This includes a decrease in Retail current 
account balances of £11.3 billion as a result of higher spend and a more competitive savings market, including the Group’s own savings 
offers. In Retail savings and Wealth, balances have increased by a combined £8.9 billion, with a significant proportion transferred from 
the Group’s current account customer base given attractive customer offers. Commercial Banking deposits were down £1.0 billion 
during 2023, reflecting targeted growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking offset by a reduction in Small and Medium Businesses. 
The trend of customer deposit mix change within the Group was slower in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.

The Group has a large, high quality liquid asset portfolio held mainly in cash and government bonds, with all assets hedged for interest 
rate risk. The Group’s liquid assets continue to significantly exceed regulatory requirements and internal risk appetite, with a stable and 
strong liquidity coverage ratio of 142 per cent (31 December 2022: 144 per cent) and a strong net stable funding ratio of 130 per cent 
(31 December 2022: 130 per cent). The loan to deposit ratio of 95 per cent, broadly stable on 2022, continues to reflect a robust funding 
and liquidity position and offers the potential for lending growth. The Group’s funding and liquidity position is further discussed on page 
180.

The Group’s pro forma CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2023 was 13.7 per cent (31 December 2022: 14.1 per cent pro forma). Capital 
generation before regulatory headwinds during the year was 223 basis points, reflecting strong banking build, the £250 million dividend 
received from the Insurance business and other movements. These impacts were partially offset by risk-weighted asset increases 
(before CRD IV model updates within Retail secured and net of optimisation) and the full year payment (£800 million) of fixed pension 
deficit contributions made to the Group’s three main defined benefit pension schemes. Regulatory headwinds of 50 basis points largely 
reflect a £5 billion risk-weighted assets adjustment for part of the impact of Retail secured CRD IV model updates. They also reflect the 
end of IFRS 9 static transitional relief and the reduction in the transitional factor applied to IFRS 9 dynamic relief. Capital generation 
after the impact of these regulatory headwinds was 173 basis points. This benefited by just under 30 basis points from an impairment 
credit driven by a significant write-back in the fourth quarter which was materially offset by around 15 basis points in relation to the 
£450 million charge arising from the potential impact of the FCA review of historical motor finance commission arrangements.

The impact of the interim ordinary dividend paid in September 2023 and the accrual for the recommended final ordinary dividend 
equated to 86 basis points, with a further 98 basis points utilised to cover the accrual for the announced ordinary share buyback 
programme and 9 basis points for variable pension contributions reflecting the payment to address the £250 million residual 
aggregate deficit in the fourth quarter. The acquisition of Tusker utilised 21 basis points of capital.

Excluding the Insurance dividend received in February 2024 and the full impact of the announced ordinary share buyback programme, 
the Group's CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2023 was 14.6 per cent (31 December 2022: 15.1 per cent).

The Group expects capital generation in 2024 to be c.175 basis points after taking further expected in-year regulatory headwinds and 
reaffirms guidance for capital generation in 2026 of greater than 200 basis points. 

Risk-weighted assets have increased by £8.2 billion during the year to £219.1 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 
£210.9 billion). This includes the impact of Retail secured CRD IV model updates of £5 billion, of which a further £2 billion was recognised 
in the fourth quarter. Excluding this, lending, operational and market risk increases, a modest uplift from credit and model calibrations 
and other movements were partly offset by optimisation, including capital efficient securitisation activity within the balance sheet. In 
relation to the Retail secured CRD IV models, it is estimated that a further £5 billion increase will be required over 2024 to 2026, noting 
that this will be subject to final model outcomes. The Group’s risk-weighted assets guidance for 2024 remains unchanged at between 
£220 billion and £225 billion.

The PRA provided an update to the Group’s Pillar 2A CET1 capital requirement during the fourth quarter, with the requirement remaining 
at around 1.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets. In July 2023 the Group’s countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate increased to 
1.8 per cent (from 0.9 per cent) in total following the increase in the UK CCyB rate to 2 per cent (from 1 per cent). As a result, the Group’s 
regulatory CET1 capital requirement is now around 12 per cent. The Board’s revised view of the ongoing level of CET1 capital required to 
grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover economic and business uncertainties is now 13.0 per 
cent (previously 13.5 per cent). This continues to include a management buffer of around 1 per cent. In order to manage risks and 
distributions in an orderly way, the Board therefore expects to pay down to c.13.5 per cent by the end of 2024 before progressing 
towards paying down to the revised capital target of 13.0 per cent by the end of 2026.

Pensions
The Group has completed the triennial valuation of its main defined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2022. Following a fixed 
contribution of £800 million in the first half of 2023, a residual aggregate deficit of £250 million was agreed with the Trustee which the 
Group paid in December 2023. There will be no further deficit contributions, fixed or variable, for this triennial period (to 31 December 
2025). 

Dividend and share buyback
The Group has a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy whilst maintaining the flexibility to return further surplus capital 
through buybacks or special dividends. 

In February 2023, the Board decided to return surplus capital in respect of 2022 through a share buyback programme of up to £2 billion. 
This commenced in February 2023 and completed on 25 August 2023 with c.4.4 billion (c.7 per cent) ordinary shares repurchased.

The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.84 pence per share, which, together with the interim ordinary dividend of 
0.92 pence per share totals 2.76 pence per share, an increase of 15 per cent compared to 2022, in line with the Board’s commitment to 
capital returns. The Board has also announced its intention to implement an ordinary share buyback of up to £2.0 billion which will 
commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed by 31 December 2024. 

Based on the total ordinary dividend and the intended ordinary share buyback the total capital return in respect of 2023 will be up to 
£3.8 billion, equivalent to c.14 per cent

 of the Group’s market capitalisation value.

Share buyback in respect of 2022 results
During 2023, the Group completed a £2 billion share buyback programme, in respect of 2022 results, with c.4.4 billion shares purchased 
at an average price of 45.59 pence per share. Through a reduction in the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, share 
buybacks have the effect of increasing earnings per share and, depending on the average price paid per share, can either increase or 
decrease the tangible net assets per share. The share buyback in respect of 2022 results had the effect of increasing the earnings per 
share by 0.3 pence and increasing the tangible net assets per share by 3.3 pence.

cards, unsecured loans, motor finance and leasing solutions. Its aim is to build enduring relationships that meet more of its customers’ 
financial needs and improve their financial resilience throughout their lifetime, with personalised products and services. Retail operates 
the largest digital bank and branch network in the UK and continues to improve service levels and reduce conduct risk, whilst working 
within a prudent risk appetite. Through strategic investment, alongside increased use of data, Retail will deepen existing consumer

propositions.

Financial performance 
• Underlying net interest income 1 per cent lower, driven by mortgage and unsecured lending margin compression, partly offset by 

the impact of the rising rate environment and higher average unsecured lending balances

• Underlying other income up 25 per cent, driven by increased current account and credit card activity, improved Lex performance 

and growth from the acquisition of Tusker

• Operating lease depreciation charge up on 2022 due to declines in used car prices impacting portfolio valuations and gains on 

disposals, depreciation cost of higher value vehicles and the Tusker acquisition and its subsequent growth

• Operating costs up 6 per cent, reflecting planned strategic investment, severance charges, inflationary effects and the Tusker 

acquisition, partly offset by efficiency initiatives. Remediation costs include a £450 million provision for the potential impact of the 
recently announced FCA review into historical motor finance commission arrangements

• Underlying impairment charge £831 million, lower than the prior year as updated economic scenarios drove a £233 million credit 
(2022: £600 million charge), partly offset by increases observed in the level of UK mortgage new to arrears and flows to default, 
primarily legacy variable rate customers, whilst unsecured performance remained stable

• Customer lending decreased 1 per cent driven by the securitisation of £2.5 billion of legacy UK mortgages (£2.1 billion within the 

closed book) and £2.7 billion of unsecured loans. Excluding these, lending is up £2.2 billion with growth across most products, offset 
by a £2.5 billion reduction in the mortgage book, predominantly run-off of the closed book 

• Customer deposits decreased 1 per cent, with an £11.3 billion reduction in current accounts, reflecting higher spend and a more 

competitive savings market, including the Group’s own offers. In Retail savings and Wealth, balances have increased by a combined 
£8.9 billion, significantly from transfers from the current account customer base

•

Risk-weighted assets up 7 per cent in the year, due to the impact of Retail secured CRD IV model updates, higher lending and a

Insurance, Pensions and Investments

Insurance, Pensions and Investments supports over 10 million customers with Assets under Administration (AuA) of £213 billion (excluding 
Wealth) and annualised annuity payments of over £1.2 billion. It has seen significant change in 2023, with a refreshed management 
team and a refocused strategy. This has been supported by the Group’s significant investment in the development of the business, 
including the investment propositions to support the Group’s mass affluent strategy, innovating intermediary propositions through the 
Embark and Cavendish Online acquisitions and accelerating the transition to a low carbon economy.

Strategic progress
• Open book AuA of £164 billion, with 12 per cent growth year-on-year. Net AuA flows of £5.1 billion, in spite of challenging market 

conditions, contributing to an increased stock of deferred profit

• Workplace pensions business saw a 9 per cent annual increase in regular contributions to pensions administered, with £4.9 billion 

net AuA flows in the period, contributing to 18 per cent AuA growth

• Grew general insurance market share following launch of MBNA product in 2022 with new coverages up over 114 per cent and overall 

share of flows up 12 per cent. Digitisation improvements continue to transform customer experience

•

Launched simple non-advised Ready-Made Investments through Embark in February 2023. This helped around 14,000 customers 
start their investment journey, of which c.45 per cent younger than 35, supporting strategic AuA growth and mass affluent 
objectives. Sharedealing income up c.75 per cent compared to last year

9,000 customers and £568 million in 2022. Increased individual annuity market share from 15.6 per cent in 2022 to 20.1 per cent

2

• Continued progress in our protection offering, integrating Cavendish Online and protecting over 20,000 families through the Group’s 

direct channels this year

Financial performance
• Underlying other income of £1,209 million, up 26 per cent driven by favourable market returns and balance sheet growth, including 
the impact of adding a drawdown feature in 2022 to existing longstanding and workplace pension business, resulting in higher 
contractual service margin and risk adjustment releases to income. General Insurance income net of claims increased by c.50 per 
cent in the year driven by market share gains and reduced severe weather-related claims compared to 2022

• Operating costs stable, with higher planned strategic investment, severance charges and inflationary effects, offset by benefit from 

efficiency initiatives

• Grew contractual service margin (deferred profits) by £506 million in the year (before release to income of £310 million), including 
£94 million from new business, reflecting strong value generation in workplace pensions and annuities alongside positive impact 
from assumption changes and expected return. Balance of deferred profits (including the risk adjustment) c.£5.3 billion at 
31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: c.£5.1 billion)

•

•

Life and pensions sales (PVNBP) decreased by 8 per cent with interest rate changes resulting in higher discounting applied in the 
current year, partially offset by strong performance in the Annuities business

Strong capital position supported a final dividend of £250 million paid to Lloyds Banking Group with an estimated Insurance Solvency 
II ratio of 186 per cent (176 per cent after proposed dividend)

• Credit asset portfolio remains strong, rated ‘A-’ on average. Well diversified, with less than 1 per cent of assets backing annuities 

being sub-investment grade or unrated. Strong liquidity position with c.£3 billion cash and cash equivalents

Includes a range of funds with a bias towards investing in companies that are reducing the carbon intensity of their businesses or are developing climate solutions.

Total deferred profit is represented by CSM and risk adjustment, both held on the balance sheet. CSM is released as insurance contract services are provided; risk 
adjustment is released as uncertainty within the calculation of the liabilities diminishes. Amounts are shown net of reinsurance.
For 2022, Other included £1,331 million relating to increases in the CSM arising on the contracts that were modified and recognised as new contracts during the period 
(2023: £nil). This is not included in new business value.

2022 comparatives have been restated to reflect the impact of IFRS 17. See note 1 on page 218.
Total insurance volatility is included within market volatility and asset sales, which in total resulted in a gain of £35 million in 2023 (2022: loss of £1,978 million). See page 68.

The Group’s Insurance business has policyholder liabilities that are supported by substantial holdings of investments. IFRS requires that 
changes in both the value of the liabilities and investments are reflected within the income statement. The value of the liabilities does 
not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments. As the investments are substantial, movements in their value can 
have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group. Management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the division’s results 
on the basis of an expected return. The impact of the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return is included 
within insurance volatility. Insurance volatility on business accounted for under the Variable Fee Approach (largely unit-linked pensions 
business) is deferred to the CSM, other than where the risk mitigation option is applied. Policyholder interests volatility is driven by the 
additional management charges made to some life product customers to cover the extra tax on their products. Underlying profit 
therefore includes the expected charge or credit for the year, with the variance to expectation included in volatility.

During 2023 the movement in the Insurance volatility line above was driven by increases to equity market levels which resulted in profit 
from application of the risk mitigation option. At total level this was more than offset by losses from hedging arrangements.

The Group manages its Insurance business exposures to equity, interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, inflation and market 
movements within the Insurance, Pensions and Investments division. It does so by balancing the importance of managing the impacts 
to both capital and earnings volatility.

2022 comparatives have been restated to reflect the impact of IFRS 17. See note 1 on page 218.

Equity Investments and Central Items includes the Group’s equity investments businesses, including Lloyds Development Capital (LDC), 
the Group’s share of the Business Growth Fund (BGF) and the Housing Growth Partnership (HGP), as well as Citra Living. Also included are 
income and expenses not attributed to other divisions, including residual underlying net interest income after transfer pricing (which 
includes the recharging to other divisions of the Group’s external AT1 distributions), in period gains from gilt sales and the unwind of 
associated hedging costs.

Net income for the year was higher compared to 2022, with stronger underlying net interest income partly offset by weaker underlying 
other income. Underlying net interest income benefited from the effect of rising rates on income earned from the placement of funds 
raised through the issuance of structured medium-term notes (offset within underlying other income by the increased funding costs of 
the notes) as well as higher internal recharges to other divisions as a result of increased AT1 distribution costs. Underlying other income 
was weaker, primarily due to higher funding costs and also subdued exit markets affecting the Group’s equity investment businesses. 
Total costs of £163 million in 2023 were higher than in 2022, in part due to the costs of business growth in equity investment businesses, 
including Citra Living. 

Underlying impairment was a £5 million credit compared to a £392 million credit in 2022. The credit in 2022 relates to the release of the 
expected credit loss central adjustment of £400 million held at the end of 2021. This adjustment was not allocated to specific portfolios 
and was applied in respect of uncertainty in the economic outlook, relating to the risks of COVID-19.

Alternative performance measures

The statutory results are supplemented with those presented on an underlying basis and also with other alternative performance 
measures. This is to enable a comprehensive understanding of the Group and facilitate comparison with peers. The Group Executive 
Committee, which is the ‘chief operating decision maker’ (as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments) for the Group, reviews the Group’s 
results on an underlying basis in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management uses underlying profit before tax, 
an alternative performance measure, as a measure of performance and believes that it provides important information for investors. 
This is because it allows for a comparable representation of the Group’s performance by removing the impact of items such as 
volatility caused by market movements outside the control of management.

In arriving at underlying profit, statutory profit before tax is adjusted for the items below, to allow a comparison of the Group’s 
underlying performance:
•
• Volatility and other items, which includes the effects of certain asset sales, the volatility relating to the Group’s hedging 

Restructuring costs relating to merger, acquisition and integration activities

arrangements and that arising in the Insurance business, the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments and the 
amortisation of purchased intangible assets
Losses from insurance and participating investment contract modifications relating to the enhancement to the Group’s 
longstanding and workplace pension business through the addition of a drawdown feature

•

The analysis of lending and expected credit loss (ECL) allowances is presented on both a statutory and an underlying basis and a 
reconciliation between the two is shown on page 164. On a statutory basis, purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) assets 
include a fixed pool of mortgages that were purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition at a deep discount to face value reflecting 
credit losses incurred from the point of origination to the date of acquisition. Over time, these POCI assets will run off as the loans 
redeem, pay down or losses crystallise. The underlying basis assumes that the lending assets acquired as part of a business 
combination were originated by the Group and are classified as either Stage 1, 2 or 3 according to the change in credit risk over the 
period since origination. Underlying ECL allowances have been calculated accordingly. The Group uses the underlying basis to monitor 
the creditworthiness of the lending portfolio and related ECL allowances.

The Group calculates a number of metrics that are used throughout the banking and insurance industries on an underlying basis. 
These metrics are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and are not any more 
authoritative than measures presented in the financial statements, however management believes that they are useful in assessing 
the performance of the Group and in drawing comparisons between years. A description of these measures and their calculation, is 
given below. Alternative performance measures are used internally in the Group’s Monthly Management Report.

Asset quality ratio

The underlying impairment charge or credit for the period in respect of loans and advances to customers, both drawn 
and undrawn, expressed as a percentage of average gross loans and advances to customers for the period. This 
measure is useful in assessing the credit quality of the loan book.

Banking net interest 
margin

Banking net interest income on customer and product balances in the banking businesses as a percentage of average 
gross interest-earning banking assets for the period. This measure is useful in assessing the profitability of the banking 
business.

Cost:income ratio

Total costs as a percentage of net income calculated on an underlying basis. This measure is useful in assessing the 
profitability of the Group’s operations before the effects of the underlying impairment credit or charge.

Gross written 
premiums

Gross written premiums is a measure of the volume of General Insurance business written during the period. This measure 
is useful for assessing the growth of the General Insurance business.

Life and pensions sales 
(present value of new 
business premiums)

Present value of regular premiums plus single premiums from new business written in the current period.

Loan to deposit ratio

Loans and advances to customers divided by customer deposits.

Operating costs

Operating expenses adjusted to remove the impact of remediation, restructuring costs, operating lease depreciation, the 
amortisation of purchased intangibles, the insurance gross up and other statutory items.

New business value

This represents the value added to the contractual service margin and risk adjustment at the initial recognition of new 
contracts, net of acquisition expenses (derived from the statutory balance sheet movements) and any loss component 
on onerous contracts (which is recognised directly in the income statement) but does not include existing business 
increments.

Pro forma CET1 ratio

CET1 ratio adjusted for the effects of the dividend paid up by the Insurance business in the subsequent quarter and the full 
impact of the announced ordinary share buyback programme.

Return on tangible 
equity

Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, divided by average tangible net assets. This measure is useful in providing a 
consistent basis with which to measure the Group’s performance.

Tangible net assets per 
share

Net assets excluding intangible assets such as goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles divided by the number of 
ordinary shares in issue. This measure is useful in assessing shareholder value.

Underlying profit 
before impairment

Underlying profit adjusted to remove the underlying impairment credit or charge. This measure is useful in allowing for a 
comparable representation of the Group’s performance before the effects of the forward-looking underlying impairment 
credit or charge.

Underlying profit

Statutory profit before tax adjusted for certain items as detailed above. This measure allows for a comparable 
representation of the Group’s performance by removing the impact of certain items including volatility caused by market 
movements outside the control of management.

In the year ended 31 December 2023 this comprised the effects of market volatility and asset sales (gain of £35 million); the amortisation of purchased intangibles (loss of 
£80 million); restructuring costs (loss of £154 million); and fair value unwind (loss of £107 million).
In the year ended 31 December 2022 this comprised the effects of market volatility and asset sales (loss of £1,978 million); the amortisation of purchased intangibles (loss 
of £70 million); restructuring costs (loss of £80 million); and fair value unwind (loss of £118 million). Market volatility and asset sales in 2022 included an exceptional charge 
under IFRS 17 from contract modifications in Insurance, Pensions and Investments, predominantly in the second half, following the addition of a drawdown feature to 
existing longstanding and workplace pensions as a significant customer enhancement.
The Group’s insurance businesses’ income statements include income and expense attributable to the policyholders of the Group’s long-term assurance funds. These 
items have no impact in total upon profit attributable to equity shareholders and, to provide a clearer representation of the underlying trends within the business, these 
items are shown net within the underlying results.

4  Statutory operating expenses includes operating lease depreciation. On an underlying basis operating lease depreciation is included in net income.

UK Corporate Governance Code

Compliance statement 
The UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the Code) applied to 
the financial year ended 31 December 2023. The Code is available 
at www.frc.org.uk.

This directors’ report is set out in a way that helps shareholders 
and investors to evaluate how the Company has applied the 
principles and complied with the provisions of the Code during 
2023. The table below signposts the most relevant parts of the 
Annual Report, in particular where supporting information is not  
in the directors’ report.

The Company confirms that it applied the principles and 
complied with all the provisions of the Code throughout 2023. 

On 22 January 2024, the Financial Reporting Council published  
an updated version of the Code which will apply to financial years 
beginning on or after 1 January 2025. The Company will report 
against that updated version in due course.

Chair’s introduction

Strong governance  
provides the  
foundation  
for all that  
we do 

Sir Robin Budenberg
Chair

Since the Group launched its strategy in February 2022, the 
environment in which we operate has changed significantly.  
The Board is acutely aware that macroeconomic uncertainties, 
societal challenges and geopolitical tensions are having a 
profound impact on people, businesses and society. It is in  
this context that the Group remains committed to its strategy, 
including delivering higher, more sustainable returns for our 
shareholders, aligned to our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper.  
Strong governance provides the foundation for the Group to help 
our customers finance their ambitions and grow whilst navigating 
this challenging external environment. At the same time, 
it ensures we address the environmental, social and economic 
concerns of our wider stakeholders in an effective and 
appropriate manner.

During 2023, the Board has overseen the executive’s continued 
delivery of the Group’s strategic transformation and has focused 
on sound risk management, including a review of operational 
resilience. The strength of our organisation also depends on  
our people and our culture and we are conscious of the impact 
that the strategic implementation is having on our colleagues. 
Listening sessions with colleagues during 2023 provided valuable 
insight on how colleagues are experiencing our culture and, 
crucially, on how our leaders are being empowered to drive  
the fast-paced change required for the successful delivery  
of our strategy.

On the topic of culture at Board level, I have been particularly 
pleased by the open and collaborative relationship the Board has 
continued to develop with the executive. Together with providing 
constructive challenge on strategic implementation, the Board 
encourages the executives to share new plans at an early stage 
in order for the Board to provide feedback as those plans evolve.

Below I highlight some of the governance activities that took 
place during 2023.

Board oversight of strategy 
As I mentioned above, the Board has overseen the continued 
implementation of the Group’s strategy, providing feedback on 
the sequencing of changes and investment priorities, together 
with monitoring key performance indicators – read more  
on page 81.

Focus on risk management
Given the scale of change required to deliver the Group’s 
strategic transformation, the Board, the Board Risk Committee 
and the Group’s Information Technology and Cyber Advisory 
Forum (ITCAF) have each played a vital role in evaluating  
change and execution risk and overseeing operational  
resilience requirements. Read more on risk management  
on pages 101 to 106.

Promoting a healthy culture 
Building on previous years’ commitments to promoting a 
values-led culture, the Board has deepened its understanding of 
colleague and customer sentiment. Further details on the Board’s 
role in overseeing the embedding of a healthy corporate culture 
can be found on page 86.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Diversity, equity and inclusion
Inclusion lies at the heart of the Group’s purpose and increasing 
diversity in the broadest sense, including diversity of thought and 
background, remains a priority for the Board. Further information 
on progress made on diversity, equity and inclusion throughout 
all levels of the organisation is set out on pages 94 to 96 and 107.

Climate ambitions
The Board, through its Responsible Business Committee, has 
overseen the Group’s sustainability strategy. The Group now has 
10 sector-specific Net Zero Banking Alliance targets together with 
its overall banking ambition and investment target. In addition  
to our supply chain ambition, a further three new pledges
for water, waste and nature were announced in November for our 
own operations. Further details can be found on pages 84 and 107.

Board and Committee changes
Succession planning and the composition of the Board are 
important components of good governance. Alan Dickinson and 
Lord Lupton will retire at the 2024 annual general meeting after 
serving nine years and almost seven years respectively on the 
Board. We are deeply grateful to Alan for the wisdom and insight 
he has brought to the Board over a long period as both Deputy 
Chair and formerly as Senior Independent Director and in the 
many important Committee roles he has held and to James for 
his leadership as the inaugural Chair of Lloyds Bank Corporate 
Markets plc and for his significant contribution to the Board. They 
leave with our thanks and best wishes for the future.

Cathy Turner took over from Alan Dickinson as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and as Senior Independent Director 
in September 2023.

Nathan Bostock will be appointed as a non-executive director of 
the Group and, subject to regulatory approval, Chair of Lloyds 
Bank Corporate Markets plc, in each case with effect from 1 August 
2024. Nathan was Chief Executive Officer of Santander UK from 
2014 until 2022 and, prior to that, an executive director and Group 
Chief Financial Officer of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and 
previously its Chief Risk Officer. Nathan’s financial services 
experience and UK banking market knowledge will be invaluable 
to his roles with the Group. 

Read more about Board and Committee changes on page 94.

Ring-fencing governance
Although this is Lloyds Banking Group plc’s corporate governance 
report, I would like to thank Nigel Hinshelwood, Sarah Bentley and 
Brendan Gilligan for their continued and valued contribution as 
non-executive directors of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland 
plc (the Ring-Fenced Banks), which represent the majority of the 
Group’s banking activities. Further details regarding ring-fencing 
governance are set out on pages 76 and 87.

Corporate Governance Code
The Company’s statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018 can be found on page 71.

Stakeholder engagement
Understanding and meeting the Group’s responsibilities and 
duties to shareholders, customers and the communities we serve 
is central to our purpose and remains of utmost importance. Read 
more about Board stakeholder engagement on pages 82 to 83.

Boards of the Ring-Fenced Banks

Since 1 January 2019, UK legislation has required large UK banks to 
separate personal banking services, such as current and savings 
accounts, from riskier activities, such as investment banking,  
in other parts of their business. This is called ring-fencing. 

Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc are the banks within the 
Group which have been included within the ring-fence (together, 
the Ring-Fenced Banks). As the Group’s core focus is on the UK 
and on retail and commercial banking customers, the majority  
of the Group’s banking business is undertaken within the  
Ring-Fenced Banks.

Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors

Each of the directors of Lloyds Banking Group plc is also a director 
of the Ring-Fenced Banks. The boards of the Ring-Fenced Banks 
have three additional independent non-executive directors: Nigel 
Hinshelwood (Senior Independent Director), Sarah Bentley and 
Brendan Gilligan (together, the Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors). 
Read their biographies below. 

These Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors are independent of the 
management and the rest of the Group and their role is to act 
exclusively in the best interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks. They 
play a crucial role in the governance structure, with an enhanced 
role in managing any potential conflicts between the Ring-Fenced 
Banks and the Group.

Read more about the role of the Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors 
and the Group’s structure on page 87.

Board leadership and company purpose

The role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for promoting and assessing
the long-term, sustainable success of the Group, generating 
value for shareholders and contributing to wider society.

The Board is also responsible for ensuring that the Group’s culture 
is aligned with its purpose, values and strategy. Read more about 
how the Board assesses and monitors the Group’s culture on 
page 86. 

The Board establishes the Group’s purpose, values and strategy 
and seeks to ensure that the Group is Helping Britain Prosper. 
The Board approved the Group’s current strategy in February 2022 
and you can read more about how the Board has overseen the 
implementation of the new strategy by the Group Chief Executive, 
supported by the wider executive management team, on page 81.

The Board retains ultimate responsibility for ensuring the 
necessary resources are in place to meet agreed objectives.  
The effective management of risk is central to the Group’s 
strategy, supported by the Group’s enterprise risk management 
framework, which is discussed in the risk management report  
on pages 138 to 196.

The Group’s role as a sustainable and inclusive business is central 
to its purpose. The Responsible Business Committee oversees the 
Group’s sustainability ambitions, with specific reporting and risk 
management responsibility in relation to sustainability-related 
matters (including climate) shared with the Audit Committee  
and Board Risk Committee. This ensures appropriate coordination 
and cooperation on these matters. Read about our sustainability 
governance structure on pages 84 to 85.

The Board recognises that engaging with, and acting on the 
needs of, the Group’s stakeholders is key to achieving the strategy 
and long-term objectives of the Company. Read more about how 
the Board engages with stakeholders on pages 82 to 83 and the 
directors’ statement of how they have carried out their duties 
under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 on pages 03 to 05.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

 
Corporate Governance Framework
The key decisions and matters reserved for the Board’s approval, 
such as the Group’s long-term strategy and priorities, are set  
out in the Group’s Corporate Governance Framework, which is 
reviewed periodically by the Board. The Board is supported by  
its committees which make decisions or recommendations on 
matters as delegated to them under the Corporate Governance 
Framework, including Board appointments, the effectiveness of 
internal controls and the risk management framework, financial 
reporting, governance and remuneration policies. This enables 
the Board to spend a greater proportion of its time on strategic, 
forward-looking matters. Read more about the Corporate 
Governance Framework on page 95. 

Each Board Committee comprises non-executive directors only 
and has an experienced chair. The Committees are managed on 
the same basis as the Board. The structure of each Committee 
seeks to facilitate open discussion and debate and ensure 
adequate time for Committee members to consider all proposals.

The executive directors make decisions within the parameters 
and principles set out in the Corporate Governance Framework, 
which aims to ensure that decisions are made by management 
under the correct authority. However, where appropriate, any 
activity can be brought to the full Board for consideration, even  
if the matter falls within agreed executive parameters.

There are executive committees established to support the Group 
Chief Executive (Group Chief Executive Committees), in particular 
the Group Executive Committee. Read about the Group Chief 
Executive Committees on pages 141 to 142 and see the Group 
Executive Committee members and attendee on page 77.

Board meetings in 2023 
During 2023 there were nine Board meetings. There are separate 
boards and board committees of Lloyds Banking Group plc, Lloyds 
Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc, but most meetings of 
these companies are held concurrently and we refer to this as the 
‘Aligned Board Model’. As most of the Group’s business sits within 
the Ring-Fenced Banks, the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks, 
the Group and HBOS plc are aligned in most circumstances. This 
model is supported by a number of safeguards to enable us to 
operate in this way including the appointment of three Ring-
Fenced Bank only non-executive directors and a Ring-Fenced 

Bank Risk Officer, all of whose primary focus is on protecting the 
interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks. Read more about the Group’s 
governance structure and ring-fencing governance 
arrangements on page 87.

Updates are provided to the Board by the Committee Chairs as 
well as by the Chair, the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, and the Chairs of the Lloyds Bank 
Corporate Markets plc and Scottish Widows Group Limited boards. 
The Chair holds a number of meetings with the non-executive 
directors without the executive directors present.

The Group has a comprehensive and continuous forward agenda 
setting and escalation process in place to ensure that the Board 
has the right information at the right time and in the right format 
to enable the directors to bring their experience and influence to 
make the right decisions. The Chair leads the process, assisted by 
the Group Chief Executive and Company Secretary. The process 
ensures that sufficient time is allocated for strategic discussions 
and business critical items. 

The process of escalating issues and agenda setting is regularly 
reviewed as part of the Board evaluation with enhancements made 
to the process, where necessary, to ensure it remains effective. 

The Chair and the Committee Chairs ensure Board and 
Committee meetings are structured to facilitate open discussion, 
debate and challenge. If directors have concerns about the 
Company or a proposed action which cannot be resolved, their 
concerns are recorded in the Board minutes. Also, on resignation, 
non-executive directors are encouraged to provide a written 
statement of any concerns to the Chair, for circulation to the 
Board. No such concerns were raised in 2023 and up to the date 
of this report.

The non-executive directors also receive regular updates from 
management to give context to current issues.

How governance contributes  
to the delivery of our strategy
Our governance arrangements contribute to the development 
and delivery of our strategy in various ways, including by creating 
accountability and responsibility, information flow and 
independent insight from the non-executive directors.

The Board is responsible for establishing the Group’s strategy and 
reviews the delivery of that strategy by the Group Chief Executive, 
supported by the wider executive management team.

In 2022 the Board approved a new strategy and in 2023 the Board 
reviewed aspects of the strategic transformation including 
opportunities and risks to delivery.

The below diagram illustrates the different ways in which the 
Board oversees implementation of the Group’s strategy.

Board meetings

Strategy has been regularly discussed at Board meetings both as part of the updates from 
the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Chief Operating Officer 
and as specific agenda items. These include updates on the progress made with the Group’s 
strategic transformation and on business-specific strategies such as those for the Consumer 
Relationships, Mass Affluent, and Insurance, Pensions and Investments (IP&I) businesses.

One-to-one discussions with 
management

Non-executive directors have discussed 
the strategy at one-to-one meetings 
with members of senior management 
such as the Group Chief Executive, 
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer 
and the CEOs of the different businesses. 
This provides the non-executive directors 
with the opportunity to explore particular 
matters in greater detail outside of 
Board meetings.

How the  
Board oversees 
implementation  
of the Group’s  
strategy

Board Committees

A number of the Board Committees 
have oversight of aspects of the Group’s 
strategy. For example, the Board Risk 
Committee considers updates on the 
performance of the Group’s change 
programme being undertaken as 
part of the strategy including the 
related execution risks and the Audit 
Committee provides oversight to the 
strategic development of the reporting 
environments and benefits from the 
independent insight provided by internal 
and external audit, supporting rigorous 
review of strategic change.

Strategy offsites

Two strategy offsites gave the Board the opportunity to receive detailed 
updates on topics relating to the Group’s strategic transformation, 
to discuss those topics with the executive management team and 
to provide challenge and feedback to the executive team to inform 
the executive team’s planning and implementation.

June strategy offsite

November strategy offsite

Topics at the June offsite included the Consumer 
Relationships strategy, the Business and Commercial 
Banking strategy, the external environment (including 
artificial intelligence) and its implications for the Group, 
and early views on the IP&I business from its newly 
appointed CEO.

Outcomes of the offsite included feedback to the executive 
team on prioritisation of transformation initiatives and 
on the execution plans for the Consumer Relationships 
strategy and feedback on the early views of the IP&I CEO 
on the IP&I business.

Topics at the November offsite included an update 
on purpose, the external environment (including 
the technology landscape and Generative Artificial 
Intelligence) and its implications for the Group, an update 
on strategic transformation (including on the Group’s 
operational resilience work) and business strategy 
updates for the Consumer Lending business and the 
Business and Commercial Banking business. 

Outcomes of the offsite included feedback to the 
executive team on articulation of the Group’s purpose, 
opportunities to revisit the pace of the strategic 
transformation and digital identification propositions.

Board leadership and company purpose continued

Stakeholder engagement
The non-executive directors undertook tailored engagement 
via the Closer to Customers, Clients and Colleagues Programme, 
allowing them to hear directly from key stakeholders, including 
customers, clients and colleagues.

A number of activities took place under the programme, which 
included meetings with customers and clients and conversations 
with colleagues. The non-executive directors continue to find 
these sessions beneficial, providing valuable insight which helps 
in their consideration of the proposals reviewed by the Board 
during the year. 

The programme was designed to help the directors better 
understand the important issues for our customers, clients 
and colleagues, the role the Group plays in supporting them 
and how the Group is performing in this respect, helping to  
inform the directors’ decision making.

Further engagement by the Board with its stakeholders is 
described below and examples of decision making by the Board 
which had particular stakeholder relevance can be found on 
pages 03 to 05. 

Our stakeholders 

Customers 
and clients

The Group’s customer-centric approach means the Board has 
an ongoing commitment to understanding and addressing 
customer and client needs, which remains central to achieving 
the Group’s strategic ambitions.

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  Non-executive directors attended events to provide deeper 

insight into the issues which customers and clients have faced 
during the year. These events included sessions on the 
challenges of running a small business, the issues faced by 
vulnerable customers, the pressures for customers dealing 
with financial difficulties and the challenges of managing 
finances in retirement 

•  The Board also took the opportunity to meet with clients  
when visiting Group sites in Glasgow, Chester and Bristol

•  Dedicated updates to the Board from across the organisation, 
which identified areas of customer and client concern and 
covered a range of internal and external performance 
measures; in addition, concerns relevant to customers and 
clients were identified for consideration in wider proposals  
put to the Board

•  Regular updates to the Board giving insight into the Group’s 

performance in delivering on its customer and client-related 
objectives and commitments, which assisted in determining 
where further action was required to meet these objectives
•  The Chair and the Group Chief Executive attended customer 
and client engagement events across various regions of  
the UK, providing an important opportunity for customers  
and clients to raise their concerns directly with these  
Board members

Colleagues

Colleagues remain central to the delivery of the Group’s 
strategic ambitions and the Board continues to recognise this  
in its engagement with them. Engagement this year included  
a variety of sessions across the Group to discuss topical issues 
relating to challenges both at and outside of work.

As in 2022, the Board’s Responsible Business Committee has 
been the designated body for workforce engagement, providing 
focus, but with the Board retaining a commitment for individual 
Board members to engage with colleagues directly throughout 
the year. The Board considers these arrangements to be 
effective as they enable a broader range of colleague 
engagement activities, as described in this section.

The Responsible Business Committee reports regularly to  
the Board on all of its activities, including on its colleague 
engagement agenda. The Board will continue to consider  
its arrangements for engaging with the Group’s workforce to 
ensure they remain effective and to encourage meaningful 
dialogue between the Board and colleagues.

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  Review by the Responsible Business Committee of the findings 

of surveys of colleague sentiment, including annual and  
ad hoc surveys and review of the progress being made in 
addressing the matters colleagues have previously raised
•  Regular review by the Responsible Business Committee of 
other workforce engagement reports, covering key issues 
raised, trends on people matters and updates on 
colleague sentiment

•  An annual report, summarising all colleague engagement 
activity, including key themes and issues which colleagues 
have raised during the year

•  Non-executive directors attended a number of colleague 

focus groups, allowing colleagues to share their perspective 
on matters on the Board’s agenda and discuss the Group’s 
progress against its strategic objectives 

•  Members of the Board also visited a number of the Group’s 
sites where they met with colleagues, including Glasgow, 
Chester, Bristol and Halifax and a visit to the Halifax branch  
on Commercial Street, Leeds. Read more on page 85

•  Sessions were hosted by both the Chair and the Group Chief 
Executive, complemented by engagement sessions led by 
other senior leaders with feedback shared with the wider 
Board. The Group Chief Executive also held sessions with 
colleagues from a number of specific business areas across 
the Group

•  Board members attended a range of other events held for the 
Group’s senior leaders and other colleague network events

Shareholders

The Group has one of the largest shareholder bases in the UK, 
which includes most of our colleagues. The Board is committed 
to understanding the needs and expectations of all our 
shareholders, both private and institutional.

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  A number of directors engaged directly with institutional 

shareholders, including the Chair, the Group Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer. In the fourth quarter of 2023 the 
Chair undertook a coordinated programme of meetings 
with approximately 15 major shareholders of the Group, which 
were largely governance focused, including remuneration 

•  The Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer 

undertook numerous meetings covering topics such as the 
Group’s strategy, its purpose and its financial performance

•  Other Board members also attended external investor events
•  Regular updates from Investor Relations on market views 

and shareholder sentiment/feedback, including an annual 
presentation from the Group’s corporate brokers on market 
dynamics and perception of the Group

•  The Board’s Nomination and Governance Committee 

considered correspondence received from institutional 
shareholders and non-governmental organisations, along 
with market feedback

•  The Senior Independent Director and Chair of the 

Remuneration Committee engaged with shareholders 
and proxy agencies on matters relevant to remuneration 
and other topics

•  Overall, the Group undertook approximately 380 meetings 
with institutional investors, many of which were attended 
by management and directors

Communities and 
environment

The Group is present in almost every community in the country 
and the Board places great importance on engagement and 
action to help these communities prosper, while helping to 
build a more sustainable and inclusive future.

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  Updates on climate, environmental and social matters, 

covering aspects of the Group’s business, where the Board 
reviewed progress made against its stated ambitions  
in these areas and agreed any further action it considered 
was required

•  The Board continues to be supported in environmental 
matters by its Responsible Business Committee. The 
Committee considers stakeholder views on all matters 
relating to the Group’s ambition to be a trusted, sustainable, 
inclusive and responsible business. The report of the 
Committee on its work during the year can be found  
on page 107

Regulators and 
government

The Board continues to maintain strong and open relationships 
with the Group’s regulators and with government authorities, 
including key stakeholders such as the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA), the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA),  
HM Treasury and HMRC.

Suppliers

The Group has a number of partners it relies on for important 
aspects of our operations and customer service provision  
and the Board recognises the importance of these supplier 
relationships in achieving the Group’s wider ambitions.

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  The Chair and individual directors, including Chairs of the 
Board’s Committees, held continuing discussions with the 
FCA and PRA on a number of aspects relevant to the evolving 
regulatory agenda

•  The Board reviewed updates on wider Group regulatory 

interaction, providing a view of key areas of focus and also 
progress made in addressing key regulatory priorities

Continuous Assessment meetings with the PRA to discuss the 
Board’s oversight of the Group, key risks and strategic priorities 

Examples of Board engagement included:
•  The Board’s Audit Committee considered reports from the 
Group’s Sourcing and Finance teams on the efficiency of 
supplier payment practices, including those relating to the 
Group’s key suppliers, ensuring our approach continued 
to meet wider industry standards

•  The Board continued to oversee resilience in the supply chain, 
ensuring our most important supplier relationships were not 
impacted by potential material events

•  The Board considered matters relating to ensuring continuity 

in the Group’s customer related print communication, 
throughout turbulence within the supply chain in the second 
half of the year

Sustainability governance 
Given the strategic importance of our sustainability ambitions 
and commitments in managing the impacts arising from climate 
change and broader social issues, the Group’s governance 
structure provides clear oversight and ownership of the Group’s 
sustainability strategy and management of risks and opportunities.

The Responsible Business Committee oversees the Group’s 
delivery of its purpose including the delivery of our sustainability 
strategy (including climate-related matters). Training has been 
provided to Committee members on upcoming sustainability 
regulation and themes of nature and biodiversity. For further 
details see the sustainability report 

. 

Sustainability-related responsibilities at Board level are overseen 
by the Responsible Business Committee, with specific reporting 
and risk management responsibility in relation to sustainability-
related matters (including climate) shared with the Audit 
Committee and Board Risk Committee. This ensures appropriate 
Board level coordination and cooperation on these matters.

Climate risks and opportunities are identified, assessed and 
managed by business unit level teams governed via functional 
and divisional level steering groups and committees.

The Chair of the Scottish Widows Board sits on the Group Board. The Scottish 
Widows CEO sits on the Group Executive Committee and will update the Group 
Executive Committee on relevant insurance matters which can include 
papers for Group Executive Committee approval. 
The Chair of the Responsible Business Committee, Amanda Mackenzie,  
is a non-executive director on the Board, a member of the Remuneration 
Committee, the Nomination and Governance Committee and, as of 1 January 
2024, the Audit Committee, and ensures that sustainability is discussed and 
considered by the Board. Amanda has extensive experience in ESG matters, 
including helping launch the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

3  The Group Net Zero Committee and the Group Risk Committee provide 

oversight from an environmental perspective only.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

One of the key areas of Board level involvement in 2023 was the 
approval of three additional Net Zero Banking Alliance sector 
targets and enhancement of our operational emissions targets. 
The Responsible Business Chair statement provides an overview 
of the Responsible Business Committee’s involvement in the 
Group’s sustainability progress and performance – read more  
on page 107. 

We engage proactively with investors and other key stakeholders 
throughout the year on our sustainability priorities and plans. 
Given net zero and sustainability are at the heart of our purpose-
driven strategy, with ambitious climate targets reflected in 
strategic objectives, the good progress already being made  
in this area and the Group’s existing focus on disclosure, 
transparency and engagement, the Board does not believe it is 
necessary to propose a separate climate vote at the Company’s 
2024 annual general meeting at this time. We will continue to be 
transparent on our sustainability strategy, targets, plans and 
progress. We will continue to consider on a regular basis whether 
to propose a climate vote. 

Executive level governance 
The accountable executive for the Group’s sustainability strategy 
is the Chief Sustainability Officer and Chief Corporate Affairs 
Officer, with relevant teams in place to drive this strategy forward. 
There are three key committees that provide management 
oversight from an executive level: the Group Net Zero Committee, 
the Group Risk Committee and the Group Executive Committee. 
These are supported by a number of divisional and function-level 
teams who consider sustainability topics. 

Group Executive Committee and Group Net Zero 
Committee governance 
Updates on the key areas of the Group’s sustainability strategy 
are provided to the Responsible Business Committee by the 
Group Executive Committee on a quarterly basis. 

The Group Net Zero Committee provides direction and oversight 
of the Group environmental sustainability strategy, including 
particular focus on the net zero transition and nature strategy, 
as well as oversight of the Group’s approach to meeting external 
environmental commitments and targets, including progress  
in relation to the requirements of the Net Zero Banking Alliance. 

Group Risk Committee governance
Responsibility for overseeing the management of financial risks 
from climate change rests with the relevant Chief Risk Officers 
across the Group, who have Senior Management Function (SMF) 
responsibility covering the Ring-Fenced Banks (Lloyds Bank plc 
and Bank of Scotland plc), Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets and 
the Solvency II regulated entities in Scottish Widows Group 
(under Scottish Widows Group, the Finance Director has additional  
SMF responsibilities to manage the risks while the Chief Risk Officer 
has oversight). 

Climate risk is considered through the Group’s monthly risk 
reporting to the Group Risk Committee, in addition to standalone 
updates on a half-yearly basis which inform discussions at the 
Board Risk Committee. Relevant updates are also provided across 
the Group’s key legal entities, as required. Additional engagement 
on relevant climate-related matters is undertaken through the 
existing risk governance structure, for example, sector risks and 
opportunities related to climate are presented and discussed 
at senior credit forums.

Programme governance is also in place for oversight of plans 
to develop the Group’s climate risk management and scenario 
analysis capabilities.

 
Key sustainability topics discussed at the Board’s Committee meetings in 2023

Across the Group’s governance structure, key areas of discussion at Board Committee level are detailed below in relation to the 
Group’s sustainability strategy, targets and approach to managing climate-related risk. These Committees meet at least quarterly 
with sustainability matters, including climate, discussed at a number of these meetings.

Non-executive director visits

Amanda Mackenzie (Chair of the Responsible Business 
Committee) and Lord Lupton (member of the Responsible 
Business Committee) visited West Yorkshire in July 2023. 

Their first stop was Halifax Town Centre and the Group’s Trinity 
Road site, where the Group has recently implemented a new 
energy solution for the site. The Group has removed its natural 
gas reliance there by introducing a ground source heat pump 
utilising the natural water that runs below Halifax Town Centre.

Amanda Mackenzie and Lord Lupton then visited the Halifax 
branch on Commercial Street, Leeds and met with colleagues. 
The branch had recently gone through a full transformation to 
make the branch sustainable, change the internal design and 
layout to the latest style and improve the digital approach in 
branch to support customer education. 

Sir Robin Budenberg (Group Chair and a member of the 
Responsible Business Committee) visited the Group’s office  
on Old Broad Street in London in December 2023 to witness 
first-hand how sustainability is at the heart of the Group’s office 
refurbishment project there. Using the latest air-source heat 
pumps to warm and cool the building, the Group aims to 
reduce energy use on the site by an estimated 63 per cent, 
fully supporting our carbon and energy reduction pledges. 
The Group has been able to recycle or repurpose 99 per cent 
of the waste that came out of the building.

We gathered insight
We looked at data and insights from the following sources:
•  Colleague surveys: 81 per cent of colleagues responded 

to our annual all-colleague survey in November
•  Conducted monthly pulse surveys with 25 per cent  
of the organisation each time to focus on key topics

•  Analysed sentiment from internal and external  

sources including nearly 200,000 comments from  
our annual survey

•  Tapped into sentiment being expressed about the world  

of work online to see external trends and influences

•  Refocused existing metrics to create a culture dashboard 
focusing on the internal and external environment – and 
developed this at an organisation and business area level

Consumer Duty
2023 has seen the implementation of Consumer Duty. This has 
included the design and management of the culture workstream 
for Consumer Duty which was delivered successfully for 
31 July 2023, the date on which Consumer Duty came into force 
for the Group, and continues to be embedded through our 
ongoing Consumer Duty culture work. This work has been in 
multiple phases:
•  All-colleague training and was completed by more than 

99 per cent of colleagues by the end of July 2023

•  Creation of four in-depth modules covering the four Consumer 
Duty outcomes – almost 100,000 module completions recorded 
in aggregate 

•  Design and implementation of workshops for leaders. 

60 workshops delivered and attended by over 1,200 leaders

• 
Board monitoring of culture progress
New for 2023: Culture Dashboard
Our Group Culture Dashboard is a new development introduced 
in November 2023, measuring the connection between high 
performing teams, change readiness and customer outcomes. 
The Culture Dashboard tracks both quantitative and qualitative 
insights and recommends actions to drive progress that will help 
the Group to Grow, Focus and Change.

Board engagement in 2023 and beyond
Our non-executive directors continue to engage with colleagues 
to deepen their understanding of how colleagues experience 
our culture, including through their participation in the Closer to 
Customers, Clients and Colleagues Programme. For the culture 
element of the programme our Board is provided with a range 
of events and listening sessions with colleagues, giving the Board 
valuable insight to inform its decision making. Towards the end 
of 2022, the decision was made to align topics for colleague 
sessions to key themes arising from colleague surveys.

One session focused on leaders, assessing the impact our  
Grow with Purpose Programme has had on them leading the 
transformation of our business. The discussion focused on how 
leaders are communicating the strategic direction and what 
barriers are getting in the way of driving fast-paced change.

Another session focused on our strategy, our colleagues’ 
understanding of it and the impact it is having on customers.  
This session also looked at the cost of living challenges and 
how colleagues feel they are being supported by the Group 
with these challenges.

The Board continues to monitor culture progress and colleague 
sentiment and engagement by drawing insight from colleague 
engagement surveys and monthly pulse surveys.

Group structure and ring-fencing  
governance arrangements
Since 1 January 2019, UK legislation has required large UK banks to 
separate personal banking services, such as current and savings 
accounts, from riskier activities, such as investment banking, 
in other parts of their business. This is called ring-fencing. 
The Group’s structure and governance arrangements meet these 
regulatory requirements. As mentioned on page 76, Lloyds Bank 
plc and Bank of Scotland plc are the banks within the Group which 
have been included within the ring-fence (together, the Ring-
Fenced Banks). The governance structure focuses on ensuring:
•  Independent decision making by the Ring-Fenced Banks’ 
boards – on any matters where there might be a conflict 
between the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks and the 
interests of another part of the Group and that any such 
conflicts are identified and appropriately managed

•  Risks affecting the Ring-Fenced Banks are considered and 

managed from the Ring-Fenced Banks’ perspective – including 
maintenance of the capital adequacy and liquidity of the 
Ring-Fenced Banks

•  Clear and effective governance at both Ring-Fenced Bank 
and Lloyds Banking Group plc level – including second and 
third lines of defence in respect of risk management

The subsidiaries of the Group are structured into the following 
sub-groups under Lloyds Banking Group plc, providing effective 
governance for the business undertaken in each sub-group: 
•  Ring-Fenced Banks sub-group containing Lloyds Bank plc 
and Bank of Scotland plc (including the Halifax and MBNA 
businesses), serving both their UK personal and commercial 
customers 

•  Non-Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group – Lloyds Bank Corporate 

Markets plc – which provides products and services to Group 
customers that are not allowed within the ring-fence, as well 
as serving financial institutions’ customers and holding certain 
of the Group’s subsidiaries and branches outside the UK 
•  Insurance sub-group under Scottish Widows Group Limited 

(including Scottish Widows Limited)

•  Equity sub-group under LBG Equity Investments Limited 

(including Lloyds Development Capital (Holdings) Limited) 

As mentioned on page 76, the boards of the Ring-Fenced Banks 
comprise all of the Group directors plus three additional 
independent non-executive directors: Nigel Hinshelwood  
(Senior Independent Director), Sarah Bentley and Brendan 
Gilligan. These Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors are independent 
of the management and the rest of the Group and their role is 
to act exclusively in the best interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks. 
They therefore play a crucial role in the governance structure, 
with an enhanced role in managing any potential conflicts 
between the Ring-Fenced Banks and the Group.

Getting closer to customers and clients

The Board remains very conscious of the challenges our 
customers and clients continue to face. During the year the 
Board reviewed and discussed an update dedicated to the 
impact of the increased cost of living on customers and 
clients, how the Group had supported, and would support, 
customers and clients and the Group’s engagement with 
the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders’ commitments  
to support borrowers. 

During the year the Board also received additional updates 
from management on the impacts of the increased cost 
of living on customers and clients across our businesses.

During 2023, Board members have attended customer and 
client engagement sessions to deepen their understanding 
of the day-to-day challenges our customers and clients 
face. The topics explored at these sessions included the 
increased cost of living, the lives of vulnerable customers 
and customers in financial difficulty and the challenges  
of managing a small business in the current environment.

Division of responsibilities

Board responsibilities
As Chair, Sir Robin Budenberg has overall responsibility for the 
leadership of the Board and for ensuring its effectiveness in all 
aspects of its operation.

The composition of the Board helps ensure that no one individual 
or small group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision 
making. The diversity of skills, experience and background on the 
Board enables the Board to provide constructive challenge and 
strategic guidance and to offer specialist advice.

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership 
of the Board and the executive leadership of the Group – please 
refer to the role summaries below. The responsibilities of the Chair,  
Group Chief Executive, Senior Independent Director, Board and 
Committees are agreed by the Board and publicly available on 
the Group’s website on our corporate governance page 
Chair periodically refreshes membership of the Committees.

. The 

Monitoring independence
The Nomination and Governance Committee monitors whether 
there are any relationships or circumstances which may affect  
a director’s independence. Following the most recent review of 
independence, the Committee concluded that all non-executive 
directors are independent in character and judgement and are 
independent directors for the purposes of the Code. For further 
details of the review in respect of Alan Dickinson, noting his long 
service, please see page 95. Sir Robin Budenberg was 
independent on appointment when assessed against the 
circumstances set out in provision 10 of the Code.

Monitoring time commitments
Non-executive directors are advised of time commitments for the 
Board and relevant Committees prior to their appointment and 
are required to devote such time as is necessary to discharge 
their duties effectively. The time commitments of the directors are 
considered by the Board on appointment and annually thereafter 
and, following the most recent review, the Board is satisfied there 
are no directors whose time commitments are considered to be  
a matter for concern.

External appointments, which may affect existing time 
commitments to the Board and its Committees, must be agreed 
with the Chair and prior Board approval must be obtained. During 
2023, Amanda Mackenzie was appointed a non-executive director 
of The British Land Company PLC. The Board considered the time 
commitment and potential conflicts involved prior to Amanda 
accepting the role and was satisfied that she would continue 
to have sufficient time to commit to her Group Board and 
Committee appointments. The executive directors do not have 
any significant external appointments. Information on directors’ 
attendance at meetings can be found on page 79.

The right information and support
The Chair, supported by the Company Secretary, ensures that 
Board members receive appropriate and timely information. 
All directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary 
and the Group provides access, at its expense, to the services of 
independent professional advisers in order to assist directors in 
their role. Board Committees are also provided with sufficient 
resources to discharge their duties.

Non-executive directors 

The independent non-executive directors challenge management constructively and help develop and set the Group’s strategy. They actively participate 
in Board decision making and scrutinise management performance. The non-executive directors satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information 
and review the Group’s risk exposures and controls. The non-executive directors, through the Remuneration Committee, also determine the remuneration of 
executive directors.

As Deputy Chair, Alan Dickinson supports the 
Chair in representing the Board and deputises for 
the Chair. The Deputy Chair may also represent 
the Group’s interests to official enquiries and 
review bodies.

As Senior Independent Director, Cathy Turner is  
a sounding board for the Chair and Group Chief 
Executive. She acts as a conduit for the views of 
other non-executive directors and conducts the 
Chair’s annual performance appraisal. She is 
available to help resolve shareholders’ concerns 
and will attend meetings with major shareholders 
and financial analysts to understand issues 
and concerns.

As Company Secretary, Kate Cheetham advises 
the Board on matters relating to governance, 
ensuring good information flows and that 
comprehensive practical support is provided to 
directors. She is also responsible for maintaining 
the Group’s Corporate Governance Framework 
and organising directors’ induction and training. 
Both the appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary are matters for the Board 
as a whole.

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Composition, succession and evaluation

Composition
The balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
on the Board is the responsibility of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee and is reviewed annually or whenever 
appointments are considered. The Nomination and Governance 
Committee assesses the skills, experience and knowledge of the 
non-executive directors on an individual basis and on a collective 
basis – please see page 73 for the results of the latest collective 
assessment, which was approved on 24 January 2024. Having the 
right balance of skills and experience helps to ensure directors 
discharge their duties effectively.

Appointments are made on merit and due consideration is given 
to diversity in its broadest sense, including gender, social, regional 
and ethnic backgrounds and cognitive and personal strengths.

Succession planning
The Nomination and Governance Committee ensures plans  
are in place for orderly succession to both Board and senior 
management positions and oversees the development of a 
diverse pipeline for succession. More information about the work 
of the Nomination and Governance Committee on succession 
planning can be found on pages 94 to 95.

The Nomination and Governance Committee leads the 
process for Board appointments, which makes recommendations 
to the Board. Open advertising and/or an external search 
consultancy is used for the appointment of the Chair and 
non-executive directors. 

All directors are subject to annual re-election. All directors intend 
to seek re-election at the Company’s annual general meeting in 
2024 except for Alan Dickinson and Lord Lupton, who have notified 
the Board that they do not intend to seek re-election.

Board Committee cross-membership

Non-executive directors sitting on multiple Board Committees enables them to read across matters relevant from one Committee to another and, by 
doing so, enhance the discussion on certain matters. The information below is as at 31 December 2023 and therefore does not reflect Amanda Mackenzie 
joining the Audit Committee with effect from 1 January 2024 and Cathy Turner joining the Board Risk Committee with effect from 1 February 2024.

Composition, succession and evaluation continued

Board evaluation
How the Board performs and is evaluated
The annual evaluation, which is typically facilitated externally at 
least once every three years, provides an opportunity to consider 
ways of identifying greater efficiencies, maximising strengths and 
highlighting areas of further development to enable the Board to 
continuously improve its own performance and the performance 
of the Group. 

The Chair of the Board, with the support of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee, leads the Board in considering and 
responding to the review of the Board’s effectiveness, which 
includes a review of its Committees and individual directors. 
Performance evaluation of the Chair is carried out by the 
non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, 
considering the views of the executive directors.

The Board is committed to independent evaluation of its own 
effectiveness and that of its Committees as recommended by the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2018. An external evaluation was 
carried out by Dr Tracy Long in 2022 and a summary of progress 
against the feedback from that evaluation is set out on page 91.

2023 evaluation of the Board’s performance
The 2023 evaluation was conducted internally between November 
2023 and January 2024 by the Company Secretary and was 
overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee. 

The 2023 review sought the directors’ views on areas of 
development identified in the 2022 review and on a range of 
topics including: board leadership and contribution; purpose  
and strategy; risk and control; and people, skills, culture and 
feedback. The topics were selected by the Company Secretary 
with input from the Chair.

Process and timeline for 2023 review 

Stage 1 
November – December 2023

Stage 2
January 2024

Stage 3
February 2024

The Company Secretary invited all 
directors to complete a questionnaire 
relating to the Board and Committees  
of which they are members. During this 
stage, the Company Secretary met  
with each of the directors to discuss  
their responses.

The findings, based on the questionnaire 
results and discussions with individual 
directors, were considered by the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
in January 2024. Committee-specific 
findings and actions were considered 
by each Board Committee.

Proposed actions based on these 
discussions were discussed at the  
Board’s meeting in February 2024.

Key findings from the 2023 review

The evaluation concluded that the performance of the Board, the Committees, the Chair and each of the directors continues  
to be effective. All directors demonstrated commitment to their roles and contributed effectively. 

The key findings and areas for consideration include the following:

Progress against the 2022 evaluation

The main focus in improvements to Board effectiveness in 2023 has been on creating room for more forward-looking and strategic 
discussions on key matters at Board and Committee meetings. These enhancements have been achieved by encouraging the 
executive team to bring strategic matters to the Board in a phased approach, allowing the Board to bring their challenge, influence 
and experience to the evolution and delivery of the strategy, ensuring that it is aligned with the Group’s purpose and values.

Board training
The Chair is responsible for leading the development, and 
monitoring the effective implementation, of training policies and 
procedures for the directors. On appointment, each director 
receives a formal and tailored induction. There is also a 
programme of ongoing training for directors.

The directors are committed to their own ongoing professional 
development and the Chair discusses training with each non-
executive director at least annually. The Company Secretary 
oversees a training plan for the non-executive directors, with the 
plan for 2023 discussed at the Nomination and Governance 
Committee at the start of the year with the non-executive 
directors encouraged to suggest training topics of interest.

Induction

New non-executive directors receive a tailored induction that 
focuses on the Group’s culture and values, stakeholders, 
strategy, structure, operations and governance with an 
emphasis on ensuring that the induction brings the business 
and its issues alive, taking account of the specific role the 
director has been appointed to fulfil and their skills and 
experience to date.

An induction pack is provided containing key corporate 
documents and information relating to the Group covering 
aspects such as the role of a director (including relevant Group 
policies such as anti-bribery, conflicts of interest, expenses,  
gifts and hospitality and share dealing), the Board and its 
Committees, financials and strategy, governance, risk 
management, culture, shareholders and training.

Group training modules

Committee training

New role training

Other training

Non-executive directors 
are asked to complete 
training modules on a 
quarterly basis. In 2023, 
these modules were on:
•  Modern slavery
•  Fighting economic 
crime – advanced 
anti-bribery

•  Security 
•  Conduct rules
•  Speak Up (the Group’s 

whistleblowing 
programme)

Committee-specific training 
is agreed by Committee 
Chairs as and when needed 
such as that provided to the 
Audit and Risk Committee 
Forum – please read more 
at the bottom of this page.

Directors who take on new 
roles, such as Cathy Turner 
taking over as Senior 
Independent Director and 
Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, or change roles 
during the year attend 
induction or handover 
meetings in respect of  
those new roles. 

Training sessions have been 
offered across a range of 
topics of particular interest that 
were chosen to complement 
the Board agenda and 
facilitate advanced discussion. 
Where training was offered 
online, the sessions have been 
recorded and made available 
to all directors. The topics are 
produced based on the level of 
knowledge and experience of 
Board members. Key topics 
during 2023 included:
•  Group Customer Dashboard
•  Senior Managers and 
Certification Regime
•  Market abuse including 
disclosure of inside 
information
•  Consumer Duty
•  Recovery and resolution 

plans

•  Nature (sustainability  

and climate)

•  Data ethics
•  Tax
In addition to the above, 
a board incident management 
exercise was undertaken.

Audit and Risk Committee Forum for non-executive directors 

In November 2023 there was the second meeting of the 
Audit and Risk Committee Forum, which was attended by 
members of the Group, Insurance and Lloyds Bank Corporate 
Markets Audit Committees and Board Risk Committees  
as well as colleagues from the business. 

The aims of this informal forum were to have interactive 
discussion to gain a shared understanding and appreciation 
of common areas of interest and to network. 

The topics discussed were risk and control environment,  
model risk management, supplier risk management and 
climate data.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Audit, risk and internal control

Audit and risk
There are formal policies and procedures in place designed 
to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the internal 
and external audit functions. Group Internal Audit is a single 
independent internal audit function, reporting to the Audit 
Committee. Further detail can be found in the sections headed 
‘Group Internal Audit’ and ‘Auditor independence and 
remuneration’ on page 100.

The Board has delegated a number of responsibilities to the  
Audit Committee, including monitoring and reviewing financial 
reporting, the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk 
management framework, whistleblowing, the internal audit 
process and the external auditor’s process. The Audit Committee 
reports regularly to the Board on its activities and its report for 
2023, confirming how it has discharged its duties, can be found  
on pages 97 to 100.

Requirements that the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable are considered during the drafting and reviewing 
process and the Board has concluded that the 2023 annual 
report meets this requirement. The Board is supported in this by  
its Audit Committee and a sign-off process involving different 
sections of the annual report being approved for inclusion 
by senior management, with additional review by the Group 
Disclosure Committee. The statement of directors’ responsibilities 
can be found on page 136 and the statement of the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements can 
be found on page 209. Related information on the Company’s 
business model and strategy can be found on pages 1 to 45.

The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management and 
internal controls systems, including the determination of the 
nature and extent of risk the Company is willing to take. Risk is 
further managed through the Board-approved risk management 
framework, as discussed in the risk management report on 
pages 138 to 196. The Board Risk Committee assists the Board 
in fulfilling its risk governance and oversight responsibilities, 
including by the provision of advice to the Board on risk strategy 
and overseeing the development, implementation and 
maintenance of the Group’s overall risk management framework, 
strategy, principles and policies and its risk appetite. The Board 
Risk Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities and 
its report for 2023, confirming how it has discharged its duties,  
can be found on pages 101 to 106.

Internal control
Board responsibility
The Board is responsible for, and monitors, the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems. These are designed  
to facilitate effective and efficient operations and to ensure the 
quality and integrity of internal and external reporting and 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and for the 
determination of the nature and extent of the principal risks the 
Group is willing to take in order to achieve its strategy. The 
directors and senior management are committed to maintaining 
a robust control framework as the foundation for the delivery of 
effective risk management. The directors acknowledge their 
responsibilities in relation to the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems and for reviewing their effectiveness.

In establishing and reviewing the risk management and internal 
control systems, the directors carried out a robust assessment of 
the emerging and principal risks facing the Company, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity and reputation, the likelihood of a risk event 
occurring and the costs of control. The process for identification, 
evaluation and management of the emerging and principal risks 
faced by the Group is integrated into the Group’s overall 
enterprise framework for risk. The risk identification, evaluation 
and management process is designed to also identify whether 
the controls in place result in an acceptable level of risk. At Group 
level, a consolidated risk report, risk appetite dashboard and 
report by the Chief Risk Officer are reviewed and regularly 
debated by the Group Risk Committee and the Board Risk 

Committee, with formal updates provided to the Board to  
ensure that they are satisfied with the overall risk profile, 
risk accountabilities and mitigating actions. The report and 
dashboard provide a view of the Group’s overall risk profile,  
key risks and management actions, together with performance 
against risk appetite and an assessment of emerging risks  
which could affect the Group’s performance over the life of  
the operating plan. Information regarding the main features  
of the internal control and risk management systems in relation  
to the financial reporting process is provided within the risk 
management report on pages 138 to 196.

Best practice in relation to risk management continues to evolve 
and throughout 2023 the Group has identified a number of 
enhancements to its risk management arrangements that are 
proposed to be implemented as part of continuous improvement. 
To support the Board’s approval, the Board Risk Committee  
has reviewed the 2023 plan and recommended approval  
of the proposals. 

The Board Risk Committee and the Board concluded that the 
Group’s risk management arrangements throughout 2023  
were adequate overall and provided assurance that the risk 
management systems put in place were responsive to the 
Group’s risk profile and strategy. The Board is confident that  
the enhancements proposed will ensure that the Group’s risk 
management arrangements will be sufficiently robust to meet 
developing risk management best practice for the future.

Control effectiveness review
All material controls are recorded and assessed on a regular 
basis in response to triggers or at least annually. Control 
assessments consider both the adequacy of their design and 
operating effectiveness. Where a control is not effective, the root 
cause is established and action plans implemented to improve 
control design or performance. Control effectiveness against  
all residual risks is aggregated by risk category, reported and 
monitored via the monthly Key Risk Insights or Consolidated  
Risk Report (CRR). The Key Risk Insights/CRR are reviewed and 
independently challenged by the Risk division and provided to  
the Risk Division Executive Committee and the Group Risk 
Committee. On an annual basis, a point in time assessment 
is made for control effectiveness against each risk category 
and across the sub-groups. The Operational Risk System,  
Key Risk Insights or CRR are the sources used for this point  
in time assessment and a year-on-year comparison on  
control effectiveness is reported to the Board Risk Committee  
and the Board.

Reviews by the Board
The effectiveness of the risk management and internal control 
systems is reviewed at least annually by the Board, the Board Risk 
Committee and the Audit Committee, which also receive reports 
of reviews undertaken by the Risk division and Group Internal 
Audit. The Audit Committee receives reports from the Company’s 
auditor, Deloitte LLP (which include details of significant internal 
control matters that they have identified) and has a discussion 
with the auditor at least once a year without executives present 
to ensure that there are no unresolved issues of concern. The 
Group’s risk management and internal control systems are 
regularly reviewed by the Board Risk Committee and the Board 
and are consistent with the Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council. There is also an annual 
independent Control Effectiveness review by Group Internal Audit 
which is reviewed by the Board Risk Committee and the Audit 
Committee. These reports have confirmed they have been in 
place for the year under review and up to the date of the approval 
of the annual report. The Group, Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group and 
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets have achieved full compliance 
with BCBS 239 risk data aggregation and risk reporting 
requirements and actively continue to maintain this status.

Nomination and Governance Committee report 

A persistent focus on succession  
planning helps ensure continuity  
of strong leadership

Sir Robin Budenberg
Chair, Nomination and 
Governance Committee

Driving an increase in inclusion and 
diversity across the Board and executive 
remains a priority.

Key activities in 2023

•  Board succession planning and recruitment
•  Board and Committee composition, skills and training
•  Senior executive succession planning
•  Board evaluation outcomes
• 

Inclusion and diversity

Q &A 

Q   How have the activities of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee (the Committee) helped strengthen inclusion 
and diversity across the membership of the Board and 
its Committees?

A   The Committee is responsible for overseeing the development 

of a diverse pipeline for succession at both Board and executive 
level. Inclusion continues to lie at the heart of the Group’s 
purpose and, in its ongoing assessment of the composition of 
the Board and its Committees, inclusion and diversity remain 
key considerations. Continuing to meet and exceed industry 
targets for Board diversity demonstrates our commitment, 
with the Committee’s role central to achieving this. Details  
of the Board diversity policy are set out on page 96.

Q   What aspects of succession planning have the Committee 

focused on in 2023?

A   Last year’s report highlighted that September 2023 would see 

Alan Dickinson having served nine years on the Board. 
Consequently, a key focus has been the succession 
arrangements for Alan’s roles, which led to Cathy Turner being 
appointed as Senior Independent Director during the year and 
the appointment of Nathan Bostock as a non-executive director 
to replace Alan’s core banking experience on the Board. Further 
consideration continues to be given to Board Committee 
membership as well as non-executive director recruitment. 
The Committee also considered succession planning for senior 
executives, building on the additional focus on this during 2022. 
See page 95 for more details.

Q   What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2024?

A   In addition to succession planning, the year ahead will see a 

focus on seeking to continue enhancing inclusion and diversity 
at both Board and executive levels. Composition of the Board 
and its Committees, and overseeing implementation of actions 
arising from the Board evaluation, will also be given 
appropriate attention.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Introduction
As highlighted in my introduction to the corporate governance 
report on page 72, Cathy Turner was appointed as Senior 
Independent Director during the year. Cathy’s appointment to 
this role helps demonstrate not only our commitment to diversity 
across the Board’s senior roles, but also how strong succession 
planning can, amongst other things, play its part in providing 
candidates for different Board roles. 

Beyond Board and executive succession planning, other key areas 
of focus for the Committee this year have included Board 
effectiveness and training, composition of the Board’s Committees 
and implementation of actions arising from the 2022 externally 
facilitated Board evaluation process. All of these areas are covered 
in more detail throughout this report.

Committee purpose and responsibilities 
The purpose of the Committee is to keep the Board’s governance, 
composition, skills, experience, knowledge, independence and 
succession arrangements under review and to make appropriate 
recommendations to the Board to ensure the Company’s 
arrangements are consistent with the highest corporate 
governance standards.

Board and Committee changes
Alan Dickinson and Lord Lupton have notified the Board that they 
do not intend to seek re-election at this year’s annual general 
meeting having served nine and almost seven years respectively 
on the Board. Nathan Bostock will be appointed as a non-
executive director and, subject to regulatory approval, Chair of 
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, in each case with effect from 
1 August 2024. Cathy Turner succeeded Alan Dickinson as Senior 
Independent Director and also as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee on 13 September 2023, at which point Alan ceased to 
be a member of the Remuneration Committee. At the same time, 
Cathy was appointed as a member of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee and, as announced on 25 January 2024, 
Cathy was appointed as a member of the Board Risk Committee 
with effect from 1 February 2024. Details of the selection process 
for Cathy’s appointment as Senior Independent Director can be 
found on page 96. As announced on 18 December 2023, Amanda 
Mackenzie was appointed as a member of the Audit Committee 
with effect from 1 January 2024.

Succession planning
Consideration has been given to tenure of Board members and 
potential future Board retirements and the impact of these on 
membership of the Board and its Committees, with particular 
attention given to succession arrangements for Alan Dickinson 
and Lord Lupton, as detailed above. The Committee’s ongoing 
review of the structure, size and composition of the Board and its 
Committees helps ensure that the appropriate mix of knowledge, 
skills, experience and diversity is maintained. A summary of Board 
and Committee composition and attendance can be found on 
page 79.

The Committee also continues to consider the overall health and 
diversity of the executive talent pipeline, together with detailed 
executive succession planning. Key considerations include, for 
example, cultural and strategic capabilities which will help deliver 
the strategic aims of the Group’s transformation programme. 
Further details on the Committee’s approach to succession 
planning can be found on page 95.

Board effectiveness and training
An internally facilitated Board evaluation has been conducted this 
year, overseen by the Committee. Full details of how the review 
was undertaken, and its outcomes, are provided on page 90, 
together with a summary of progress against the actions arising 
from the 2022 external Board evaluation process carried out by 
Dr Tracy Long on page 91. The Committee considered the 
outcomes of the review and agreed, and recommended to the 
Board for approval, the actions arising from the review. During 
2024, the Committee will continue to oversee implementation  
of the remaining actions from the 2022 review, together with 
outcomes from the 2023 review. The Committee has also 
undertaken an annual review of its effectiveness, the findings  
of which, together with the outcomes of the Board evaluation 
process as relevant to the Committee, were considered by the 
Committee at its January 2024 meeting; it was considered that 
the performance of the Committee continues to be effective.

The Committee also oversees training undertaken by the 
non-executive directors. The Chair discusses training with each 
non-executive director at least annually and, as set out in the 
summary of Board training on page 92, training sessions have 
been offered across a range of topics which complement the 
Board agenda, in addition to mandatory training requirements. 
Learning and engagement opportunities have been undertaken
by all non-executive directors in relation to material aspects of 
the Group’s business.

Independence and time commitments 
Based on its assessment for 2023, the Committee is satisfied  
that, throughout the year, all non-executive directors remained 
independent1 in character and judgement, and are independent 
directors for the purposes of the Code. Having served nine years  
on the Board in September 2023, the Committee gave specific 
and particularly rigorous consideration to Alan Dickinson’s 
independence. On the basis of the continued robust and 
constructive challenge and oversight provided in his role, 
facilitated by his deep knowledge of the Group and significant 
retail and commercial banking experience, the Committee 
confirmed Alan’s continued independence as a non-executive 
director. During the processes leading to the appointment of 
Cathy Turner as Senior Independent Director, consideration was 
given to Cathy’s independence and overall time commitments  
to ensure that her other appointments could continue to be 
appropriately accommodated. Nathan Bostock’s independence 
was considered as part of the appointment process and it was 
determined that he would be independent for the purposes of the 
Code. As discussed on page 88 of the corporate governance 
report, consideration is also given to time commitments when 
directors seek to take on any additional external appointments.

In recommending directors for re-election at the annual general 
meeting, the Committee has reviewed the performance of each 
non-executive director and their ability to continue meeting the 
time commitments required, taking into consideration individual 
capabilities, skills and experiences and any potential conflicts of 
interest that have been disclosed. The external roles held by all 
directors were considered to be appropriate. Fuller details of any 
conflicts of interest can be found on page 133.

The Group’s Corporate Governance Framework
The most recent annual review of the Corporate Governance 
Framework was finalised in April 2023. This review continued to 
build upon the simplification of the framework achieved during 
2022, while ensuring it remains compliant with relevant 
obligations and best practice.

As part of its broader governance responsibilities, the Committee 
considered regular updates on developments in corporate 
governance during the year, including the Edinburgh Reforms, 
the Financial Reporting Council’s consultation on proposed 
changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code, FCA and PRA 
consultations on Diversity & Inclusion in the financial sector 
and the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. 
The Committee also considered correspondence with 
shareholders on governance issues.

UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company applied the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 
for the year ending 31 December 2023 and complied with all the 
provisions. A table in relation to the Company’s compliance can 
be found on page 71.

The Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges its 
responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board,  
all of which have been accepted during the year. The 
Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the  
corporate governance page 

 on our website.

Committee composition, skills and experience
To ensure a broad representation of experienced and 
independent directors, membership of the Committee currently 
comprises the Chair, Deputy Chair, Senior Independent Director 
(who is also the Chair of the Remuneration Committee) and the 
Chair of the Responsible Business Committee, together with a 
further independent non-executive director (who is the Chair of 
Scottish Widows Group). 

1 

The Chair was independent on appointment. Under the Code, thereafter 
the test of independence is not appropriate in relation to the Chair.

The Senior Independent Director of the Ring-Fenced Banks also 
attends meetings as an observer in order to provide insights on 
matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks when required and as 
part of his role in the Group’s overall governance structure.

The Group Chief Executive attends meetings as appropriate. 
Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance 
during the year can be found on page 79.

Succession planning 

Succession planning, at both Board level and across key senior 
management roles, continued to be a core area of consideration 
for the Committee during 2023, with a particular focus on 
succession arrangements for Alan Dickinson. 

Effective succession planning assists the Group in delivering on its 
strategic objectives over the medium and longer term by ensuring 
the desired mix of skills and experience of Board members and 
executives, this being particularly important as we continue to 
drive forward delivery of the Group’s strategic and cultural 
transformation. The Board remains committed to ensuring the 
development of a diverse pipeline of current and future leaders 
across the Group’s executive and management levels, through 
the provision of a range of development opportunities.

At an executive level, the Chair is responsible for developing and 
maintaining a succession plan for the Group Chief Executive who 
is, in turn, primarily responsible for developing and maintaining 
succession plans for key leadership positions in the senior 
executive team. As part of its regular oversight and review of the 
adequacy and effectiveness of succession arrangements for 
executive directors and members of the senior executive, the 
Committee received and discussed regular updates from the 
Group Chief Executive covering executive succession planning 
arrangements. These demonstrated the continuing strength 
and effectiveness of the Group’s senior management succession 
planning, through the depth and diversity of the succession 
plans covering key senior management roles.

The Committee also supports the Chair in keeping the composition 
of the Board and its Committees under regular review and in 
leading the appointment process for nominations to the Board. 
This helps ensure continued focus on increasing the overall 
diversity of the Board and capacity for future succession planning, 
bearing in mind tenure of Board members and potential future 
retirements from the Board. The appointment process set out on 
the following page helps illustrate how this works in practice. 
In contemplating succession arrangements for Alan Dickinson 
as Senior Independent Director, the Committee considered both 
external and internal candidates, before making the 
recommendation to the Board that Cathy Turner be appointed 
as Senior Independent Director. Cathy’s breadth of executive and 
non-executive experience was a key factor, helping demonstrate 
the strength of our succession planning arrangements and 
recruitment processes. In addition to the appointment of Nathan 
Bostock, the Committee continues to give consideration to the 
appointment of further non-executive representation to the Board. 

The Chair leads an ongoing assessment of the Board’s technical 
and governance skill set, on both an individual and collective basis, 
using a Board skills matrix to track the Board’s strengths and to 
identify any gaps in the desired collective skills profile of the Board. 
Consideration is given to a range of factors such as the Group’s 
future strategic direction and helping to ensure that due weight 
is given to diversity in its broadest sense. The skills matrix is 
considered in the appointment of all Board members. The Group’s 
diversity commitments and outcomes of the Board evaluation 
process are also taken into consideration.

Succession planning also plays a key role in the recognition and 
promotion of diversity across the Board and senior management, 
further supported by a range of policies across the Group which 
promote the engagement of under-represented groups within the 
business in order to help continue to build a diverse talent pipeline. 
Further details can be found on page 31.

Nomination and Governance Committee report continued

Appointment process – non-executive directors 

The Committee leads the process for the appointment of non-
executive directors, making recommendations to the Board for the 
appointment of preferred candidates. The process involves open 
advertising and the engagement of an external search firm to assist 
with the identification of potential candidates, based on criteria 
identified by the Committee. This generates a list of potential 
candidates for consideration, from which a short list of candidates 
is selected who are then interviewed by the Chair, with further 
interviews and meetings then being held with other members of the 
Board, as deemed appropriate. After further consideration the 
Committee makes its recommendations to the Board for formal 
approval. This is a formal, rigorous and transparent process, leading 
to appointments being made on merit and objective criteria, with 
due consideration being given to a broad range of factors such 
as diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive 
and personal strengths and the Group’s future strategic direction.

There were no additional non-executive directors appointed  
to the Board during 2023. The process described above has  
been followed in the appointment of Nathan Bostock; the Group  
will report further on that appointment process in its 2024  
annual report.

The Committee gave particular consideration to the Senior 
Independent Director role recognising that, by September 2023, 
Alan would have served nine years on the Board. The Committee 
delegated authority to the Chair to lead the formal interview  
and selection process for this role and, supported by Alan, 
consideration was given to both external and internal candidates 
against criteria identified by the Committee. Russell Reynolds 
Associates, who were engaged in the process of identifying 
external candidates for consideration, as well as the process which 
resulted in Nathan Bostock’s recruitment, have no connection with 
the Group or individual directors other than conducting leadership 
search and succession planning services and facilitating 
leadership performance services. The Committee was kept 
informed on progress and discussions were held with other Board 
members, from which the consensus view was a preference for an 
internal candidate, unless a significantly stronger external 
candidate was identified. The Chair subsequently canvassed all 
directors for their views and interviewed the candidates for the role, 
before the matter was further discussed by the Committee. This led 
to the Committee’s recommendation, and the Board’s approval, of 
the appointment of Cathy Turner as Senior Independent Director. 
Further information on this process can also be found on page 4.

Board diversity policy
The Board diversity policy (the Policy) sets out the Board’s 
approach to diversity and provides a high-level indication  
of the Board’s approach to inclusion and diversity in senior 
management roles which is governed in greater detail through 
the Group’s policies.

The Board places great emphasis on ensuring that its 
membership reflects diversity in its broadest sense. Consideration 
is given to the combination of demographics, skills, experience, 
race, age, gender, educational and professional background and 
other relevant personal attributes on the Board to provide the 
range of perspectives, insights and challenge needed to support 
good decision making.

New appointments are made on merit, taking account of the 
specific skills and experience, independence and knowledge 
needed to ensure a rounded Board and the diverse benefits  
each candidate can bring to the overall Board composition.

Objectives for achieving Board diversity are reviewed on a regular 
basis. On gender diversity, the Board is committed to maintaining 
at least four women Board members and over time will aim to 
reach 50 per cent representation of men and women on the 
Board to match the 50 per cent ambition that the Group has set 
for women in senior roles. Reflecting these aspirations, the Board 
will also aim to meet the recommendations set out by the 
FTSE Women Leaders. Currently, this Policy is not applied to Board 
Committees individually, although we strive to apply similar 
representation across the Committees. The Board is comfortable 
that the diversity of the Board is reflected across Committee 
memberships and that this remains an ongoing consideration. 
The representation of women on the Board is currently 45 per cent 
(based on five directors being women and six directors being 
men). As at 31 December 2023, the Group meets the three board 
diversity targets identified under Listing Rule 9.8.6R(9), namely that 
the Board comprises at least 40 per cent women, at least one of 
the chair, the chief executive, the senior independent director or 
the chief financial officer is a woman and at least one member 
of the Board is from a Minority Ethnic background. Further 
information disclosed in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(10) 
and (11) can be found on page 136.

The Group has also set a target of 13 per cent of senior roles to 
be held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic executives by 2025. 
The Board will therefore aim to reflect this goal with regard to 
Board members. As at 31 December 2023, the Board continues to 
meet the Board level recommendation of the Parker Review with 
two Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Board members. As noted, 
the Board places high emphasis on ensuring the development 
of diversity in the senior management roles within the Group 
and supports and oversees the Group’s ambition of achieving 
50 per cent of senior roles held by women by 2025 and of 
13 per cent of senior roles held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic 
colleagues by 2025 (including a minimum of 3 per cent of senior 
roles being held by Black Heritage colleagues). This is 
underpinned by a range of policies within the Group to help 
provide mentoring and development opportunities for women 
and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues and to ensure 
unbiased career progression opportunities. Progress on this 
objective is monitored by the Board and built into its assessment 
of executive performance.

As at 31 December 2023, the representation of women within 
the Group Executive Committee and their direct reports was 
46.2 per cent in total (with 46.7 per cent for the Group Executive 
Committee and 46.2 per cent for their direct reports). The 
representation of women across all senior roles was 40.1 per cent, 
and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation in senior roles 
was 11.3 per cent. The Group’s Race Action Plan, which was 
launched during 2020, aims to drive cultural change, recruitment 
and progression across the Group. This includes a goal to 
increase Black representation in senior roles from 0.6 per cent 
to at least 3 per cent by 2025. As at 31 December 2023, we have 
increased the representation of Black Heritage colleagues in 
senior roles to 1.7 per cent. Further details of the Race Action Plan, 
and the Group’s further achievements in championing inclusion 
and diversity in its widest sense, can be found on page 31.

A copy of the Policy is available on the social sustainability page 
on our website and further information on the Board’s broader 
approach to inclusion and diversity as part of its strategic 
priorities and continued investment in being a leading inclusive 
employer can be found on pages 30 to 32.

Audit Committee report

The integrity of our financial disclosures 
and the effectiveness of the internal control 
environment are key priorities for 
the Group

Sarah Legg
Chair, 
Audit Committee

The Group’s IFRS 17 transition and the 
impacts of external volatility have been 
key priorities during the year.

Key activities in 2023

•  Reviewing and approving the Group’s IFRS 17 transition 
document published in April 2023 and the new IFRS 17 
disclosures included within the Group’s annual report 
and accounts

•  Supporting the close working of the Committees of the 

Board on matters relevant to sustainability
•  Assessing the effects and action required on 

matters relevant to the remit of the Audit Committee 
(the Committee) as a consequence of external volatility

Q&A

Q  What role has the Committee played in supporting 

transformation within the Finance function?

A  The Committee has had the opportunity to review and challenge 
the plans and progress made with the Finance transformation 
and strategy, a multi-year programme that is critical to the 
success of Finance and the wider Group. The Committee has 
received regular updates from management on progress with 
the Finance transformation and has also heard from Internal 
and External Audit. The Committee has also had the opportunity 
to consider further areas which are key to supporting the 
transformation, including finance talent and succession plans.

Q  How has the Committee supported the Group’s sustainability 

reporting during the year?

A  Throughout the year, the Committee has remained close to the 
developments in narrative reporting and how this is continuing 
to translate into financial statement disclosures. Progress on 
enhanced reporting processes and control environment across 
the social and environmental spectrum has been monitored, 
alongside development of new targets through to internal 
monitoring and external disclosure. The Committee supports 
the commitment to continuous improvement in sustainability 
reporting, which will remain a priority in 2024 given the pace of 
change with external standards.

Q  Why has the work of the Committee been important in managing 

the impact of uncertainty on the Group’s pension schemes? 

A  With an uncertain economic environment, including increased 
interest rates, the Committee continued to focus on the key 
valuation inputs to the accounting presentation of the Group’s 
pension schemes. This included consideration of the underlying 
assumptions, in particular those relating to demographics and 
rates of inflation. The Committee noted the results of the 
triennial valuation of the main schemes as at 31 December 2022, 
which were also shared with the Board.

Introduction
I am pleased to report on how the Committee has discharged
its responsibilities during what has been another busy year  
and I would like to start by thanking Committee members for  
their ongoing contributions to and continued support of the 
Committee’s work. The Committee has also benefited from the 
participation of Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors, who attend the 
Committee as observers, bringing insight on matters relevant to 
the Ring-Fenced Banks. Also, I would like to welcome Amanda 
Mackenzie, who became a member of the Committee on 
1 January 2024.

The Committee has again during 2023 worked closely with other 
Board Committees, in particular in matters relating to the Group’s 
sustainability ambitions and climate-related disclosures. I am 
pleased to report that the joint Audit and Risk Forum, which was 
formed in 2022 to discuss governance topics of common interest, 
met again in 2023 providing an opportunity for both Committees 
to share thinking on areas of common interest. 

Looking forward to 2024, in addition to our core responsibilities,  
the Committee will continue to monitor areas of continuous 
improvement on an end-to-end basis, and the audit plan to 
deliver focus from a risk perspective. 

Committee purpose and responsibilities
The purpose of the Committee is to monitor and review the formal
arrangements established by the Board in respect of the integrity 
of the financial reporting and narrative reporting of the Group 
and the Company. The Committee also monitors and reviews  
the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external 
audit functions, the effectiveness of the internal controls and the 
risk management framework and the adequacy and security of 
the arrangements for whistleblowing.

This includes the statutory audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and the independence of the statutory external 
auditor. The Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges 
its responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board, 
all of which have been accepted during the year. A full list of 
responsibilities is detailed in the Committee’s terms of reference, 
 on the 
which can be found on our corporate governance page 
Group’s website. 

In satisfying its purpose, the Committee undertakes the functions 
detailed within Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 7.1.3R. 
During the year the Committee considered a number of matters 
relating to the Group’s financial reporting. These matters are 
summarised on the following pages, including discussion of the 
conclusions the Committee reached, and the key factors 
considered in reaching these conclusions. 

In addition, the Committee considered a number of other  
matters not related directly to financial reporting, including 
internal controls, internal audit and external audit. These matters 
are also discussed in detail on the final page of the report.

Audit Committee report continued

Committee composition, skills,  
experience and operation
The Committee acts independently of the executive to ensure
the interests of shareholders are properly protected in relation 
to financial reporting and internal control.

The Committee undertook an annual review of its effectiveness, 
the findings of which, together with the outcomes of the Board 
evaluation process as relevant to the Committee (which, for 2023, 
was internally facilitated) were considered by the Committee at
its January 2024 meeting. It was considered that the performance 
of the Committee continues to be effective. 

All members of the Committee are independent non-executive 
directors with competence in the financial sector, and their 
biographies can be found on pages 74 to 75. Sarah Legg is a 
Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants 
and of the Association of Corporate Treasurers, with extensive 
knowledge of financial markets, treasury, risk management and 
international accounting standards. She is a member having 
recent and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and is the Audit Committee 
financial expert for SEC purposes.

During the course of the year, the Committee held separate 
sessions with the internal and external audit teams, without 
members of the executive management present. 

Matters considered during 2023

While the Committee’s membership comprises the non-executive
directors noted on page 79, all non-executive directors may

Financial reporting
During the year, and in relation to the year ended 31 December 2023, the Committee considered the following issues in relation
to the Group’s financial statements and disclosures, with input from management, the Risk division, Group Internal Audit and the
external auditor.

Committee review and conclusion

Allowance for 
impairments on loans 
and advances

31 December 2023: 
£4,084 million

31 December 2022: 
£4,903 million

The Group’s impairment 
provision is dependent  
on management’s 
judgements on matters 
such as future interest 
rates, house prices and 
unemployment rates, 
as well as its assessment 
of the current financial 
position of its customers. 

During the year, the Committee has reviewed the level of provision held for 
expected credit losses (ECL) by the Group and the judgements and estimates 
used to calculate the provision. The most significant judgemental adjustment  
in 2023 has been in respect of inflationary pressures and interest rate risk. 
The Group continues to benefit from investment in ECL models, overseen by 
the Committee, to deliver impact assessments and sensitivity analysis more  
quickly and accurately. This has been particularly relevant given the constantly 
changing economic outlook in 2023. Note 24 to the financial statements 
includes details of the Group’s ECLs allowances, including those resulting from 
judgemental adjustments (31 December 2023: £28 million; 31 December 2022: 
£330 million), and a discussion of the improvements the Group has made  
to its consideration of climate risk on the ECL The Committee has reviewed 
management’s rationale for these provisions and has challenged whether their 
inclusion and quantification are appropriate. It also considered management’s 
assessment of climate risk impacts on ECL and the conclusion that no 
adjustment was required. 

Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that the impairment provision 
and the disclosures provided in the financial statements were appropriate.

Key issues

Committee review and conclusion

The directors are required 
to confirm whether they 
have a reasonable 
expectation that the 
Company and the Group 
will be able to continue 
to operate and meet their 
liabilities as they fall due 
for a specified period. 
The viability statement 
must also disclose the 
basis for the directors’ 
conclusions and explain 
why the period chosen 
is appropriate.

The Group has open tax 
matters which require it to 
make judgements about 
the most likely outcome 
for the purposes of 
calculating its tax position.

The value of the Group’s 
defined benefit pension 
plan obligations is 
determined using both 
financial and 
demographic 
assumptions.

Determining the value 
of the Group’s liabilities 
arising from insurance 
and participating 
investment contracts 
requires management 
to make significant 
estimates for both 
economic and non-
economic actuarial 
assumptions.

Management judgement 
is used to determine the 
expected costs of 
remediation and, where 
appropriate, the related 
administration costs.

The Committee assisted the Board in determining the appropriateness 
of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and in performing the 
assessment of the viability of the Company and the Group. These assessments 
were based on the Group’s operating, funding and capital plans which included 
consideration of climate-related matters on the Group’s performance and its 
projected funding and capital position. The Committee also took into account 
the results of the Group’s stress testing activities (page 143), its principal risks 
(page 40 to 43) and its emerging risks (page 44).

Conclusion: The Committee determined that the going concern basis of 
accounting was appropriate and advised the Board that three years was  
a suitable period of review for the viability statement and that the viability 
statement could be provided. The viability statement is disclosed within the 
directors’ report on page 45.

The Committee reviewed management’s assessment of the Group’s uncertain 
tax positions, which took into account the views of the relevant tax authorities 
and any external advice it received. In particular, it considered the Group’s claim 
for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary.

Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that the provisions and disclosures 
made in respect of uncertain tax positions were appropriate.

The Committee reviewed the process used by management to determine 
appropriate assumptions to calculate the Group’s defined benefit liabilities. 
These included the discount rate, the future rate of inflation and expected 
mortality rates.

Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that management had used 
appropriate assumptions that reflected the Group’s most recent experience 
and were consistent with market data and other information.

The Committee considered updates from management and from the Group’s 
Insurance Audit Committee summarising its activities, which included a review 
of the economic and non-economic assumptions made by management to 
determine the carrying value of Group’s liabilities arising from insurance and 
participating investment contracts. The assumptions discussed were in respect 
of workplace pension persistency, annuitant longevity and expenses.

Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that the assumptions used to 
calculate the Group’s liabilities arising from insurance and participating 
investment contracts were appropriate.

The Committee has received regular updates on the Group’s conduct risk 
matters and the progress it has made including updates on HBOS Reading 
and in relation to the recently announced FCA review of historical motor finance 
commission arrangements. 

Conclusion: The Committee has considered management’s assessment 
of the Group’s provision for conduct-related matters and was satisfied that 
the provisions were appropriate, noting a high level of uncertainty in relation 
to these estimates.

Other significant matters
The following matters were also considered by the Committee.

The Committee was satisfied that internal controls over financial 
reporting were appropriately designed and operating effectively.

Risk management and internal control systems
Full details of the internal control and risk management systems 
in relation to the financial reporting process are given within the 
risk management section on pages 138 to 196. Specific related 
matters that the Committee considered for the year included:

•  The effectiveness of systems for internal control, financial 

reporting and risk management

•  The extent of the work undertaken across the Group to ensure 
that the control environment continued to operate effectively

•  The major findings of internal investigations into control 
weaknesses, fraud or misconduct and management’s 
response, along with any control deficiencies identified 
through the assessment of the effectiveness of the internal 
controls over financial reporting under the US Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act (SOX). Specifically the Committee continued to closely 
monitor the deficiencies identified in respect of privileged  
and user access across certain business applications and 
associated IT infrastructure and the Group’s plans to address 
the control findings identified

Risk-weighted assets (RWA) and regulatory reporting
The focus on the quality of regulatory reporting continues to be 
high on the PRA’s agenda. To date, a number of skilled person 
independent reviews have been commissioned across the 
industry to review the governance, controls and processes 
supporting the regulatory reporting framework within firms.
Across the first, second and third lines of defence management 
continue to focus on strengthening the control environment in 
regulatory reporting with a link to longer-term and strategic 
initiatives also being considered. 

The ongoing programme of external assurance on regulatory 
reporting commissioned by the Committee has to date focused 
on risk-weighted assets. Management have provided regular 
updates to the Committee over the year to highlight progress 
made in improving the reporting control environment across  
a number of regulatory reports.

Audit Committee report continued

IFRS 17
The Committee has received updates throughout the year on 
both the financial and controls impact of the Group’s adoption  
of IFRS 17. It reviewed the Group’s transition document published  
in April 2023, which included the significant judgements and 
estimates, including those relating to the drawdown feature 
added to some of the Group’s pension products, that affect the 
reported amounts and the accounting policy choices made  
by the Group.

Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance
During the year the Committee has received updates on the 
responses of the Government and the Financial Reporting Council 
(FRC) to the white paper ‘Restoring trust in audit and corporate 
governance’. The Committee recognises the importance of  
an effective corporate reporting and governance framework  
that is proportionate and does not significantly impact the 
attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business. The Committee 
is supportive of the Government’s decision to withdraw the draft 
Companies (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2023 so that it can deliver a more targeted, simpler 
and effective framework for both businesses and investors.

The Group notes that on 22 January 2024 the FRC issued a revised 
UK Corporate Governance Code which will be effective from 
1 January 2025 apart from the updates to the provision on  
the monitoring and review of a company’s risk management  
and internal control framework which are effective from  
1 January 2026. 

Speak Up (the Group’s whistleblowing service)
The Committee received and considered reports from 
management on the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements.  
The Committee reviewed the reports to ensure there are 
arrangements in place which colleagues can use in confidence 
and without fear of retaliation. In addition, colleagues are able  
to report concerns about inappropriate and unacceptable 
practices; these arrangements are well publicised and there  
is proportionate and independent investigation of such matters 
or appropriate follow-up. The Committee reported on its 
consideration of whistleblowing arrangements to the Board.

Sustainability reporting 
The Committee discussed and challenged the Group’s progress 
with sustainability related reporting. Developments in UK 
companies regulation requirements for climate-related financial 
disclosure alongside emerging environmental sustainability 
reporting frameworks have been considered, assessing the near 
term and future impacts on external disclosures. As previously, the 
Committee benefited from a dedicated teach-in session focusing 
on the Group’s capabilities and progress with the production of 
climate and sustainability reporting and associated data, the 
enhanced control environment, and the developments with 
governance and assurance. Further discussion on sustainability 
governance can be found on pages 84 to 85. 

Group Internal Audit
In monitoring the activity, role and effectiveness of the internal 
audit function and their audit programme the Committee:
•  Approved the annual audit plan and budget, including resource
•  Reviewed progress against the plan through the year with 

updates including quarterly reports on the activities 
undertaken and six-monthly updates as a result of reviews  
by the internal audit Quality Assurance team

•  Considered the major findings of significant internal audits, 

and management’s response

•  Monitored the progress of internal audit’s coverage of key risk 
themes across the Group, including strategic delivery, cultural 
transformation, cost of living, Consumer Duty, supplier 
partnerships, capital efficiency, transition to net zero and  
data quality

•  Continued to monitor completion of enhancements identified 

by the third party who assessed the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function in 2021

100 Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Finance strategy and transformation
Significant investment has been committed to transform  
the Finance function, including the near-term deliverables  
of a new General Ledger across the Group in 2025 in addition  
to the transformation of processes and procedures across  
the financial data landscape and costs and investment 
management. This multi-year transformation journey 
incorporates significant improvements and efficiencies to the 
Group, with the Committee receiving timely updates with regard 
to the proposed plans, progress with them, and the associated 
financial and non-financial benefits.

Auditor independence and remuneration
The Committee is responsible for establishing the Group’s policies 
and procedures designed to protect the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor. In April 2023, the Committee 
reviewed its non-audit services policy; no substantive changes 
were made to the policy.

The policy details those services that the auditor is permitted 
to carry out and pre-approves certain of these services provided 
the fee is below a threshold; all other permitted services must  
be specifically approved in advance by the Committee. Prior  
to the engagement of the auditor for a permitted service, the 
policy requires that senior management confirms whether the 
Committee has pre-approved the service or specific approval is 
required. The total amount of fees paid to the auditor for both audit 
and non-audit related services in 2023 and further information 
on the policy is disclosed in note 17 to the financial statements.

External auditor
Following an external audit tender in 2018, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) 
was appointed as auditor of the Company and the Group with 
effect from the 2021 financial year. Mike Lloyd is the statutory audit 
partner for the Group and attends all meetings of the Committee.

The Committee oversees the relationship with the external  
auditor including its terms of engagement and remuneration  
and monitors its independence and objectivity. During 2023,  
the Committee reviewed Deloitte’s audit plan, including the 
underlying methodology, and Deloitte’s risk identification 
processes. In its assessment of Deloitte’s performance and 
effectiveness, the Committee has considered: Deloitte’s 
interactions with the Committee; the responses to a questionnaire 
issued to the Group’s businesses, Finance, Risk and Internal Audit; 
and the FRC’s Audit Quality Inspection Report published in 
July 2023. The Committee concluded that it was satisfied with 
the auditor’s performance and recommended to the Board a 
proposal for the reappointment of the auditor at the Company’s 
annual general meeting.

Statutory Audit Services compliance
The Company and the Group confirm compliance with the 
provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, 
which relates to the frequency and governance of tenders for the 
appointment of the external auditor and the setting of a policy  
on the provision of non-audit services, for the year to 31 December 
2023. There are no plans as at the date of this report to conduct  
a tender exercise for external audit services.

Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard
While not mandatory the Group is broadly compliant with Audit 
Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard published 
by the FRC in May 2023.

Board Risk Committee report 

Operational resilience and sound risk 
management are fundamental to the 
strength of the Group

Catherine Woods
Chair, Board Risk 
Committee

Delivery of the Group’s strategic and

management of change and execution risks

•  Considered the impacts of the rising cost of living, higher 

interest rates and inflation, macroeconomic uncertainties, 
and geopolitical risks on both the Group and its customers
•  Overseeing the embedding of the Group’s operational risk  
and control framework and discussing evolution of the 
broader risk framework

Q &A 

Q   How has the Board Risk Committee (the Committee) assessed 
the challenges and uncertainties of the external environment, 
and the potential impacts of these on the Group’s strategy 
and its customers?

A   The Committee is acutely aware of the breadth of challenges 

which the external environment and ongoing macroeconomic 
and geopolitical uncertainties continue to present. The 
Committee continues to use deep dives to focus on specific 
topics of interest. Areas such as credit and market risk, and the 
associated impacts of continued high interest rates and 
inflation, climate risk, cyber and data risks and economic crime 
prevention have all featured highly on the Committee’s agenda 
during the year, with consideration being given to actions being 
taken by management to not only mitigate risks, but to ensure 
appropriate support for customers and businesses. Further 
information is set out on the following pages, within the 
commentary on each risk type.

Q   In recognition of the external environment, what further 

consideration has the Committee given to progress with 
implementation of the Group’s strategic transformation and how 
successful delivery of the transformation could be impacted? 

A   The Committee received regular progress updates on the 

roup’s strategic transformation throughout the year. It also 
G
onsidered a number of deep dives on the Group’s control 
c
nvironment, together with a range of areas core to ensuring 
e
he Group’s operational resilience is maintained. This ensures 
t
he Committee has an appropriate view of overall progress  
t
nd visibility of core areas such as the Group’s critical business 
a
rocesses and important business services. These updates  
p
nd deep dives provide the Committee with the opportunity to 
a
hallenge management on progress and action being taken  
c
o mitigate risks. Further information on a number of these areas 
t
s covered throughout this report.
i

Q  What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2024?

A   The Committee will continue to focus on broadly the same 

areas as have been central to its discussions this year. As part of 
the Committee’s forward planning of activities, regular reviews 
are undertaken of areas that the Committee wishes to give 
additional focus to through, for example, the use of deep dives. 
This provides an appropriate balance between forward 
planning and flexibility, helping ensure focus on the Group’s 
most material risk types and any other areas of specific interest. 
The year ahead will see a broad range of topics covered, 
with these anticipated to include areas such as operational 
resilience, the Group’s control environment, credit reviews in  
key sectors, climate risk and people risks, amongst others.

Introduction
I am pleased to report on how the Committee has discharged  
its responsibilities during the year and would like to thank fellow 
Committee members for their valued contributions throughout 
the year. I also take this opportunity to welcome Cathy Turner, 
who was appointed as a member of the Committee with effect 
from 1 February 2024. The external environment continued to 
present a variety of challenging, and evolving, considerations for 
the Committee, with areas such as cost of living and continued 
high interest rates, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic 
uncertainties which notably included the failure of a small 
number of banks, driving impacts across the broader economy. 

The Committee has continued to focus on risks related to delivery 
of the Group’s strategy, including various aspects of operational 
and technology resilience, data and cyber risks, people risks and 
supply chain management, together with overall change and 
execution risk. Additional oversight is also given to a number of 
these areas through the IT and Cyber Advisory Forum, which 
supports the Committee. 

Consideration has also been given to credit risk, with deep dives 
across various areas of the business, alongside regular reporting 
and updates from the Chief Risk Officer assessing the overall 
credit environment and economic crime where the Committee 
considered the impacts and mitigating actions being taken.  
The Committee was also kept updated on progress with 
implementation of the Group’s Consumer Duty Programme 
and progress on new prudential modelling requirements relating 
to credit risk capital models and market risk models. Each of these 
areas is covered in more detail throughout this report.

Committee purpose and responsibilities
The Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk governance 
and oversight roles and responsibilities. The Committee is also 
responsible for ensuring the risk culture is fully embedded and 
supports at all times the Group’s agreed risk appetite, including 
the extent and categories of risk which the Board considers as 
acceptable for the Group to bear. A review and update of the 
Committee’s terms of reference was completed during the year, 
with no material changes being made. 

The Committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting its 
conclusions to the Board on the Group’s risk management 
framework, which captures risk principles, policies, 
methodologies, systems, processes, procedures and people.

Board Risk Committee report continued

This also includes the review of new, or material, amendments to 
risk principles and policies and overseeing any action resulting 
from material breaches of such policy. During the year, the 
Committee discussed the development of the Group’s broader 
risk management framework and risk taxonomy, which will be 
an area of further focus in 2024.

More details on the Group’s wider approach to risk management 
can be found in the risk management section on pages 137 to 196. 
Full details of the Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its 
terms of reference, which can be found on the corporate 
. on our website.
governance page 

Committee composition, skills, experience and 
operation
There were no changes to the membership of the Committee 
during the year. As announced on 25 January 2024, Cathy Turner, 
Senior Independent Director, was appointed as a member of the 
Committee with effect from 1 February 2024. Two of the three 
designated independent non-executive directors of the Ring-
Fenced Banks also attend meetings as observers in order to 
provide insights on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks 
when required and as part of their role in the Group’s overall 
governance structure. The Chief Risk Officer has full access to  
the Committee and attends all meetings. The Chief Internal 
Auditor and members of the executive also attend meetings as 
appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting 
attendance can be found on page 79.

The Committee undertook an annual review of its effectiveness, 
the findings of which, together with the outcomes of the Board 
evaluation process as relevant to the Committee (which, for 2023, 
was led by the Company Secretary), were considered by the 
Committee at its January 2024 meeting; it was considered that 
the performance of the Committee continues to be effective. 
Details of the Board evaluation process can be found on page 90.

As the most senior risk committee in the Group, the Committee 
interacts with other related risk committees, including the 
executive Group Risk Committee. These interactions help ensure 
the appropriate escalation of relevant matters to the Committee 
for review and consideration.

Matters considered by the Committee
During 2023, the Committee considered a wide range of risks 
facing the Group and its Ring-Fenced Banks, both current 
and forward-looking, across all key areas of risk management,  
in addition to risk culture and risk appetite. The Committee 
continues to focus on key risk topics through, for example,  
the use of deep dives to provide greater analysis of particular  
topics and associated risks.

The following pages provide a summary of the risks considered  
by the Committee, together with an outline of the material factors 
considered and the conclusions which were ultimately reached. 
The Committee continues to be supported by the IT and Cyber 
Advisory Forum, which dedicates additional time and resource to 
reviewing and challenging risks associated with IT infrastructure, 
IT strategy, IT resilience and cyber risks. The Chair and other 
members of the Committee attend this Forum.

The Board Risk Committee Chair is a member of the Audit 
Committee, in addition to the Audit Committee Chair being  
a member of the Board Risk Committee; this close interaction 
continues to help ensure that common issues of interest are 
addressed appropriately. A further Group-wide Audit and Risk 
Committee Forum was held during the year, following a similar 
forum in 2022. This provided an opportunity for members of  
both Committees to discuss key areas of common interest  
and enhances interaction across these Committees. Further 
information about this Forum can be found on page 92. There 
continues to be regular interaction with other Board Committees, 
in particular, with the Responsible Business Committee on  
climate risk and Consumer Duty, and with the Remuneration 
Committee on the alignment of remuneration to risk 
performance. This is further illustrated in the table of Board 
Committee cross-membership set out on page 89 of the 
corporate governance report. 

The Committee also reviewed regular updates from the non-
Ring-Fenced Bank and Insurance sub-groups, headed up by 
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and Scottish Widows Group 
Limited respectively, summarising key discussions and decisions 
taken at the relevant entities’ risk committees.

Rectifications  
and complaints 

The Group’s management 
of customer rectifications; 
resolving customer 
complaints in a timely 
and fair manner, together 
with eradicating the 
complaint causes 
through root cause 
analysis.

During 2023, the Committee received updates on the Group’s complaints and 
rectifications performance. For rectifications, the Committee has been kept 
informed of progress in dealing with customer remediation and process 
improvement activity as well as any new rectifications being identified. The 
Committee has also been appraised of key themes and progress against 
complaint-related appetite metrics, performance relative to peers and the 
challenges faced in the current landscape. Further investment has been 
allocated to improving the efficiency and efficacy of complaint handling. 
The Committee has also considered regular updates in relation to historical 
motor finance commission arrangements.

Conclusion: This will continue to be a key area of focus for the Committee. In 
particular, supporting the actions being taken to improve time taken to handle 
complaints and rectifications, deliver good outcomes for customers and to 
ensure that lessons are learned to minimise future events.

Committee review and conclusions

Consumer Duty

Implementation and 
embedding of the FCA’s 
new Consumer Duty 
rules across the Group.

The Committee has received updates on the Consumer Duty Programme  
during 2023. The Group’s implementation plan was approved by the Responsible 
Business Committee in July in line with FCA requirements. As a critical element  
of Consumer Duty, it is vital that focus remains on the delivery of the key cultural 
initiatives, the development of Group management information reporting, 
enhancing customer communication and third party requirements. There  
will be ongoing engagement and transparency with regulators through 
quarterly meetings.

Conclusion: The Committee recognises the significance of the embedding 
of the Consumer Duty requirements and will monitor the ongoing delivery 
and evolution as well as the closed book July 2024 delivery date.

Financial risks – covering credit and market risk 

Commercial credit 
quality 

Risks and external threats 
to commercial credit 
performance, including 
impacts related to a 
higher interest rate 
environment, together 
with sectors potentially 
exposed to climate risks.

The Committee provided oversight of the Commercial Banking portfolio via 
regular credit quality papers, sector deep dives and spotlight reviews, including 
large single name exposures. Specific consideration is given to topics on a risk 
profile basis and this year there were deep dives on the Group’s Agriculture 
portfolio and exposures to both the shadow banking sector and Liability-Driven 
Investments (LDIs). Discussion was also held regarding progress against 
roadmaps to fully embed risk-adjusted returns into active portfolio 
management as well as credit strategies for new origination flow. Detailed 
reviews allowed the Committee to assess risk levels and credit exposures,  
as well as clients requiring closer risk management. This includes the active 
engagement of the Business Support teams with Commercial customers. 

The Committee also reviewed emerging risks across a range of sectors, 
including those considered more vulnerable to the wider economic backdrop  
or structural change and those exposed to increased levels of physical and 
transitional climate risk; specific spotlights focused on utilities and real estate 
office exposures.

Conclusion: While recognising the risks in the portfolio, the Committee was 
satisfied that management was continuing to take appropriate action to 
mitigate and address current and horizon risks, while preparing to manage  
an expected increase in defaults in 2024 as a result of economic headwinds 
including inflation and higher interest rates.

Consumer credit 
quality 

Risks relating to 
Consumer lending, 
including impacts of 
higher cost of living,  
a higher interest rate 
environment and  
climate risks. Customer 
affordability and 
indebtedness is  
a key focus.

The Committee reviewed the performance of the Consumer portfolio via regular 
credit quality updates. Consideration is given to topics on a risk profile basis 
and this year additional focus was given to the Homes and Transport portfolios, 
as well as progress against the roadmap to fully embed risk-adjusted returns 
into active portfolio management as well as credit strategies for new origination 
flow. Enhanced monitoring is in place to provide early warning of any adverse 
trends requiring further action and the Group continues to closely monitor and 
manage higher risk segments, such as customers with higher indebtedness 
levels or lower incomes. Specific attention has been given to mortgages, given 
the impact of increased interest rates on variable rate customers and those 
coming to the end of fixed rate periods. 

Conclusion: The Committee is satisfied that appropriate lending controls and 
monitoring are in place to control risks across the Consumer lending portfolios 
and that there is an effective framework in place for ongoing risk management 
as well as significant support for customers in financial difficulty.

Balance sheet 
management and 
structural hedge

Management of the 
Group’s balance sheet, 
liquidity and structural 
hedging programme 
in an environment of 
uncertain customer 
behaviour, high interest 
rates and high-profile 
market events.

A key focus for the Group in 2023 has been the management of the balance 
sheet and resulting market and liquidity risks through periods of significant 
volatility driven by higher interest rates and uncertainty over customer 
behaviour in a world of increasing digitalisation. Updates were presented to the 
Committee on the LDI crisis, bank failures and the growth of the shadow banking 
sector, as well as the monitoring and management of risks due to changes in 
the volume and mix of customer deposits. The Committee discussed the risks 
associated with the current strategy, the management of those risks and the 
lessons that the Group has learned from the events of the year.

Conclusion: Close monitoring of the associated risks continues and any 
relevant lessons learned were incorporated into the measurement and 
management of market and liquidity risk. The Committee was satisfied that 
management was taking the appropriate actions to monitor and mitigate  
the risks, while recognising that this will remain a key priority in 2024 as the 
macroeconomic outlook and global political environment continue to evolve.

Key activities for the year continued 

Risk type

Key issues

Committee review and conclusions

Model risk 

Model risk continues to  
be an area of significant 
activity and importance, 
both internally and 
externally.

The Committee continued to receive updates on the progress to satisfy  
new prudential modelling requirements relating to credit risk capital models 
(primarily the new Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) IV regulations) and 
market risk models within Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition activities. 
Committee oversight was also focused on wider issues such as the model risk 
management and governance approach and the increased resources required 
for these as we proactively enhance the framework and capabilities to meet 
increasing internal and external demands, including those relating to Supervisory 
Statement 1/23. The Committee was also kept abreast of model risk management 
activity relating to advanced analytics (such as machine learning/artificial 
intelligence) models and associated aspects such as data ethics and climate, 
as the Group continues to develop its capability in these areas.

Conclusion: The Committee is comfortable that the development of new model 
types is subject to appropriate risk control and will continue to oversee the 
development of the management and control framework for model risk,  
as required by the Supervisory Statement 1/23. The Committee will continue  
to oversight CRD IV and IBOR prudential change related submissions.

Climate risk

Climate risk

Risks associated with the 
Group’s role in supporting 
the transition to net zero 
and evolving regulatory 
expectations.

The Committee continues to be engaged on the Group’s progress in developing 
climate risk capabilities, particularly in relation to current and developing 
regulatory requirements, as well as the key choices faced as part of the Group’s 
environmental sustainability strategy. Regular updates and periodic deep  
dives are provided to support the Committee’s oversight.

In 2023, the Committee was provided with an overview of activity across the 
Group to meet climate-related regulation requirements. Regular climate risk 
updates have also included management information covering key physical 
and transition risks across the Consumer, Commercial and Insurance portfolios. 
The Committee also discussed the Group’s implementation of its net zero strategy 
and the key strategic levers and participation choices facing different areas  
of the business. 

Conclusion: The Committee recognises the challenges associated with net zero 
and dependencies on the wider external landscape, however, maintains the 
importance of the need to support the transition as part of the Group’s wider 
purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. This will require difficult choices, which will 
continue to be monitored and discussed, as well an ongoing capability 
development, building on further progress made over the last 12 months.

Operational risk

Operational risk 
management 
framework

Completing the 
embedding of  
One Risk and Control 
Self-Assessment 
(One RCSA) to strengthen 
risk culture, simplify  
the risk and control 
environment, achieve 
better customer 
outcomes, increasing 
the pace of change and 
operational efficiency.

The Committee was provided with regular updates on embedding of One RCSA 
ahead of completion by year-end 2023. The Committee noted the emerging 
benefits, with greater self-identification of issues by business teams, fewer 
repeat audit findings and continued reduction in the number of material events. 
One RCSA laid the foundations for a broader evolution of the Group’s risk 
management framework. The evolution has been a key area of Committee 
focus in 2023. Defined targets were cascaded on the automation of controls 
over a three-year time horizon, with each business unit CEO presenting 
individual plans to the Committee.

Whilst it is fit for purpose, the Committee has also discussed the evolution  
of the broader risk framework, to ensure it truly enables the Group’s strategic 
ambitions. Proposals to change the Group’s risk taxonomy and reimagine the 
‘three lines of defence’ operating model were discussed and will shape activity 
into 2024.

Conclusion: The Committee recognises efforts to embed One RCSA and 
achieve a significant milestone in the Group’s risk and control management 
journey. This represents a strong foundation from which the Group can maintain 
ongoing control over its key risks, while seeking to optimise the associated 
people, processes and technology, to ensure risk and control can become  
a true enabler for the Group’s strategic ambitions.

Committee review and conclusions

Operational resilience 
(IT resilience, cyber, 
and supplier 
management)

Operational resilience 
remains one of the 
Group’s most important 
non-financial risks. 
We continue to enhance 
our resilience to better 
serve customers and 
to address regulatory 
priorities.

The Committee has received reports on the Group’s overall maturity against a 
suite of operational resilience capabilities and on the refinement of the impact 
tolerances of important business services. The Committee has also reviewed 
Group-wide self-assessments covering progress on the enhancements needed 
to ensure our important business services can be recovered within impact 
tolerance by March 2025 (in response to regulatory policy statements on 
operational resilience published in March 2021). Close attention has been  
paid to the Group’s management of its contracts with its suppliers to ensure 
resilience of services to customers. Given the significance of the risk to the 
Group, the Committee is supported by the IT and Cyber Advisory Forum 
specifically focused on IT and cyber risks.

Conclusion: The Committee has requested further specific updates on the 
progress of the Group-wide Operational Resilience Programme, the impact  
of investment on operational resilience and the way in which data is used to 
support management decisions around operational resilience.

Data risk 

Data strategy plans to 
remediate legacy and 
emerging risk challenges 
in the Group’s data 
control environment 
to enable strategic 
objectives.

Data risk continues to be an area of significant regulatory and media attention, 
particularly relating to new technologies such as artificial intelligence. Frequent 
updates have been provided to the Committee on the progress of the data 
strategy in response to legacy and emerging data risk challenges including  
on data quality and lineage controls and enhancing the Group’s governance 
framework e.g. around Data Ethics.

Conclusion: The Committee continues to be supportive of the data strategy  
and approach, recognising the complex roadmap of initiatives planned over  
a number of years. Delivery of the data strategy is critical, given data is a key 
enabler for good customer outcomes and the overall Group strategy.

People and health 
and safety risk

Managing people risks 
arising from the cultural 
transformation of the 
workforce will be critical 
to ensure we attract and 
retain the right skills and 
capabilities to deliver  
our strategy. 

People risk remains a key focus of the Committee, reflecting the scale and 
complexity of change required to the skills composition and size of our 
workforce. The Committee considered the current, emerging and horizon risks 
arising from the people plan and how these would be effectively monitored and 
managed with continued focus on culture, capability and capacity, colleague 
proposition, health and safety and wellbeing. The Committee also considered  
a deep dive on health and safety which highlighted enhancements to the 
framework, bringing more rigour and management focus to ensure we create  
a safe and healthy workplace.

Conclusion: The Committee supports the people plan and acknowledges that 
delivering the plan is critical to increasing our capability and capacity to deliver 
change faster as we move purposefully towards a high performing culture. 
People risk will remain a key area of focus in 2024 as the transformation  
journey continues.

Strategic 
transformation 
oversight

Risks associated with the 
extensive current and 
future Group strategic 
change agenda, 
recognising challenges 
faced in ensuring both 
successful delivery  
and implementation  
of change.

The Committee has reviewed the portfolio performance on a regular basis, 
focusing on the Board metric outcomes and underlying deliverables, which 
supports the Group’s strategic growth ambitions. The focus for 2023 has centred 
on embedding the new platform-based operating model and ensuring 
management is learning from the root causes of any delivery delays. The 
Committee, with the IT and Cyber Advisory Forum, also increased its monitoring 
of the safe delivery of change for important business services with dedicated 
deep dives undertaken throughout 2023, which is critical to ensure we avoid 
customer harm and minimise operational incidents. 

Conclusion: The Committee will continue to focus on the management of 
change and execution risk within appetite and on monitoring the outcomes 
being achieved. The Committee will review how the expected evolution of the 
platform model and agile change delivery approach is undertaken in 2024. 
Enhancing resilience in relation to our important business services remains 
a priority, ensuring that any strategic transformation delivered does not cause 
customer harm or compromise our operational resilience posture.

Fraud

The Group’s management 
of fraud risk, while 
continuing to minimise 
the impact on genuine 
customer journeys.

Money laundering 
and financial crime 

The Group’s management 
of financial crime risks 
and compliance with 
the UK’s anti-money 
laundering regime.

Other categories

Regulatory and 
legal risk

Managing regulatory  
and litigation risk is a key 
focus within the Group.

Fraud, accounting for over 40 per cent of all crime in the UK according to the 
Home Office policy paper (Fraud Strategy: stopping scams and protecting the 
public) published in May 2023, remains a priority for the Group. Updates were 
provided to the Committee in 2023 related to the Consumer fraud programme 
and the Group’s preparations for new Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) reforms. 
Committee members acknowledged the progress made and supported the 
ongoing focus on and investment into improved detection capabilities and 
customer fraud remediation. The Committee noted the investment ring-fenced 
to ensure the Group meets new PSR policy requirements coming into force  
in 2024. 

Conclusion: The Committee welcomed the progress made and supports the 
forward plan for 2024 to improve detection capabilities and customer fraud 
response and remediation. The Committee will continue to be updated in 2024 
on the delivery of the PSR policy requirements.

Financial crime continues to be a source of significant external threats and 
remains a regulatory priority. Updates have been provided to the Committee 
throughout 2023 including the annual Money Laundering Reporting Officer’s 
Report, an update on the Group’s Ongoing Know Your Customer programme 
and a Group-wide Economic Crime deep dive review. Committee members 
have been supportive of the actions being taken by management; and  
noted that as financial crime risks continue to evolve and increase there is  
a continued need to prioritise investment to maintain an effective, risk-based 
and threat-led control environment. 

Conclusion: The Committee is supportive of the actions being taken to manage 
financial crime risks and supports management’s continued investment to 
remain effective in the face of increasing threats. The Committee will continue 
to be updated in 2024 on key deliverables across the programme.

The Committee has provided oversight to ensure effective controls are in place  
to comply with existing regulatory obligations, including consideration of these  
at an individual legal entity level. The Committee considered regular updates  
on emerging regulatory and legal risks. In addition, the Committee has continued 
to closely monitor a number of significant regulatory change and oversight 
programmes, such as risk-free rates transition; model risk management and 
ring-fencing reforms. In particular, the Committee has also reviewed regular 
progress updates on the enhancements to the Group’s Recovery and Resolution 
planning, including fire drill activities.

Conclusion: The Group places significant focus on complex regulatory changes 
and litigation risk, as well as ensuring effective horizon scanning of upcoming 
trends and evolving risks. The Committee has discussed the topics raised and  
will continue to closely monitor compliance with regulatory requirements in 2024.

Emerging and 
strategic risk 
categories

Continued evolution of 
the Group’s emerging  
risk landscape and 
methodology with greater 
focus on geopolitical risks. 
Incorporation of strategic 
risk themes into the 
Group’s business 
planning process.

The Group’s focus on the emerging risk landscape and assessment approach 
has continued to be refined during 2023. A series of deep dives on the top 
emerging risk themes from 2022 have taken place during the year. In addition, 
geopolitical risks have been a focus and how these may generate second order 
impacts for the Group. The 2023 emerging risk landscape has been simplified, 
combining emerging and strategic risks into a single view. The Committee  
is supportive of the updated approach and approved the revised emerging  
risk themes.

Conclusion: Ensuring the Group understands the emerging risk landscape  
and its level of preparedness remains a key priority. In 2024, the Committee  
will continue to monitor the emerging and strategic risk trends, supported by 
targeted deep dives, considering their potential impacts and mitigating actions.

Key activities in 2023

•  Becoming a purpose-driven organisation
•  Tackling social and environmental challenges
•  Engaging our employees to deliver cultural change 
•  Delivering on our duty to customers and stakeholders

Q &A 

Q     What are the Responsible Business Committee’s (Committee) 

priorities for 2024?

A   W  e made significant strides in transforming the Group and 

embedding purpose in our decision making and behaviours in 
2023. The next year will be important in ensuring we continue to 
support colleagues, customers and communities and deliver 
on our focus areas of providing access to quality housing, 
unlocking regional development, greening the built 
environment and promoting financial resilience and inclusion. 

Q     What role does nature play in your environmental 

sustainability ambitions?

A    P  rotecting and restoring nature goes hand-in-hand with 
supporting the low carbon transition and Helping Britain 
Prosper. We’ve made strong progress this year, building an 
expert team and hiring our first Group Head of Nature. In 2024, 
we will be working with colleagues, customers and clients to 
manage our nature-related risks, capitalise on opportunities 
and embed nature into our decision making.

Introduction
I am pleased to report on the Committee’s work in 2023 and 
I would like to thank members for their contributions. We will 
continue to review progress against our inclusion and diversity 
aspirations and rigorously support our sustainability plans in 2024. 
The strong foundations we have laid will continue to shape how 
we do business to create a more sustainable and inclusive future. 
This is a key part of how we will grow our business profitably 
and provide long-term, sustainable value for shareholders  
and other stakeholders.

Committee purpose and responsibilities 
The purpose of the Committee is to support the Board in 
overseeing the Group’s policies, performance and priorities  
as a responsible business. We will continue our oversight of the 
Group’s work in 2024, as well as reacting to key emerging topics 
for our industry, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics. 
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on our  
corporate governance page 

 on the Group’s website. 

Environmental sustainability 
The Committee provides oversight of the Group’s environmental 
sustainability strategy, sharing responsibility with the Audit 
Committee and Board Risk Committee. In 2023, we recommended 
to the Board an updated environmental sustainability strategy and 
three new sector targets for road passenger transport, agriculture 
and commercial & residential real estate. We have also launched 
enhanced operational emissions goals, including a more 
ambitious direct carbon emissions reduction target alongside new 
water, waste and nature pledges. More detail on our sustainability 
progress can be found in the sustainability report 

.

Consumer Duty
The Committee is the designated body that fulfils the Board’s 
responsibility for Consumer Duty oversight. As the Board 
Consumer Duty champion, I worked alongside the Committee to 
provide oversight of the Group’s Consumer Duty implementation 
plan to meet the first of the FCA’s two Consumer Duty deadlines 
in July 2023 for new and open products. Consumer Duty sits at the 
heart of everything we do and we will continue our close work 
with the business as we approach the FCA’s second deadline for 
closed products in July 2024. 

Colleagues and culture 
Our colleagues play a vital role in the delivery of the Group’s 
strategic ambitions. The Committee, as the designated body for 
workforce engagement, supports the Group’s wider engagement 
strategy, reporting at least annually to the Board on the key 
themes and issues we’re hearing from our colleagues. This year 
we discussed the long-term journey we are on to transform 
our culture, with change readiness a key theme. Engaging our 
colleagues in our transformation is key to driving the Group’s 
success. Please refer to page 82 for more details on our colleague 
engagement activities. 

Diversity, equity and inclusion 
The Committee received regular updates on our diversity, 
equity and inclusion performance in 2023 and are pleased by 
the continued progress in increasing the representation of 
women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues in senior 
roles. The latest FTSE Women Leaders Review report confirmed 
women are represented in over 40 per cent of our senior roles, 
meeting the review’s recommendation. In April 2023, we also 
announced a further goal to double the representation of senior 
colleagues with a disability by 2025. We have asked the executive 
to continue to progress towards our commitments as we work to 
build a more inclusive organisation.

Committee composition, skills, experience  
and operation 
The Committee met on four occasions in 2023 and is composed 
of independent non-executive directors and is attended by the 
Group Chief Executive. It benefits from a range of perspectives, 
insight and experience, with representatives from Group Internal 
Audit and the Chief Operating Office attending meetings as 
appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting 
attendance can be found on page 79. Sarah Bentley joined the 
Responsible Business Committee of each of the Ring-Fenced 
Banks in January and I joined our Audit Committee to support  
the Committee’s sustainability-related reporting responsibilities. 

The findings of the internal annual review of effectiveness were 
considered by the Committee at its January 2024 meeting. 
Based on the evaluation, the feedback was that the performance 
of the Committee continues to be effective.

Remuneration Committee
Chair’s statement

Cathy Turner
Chair, Remuneration 
Committee

Throughout 2023 we have continued to 
support our people with the rising cost  
of living. We recognise the continued 
commitment of our colleagues and 
announced changes to our reward 
package providing greater certainty in 
what remains a fast-changing economic 
environment. This latest two-year pay  
deal means that between August 2022  
and April 2025 we will have provided  
a minimum £5,0001 pay award and £2,0001

108 Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Board, it is my pleasure to present the directors’ 
remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2023. I would 
also like to take this opportunity to thank Alan Dickinson for his 
commitment and contribution to the work of the Remuneration 
Committee (the Committee) during his time as Chair.

Supporting our customers and colleagues in 2023
Helping Britain Prosper has been central to all that the Group has 
done in 2023, focusing on delivering for customers, clients and 
shareholders. This has meant providing support through a tough 
and uncertain economic period which, whilst inflationary 
pressures have eased somewhat, remains an uncertain outlook 
for 2024 for many of our customers and colleagues. Our 
colleagues have worked tirelessly to support our customers, 
clients and communities as they continue to navigate this 
fast-changing environment. 

We remained committed to our ambition to be the Best Bank for 
Customers; we proactively targeted support for customers facing 
economic uncertainty, directly contacting around 675,000 
mortgage customers to encourage a review of their options, 
contacted 7.5 million customers since April 2022 to offer support 
and enhance financial resilience and, contacted more than  
15 million customers on their savings options.

The Group delivered a robust financial performance in 2023 
enabling a total ordinary dividend of 2.76 pence per share for 
2023 and its intention to implement an ordinary share buyback  
of up to £2.0 billion in 2024, benefiting our 2.2 million shareholders, 
including most of our employees.

Recognising the continued commitment of our colleagues, the 
Committee has reflected on how our overall reward package 
meets both their needs and the needs of the Group and, as a 
result, we have made a number of changes over 2023. For our 
more senior colleagues, including our executive directors, we  
are introducing greater performance differentiation in variable 
reward, including the return to a performance-based Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) for our Group Executive Committee members 
which will deliver stronger alignment and accountability for the 
delivery of our purpose-driven strategy. For our junior colleagues 
we’ve kept things simple, giving more certainty and delivering 
reward faster, with a continuing focus on supporting those 
impacted most by increased day-to-day living costs. 

Recognising the importance of certainty of earnings for many 
employees, in July 2023, we consolidated a significant portion of 
our annual bonus, the Group Performance Share (GPS) into base 
salary for around 32,000 colleagues. We also consolidated our  
4 per cent Flex cash allowance into base salary for the majority  
of colleagues, further simplifying their reward package.

Over the course of 2023 we have worked closely with our 
recognised unions, Accord and Unite, to agree an industry-
leading, multi-year pay deal for 2024 and 2025, reflecting our 
continued commitment to support colleagues and to help them 
plan for the future. To recognise the immediate cost of living 
challenges, we made a further £5001 payment in December 2023 
to around 44,000 colleagues who, including this payment, will 
receive average pay increases of between 9.1 per cent and  
14.4 per cent cumulatively over the two years. The overall increase 
to our total pay costs over this two-year period will be lower at  
8.2 per cent, as we continue to direct spend to our lowest paid 
colleagues. As part of our multi-year pay commitment, we will 
also raise our minimum salary across the Group to £25,0001  
by April 2025, all part of delivering on our purpose of Helping 
Britain Prosper.

Our two-year pay deal means that between August 2022 and 
April 2025, we will have provided a minimum £5,0001 pay award 
and £2,0001 in cash support, worth a total of around 35 per cent  
of salary, for our colleagues at lower grades.

2023 variable reward outcomes
In 2023, we are seeing real evidence of strategic progress as  
we transform the business and have increased our confidence  
in delivering the 2024 and 2026 commitments and growth.  
As a result of our robust financial performance this year, the 
Committee has approved a GPS pool of £384 million. This is a 
lower absolute pool than in 2022 because of the consolidation 
referred to above. On a like-for-like basis, including the 
consolidation of variable pay, the 2023 pool would be higher  
than 2022. Ensuring colleagues share in the success of the  
Group is an important element of our remuneration approach.

The approved pool includes the impact of a provision for the 
potential impact of the recently announced FCA review into 
historical motor finance commission arrangements.

In 2021, Long Term Share Plan (LTSP) awards were granted to 
around 600 colleagues and the Committee has determined that 
these should vest in full. In making this decision, the Committee 
considered several elements to satisfy itself that the vesting is 
appropriate. It noted that, during the ‘pre-grant test’ this award 
was reduced by up to 40 per cent to reflect the Group’s 
performance in 2020, the share price at the time of award and the 
wider experience of our shareholders. Furthermore, the vesting is 
subject to a ‘pre-vest test’ consisting of three financial underpins 
and four key questions. Finally, there was careful consideration 
whether an adjustment for windfall gains would be appropriate 
and it was concluded that given the award was initially reduced 
by up to 40 per cent, granted at a share price of 39.3015 pence 
which is higher than the 31.2 pence over the pandemic period  
and consistent with our share price range over the performance 
period (33-55 pence), no windfall gain has arisen and therefore 
no further adjustment would be appropriate. More detail is 
provided on page 115.

Executive directors’ remuneration outcomes
Charlie Nunn, Group Chief Executive (GCE) continues to show 
strong leadership in all aspects of the business and consistently 
demonstrates the Group’s values. He has led the strategic and 
cultural transformation which has maintained momentum 
whilst the Group has also navigated a challenging external 
environment. Once again, Charlie has overseen the Group’s 
robust financial performance and achievement of broader Group 
balanced scorecard (BSC) targets whilst maintaining a strong 
regulatory and risk environment.

Likewise, William Chalmers, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), 
has played a critical role in the development, communication 
and execution of our new strategy, as well as embedding and 
delivering a strong commercial, capital and investment  
discipline across the Group.

The Committee determined that the GPS (annual bonus)  
awards for the GCE and CFO should be in line with the Group’s 
performance as assessed by the Group BSC of 80.3 per cent of 
maximum, with resultant awards of £1,277,372 and £920,658 
respectively. This BSC outcome was inclusive of a downward 
adjustment in recognition of the external factors which benefited 
the ‘reduction in carbon emissions’ measure. Further details are 
outlined on page 113.

In 2021, William Chalmers was granted an LTSP award of 
75 per cent of salary, a reduction of 40 per cent versus the typical 
award recognising the Group’s performance in 2020. In line with 
the outcome for other participants set out above, William’s award 
will vest in full. 2021 LTSP awards were granted prior to Charlie Nunn 
joining the Group and therefore he did not receive an award.

The 2023 Group BSC outcome also acts as part of a ‘pre-grant 
test’ for our 2024 LTIP awards. Given our robust 2023 performance, 
the Committee has determined to grant LTIP awards to the GCE 
and the CFO of 300 per cent of salary in line with the policy 
approved at the last AGM. 

The vesting outcome of the LTIP award will be subject to the 
achievement of stretching performance targets (see page 124) 
measured over the period 2024 to 2026.

Strengthening the Group’s performance culture
The pivot towards a more demanding, high-performance  
culture is critical in delivering against the ambitious strategy  
we announced in 2022; returning to a performance-related LTIP 
directly aligns with that objective. We appreciated your 
overwhelming support having achieved 96 per cent support  
for the Remuneration Policy at the AGM in 2023.

Our principal reason for reintroducing an LTIP is to deliver stronger 
alignment between variable reward outcomes and the creation 
of shareholder value through the delivery of our strategy and the 
deepening of our relationships with our customers. Accordingly, 
the Committee has given careful consideration to the choice of 
LTIP performance measures ensuring that they are both stretching 
and transparent.

As set out in our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (DRP) approved  
at the 2023 AGM, 50 per cent of the LTIP outcome will be weighted 
to robust measures directly linked to our financial performance  
as we build to higher and more sustainable returns – Return  
on Tangible Equity, Capital Build and relative Total Shareholder 
Return (rTSR).

Recognising that the delivery of our refreshed strategy is critical to 
the creation of value for shareholders and our purpose of Helping 
Britain Prosper, a further 35 per cent of the LTIP will depend on 
performance against our four strategic growth pillars – Deepen 
and innovate in Consumer, Create a new mass affluent offering, 
Digitise and diversify our SME business and Target our Corporate 
and Institutional offering.

Our strategy is purpose driven and we continue to aspire towards 
a more sustainable and inclusive future through support for areas 
in which we can make a difference, such as our commitment  
to sustainable financing and the transition to net zero. 15 per cent 
of the LTIP outcome will therefore depend on the extent to which 
we deliver on our Sustainable Finance and Investment 
commitments and make progress towards our 2030 Net Zero 
Banking Alliance (NZBA) sector targets and Scottish Widows’ 
overall 2030 net zero ambition.

Full details of our new LTIP can be found on page 124.

For the last two years, our priority has been pay for our most junior 
colleagues and we did not award pay increases to our executive 
directors in 2023. For 2024, we will be increasing the fixed pay of 
our executive directors by four per cent consistent with the pay 
rise awarded to the majority of the wider colleague population  
as part of our unique two-year commitment on pay.

We will also be recommending a resolution to the AGM to ensure 
our governance remains aligned with the PRA’s updated Policy 
Statement on the setting of variable to fixed pay ratios for large UK 
institutions; the variable pay opportunity of our executive directors 
is determined by our Directors’ Remuneration Policy and will not 
be impacted.

Finally, together with my Committee members, I would like to 
thank our shareholders for their continued support and our 
colleagues for delivering another robust set of results in 2023. 

On behalf of the Board

  Cathy Turner,
Chair, Remuneration Committee

Group Chief Executive Charlie Nunn

Group Chief Executive
The single total figure of remuneration for the Group Chief 
Executive during 2023 was £3.7 million. This is a decrease  
of 2 per cent compared to 2022 largely driven by the  
lower short term variable award in 2023 given the Group 
balanced scorecard performance of 80.3 per cent versus 
2022 at 84.1 per cent.

decrease of 6 per cent compared to 2022 which was driven 
by a lower long-term incentive payment for 2023. The 2021 
LTSP award was reduced by 40 per cent upfront at the time 
of grant, showing restraint based on 2020 Group 
performance.

The Committee determined a GPS pool for 2023 of

from 2022, the 2023 outcome reflects the consolidation 
from GPS to fixed pay to provide greater certainty for 
our colleagues as described on page 108. 

The award level for the 2021 LTSP was appropriately set 
at grant in March 2021. Vesting was subject to a ‘pre-vest

The Fixed Share Award is part of fixed remuneration and is not subject to any performance conditions (see page 129).

1 
2  Awards for Charlie Nunn and William Chalmers will be made in March 2024 in a combination of cash and shares.
3  The 2021 Long Term Share Plan (LTSP) vesting (see page 115) at 100 per cent was confirmed by the Remuneration Committee at its meeting on 15 February 2024. 

The total number of shares vesting will be 1,547,340 for William Chalmers. The average share price between 1 October 2023 and 31 December 2023 of 
43.564 pence has been used to indicate the value. The shares were awarded in 2021 based on a share price of 39.3015 pence and as such 11 per cent of the 
reported value is attributable to share price appreciation.

4  The long-term incentive figures for 2022 have been adjusted to reflect the share price on the date of vesting (7 March 2023) of 51.764 pence instead 

of the average price of 44.04 pence reported in the 2022 report.

5  The 2021 LTSP awards were granted prior to Charlie Nunn joining as Group Chief Executive from 16 August 2021.
6  Other remuneration payments comprise income from all employee share plans, which arises through employer matching or discounting 

of employee purchases.

Our 2023 balanced scorecard
Our balanced scorecard provides transparency on how 
our performance directly aligns with remuneration outcomes 
for 2023 GPS. 

Strong performance across financial, customer and ESG 
measures has resulted in an overall outcome of 80.3 per cent  
as set out in the scorecard assessment table below. Our 2023 
employee engagement index score is somewhat reflective 
of implementing some necessary but tough changes in  
the operation of flexible working. Further commentary on  
non-financial performance is described on page 114. 

For 2023, ESG metrics aligned to our public commitments on 
climate change and promoting inclusion and diversity accounted 
for 17.5 per cent of the scorecard.

Our 2023 balanced scorecard

In determining the scorecard outcome for 2023, the Committee 
concluded that the mechanical outcome for reducing our 
operational carbon emissions benefited significantly from 
external factors including changes in government policy and a 
milder winter compared to the ten year average. Therefore, while 
the measure outcome is 93.3 per cent, a downward adjustment  
to 50 per cent has been applied as shown below reducing the 
measure outcome to 2.5 per cent.

Non-financial measures  
(45%) commentary
The scorecard that the Committee used in determining the 
annual Group Performance Share awards for the executive 
directors, along with the assessment of performance against  
the scorecard, is detailed on page 113. The table below outlines 
the Committee’s assessment of the non-financial elements  
of the scorecard.

Non-financial measures commentary

Measure

Commentary

Group customer 
dashboard
Our assessment of how effectively 
we are serving customers across 
all brands, products and services.

•  The 2023 Group customer dashboard contains 195 targeted measures relating to customer 

• 

satisfaction, including; customer complaints, NPS and peer benchmarks
In 2023, 86 per cent of Group customer dashboard measures achieved target (compared to  
80 per cent in 2022), supported by ongoing strong performance relative to peers. Continued focus 
is required to maintain strong customer performance and to further improve scores in the context 
of our growth strategy

•  Score reflects the percentage of Group customer dashboard measures achieving target in 2023

Reducing operational 
carbon emissions
Reported vs 2018/19 baseline. 
Includes Scope 1, Scope 2 and 
Scope 3 carbon emissions. 
Reporting year is October to 
September.

•  A 30.2 per cent reduction has been achieved in 2023 from our 2018/19 baseline. Year on year 

reductions in gas and refrigerants have been delivered, although increases continue to be seen  
in commuting and business travel emissions as colleagues increase their presence in the office 
as part of the new approach to flexible working

•  A downward adjustment to 50 per cent of maximum has been applied to reflect that a significant 

proportion of the 2023 reduction has been driven by external factors including changes in 
government policy and a milder winter compared to the ten year average

•  Metric supports our external commitments to achieve net zero carbon operations by 2030  

and maintain travel emissions below 50 per cent of 2018/2019 levels

Sustainable financing 
and investment1

•  We have continued strong performance with our sustainable finance and investment metric 
across all contributing business lines – Commercial Banking, Consumer Lending Mortgages, 
Consumer Lending Transport and Scottish Widows Investments

•  Our robust performance continues to be driven by the positive uptake of electric vehicles  

and the acquisition of Tusker, along with our expanded product range for EPC A/B properties. 
Our performance was bolstered by Hybrid/EV Clean Growth Finance Initiative transactions and 
Debt Capital Markets activity, along with an increase in sustainable financing, for example across 
solar financing, battery storage and EV charging. Performance of our investments in climate-
aware strategies has been driven by allocations to ESG Property and Group Environmental 
Solutions, as well as into the BlackRock Climate Transition Global Equity Fund

Increasing our gender 
and ethnic representation 
in senior roles

•  We have increased the representation of women within our senior population by  

0.7 percentage points since the end of 2022, moving from 39.4 per cent to 40.1 per cent
•  We have increased the representation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues  

by 1.1 percentage points since the end of 2022, moving from 10.2 per cent to 11.3 per cent

Culture
and colleague
engagement
Our employee engagement 
index score.

•  Our employee engagement index (EEI) encompasses pride and satisfaction working for 

Lloyds Banking Group, and also recommending Lloyds Banking Group as a great place to work
•  Our 2023 EEI score has been impacted by changes to flexible working arrangements, made to 

ensure flexible working is available to all colleagues in moments that matter. Not all colleagues 
welcomed the changes necessary to transform the Group. Despite this our in-year advocacy 
measure is moving in a positive direction

  1 

Includes sustainable finance for: Corporate and Institutional, Business and Commercial Banking clients, EPC A/B mortgage lending (full year estimate based on 
September 2023 actual position), financing for EV and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and Scottish Widows discretionary investment in climate aware strategies.

2021 Long Term Share Plan
A Long Term Share Plan award was granted in relation to 2020 
performance under the terms of the previous Remuneration Policy. 

It is an important feature of the LTSP that performance is 
assessed and appropriately recognised upfront in the award 
size during the ‘pre-grant test’.

A final ‘pre-vest test’ of financial underpins and consideration  
of four key questions takes place prior to vesting to ensure 
performance over the period has been sustainable. The 
Committee has completed the full assessment and there  
is nothing known now which, had it been known at the time  
of grant, would have changed the initial award levels.

Pre-vest test – additional consideration by the Committee

In conjunction with the assessment of performance against the 
financial underpins above, the Remuneration Committee considered 
the four questions below to satisfy itself that there is nothing known 
now which, had it been known at the time of grant, would have 
changed the initial award levels:

Q  Has the bank lived up to its ambition to be the Best Bank 

f
or Customers?

Q  Do the Group’s financial results and capital position adequately 
reflect risk, conduct and any other non-financial considerations, 
including ESG?

Q  Has the Group made meaningful progress in supporting the UK’s 

transition to net zero? 

Q  Has the Group suffered a serious conduct event or has severe 

reputational damage arisen from the Group not living its values?

A  The Group has maintained its strong capital position, strong 
reputation and support for customers and businesses since 
making awards in 2021. Risk management has remained a key 
element in shaping our business model, with a focus on safely 
progressing strategic ambitions whilst supporting customers 
impacted by the rising cost of living.

The Group continues to make meaningful progress against our 
environmental commitments including reducing our operational 
carbon emissions by around 30 per cent from the 2018/19 
baseline, delivering over £40 billion1 in sustainable financing  
and investment since 2022, becoming a founding member of the 
Net Zero Banking Alliance and publishing 10 sector-based 2030 
emissions reduction targets for our most carbon-intensive sectors 
tracked through our system-led transition plans.

The Committee noted in the 2020 pre-grant test that there was 
still work to do towards achieving the Group’s gender and 
diversity goals but felt comfortable that these were reflected in 
stretch targets in the 2021 balanced scorecard. In each 
performance year from 2021 to 2023 we have continued to 
improve our gender and ethnicity representation in senior roles. 
From year-end 2020 we have increased women in senior roles 
from 37 per cent to 40.1 per cent at year-end 2023 and from 
year-end 2020 we have increased Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic 
representation by 47 per cent from 7.7 per cent to 11.3 per cent at 
year-end 2023.

The Committee concluded that performance considered in the 
‘pre-grant test’ has been sustainable and therefore no discretion 
has been applied. The 2021 LTSP awards will vest at 100 per cent, 
as the outcome represents a fair reflection of performance during  
the period.

1 

Includes: Corporate and Institutional, Business and Commercial Banking clients, EPC A/B mortgage lending (cumulative to September 2023),  
financing for EV and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and Scottish Widows discretionary investment in climate aware strategies.

In determining the final vesting outcome of the 2021 Long Term 
Share Plan, the Committee carefully considered alignment 
with shareholder experience and whether adjustments were 
required for windfall gains.

Awards were granted in March 2021 at 39.3015 pence. The  
share price used to calculate indicative value is 43.564 pence  
(page 112). While 10.8 per cent higher, the Committee considers 

it reasonably represents performance over the period. 2021 LTSP 
awards, including the award for the CFO, were reduced by up to 
40 per cent upfront at the time of grant, showing restraint based 
on 2020 Group performance. The GCE did not receive a 2021 LTSP 
award as he was not in role at the time of grant. The Committee 
concluded there was no windfall gain over the period and as such 
no additional adjustment was required.

1  When Charlie Nunn joined the Group on 16 August 2021 as Group Chief Executive and executive director he was granted deferred share awards and deferred 
cash to replace unvested awards from his previous employer, HSBC. Options vested on the 14 March 2023 and were exercised on 21 March 2023. Charlie Nunn 
retained all the shares apart from 586,558 shares which were sold at 48.16 pence to meet income tax and National Insurance contributions withholding 
obligations. The remaining 660,990 shares are subject to holding periods that mirror the shares replaced from HSBC of no hold, six months and  
12 months holds.

2  All GOS and LTSP awards have a three-year performance period ending 31 December. Awards were made in the form of conditional rights to free shares.
3 

LTSP awards (in the form of conditional share awards) in 2023 were made over shares with a value of 150 per cent of salary for Charlie Nunn (3,283,896 shares 
with a value of £1,704,375) and a value of 150 per cent for William Chalmers (2,366,848 shares with a value of £1,228,418). Vesting is subject to underpin 
thresholds applicable for the first three years from grant as detailed on page 121 of the 2022 Directors’ remuneration report. Each year the Remuneration 
Committee will monitor the Group’s progress in relation to the underpins. The share price used to calculate the value is the average price over the five days 
prior to grant (27 February 2023 to 3 March 2023), which was 51.901 pence.

4  The second tranche of the 2021 GPS deferred award vested on 7 March 2023. The closing market price of the Group’s ordinary shares on that date was  

51.360 pence. The award was settled in shares net of tax, with the resulting shares subject to a one-year holding period.

5  Half of the 2022 GPS is deferred into shares (in the form of conditional rights to free shares). The value of the shares awarded in respect of GPS granted in 

March 2023 was £668,911 (1,288,821 shares) for Charlie Nunn; and £344,367 (663,507 shares) for William Chalmers. As the awards represent deferral of awarded 
GPS they are not subject to further performance conditions. The share price used to calculate the value is the average price over the five days prior to grant 
(27 February 2023 to 3 March 2023), which was 51.901 pence.

6  The first tranche of the 2022 GPS award vested on 7 March 2023. The closing market price of the Group’s ordinary shares on that date was 51.360 pence.  

The award was settled in shares net of tax, with the resulting shares subject to a one-year holding period.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Shareholding requirement
Executives are expected to build and maintain a shareholding 
in the Group in direct proportion to their salary in order to align 
their interests to those of shareholders. 

The minimum shareholding requirements applicable to executive 
directors at 31 December 2023 are 350 per cent of salary for the 
GCE and 250 per cent of salary for the CFO.

Under the Policy applicable at 31 December 2023, the GCE has until 
15 August 2026 to meet the requirement of 350 per cent of salary 
and the CFO has until 2 June 2024 to meet the requirement of 
250 per cent of salary (in both cases five years from appointment). 
The CFO has met the requirement of 250 per cent of salary and 
currently holds 467 per cent of salary at 31 December 2023.

In recognition of the increased variable opportunity offered by 
the implementation of the LTIP and to further strengthen alignment 
with shareholders, from 1 January 2024 the shareholding 
requirement applicable to the GCE will increase from 350 per cent 
to 400 per cent of salary and from 250 per cent to 300 per cent 
for the CFO.

Post-employment shareholding requirement
Executive directors are contractually bound to a post-
employment shareholding requirement of two years at a level 
equal to the lower of the shareholding requirements immediately 
prior to departure or the actual shareholding on departure.
The post-employment requirement will be maintained through 
self-certification, with the Committee keeping this approach 
under review.

None of those who were directors at the end of the year had  
any other interest in the capital of Lloyds Banking Group plc  
or its subsidiaries.

As reported in the 2022 Annual Report, following approval at the 2023 AGM, from 1 January 2024 the shareholding requirement applicable to the GCE 
will increase to 400 per cent of salary and to 300 per cent for the other executive directors.

2  Calculated using the average share price for the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 (45.864 pence). Includes ordinary shares, net of tax where 

appropriate, acquired through the vesting of the deferred Group Performance Share plan, Fixed Share Awards as the shares have no performance conditions, 
awards in the form of options which have vested but have not been exercised, unvested performance tested Executive Group Ownership Share awards and 
Long Term Share Plan awards, shares held in the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) Trust, i.e. Free, Partnership, Matching and Dividend shares which are no longer 
subject to forfeiture, as defined in the SIP Rules. Shares held by Person Closely Associated, as defined by the Companies Act, but broadly meaning spouse 
or partner and children, are also included.

3  2022 shareholding has been recalculated using the average share price for the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 (45.864 pence). Salary as at 

31 December 2022 has been used to calculate the percentage.

1 
2  Charlie Nunn became the Group Chief Executive in August 2021. Figures for 2021 have been annualised based on the single total figure table.
3  William Chalmers was the Interim Group Chief Executive from May to August 2021 and received a deputisation payment for this period.
4  No Group Performance Share (bonus) was paid for 2020 performance.
5 

In some instances, non-executive directors may change membership or become the Chair of a Committee during the year, resulting in large year-on-year 
percentage changes in fees.

6  Some non-executive directors have received other benefits that relate to reimbursement for expenses incurred in the course of duties. Reimbursements 

of these expenses do not provide an accurate comparison to benefits received by colleagues and are therefore not included.

7  Cathy Turner was appointed on 1 November 2022. Figures for 2022 have been annualised based on the single total figure table. Cathy was appointed Chair 

of the Remuneration Committee and Senior Independent Director in September 2023.

8  Scott Wheway was appointed on 1 August 2022. Figures for 2022 have been annualised based on the single total figure table.
9  2022 to 2023 variance was impacted by the consolidation of variable pay and Flex cash allowance into base salary as described on page 108.

Lloyds Banking Group has committed to becoming a 
leader in gender diversity. We recognise that companies with 
proportionate gender diversity see increased performance, 
and make better decisions. We are working towards an 
ambition of 50 per cent of senior leadership roles being held 
by women by 2025. At the end of April 2023 we were at 
39.8 per cent, an increase from when we first set our original 
gender goal in 2014 when we were at 28 per cent.

Continued progress has been made in closing the Gender  
Pay Gap, with the gap reducing by 2.6 percentage points to  
26.7 per cent, the largest improvement since we started 
reporting. This improvement demonstrates that our actions 
are moving us in the right direction, however, we remain 
committed to accelerating our progress.

As part of our commitment to Helping Britain Prosper, we 
believe it is essential for us to make an impact beyond our 
organisation. We therefore co-sponsor the FTSE Women 
Leaders review, which has set a target of a minimum of 
40 per cent women on boards and in leadership teams. 
Our ongoing work to improve gender balance in our 
organisation has resulted in us being named in the 2023 
Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fifth consecutive 
year, and in The Times 2023 Top 50 Employers for Gender 
Equality for the 12th consecutive year. 

Further information is available in our pay gap report 

.

We know that diversity of our workforce is important, and 
that representation is a key driver to close the gaps that exist. 
For this reason, we made a public commitment to increase 
Black Heritage representation in senior roles to 3 per cent by 
2025 and increase our overall senior Black, Asian and Minority 
Ethnic representation to 13 per cent by 2025. At the end of April 
2023, 10.5 per cent of senior manager roles were held by Black, 
Asian or Minority Ethnic colleagues, and 1.6 per cent held by 
Black Heritage colleagues.

When it comes to Ethnicity Pay Gap reporting, there is no 
legislative requirement on UK organisations to publish these 
figures. However, for the past three years we have published 
our Ethnicity Pay Gap on a voluntary basis. As a leading UK 
employer, we’ve chosen to publish this data because we 
recognise the importance of transparency in encouraging 
focus and inspiring purposeful, action-led change. It holds  
us accountable, helps us to learn, and we believe will lead  
to positive improvement.

Encouragingly, our disclosure rate has increased from  
85.1 per cent in April 2022 to 88.2 per cent in April 2023  
(of those colleagues who have chosen to disclose their 
ethnicity with us). We’re pleased to see that our overall 
representation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic talent  
has increased. This is due to higher volumes of inclusive 
recruitment and a greater proportion of colleagues sharing 
their ethnicity data with us at the more junior levels of our 
business. This has, however resulted in an increase in our 
ethnicity pay gaps from 4.6 per cent to 5.7 per cent because 
our junior colleagues hold lower paid positions within our 
business. Whilst we have also seen improvements within the 
representation of our senior leadership teams this remains 
lower, affecting our efforts to close the gaps further and 
we recognise we have more to do to achieve this.

Notes to the table:
•  The 2023 total remuneration for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: £32,921, £46,209, £82,030
•  The 2023 base salary for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: £24,682, £37,504, £63,066
•  The P25, P50 and P75 colleagues were determined on 31 December 2023 based on calculating total remuneration for all UK 

employees for the 2023 financial year. Payroll data from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023

•  Colleague total remuneration has been calculated in line with the single total figure of remuneration. The single total figure of 

remuneration has been calculated for 58,072 UK colleagues within the Group for a full year including full-time equivalent base pay, 
vesting Long Term Share Plan awards (for eligible colleagues), core benefits, pension, overtime and shift payments, travel/relocation 
payments (for eligible colleagues) and private medical benefit

•  The average share price between 1 October 2023 and 31 December 2023 of 43.564 pence has been used to indicate the value of 

vesting Long Term Share Plan awards

•  Due to operational constraints, the calculation of the colleague Pension Input Figure excludes inflationary adjustments for those on 
the defined benefit scheme. The omission of this factor does not materially affect the outcome of the ratio and/or distort the validity 
of the valuation

•  All other data has been calculated in line with the methodology for the single total figure of remuneration for the GCE

Our ratios have been calculated using Methodology option A on the basis that it provided the most accurate means of identifying 
the median, lower and upper quartile colleagues. The ratio has been calculated taking into account the pay and benefits of 58,072 
UK employees, other than the individual performing the role of GCE.

The change in total remuneration ratios since 2017 is largely driven by the more volatile nature of variable pay for the GCE.

The reduction in 2020 can be attributed to the decision not to make awards under the Group Performance Share plan, reduced 
performance in the vesting of the 2018 Group Ownership plan compared to the 2017 plan and the reduction in the former GCE’s pension 
allowance from 33 per cent to 15 per cent of salary.

In 2021 the median ratio was calculated for all three individuals undertaking the role of GCE and increased by 137 per cent year-on-
year. This increase can be attributed to the one-off buy out awards granted to Charlie Nunn, an increase in the vesting of the LTIP 
and the payment of Group Performance Share (annual bonus), which were not awarded for 2020.

The reduction in 2022 was due to two factors. Firstly, Charlie Nunn’s remuneration for 2022 did not include any value in respect of 
Long Term Incentive plans, as no 2020 EGOS award was granted to him given that he was not an executive director at the time of grant. 
Secondly, the 2021 ratio included the one-off buy-out awards granted to Charlie Nunn. In addition the 2021 ratio was calculated for all 
three individuals undertaking the role of GCE. Over the same time period, employee total compensation increased by 12 per cent at 
the lower quartile, 11 per cent at the median and 7 per cent at the upper quartile, also contributing to the decrease in pay ratios.

There has been a further reduction in 2023 which can be attributed to three key factors. Recognising the desire to focus on 
the remuneration of lower paid colleagues, no annual pay award was proposed for the GCE for 2023 while the pay budget for the 
wider workforce was 6.3 per cent. Given the approach focused on lower paid colleagues and colleagues lower in their pay range, 
this resulted in pay increases of between 8 per cent and 13 per cent for around 43,000 colleagues. In addition, from July 2023 we 
consolidated a significant portion of our Group Performance Share into base salary for around 32,000 colleagues, further increasing 
the fixed pay element. Finally, the GCE received a lower annual short-term variable award for 2023 compared to 2022.

For the majority of colleagues, year-on-year changes in remuneration are principally driven by pay increases and the impacts of 
Group performance and collective adjustment. The Group has a commitment to pay progression and a continued focus on ensuring 
higher pay awards for colleagues who are lower paid, or paid lower within their pay range. We are committed to reducing the pay gap 
between executives and wider colleagues and continue to remain focused on addressing the gap from the bottom up and not just 
from the top down.

The Committee is thoughtful of the volatility in pay ratios due to variable reward outcomes. Although the pay ratio is used as  
a useful reference point to inform policy-setting, the Committee takes into account a number of other factors to assess colleague  
pay progression.

 Base Salary 

Pay deal for wider workforce reflects a 4.2 per cent budget.  
The approach focuses on lower paid colleagues. 

Salaries will therefore be as follows:
•  GCE: £1,181,700
•  CFO: £851,703

Salary increases for the Group Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer are in line with the pay awards for the majority 
of the wider workforce at 4 per cent.

 Fixed Share Award 

Fixed Share Awards for the Group Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer will increase as part of the 4 per cent fixed 
pay increase for 2024. 

Shares will be released in equal tranches over three years.
(See page 129 for further details).

Awards will therefore be as follows:
•  GCE: £1,092,000
•  CFO: £524,160

 Pension 

Pension allowances for all executive directors are set at 
15 per cent of base salary. Any new executive director 
appointments in 2024 will also attract a maximum allowance 
of 15 per cent of base salary.

In addition to the DC arrangement, the Group currently 
has around 10,000 active members in defined benefit plans, 
with the effective cost of employer contributions into these 
arrangements being around 34 per cent of salary.

Over 56,000 colleagues participate in the Group’s Defined 
Contribution (DC) Pension scheme where the maximum 
opportunity for the workforce is 15 per cent of base salary. 
Executive directors’ employer pension contributions are 
therefore aligned with those available to the majority of  
the workforce.

 Benefits 

Benefits remain unchanged from 2023. Executive directors 
receive a flexible benefit allowance of 4 per cent of base salary.

Other benefits include transportation and private medical cover. 
The CFO also receives a car allowance.

This can be used to select benefits including life assurance 
and critical illness cover.

 Group Performance Share (short term variable)  

The performance measures for determining any individual
2024 GPS awards for executive directors are outlined in the 2024 
balanced scorecard on page 125.

Maximum opportunities for executive directors for 2024 are
140 per cent of base salary.

The Group will apply deferral in line with minimum regulatory 
requirements as set out in the Policy. This is consistent with the 
approach taken by our peers. At least 60 per cent of total 
variable remuneration awarded to our executive directors will 
remain deferred over a period of up to seven years, maintaining 
strong alignment to shareholders.

Individual awards as a percentage of maximum will directly 
relate to the overall performance assessment outcome. For the 
2024 performance year, any GPS opportunity will be awarded  
in March 2025 in a combination of cash (up to 50 per cent)  
and shares.

Directors’ remuneration report continued

 Long Term Incentive Plan 

The Group’s pivot towards a more demanding, high-
performance culture is critical in delivering against our 
ambitious strategy. LTIP awards will be granted in relation to 
2023 performance under the terms of the current Remuneration 
Policy. The Committee concluded that 2023 performance, 
including assessment of our 2023 Group scorecard and other 
factors, was at a level to make awards. This is known as the 
‘pre-grant test’.

To ensure strong alignment between variable reward outcomes 
and the creation of shareholder value through the delivery of 
our strategy and the deepening of our relationships with our 
customers, the Committee has determined that LTIP awards 
will be granted with a value of 300 per cent of salary to the GCE 
and CFO to reflect the Group’s performance in 2023. 

In accordance with regulatory requirements LTIP awards will  
not accrue dividend equivalents over the vesting period; in line 
with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the number of shares 
granted under the awards will be determined using a share 
price adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends or 
equivalents during the vesting period.

Performance measures and weightings
The 2023 DRP set out a framework to align LTIP performance 
measures to the financial performance of the Group, the 
delivery of its refreshed, growth-orientated strategy and the 
progress towards its environmental commitments. Three 
financial measures have been chosen, aligned to our disclosed 
intentions in the 2022 ARA, with a total weighting of 50 per cent. 
Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) emphasises the efficient use of 
capital and ensures focus on long-term value creation, Capital 
Build recognises the importance of maintaining a strong 
financial foundation for the Group and prioritises capital 

2024-2026 LTIP scorecard

accretive decision making for the long-term and rTSR compares 
the value delivered to a shareholder in the Group over the 
performance period with the value delivered to shareholders  
by our peers.

A dedicated 35 per cent weighting will focus on the Group’s 
delivery of its strategy and success of our strategic initiatives in 
driving revenue growth and diversification. The Committee will 
give consideration to an assessment of performance against 
quantifiable Board metrics aligned to each of our four strategic 
growth pillars: Deepen and innovate in Consumer, Create a new 
mass affluent offering, Digitise and diversify our SME business 
and Target our Corporate and Institutional offering.

Finally, 15 per cent weight is attributed to environmental 
measures, reflecting that the transition to a low carbon 
economy is at the core of our strategy and aligns with our 
purpose to Help Britain Prosper. The Committee will assess 
performance of the Group’s sustainable financing and 
investment commitments over the performance period, 2026 
progress towards its 2030 NZBA sector targets and delivery 
against Scottish Widows’ net zero ambition (see page 33).

Target setting
Setting targets is a critical focus area for the Committee and 
a rigorous exercise has been undertaken to ensure our targets 
are sufficiently stretching. We have taken into account our 
long-term strategic ambitions, commitments to our ESG 
agenda and comparable industry returns.

Operation
The awards made in 2024 will vest based on the Group’s 
performance between January 2024 to December 2026. 
The following table provides a breakdown of the construct 
which the Committee considers aligns management and 
shareholder interests appropriately.

The Committee will assess the Group’s delivery of its strategy to drive 
revenue growth and diversification aligned to its four strategic growth 
pillars: Deepen and innovate in Consumer, deepen relationships and 
innovate intermediary positions; Create a new mass affluent offering, 
expand in the growing mass affluent market; Digitise and diversify our 
SME business, meet more client needs with a digital-first model; Target our 
Corporate and Institutional offering, strengthen a core business with focus 
on UK-linked clients. After this assessment the Committee will holistically 
determine a vesting outcome.

The Committee will assess the Group’s performance against its publicly 
disclosed environmental targets aligned to cumulative sustainable 
financing and investment provided over the performance period, 2026 
progress towards its 2030 NZBA sector targets and delivery against Scottish 
Widows’ net-zero ambition. After this assessment the Committee will 
holistically determine a vesting outcome.

If average RoTE reaches 12 per cent then 5 per cent of the award vests. If average RoTE reaches 15 per cent then 20 per cent of the award vests. If average 
RoTE is between the threshold and maximum, vesting is calculated on a straight-line basis between these two points.
If average Capital Build reaches 160 basis points then 2.5 per cent of the award vests. If average Capital Build reaches 205 basis points then 10 per cent of 
the award vests. If average Capital Build is between the threshold and maximum, vesting is calculated on a straight-line basis between these two points.

2024 Group balanced scorecard
The performance measures and weightings for determining 
any 2024 GPS awards for the executive directors are shown in 
the table below.

The measures and targets are set annually by the Remuneration 
Committee to reflect the strategic priorities of the Group and take 
into account both the annual financial plan and operating plan 
against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving external economic 
and societal landscape.

Performance measures and weightings
The 2024 scorecard metrics have been reviewed alongside the 
new 2024 LTIP measures, shown on page 124, to ensure they are 
complementary and there is minimal overlap which would risk 
duplication of outcomes.

The Sustainable Financing and Investment measure which has 
featured in previous annual scorecards is a critical part of the 
2024 LTIP. For this reason, it has been removed from the 2024 
scorecard and its 5 per cent weight allocated to the RoTE 
measure recognising its importance to shareholders. This brings 
the total financial weighting to 60 per cent.

Whilst a RoTE measure is also included in the LTIP performance 
metrics, it is considered a fundamental indicator of Group 
performance and creation of shareholder value. The RoTE within 
the annual scorecard focuses on in-year performance while the 
LTIP assesses long-term performance. There are no other 
changes from 2023.

Targets
Setting stretching targets is a key component of our demanding 
performance-driven culture. The Committee has undertaken a

applicable, forward-looking guidance.

Targets will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2024 annual report 
alongside the level of performance achieved, as the 
Remuneration Committee considers such targets to be 
commercially sensitive. 

Measures of financial and non-financial performance have been 
agreed by the Remuneration Committee to evaluate 
performance during 2024.

Discretion
When determining the final outcome, the Remuneration 
Committee may consider any personal or business area 
objectives and whether there has been effective, consistent
and proactive risk management and conduct outcomes across 
all dimensions.

When assessing performance, the Committee can exercise its 
judgment to determine the appropriate outcome. This helps to 
avoid any potential unintended outcomes that might arise from 
the application of formulaic performance criteria.

Directors’ remuneration report continued

Remuneration Committee
At the beginning of 2023, the Committee was comprised of five 
non-executive directors. From September 2023, the Committee 
has comprised of four non-executive directors, after Alan 
Dickinson stepped down from the Committee. Sir Robin 
Budenberg attends the Committee in his role as Group Chair. 
The non-executive directors are from a wide background to 
provide a balanced and independent view on remuneration 
matters. Two of the three designated independent non-executive 
directors of the Ring-Fenced Banks also attend meetings of the 
Committee as observers in order to provide insights on matters 
relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks and as part of their role in 
the Group’s overall governance structure. For further details of 
Committee membership and attendance at meetings, please 
see page 79.

During the year, Charlie Nunn, as the GCE provided regular 
briefings to the Committee. In addition, the Committee engaged 
with and received updates from the Chief People and Places 
Officer, Total Reward Director and the Chief Risk Officer.

The purpose of the Committee is to set the remuneration for all 
executive directors and the Chair, including pension rights and 
any compensation payments. It recommends and monitors the 
level and structure of remuneration for senior management and 
material risk takers. It also considers, agrees and recommends

to the Board an overall remuneration policy and philosophy for 
the Group that is aligned with its long-term business strategy, 
its business objectives, its risk appetite, purpose and values and 
the long-term interests of the Group, and recognises the interests
of relevant stakeholders, including the wider workforce. The 
Committee’s operation is designed to ensure that no conflicts of 
interest arise, and in particular, the Committee ensures that no 
individual is present when matters relating to their own
remuneration are discussed.

Advisers
PwC was appointed by the Committee in May 2022 following  
a competitive tender process and was retained for 2023.  
The Committee is of the view that PwC provides independent 
remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have  
any connections with the Group or any director that may impair 
its independence.

More broadly, PwC provides unrelated professional services to the 
Group in the ordinary course of business including tax, advisory, 
internal audit and non-audit assurance services. PwC attended 
Committee meetings upon invitation and fees payable for the 
provision of services in respect of directors’ remuneration in 2023 
amounted to £122,650 excluding VAT. Fees paid to PwC for advising 
the Committee are based partly on a fixed fee and partly on  
a time and materials basis.

2023 Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Group’s Remuneration Policy was approved at the AGM  
on 18 May 2023 and took effect from that date. 

It is intended that approval of the Policy will be sought at  
three-year intervals, unless amendments to the Policy are 
required, in which case further shareholder approval will be 
sought. Information on how the Policy will be implemented  
in 2024 is included in the annual report on remuneration on  
pages 123 to 125.

The Committee extensively consulted on the Policy proposals  
with the Group’s institutional shareholders and key proxy rating 
agencies. The Committee regularly engages and consults with 
key shareholders to take into account their feedback on the  
Policy and its implementation.

The full policy is set out in the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts 
(pages 125 to 133) which is available on our website 

.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy and  
alignment to our Group strategy
The performance measures selected for the GPS and LTIP will be 
set annually by the Committee taking account of the Group’s 
strategic priorities and its most important financial measures. 
Performance measures are selected to ensure an appropriate 
balance between short and long-term strategic goals and to 
align executive director and shareholder interests. In determining 
the appropriate set of measures and targets for annual bonus 
and LTIP awards, the Committee has discretion to vary the 
performance measures, or to substitute the metrics, over the life 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy taking into account the 
Group’s strategic plan or emerging best practice.

The only significant difference between the Policy for executive 
directors and colleagues outside the Group Executive Committee 
is participation in the LTIP which is restricted to those most directly 
accountable for the successful delivery of the Group’s strategy. 

The table below summarises how the Policy applies across  
the Group.

 Base Salary 

Purpose and link to strategy
To support the recruitment and retention of executive directors 
of the calibre required to develop and deliver the Group’s 
strategic priorities. Base salary reflects the role of the individual, 
taking account of market competitiveness, responsibilities and 
experience, and pay in the Group as a whole.

Operation
Base salaries are typically reviewed annually with any increases 
normally taking effect from 1 April for executive directors. When 
determining and reviewing base salary levels, the Committee 
takes into account base salary increases for employees 
throughout the Group and ensures that decisions are made 
within the following two parameters: 
•  An objective assessment of the individual’s responsibilities 

and the size and scope of their role, using objective job-sizing 
methodologies. 

•  Pay for comparable roles in comparable publicly listed 

financial services groups of a similar size. 

Salary may be paid in sterling or other currency and at an 
exchange rate determined by the Committee.

128 Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Maximum potential 
The Committee will make no increase which it believes is 
inconsistent with the two parameters. Increases will normally  
be no more than the increase awarded to the overall employee 
population. However, a greater salary increase may be 
appropriate in certain circumstances, such as a new 
appointment made on a salary below a market competitive 
level, where phased increases are planned, or where there has 
been an increase in the responsibilities of an individual. Where 
increases are awarded in excess of the wider employee 
population, the Committee will provide an explanation in the 
relevant annual report on remuneration.

 Fixed Share Award 

Maximum potential
The maximum award is 100 per cent of base salary.

Performance measures 
N/A

Purpose and link to strategy 
To ensure that total fixed remuneration is commensurate  
with role and to provide a competitive reward package for 
executive directors with an appropriate balance of fixed 
and variable remuneration. 

Operation
The Fixed Share Award will be delivered entirely in Lloyds  
Banking Group shares, released over three years with 
33 per cent being released each year following the year of 
award. Fixed Share Awards are preferred to be delivered in 
shares to create further alignment with shareholders over time. 
However, the Committee has discretion to deliver some or all 
of the awards in cash.

Maximum potential
The maximum allowance for all executive directors 
 is set at 15 per cent of base salary in line with the  
majority of the workforce. 

Performance measures
N/A

 Pension 

Purpose and link to strategy
To provide cost-effective and market competitive  
retirement benefits, supporting executive directors  
in building long-term retirement savings.

Operation
Executive directors are entitled to participate in the  
Group’s defined contribution scheme with company 
contributions set as a percentage of salary. 

An individual may elect to receive some or all of  
their pension allowance as cash in lieu of pension  
contribution.

 Benefits 

Purpose and link to strategy
To provide flexible benefits as part of a competitive 
remuneration package.

Operation
Benefits may include those currently provided and disclosed 
in the annual report on remuneration. Core benefits include 
a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, 
life insurance and other benefits that may be selected through 
the Group’s flexible benefits plan. 

Additional benefits may be provided to individuals in certain 
circumstances such as relocation. This may include benefits 
such as accommodation, relocation, and travel. The Committee 
retains the right to provide additional benefits depending on 
individual circumstances. 

When determining and reviewing the level of benefits provided, 
the Committee ensures that decisions are made within the 
following two parameters:
•  An objective assessment of the individual’s responsibilities 

and the size and scope of their role, using objective job-sizing 
methodologies

•  Benefits for comparable roles in comparable publicly listed 

financial services groups of a similar size

Maximum potential
The Committee will only make increases in the benefits  
currently provided which it believes are consistent with the  
two parameters above. Executive directors receive a flexible 
benefits allowance which does not currently exceed 4 per cent 
of base salary.

Performance measures
N/A

 All-employee plans 

Purpose and link to strategy
Executive directors are eligible to participate in HMRC-approved 
share plans which promote share ownership by giving 
employees an opportunity to invest in Group shares.

Operation
Executive directors may participate in these plans in line with 
HMRC guidelines currently prevailing (where relevant), on the 
same basis as other eligible employees.

Maximum potential
Participation levels may be increased up to HMRC limits as 
amended from time to time. The monthly savings limits for  
Save As You Earn (SAYE) is currently £500. The maximum value 
of shares that may be purchased under the Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP) in any year is currently £1,800 with a two-for-one 
match. Currently a three-for-two match is operated up to  
a maximum colleague investment of £30 per month. 
The maximum value of free shares that may be awarded 
in any year is £3,600.

   Group Performance Share 
(Short term variable) 

Purpose and link to strategy
To incentivise and reward the achievement of the Group’s 
annual financial and strategic targets whilst supporting 
the delivery of long-term superior and sustainable returns.

Operation
Measures and targets are set annually and awards are 
determined by the Committee after the year-end based on 
performance against the targets set. The GPS may be delivered 
partly in cash, shares, notes or other debt instruments including 
contingent convertible bonds. Where all or part of any award is 
deferred, the Committee may adjust these deferred awards in 
the event of any variation of share capital, demerger, special 
dividend or distribution or amend the terms of the plan in 
accordance with the plan rules. 

Where an award or a deferred award is in shares or other share-
linked instrument, the number of shares to be awarded may be 
calculated using a fair value or based on discount to market 
value, as appropriate to reflect the fact that the directors are 
not eligible for dividends on unvested deferred awards. 

The Committee applies its judgement to determine the  
payout level commensurate with business and/or individual 
performance or other factors as determined by the Committee. 
The Committee may reduce the level of award (including  
to zero), apply additional conditions to the vesting, or delay  
the vesting of deferred awards to a specified date or until 
conditions set by the Committee are satisfied, where it 
considers it appropriate. Awards may be subject to malus 
and clawback for a period of up to seven years after the date 
of award which may be extended to 10 years where there is 
an ongoing internal or regulatory investigation.

  Long Term Incentive Plan 
(Long term variable) 

Purpose and link to strategy
To incentivise performance linked to the Group’s strategy 
and aligned to shareholder interests.

Operation
From 2024, awards will be granted under the rules of the  
2023 Long Term Incentive Plan, approved at the AGM on  
18 May 2023. Awards will be granted in the form of conditional
rights to shares in the Group.

The grant price of shares to be awarded may be discounted  
to reflect that the directors are not eligible for dividends on 
unvested awards. 

Awards shall vest in five equal annual instalments which will not 
start before the third anniversary of grant; each vesting will be 
subject to a further holding period as required by regulation. 

The Committee retains full discretion to amend the vesting 
levels should the outcome not reflect business and/or individual 
performance including risk and conduct outcomes. The 
Committee may reduce (including to zero) the level of the 
award, apply additional conditions to the vesting, or delay the 
vesting of awards to a specified date or until conditions set by 
the Committee are satisfied, where it considers it appropriate. 
Awards may be subject to malus and clawback for a period of 
up to seven years after the date of award which may be 
extended to 10 years where there is an ongoing internal or 
regulatory investigation.

130 Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Maximum potential
The maximum GPS opportunity is 140 per cent of salary for the 
executive directors. 

Performance measures
Measures and targets are set annually by the Committee in  
line with the Group’s strategic business plan and further details 
are set out in the annual report on remuneration for the  
relevant year.

Measures consist of both financial and non-financial measures 
and the weighting of these measures will be determined 
annually by the Committee. All assessments of performance 
are ultimately subject to the Committee’s judgement, but 
measures will not vest if a 25 per cent threshold performance  
is not met. The normal ‘target’ level of the GPS is 50 per cent  
of maximum opportunity. 

The Committee is committed to providing transparency in its 
decision making in respect of GPS awards and will disclose 
historic measures and target information together with 
information relating to how the Group has performed against 
those targets in the annual report on remuneration for the 
relevant year except to the extent that this information is 
deemed to be commercially sensitive, in which case it will  
be disclosed once it is deemed not to be sensitive.

Maximum potential
The maximum Long Term Incentive Plan opportunity is 
300 per cent of base salary for annual awards to all executive 
directors. The actual award level granted will be determined 
with reference to a pre-grant test based on an assessment of 
performance by the Committee.

Performance measures
Awards will be subject to forward-looking performance 
measures based on financial and other strategic and 
environmental measures set out in the annual report on 
remuneration each year; performance will be measured  
over a period of not less than three years as determined  
by the Committee. 

The Committee has the discretion to change the measures 
or their weightings subject to a minimum of 50 per cent of the 
award being dependent on financial measures.

No more than 25 per cent of the award will vest for threshold 
performance. 100 per cent of the award will vest for achieving 
the maximum performance. Where performance falls between 
threshold, target and maximum levels, an intermediate number 
of awards will vest. 

   Deferral of variable remuneration 
and holding periods 

Operation
The GPS and LTIP are both considered variable remuneration for 
the purpose of regulatory payment and deferral requirements. 

The payment of variable remuneration and deferral levels are 
determined at the time of award in compliance with regulatory 
requirements which currently require that at least 60 per cent of 
the aggregate variable remuneration (GPS + LTIP) is deferred up 
to seven years with pro rata vesting between the third and 
seventh year, and at least 50 per cent of total variable 
remuneration is delivered in shares or other equity linked 
instruments subject to a minimum one-year holding period. 

   Performance adjustment 

Performance adjustment is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee and/or Board Risk Committee and may result in  
a reduction of up to 100 per cent variable remuneration 
opportunity for the relevant period. It can be applied on a 
collective or individual basis. When considering collective 
adjustment, a report is submitted to the Remuneration 
Committee and Board Risk Committee regarding any 
adjustments required to balanced scorecards or the overall  
GPS and/or LTSP/LTIP outcome to reflect in-year or prior year 
risk matters.

The application of malus will generally be considered when:
•  There is reasonable evidence of employee misbehaviour 

or material error or that they participated in conduct which 
resulted in losses for the Group or failed to meet appropriate 
standards of fitness and propriety

•  There is material failure of risk management at a Group, 

business area, division and/or business unit level

•  The Committee determines that the financial results for 

a given year do not support the level of variable 
remuneration awarded

•  Any other circumstances where the Committee consider 

adjustments should be made

Judgement on individual performance adjustment is informed 
by taking into account the severity of the issue, the individual’s 
proximity to the issue and the individual’s behaviour in relation 
to the issue. Individual adjustment may be applied through 
adjustments to balanced scorecard assessments and/or 
through reducing the variable remuneration outcome.

Awards are subject to clawback for a period of up to seven years 
after the date of award which may be extended to 10 years 
where there is an ongoing internal or regulatory investigation.

The application of clawback will generally be considered when:
•  There is reasonable evidence of employee misbehaviour or 

material error

•  There is material failure of risk management at a Group, 

business area, division and/or business unit level

From 2 October 2023 we comply with new US Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) rules which require listed firms in 
the US (including foreign issuers such as Lloyds Banking Group) 
to be able to recover variable awards in the event of a 
restatement of the company’s financial statements.

Directors’ remuneration report continued

Remuneration policy table for executive directors continued

  Chair and non-executive  
director fees and benefits 

Purpose and link to strategy
To provide an appropriate reward to attract and retain a 
high-calibre individual with the relevant skills, knowledge 
and experience.

Operation
The Committee is responsible for evaluating and making 
recommendations to the Board with regard to the
Chair’s fees. The Chair does not participate in these discussions.
The GCE and the Chair are responsible for evaluating and 
making recommendations to the Board in relation to the fees 
of the non-executive directors (NEDs).

When determining and reviewing fee and benefit levels, 
the Committee ensures that decisions are made within the 
following parameters:
•  The individual’s skills and experience
•  An objective assessment of the individual’s responsibilities 
and the size and scope of their role, using objective sizing 
methodologies

•  Fees and benefits for comparable roles in comparable 
publicly listed financial services groups of a similar size 

The Chair receives an all-inclusive fee, which is reviewed 
periodically plus benefits including life insurance, medical 
insurance and transportation. The Committee retains 
the right to provide additional benefits depending on 
individual circumstances.

NEDs are paid a basic fee plus additional fees for the Chair/
membership of Committees and for membership of Group 
company boards, non-board level committees and/or other 
specific responsibilities. 

Additional fees are also paid to the Senior Independent Director 
and to the Deputy Chair to reflect additional responsibilities.

Any increases normally take effect from 1 January of a given year.

The Chair and the NEDs are not entitled to receive any payment 
for loss of office (other than in the case of the Chair’s fees for 
the six month notice period) and are not entitled to participate 
in the Group’s variable remuneration arrangements, all-
employee share plan or pension arrangements.

NEDs are reimbursed for expenses incurred in the course of 
their duties, such as travel and accommodation expenses, 
on a grossed-up basis (where applicable).

Maximum potential
Any increase in fees or benefits currently provided will be 
consistent with the parameters above.

Performance metrics
N/A

Service agreements
The service contracts of all current executive directors are terminable on 12 months’ notice from the Group and six months’ notice  
from the individual. The Chair also has a letter of appointment. The Chair’s engagement may be terminated on six months’ notice  
by either party.

Letters of appointment
The non-executive directors all have letters of appointment and are appointed for an initial term of three years after which their 
appointment may continue subject to an annual review. Non-executive directors may have their appointment terminated, in 
accordance with statute, regulation and the articles of association, at any time with immediate effect and without compensation.

All directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.

Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

 
Other statutory and regulatory information

This directors’ report on pages 71 to 136 is 
our directors’ report for the purposes of  
the Companies Act 2006 and fulfils the 
requirements of the corporate governance 
statement for the purposes of the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Guidance 
and Transparency Rules (DTR).

Profit and dividends
The consolidated income statement shows a statutory profit 
before tax for the year ended 31 December 2023 of £7,503 million 
(2022: £6,928 million).

The directors have recommended a final dividend for 2023, which 
is subject to approval by the shareholders at the annual general 
meeting (AGM), of 1.84 pence per share, which together with the 
interim dividend of 0.92 pence per share represents a total 
dividend for the year of 2.76 pence per share, equivalent to 
£1.8 billion. If approved by shareholders, the final dividend will 
be paid on 21 May 2024. 

A final dividend of 1.60 pence per share totalling £1,059 million in 
respect of 2022 was paid on 23 May 2023, and an interim dividend 
of 0.92 pence per share totalling £592 million was paid on 
12 September 2023. Further information on dividends is shown in 
note 46 on page 305 and is incorporated into this directors’ report 
by reference.

The Board continues to give due consideration at each year end 
to the return of any surplus capital to shareholders and for 2023, 
the Board intends to return up to £2.0 billion through a share 
buyback programme in respect of the Company’s ordinary 
shares. This represents the return of capital over and above the 
Board’s view of the current level of capital required to grow the 
business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties.

The share buyback programme is intended to commence as 
soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed, subject 
to continued authority from the PRA, by 31 December 2024. Based 
on the total ordinary dividend and the intended ordinary share 
buyback the total capital return in respect of 2023 will be up to 
£3.8 billion.

The Company intends to use the authority for the repurchase of 
ordinary shares granted to it at the 2023 AGM to implement the 
proposed share buyback. Details of this existing authority are set 
out under ‘Power of directors in relation to shares’. Shareholders 
will be asked to renew this authority at the 2024 AGM, in line with 
common practice.

Appointment and retirement of directors
The appointment and retirement of directors is governed by the 
Company’s articles of association, the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s articles of 
association may only be amended by a special resolution of the 
shareholders in a general meeting.

Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
Throughout 2023 the Group had appropriate insurance cover  
in place to protect directors, including the directors who retired 
during the year, from liabilities that may arise against them 
personally in connection with the performance of their role.

As well as insurance cover, the Group agrees to indemnify 
the directors to the maximum extent permitted by law. Further 
information on the Group’s indemnity arrangements is provided  
in the directors’ indemnities section.

Directors’ indemnities
The directors of the Company have entered into individual deeds  
of indemnity with the Company which constituted ‘qualifying third 
party indemnity provisions’ for the purposes of the Companies Act 
2006. The deeds indemnify the directors to the maximum extent 
permitted by law and remain in force. The deeds were in force 
during the whole of the financial year. Deeds for existing directors 
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.

The Company has also granted deeds of indemnity by deed poll 
and by way of entering into individual deeds, which constitute 
‘qualifying third party indemnity provisions’ to the directors of  
the Group’s subsidiary companies, including to former directors 
who retired during the year and since the year-end, and to Group 
colleagues subject to the provisions of the Senior Managers  
and Certification Regime. Such deeds were in force during the 
financial year ended 31 December 2023 and remain in force as  
at the date of this report.

Qualifying pension scheme indemnities have also been granted 
to the Trustees of the Group’s pension schemes, which were in 
force for the whole of the financial year and remain in force as  
at the date of this report.

Conflicts of interest
The Board has a comprehensive procedure for reviewing and,  
as permitted by the Companies Act 2006 and the Company’s 
articles of association, approving actual and potential conflicts of 
interest. Directors have a duty to notify the Chair and Company 
Secretary as soon as they become aware of actual or potential 
conflict situations. Any changes to the commitments of directors 
are reported to the Nomination and Governance Committee  
and the Board and a register of directors’ interests is regularly 
reviewed and authorised by the Board to ensure the authorisation 
status remains appropriate. 

Lord Lupton is a senior adviser to Greenhill Europe, an investment 
bank focused on providing financial advice on significant 
mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, financings and capital 
raising to corporations, partnerships, institutions and 
governments. The Board has authorised the potential conflicts 
and requires Lord Lupton to recuse himself from discussions, 
should the need arise.

Share capital
Detail of the rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s 
issued share capital may be found in note 40 to the financial 
statements.

In the interests of good governance and in accordance with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors  
will retire at the 2024 AGM and those wishing to serve again will 
submit themselves for re-election. Biographies of the current 
directors are set out on pages 74 to 75. Details of the directors 
seeking re-election at the AGM will be set out in the Notice  
of Meeting.

Power of directors in relation to shares
The Board manages the business of the Company under the 
powers set out in the articles of association, which include the 
directors’ ability to issue or buy back shares. The directors were 
granted authorities to issue and allot shares and to buy back 
shares at the 2023 AGM. Shareholders will be asked to renew  
these authorities at the 2024 AGM. 

Board composition changes
There were no changes to the composition of the Board since 
1 January 2023 up to the date of this report. Alan Dickinson and 
Lord Lupton have notified the Board that they do not intend to 
seek re-election at this year’s annual general meeting. Nathan 
Bostock will be appointed as a non-executive director and, 
subject to regulatory approval, Chair of Lloyds Bank Corporate 
Markets plc, in each case with effect from 1 August 2024.

The authority in respect of purchase of the Company’s ordinary 
shares, as granted at the 2022 AGM, was limited to 7,047,917,092 
ordinary shares, equivalent to 10 per cent of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company as at the latest practicable date 
prior to publication of the 2022 AGM Notice of Meeting. Such 
authority was used during the year under review in connection 
with the share buyback programme described below and,  
as at 31 December 2023 and the date of this report, a total of 
4,386,262,707 ordinary shares had been repurchased.

Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reporting  
for our own operations
The Group has reported greenhouse gas emissions and 
environmental performance since 2009 and since 2013 this has 
been reported in line with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and its applicable regulations and the Large and Medium 
Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 as amended (i.e. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting 
(SECR). Our total emissions, in tonnes of CO2 equivalent, are 
reported in the table below. Deloitte LLP has provided limited  
level ISAE 3000 (Revised) assurance over selected non-financial 
indicators. Their full independent assurance statement is available 
online on the financial downloads page 

 of our website. 

Methodology
The Group follows the principles of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to 
calculate Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from our worldwide 
operations. Energy consumption is calculated according to 
guidance set out by the Department for Energy Security and Net 
Zero. The reporting period is 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023, 
which is different to that of our directors’ report (January to 
December 2023). This is in line with the regulations in that most  
of the emissions reporting year falls within the period of the 
directors’ report.

Research and development activities
During the ordinary course of business, the Group develops  
new products and services within the business units.

Change of control
The Company is not party to any significant agreements which 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid. There are no agreements 
between the Company and its directors or employees providing 
compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a 
takeover, except for the Company’s employee share plans which 
contain provisions relating to a change of control set out on  
page 301.

Capital Requirements  
(Country-by-Country Reporting)
As required under the Capital Requirements (Country-by-Country 
Reporting) Regulations 2013, the Group’s related disclosures may 
be found online on the financial downloads page 

 of our website. 

Post balance sheet events
Details of events since the date of the balance sheet are provided 
in note 55 on page 332.

Substantial shareholders
Major shareholders do not have different voting rights from other 
holders of ordinary shares. Information provided to the Company 
by substantial shareholders pursuant to the DTR is published via  
a Regulatory Information Service. As at 31 December 2023, the 
Company had been notified by its substantial shareholders  
under Rule 5 of the DTR of the following interests in the  
Company’s shares:

representing 5.04 per cent of the voting rights in the Company and (ii) a 
holding of 69,305,385 in other financial instruments in respect of the Company 
representing 0.09 per cent of the voting rights of the Company. BlackRock 
Inc.’s holding most recently notified to the Company under Rule 5 of the DTR 
varies from the holding disclosed in BlackRock Inc.’s Schedule 13-G filing with 
the US Securities and Exchange Commission dated 8 February 2024, which 
identifies beneficial ownership of 5,352,886,800 shares in the Company 
representing 8.4 per cent of the issued share capital in the Company. This 
variance is attributable to different notification and disclosure requirements 
between these regulatory regimes.

Emissions are reported based on the operational control 
approach. Reported Scope 1 emissions are those generated from 
gas and oil used in buildings, emissions from fuels used in UK 
company owned vehicles used for business travel and fugitive 
emissions from the use of air conditioning and chiller/refrigerant 
plant. Reported Scope 2 emissions are generated from the use  
and purchase of electricity and imported heat through heat 
networks; which are calculated using both the location and 
market-based methodologies. Reported Scope 3 emissions relate 
to business travel (category 6) and commuting (category 7) 
undertaken by colleagues, emissions from colleagues working 
from home (category 7), operational waste (category 5) and the 
extraction and distribution of each of our energy sources – 
electricity, imported heating, gas and oil (category 3). Scope 3 
emissions do not include purchased good and services, capital 
goods and upstream transportation and distribution (category 1, 2 
and 4) and investments (category 15), but these figures are 
disclosed in the sustainability report which can be found on the 
responsible business downloads page 

 of our website.

Intensities have been restated for 2018/19, 2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22 
emissions data to improve the accuracy of reporting, using actual data to 
replace estimates, account for the historical impacts of acquired Embark 
Group locations and improvements to fugitive gas calculations. Underlying 
income figures for those years have not changed.

This year our overall location-based carbon emissions2 were 
177,599 tonnes CO2e; a 0.7 per cent increasing year on year. While 
our overall market-based carbon emissions3 were 123,499 tonnes 
CO2e; a 5.0 per cent increase since 2021/22 mainly driven by 
higher business travel and commuting related carbon emissions. 
Group energy consumption (electricity and gas) has reduced in

buildings and adaptations to our established hybrid workstyle.

renewable certificates equivalent to the remainder to make up the total 
electricity consumption in each of the markets in which we operate.

Energy efficiency
Our ongoing energy optimisation programme has resulted in  
62 GWh cumulative energy savings in 2023. This workstream 
includes onsite optimisation and strategic alterations of building 
management and control systems to match the run hours of 
plant to core operating hours and ensures temperature settings 
are aligned with Group comfort guidelines. In 2023, 30 deep dives, 
47 onsite optimisations, 16 remote optimisations, 14 onsite 
engagements and 151 bank holiday programmes were 
completed. Together with the energy optimisation programme, 
we have also delivered a significant LED lighting and Building 
Management System upgrade throughout our estate, leading  
to an estimated annualised 6,406 MWh electricity saving. These 
were the principal measures taken in 2023 to increase the Group’s 
energy efficiency. 

Omissions
Emissions associated with our supply chain, joint ventures and 
investments are not included in this disclosure as they fall outside 
the scope of our operational boundary. Further information on 
these sources can be found in the sustainability report available 
on the responsible business downloads page 
The Group does not have any emissions associated with the 
purchase of steam or cooling for its own use and is not aware of 
any other material sources of omissions from our reporting.

Methodology and definitions
Data is sourced from the Group’s HR system (Workday) containing 
all permanent colleague details. All data is disclosed as at 
31 December 2023. The Group has 100 per cent completion of 
gender data and ethnic background data for the Board and 
Group Executive Committee (GEC). All diversity information for 
ethnicity is based on voluntary self-declaration by colleagues. 
Our systems do not record diversity data of colleagues who have 
not declared this information and is for UK payroll only. Gender 
data includes international, those on parental/maternity leave, 
absent without leave and long-term sick and excludes 
contractors, Group non-executive directors and temporary  
and agency staff. The GEC assists the Group Chief Executive  
in strategic, cross-business or Group-wide matters and inputs  
to the Board. GEC includes the Group Chief Executive. Diversity 
calculations are based on headcount, not full-time employee 
value. Ethnicity data excludes non-UK colleagues.

Independent auditor and audit information
Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this report 
confirms that, so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and 
each director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a director to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.

This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, 
including the directors’ remuneration report and the financial 
statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors 
are required to prepare the Group and parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with international accounting 
standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006.

Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required  
to properly select and apply accounting policies; present 
information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in international accounting standards 
in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance; and  
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors’ 
remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

A copy of the financial statements is placed on our website  
on the financial downloads page 
for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and  
dissemination of financial statements may differ from  
legislation in other jurisdictions.

. The directors are responsible  

Each of the current directors who are in office as at the date 
of this report, and whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 74 to 75 of this annual report, confirm that, to the best 
of his or her knowledge:
•  The Group and the Company financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with international accounting 
standards in conformity with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group and 
the Company

•  The management report contained in the strategic report and 
the directors’ report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and the Company together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties they face

•  The annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, 

balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company and the 
Group’s position, performance, business model and strategy. 

The directors have also separately reviewed and approved the 
strategic report.

Risk management

Risk management is at the heart of 
Helping Britain Prosper and creating a 
more sustainable and inclusive future for 
people and businesses.

Our mission is to protect our customers, 
shareholders, colleagues and the Group, while 
enabling sustainable growth. This is achieved 
through informed risk decisions and robust risk 
management, supported by a consistent risk-
focused culture.

The risk overview (pages 39 to 45) provides a summary of risk 
management within the Group and the key focus areas for 2023, 
including maintaining support for customers. The risk overview 
also highlights the importance of the connectivity of principal, 
emerging and strategic risks and how they are embedded into 
the Group’s strategic risk management framework.

This full risk management section provides a more in-depth 
picture of how risk is managed within the Group, detailing the 
Group’s emerging risks, approach to stress testing, risk 
governance, committee structure, appetite for risk and a full 
analysis of the principal risk categories (pages 145 to 196), the 
framework by which risks are identified, managed, mitigated and 
monitored.

The Group’s approach to risk
The Group operates a prudent approach to risk with rigorous 
management controls to support sustainable business growth 
and minimise losses. Through a strong and independent risk 
function (Risk division), a robust control framework is maintained 
to identify and escalate current and emerging risks, support 
sustainable growth within the Group’s risk appetite, and to drive 
and inform good risk reward decision making.

To comply with UK specific ring-fencing requirements, core 
banking services are ring-fenced from other activities within the 
overall Group. The Group’s enterprise risk management framework 
(ERMF) and risk appetite apply across the Group. These are 
supplemented by sub-group specific risk management 
frameworks and risk appetites which operate within the Group 
parameters. The Group’s Corporate Governance Framework 
applies across Lloyds Banking Group plc, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of 
Scotland plc and HBOS plc. It is tailored where needed to meet the 
entity-specific needs of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc, 
within the Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group and supplementary 
corporate governance frameworks are in place to address the 
specific requirements of the other sub-groups (Non-Ring-Fenced 
Bank, Insurance and Equity Investments).

The Group’s ERMF is structured to align with the industry-accepted 
internal control framework standards.

The ERMF applies to every area of the business and covers all 
types of risk. It is reviewed, updated and approved by the Board to 
reflect any changes in the nature of the Group’s business and 
external regulations, law, corporate governance and industry 
good practice. The Group is in the process of conducting a more 
detailed review of the ERMF which will result in a reclassification of 
our principal risks in 2024.

The ERMF provides the Group with an effective mechanism for 
developing and embedding risk policies and risk management 
strategies which are aligned with the risks faced by its businesses. 
It also seeks to facilitate effective communication on these 
matters across the Group.

Role of the Board and senior management
Key responsibilities of the Board and senior management include:
• Approval of the ERMF and Board risk appetite
• Approval of Group-wide risk principles and policies
•

The cascade of delegated authority (for example to Board 
sub-committees and the Group Chief Executive)
Effective oversight of risk management consistent with risk 
appetite

•

Lloyds Banking Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Risk appetite
The Group’s approach to setting, governing, embedding and 
monitoring risk appetite is detailed in the risk appetite framework, 
a key component of the ERMF. 

Risk appetite is defined within the Group as the amount and type 
of risk that the Group is prepared to seek, accept or tolerate in 
delivering its strategy.

Business planning aims to optimise value within the Group’s risk 
appetite parameters and deliver on its promise of Helping Britain 
Prosper.

The Group’s risk appetite statement details the risk parameters 
within which the Group operates. The statement forms part of the 
Group’s control framework and is embedded into its policies, 
authorities and limits, to guide decision making and risk 
management. Group risk appetite is regularly reviewed and 
refreshed to ensure appropriate coverage across our principal 
risks and any emerging risks, and to align with internal or external 
change.

The Board is responsible for approving the Group’s Board risk 
appetite statement annually. Group Board level metrics are 
augmented by further executive-level metrics and cascaded into 
more detailed business appetite metrics and limits.

The following areas are currently included in the Group Board risk 
appetite:

• Capital: the Group maintains capital levels commensurate 

with a prudent level of solvency to achieve financial resilience 
and market confidence

• Change and execution: the Group has limited appetite for 

negative impacts on customers, colleagues, or the Group as a 
result of change activity

• Climate: the Group takes action to support the Group and its 
customers’ transition to net zero, and maintain its resilience 
against the risks relating to climate change

• Conduct: the Group delivers good outcomes for its customers
• Credit: the Group has a conservative and well-balanced credit 
portfolio through the economic cycle in line with the Group’s 
target return on equity in aggregate. The Group’s approach 
focuses on origination quality and levers at Board level while 
dynamically adapting to the risk environment, business growth 
strategy, industry practices and regulatory expectations

• Data: the Group has zero appetite for data-related regulatory 

fines or enforcement actions

• Funding and liquidity: the Group maintains a prudent liquidity 
profile and a balance sheet structure that limits its reliance on 
potentially volatile sources of funding 
Insurance underwriting: the Group has an appetite to take on 
insurance underwriting risks where they fit with our strategic 
objectives

•

• Market: the Group has effective controls in place to identify 
and manage the market risk inherent in our customer and 
client-focused activities

• Model: material models perform in line with expectations 
• Operational: the Group has robust controls in place to 

manage operational losses, reputational events and regulatory 
breaches. It identifies and assesses emerging risks and acts to 
mitigate these

• Operational resilience: the Group has limited appetite for 
disruption to services to customers and stakeholders from 
significant unexpected events

• People: the Group leads responsibly and proficiently, manages 
people resource effectively, supports and develops colleague 
skills and talent, creates and nurtures the right culture and 
meets legal and regulatory obligations related to its people
• Regulatory and legal: the Group interprets and complies with 
all relevant regulation and all applicable laws (including codes 
of conduct which could have legal implications) and/or legal 
obligations

Governance frameworks
The Group’s approach to risk is based on a robust control 
framework and a strong risk management culture which are the 
foundation for the delivery of effective risk management and 
guide the way all employees approach their work, behave and 
make decisions.

Governance is maintained through delegation of authority from 
the Board to individuals through the management hierarchy. 
Senior executives are supported where required by a committee-
based structure which is designed to ensure open challenge and 
support effective decision making.

The Group’s risk appetite, principles, policies, procedures, controls 
and reporting are regularly reviewed and updated where needed 
to ensure they remain fully in line with regulation, law, corporate 
governance and industry good practice.

The interaction of the executive and non-executive governance 
structures relies upon a culture of transparency and openness 
that is encouraged by both the Board and senior management.

Board level engagement, coupled with the direct involvement of 
senior management in Group-wide risk issues at Group Executive 
Committee level, ensures that escalated issues are promptly 
addressed and remediation plans are initiated where required.

Line managers are directly accountable for identifying and 
managing risks in their individual businesses, ensuring that 
business decisions strike an appropriate balance between risk 
and reward and are consistent with the Group’s risk appetite.

Clear responsibilities and accountabilities for risk are defined 
across the Group through a three lines of defence model which 
ensures effective independent oversight and assurance in 
respect of key decisions.

The Risk Committee governance framework is outlined on page 
141.

Three lines of defence model
The ERMF is implemented through a ‘three lines of defence’ model 
which defines clear responsibilities and accountabilities and 
ensures effective independent oversight and assurance activities 
take place covering key decisions.

Business lines (first line) have primary responsibility for risk 
decisions, identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks 
within their areas of accountability. They are required to establish 
effective governance and control frameworks for their business to 
be compliant with Group policy requirements, to maintain 
appropriate risk management skills, mechanisms and toolkits, and 
to act within Group risk appetite parameters set and approved by 
the Board.

Risk division (second line) is centralised, headed by the Chief Risk 
Officer, providing oversight and constructive challenge to the 
effectiveness of risk decisions taken by business management, 
providing proactive advice and guidance, reviewing, challenging 
and reporting on the risk profile of the Group and ensuring that 
mitigating actions are appropriate.

It also has a key role in promoting the implementation of a 
strategic approach to risk management reflecting the risk 
appetite and ERMF agreed by the Board that encompasses:
• Overseeing embedding of effective risk management 

•
•

processes
Transparent, focused risk monitoring and reporting
Provision of expert and high-quality advice and guidance to 
the Board, executives and management on strategic issues 
and horizon scanning, including pending regulatory changes
• A constructive dialogue with the first line through provision of 

advice, development of common methodologies, 
understanding, education, training, and development of new 
risk management tools

The primary role of Group Internal Audit (third line) is to help the 
Board and executive management protect the assets, reputation 
and sustainability of the Group. Group Internal Audit is led by the 
Group Chief Internal Auditor. Group Internal Audit provides 
independent assurance to the Audit Committee and the Board 
through performing reviews and engaging with committees and 
executive management, providing opinion, challenge and 
informal advice on risk and the state of the control environment. 
Group Internal Audit is a single independent internal audit 
function, reporting to the Group Audit Committee, and the Board 
or Board Audit Committees of the sub-groups, subsidiaries and 
legal entities where applicable.

Risk and control cycle from identification to reporting
To allow senior management to make informed risk decisions, the 
business follows a continuous risk management approach. This 
risk and control cycle, from identification to reporting, ensures that 
there is consistency in the approach to managing and mitigating 
risks impacting the Group.

The risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) process is used to 
identify, measure and manage operational risk across the Group. 
Risks, including emerging risks, are identified and measured on an 
inherent basis, using a consistent quantification methodology. 

All key controls are recorded against material inherent risks, and 
assessed on a regular basis, in response to triggers or as a 
minimum annually. Where a control is not effective, the root cause 
is established and action plans implemented to improve control 
design or performance. The assessment of control effectiveness 
combined with a view of the inherent risk assessment is used to 
determine the residual risk that the Group is exposed to. 

Risks are reviewed and independently challenged by the Risk 
division and then reported on a regular basis to management 
and the Board through the risk governance structure. Risk 
exposure is compared to overall risk appetite as well as specific 
limits or triggers. When thresholds are breached, committee 
minutes are clear on the actions and time frames required to 
address the risk and bring the exposure back within tolerance. 

Risk identification is also conducted through the use of scenario 
analysis which considers the most material risks the Group faces 
and identifies and assesses extreme, but plausible instances 
which may occur.

Risk culture
The Group operates a prudent business model and a balanced 
approach to risk management. This provides a solid foundation to 
deliver good customer outcomes and drive forward the Group’s 
strategic transformation to ensure we continue Helping Britain 
Prosper. Guided by the Board, the senior management articulates 
and role models the core risk values to which the Group aspires. 
Senior management establishes a strong focus on building and 
sustaining long-term relationships with customers, through the 
economic cycle. The Group’s Code of Ethics and Responsibility, 
reinforce colleagues’ accountability for the risks they take, and 
supports better decision making to meet their customers’ needs.

Risk skills and capabilities
To support a strong risk culture across the Group, all colleagues 
complete risk training as part of their annual mandatory training. 
A library of risk management learning resources is available, 
which all colleagues who have specific risk management roles 
can access to build their skills and capabilities.

There is ongoing investment in risk systems and models alongside 
the Group’s investment in customer and product systems and 
processes. This drives improvements in risk data quality, 
aggregation and reporting leading to effective and efficient risk 
decisions.

Risk decision making and reporting
Risk analysis and reporting enables better understanding of risks 
and returns, supporting the identification of opportunities as well 
as better management of risks.

An aggregate view of the Group’s overall risk profile, key risks and 
management actions, and performance against risk appetite, 
including the Key Risk Insights Report and Consolidated Risk Report 
(CRR), is reported to and discussed monthly at the Group Risk 
Committee with regular reporting to the Board Risk Committee 
and the Board.

Financial reporting risk management systems and internal 
controls
The Group maintains risk management systems and internal 
controls relating to the financial reporting process which are 
designed to:
•

Ensure that accounting policies are appropriately and 
consistently applied, transactions are recorded accurately, 
and undertaken in accordance with delegated authorities, that 
assets are safeguarded and liabilities are properly stated
Enable the calculation, preparation and reporting of financial, 
prudential regulatory and tax outcomes in accordance with 
applicable International Financial Reporting Standards,

and the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
Ensure ongoing monitoring to assess the impact of emerging 
regulation and legislation on financial, prudential regulatory 
and tax reporting
Ensure an accurate view of the Group’s performance to allow 
the Board and senior management to appropriately manage 
the affairs and strategy of the business as a whole and each of 
its sub-groups

The Group has a Disclosure Committee which assists the Group 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer in fulfilling their 
disclosure responsibilities under relevant listing and other 
regulatory and legal requirements. In addition, the Audit 
Committee reviews the quality and acceptability of the Group’s 
financial disclosures. For further information on the Audit 
Committee’s responsibilities relating to financial reporting see 
pages 97 to 100.

Exposure to risk arising from the business activities of the 
Group
The table below provides a high level guide to how the Group’s 
business activities are reflected through its risk-weighted assets 
(RWAs), which are calculated in accordance with prudential 
capital requirements. There are a number of risks that are not 
captured in RWAs such as pension obligation risk and interest rate 
risk in the banking book, which instead fall within the scope of the 
Group's Pillar 2A capital requirements. Furthermore the risk relating 
to Insurance activities is not included in this table as Insurance is 
subject to a different set of prudential rules (Solvency 2 regime). 
Details of the business activities for each division are provided in 
the divisional results on pages 58 to 65.

As a separate regulated business, the Insurance business maintains its own solvency requirements, including appropriate management buffers, and reports directly to 
the Insurance Board. Insurance does not hold any RWAs as its assets are removed from the Group’s banking regulatory capital calculations. However, in accordance with 
banking capital rules part of the Group’s equity investment in Insurance is included in the calculation of threshold RWAs, while the remainder is taken as a deduction from 
common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital.
Equity Investments and Central Items includes the risk-weighted assets of the Group’s equity investments businesses (including Lloyds Development Capital and Citra 
Living) and Group Corporate Treasury, in addition to other central amounts.
Exposures relating to the default fund of a central counterparty and credit valuation adjustment risk are included in counterparty credit risk.
Threshold RWAs reflect the proportion of significant investments and deferred tax assets that are permitted to be risk-weighted instead of deducted from CET1 capital. 
Significant investments primarily arise from the investment in the Group’s Insurance business.

Risk governance
The risk governance structure below is integral to effective risk management across the Group. To meet ring-fencing requirements the 
Boards and Board Committees of the Group and the Ring-Fenced Banks as well as relevant Committees of the Group and the Ring-
Fenced Banks will sit concurrently and we refer to this as the Aligned Board Model. Please see page 87 for further information on the 
Aligned Board Model and the Group’s approach to ring-fencing. The Risk division is appropriately represented on key committees to 
ensure that risk management is discussed in these meetings. This structure outlines the flow and escalation of risk information and 
reporting from business areas and the Risk division to the Group Executive Committee and Board. Conversely, strategic direction and 
guidance is cascaded down from the Board and Group Executive Committee.

Stress testing
Overview
Stress testing is recognised as a key risk management tool by the 
Boards, senior management, the businesses and the Risk and 
Finance functions of all parts of the Group and its legal entities. It 
is fully embedded in the planning process of the Group and its key 
legal entities as a key activity in medium-term planning, and 
senior management is actively involved in stress testing activities 
via the governance process.

Scenario stress testing is used to support:

Risk identification:
• Understanding key vulnerabilities of the Group and its key legal 

entities under adverse economic conditions

Risk appetite:
• Assessing the results of the stress test against the risk appetite 

of all parts of the Group to ensure the Group and its legal 
entities are managed within their risk parameters
Setting of risk appetite by assessing the underlying risks under 
stress conditions

•

Strategic and capital planning:
•

Senior management and the Boards of the Group and its 
applicable legal entities to adjust strategies if the plan does not 
meet risk appetite in a stressed scenario
The ICAAP, by demonstrating capital adequacy and meet the 
requirements of regulatory stress tests that are used to inform 
the setting of the PRA and management buffers (see capital 
risk on pages 146 to 153) of the Group and its separately 
regulated legal entities
The capital allocation process which feeds into business unit 
performance management

•

•

Risk mitigation:
•

The development of potential actions and contingency plans 
to mitigate the impact of adverse scenarios. Stress testing also 
links directly to the recovery and resolution planning process of 
the Group and its legal entities

Regulatory stress tests
Following two years of COVID-19 pandemic crisis related stress 
testing, in 2022 the PRA returned to the annual cyclical scenario 
(ACS) stress test framework. The 2022 ACS included submissions 
for both the Group and RFB. The 2022 stress test objective was to 
assess the resilience of the UK banking system to deep 
simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economy, large falls 
in asset prices and higher global interest rates. The results were 
published in the third quarter of 2023; the Group passed the stress 
test and given the strong performance, the Group was not 
required to take any capital actions. 

Internal stress tests
On at least an annual basis, the Group conducts macroeconomic 
stress tests to highlight and understand the key vulnerabilities of 
the Group’s and its legal entities’ business plans to adverse 
changes in the economic environment, and to ensure that there 
are adequate financial resources in the event of a downturn.

Reverse stress testing
Reverse stress testing is used to explore the vulnerabilities of the 
Group’s and its key legal entities’ strategies and plans for extreme 
adverse events that would cause the businesses to fail. Where this 
identifies plausible scenarios with an unacceptably high risk, the 
Group or its entities will adopt measures to prevent or mitigate 
that and reflect these in strategic plans.

Other stress testing activity
The Group’s stress testing programme also involves undertaking 
assessments of liquidity scenarios, market risk sensitivities and 
scenarios, and business-specific scenarios (see the principal risk 
categories on pages 146 to 196 for further information on risk-
specific stress testing). If required, ad hoc stress testing exercises 
are also undertaken to assess emerging risks, as well as in 
response to regulatory requests. This wide-ranging programme 
provides a comprehensive view of the potential impacts arising 
from the risks to which the Group is exposed and reflects the 
nature, scale and complexity of the Group. The Group is currently 
participating in the Bank of England’s System-wide exploratory 
scenario (SWES), which aims to improve understanding of the 
behaviours of banks and non-bank financial institutions during 
stressed financial market conditions. Results of this exercise will be 
published in late 2024.

Methodology
The stress tests process must comply with all regulatory 
requirements, which is achieved through comprehensive 
macroeconomic scenarios and a rigorous divisional, functional, 
risk and executive review and challenge process, supported by 
analysis and insight into impacts on customers and business 
drivers.

All relevant business, Risk and Finance teams are involved in the 
delivery of analysis, and ensure the sensitivity of the business plan 
to each risk is well understood. The methodologies and modelling 
approach used for stress testing embed direct links between the 
macroeconomic scenarios and the drivers for each business area 
to give appropriate stress sensitivities. All material assumptions 
used in modelling are documented and justified, with a clearly 
communicated review and sign-off process. Modelling is 
supported by expert judgement and is subject to the Group 
model governance policy.

Governance
Clear accountabilities and responsibilities for stress testing are 
assigned to senior management and the Risk and Finance 
functions throughout the Group and its key legal entities. This is 
formalised through the Group business planning and stress 
testing policy and procedure, which are reviewed at least 
annually.

The GFRC, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and attended by the 
Chief Financial Officer and other senior Risk and Finance 
colleagues, has primary responsibility for overseeing the 
development and execution of the Group’s and Ring-Fenced 
Bank’s stress tests. The Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc (LBCM) 
Risk Committee performs a similar function within the scope of 
LBCM.

The review and challenge of the Group’s and Ring-Fenced Bank’s 
detailed stress forecasts, the key assumptions behind these, and 
the methodology used to translate the economic assumptions 
into stressed outputs conclude with the appropriate Finance and 
Risk sign-off. The outputs are then presented to the GFRC and the 
Board Risk Committee for review and challenge. With all regulatory 
exercises being approved by the Board. There is a similar process 
within the LBCM for the governance of the LBCM-specific results.

Risk management continued

Emerging risks
Background and framework
Understanding emerging risks is an essential component of the 
Group’s risk management approach. It enables the Group to 
identify the most pertinent risks and opportunities, and to 
proactively respond through strategic planning and appropriate 
risk mitigation.

Whilst emerging risk is not a principal risk, if left undetected 
emerging risks have the potential to adversely impact the Group 
or result in missed opportunities.

Impacts from emerging risks on the Group’s principal risks can 
materialise in two ways:
•

Emerging risks can impact the Group’s principal risks directly in 
the absence of an appropriate strategic response
Emerging risks can be a source of new risks, dependent on our 
chosen response and the underlying assumptions on how 
given emerging risks may manifest

•

Where an emerging risk is considered material enough in its own 
right, the Group may choose to recognise the risk as a principal 
risk, with a recent example being climate risk. Such elevations are 
considered and approved through the Board Risk Committee as 
part of the annual refresh of the enterprise risk management 
framework.

Risk identification
The basis for risk identification is underpinned by our horizon 
scanning approach, supported by collaboration between 
functions across the Group. The Group works closely with 
regulatory authorities and industry bodies to ensure that the 
Group can monitor external developments and identify and 
respond to the evolving landscape, particularly in relation to 
regulatory and legal risk. In addition, the Group engages with 
external experts to gain external insight and context. This activity 
complements and builds upon the annual strategic planning 
cycle and is used to identify key external trends, risks and 
opportunities for the Group.

The Group continues to evolve its approach for the identification 
and prioritisation of emerging risks. During 2023, the Group 
continued to evolve its emerging risk methodology, refining and 
enhancing the process, placing greater focus on existing controls, 
to reflect the Group’s position in its strategic transformation 
journey and the level of planned investment outlined in the 
Group’s business plans.

The emerging risk methodology is centred around several key 
factors:
•
•
•

The threat presented by a risk
The Group’s specific vulnerability to the risk
The preparation and protection the Group has in place to 
manage or mitigate impacts
The existing control environment and planned investment (new 
for 2023)

•

Our evolved approach has further streamlined the list of 
emerging risk themes from 10 to eight, enabling greater 
management concentration on developing the appropriate 
responses.

The emerging risk themes detailed in the risk overview section on 
page 44, align to the current primary risks the Group is managing 
and many of which (for example, operational elasticity and 
political and macroeconomic environment) are continuous areas 
of focus. The nature of emerging risks is expected to evolve and 
may require different ways to mitigate from the measures used 
today. The risks also correlate, for example customer propositions 
and societal expectations will be influenced by the UK political 
and macroeconomic environment. 

Risk mitigation and monitoring
Emerging risks are currently managed through the Group’s 
strategic risk framework, detailed on page 196.

Emerging risk themes have been discussed at executive-level 
committees throughout 2023, with key actions assigned to closely 
monitor their manifestation and potential opportunities, and in 
some cases, also forming part of the business planning process. 
Deep dives on selected emerging risk themes are also planned for 
2024. 

As part of the 2023 analysis, it has been identified that there is 
significant overlap with the previous strategic risk themes (climate 
change, customer proposition, organisational purpose, talent 
attraction and retention, and technology advances) and the 
emerging risk themes. This further supports our recommendation 
to merge these into a combined category of horizon and 
emerging risks from 2024 onwards. The graphic below indicates 
the mapping of the strategic risk themes to the emerging risk 
themes.

Full analysis of risk categories
The Group’s risk framework covers all types of risk which affect the Group and could impact on the achievement of its strategic 
objectives. A detailed description of each category is provided on pages 146 to 196. 

Risk categories recognised by the Group are periodically reviewed to ensure that they reflect the Group risk profile in light of internal 
and external factors, such as the Group strategy and the regulatory environment in which it operates. No changes were made to the 
risk categories in 2023.

Capital risk
Definition
Capital risk is defined as the risk that an insufficient quantity or 
quality of capital is held to meet regulatory requirements or to 
support business strategy, an inefficient level of capital is held or 
that capital is inefficiently deployed across the Group.

•

•

Exposures
A capital risk event arises when the Group has insufficient capital 
resources to support its strategic objectives and plans, and to 
meet both regulatory and external stakeholder requirements and 
expectations. This could arise due to a depletion of the Group’s 
capital resources as a result of the crystallisation of any of the 
risks to which it is exposed, or through a significant increase in 
risk-weighted assets as a result of rule changes or economic 
deterioration. Alternatively a shortage of capital could arise from 
an increase in the minimum requirements for capital, leverage or 
MREL either at Group, Ring-Fenced Bank (RFB) sub-group or 
regulated entity level. The Group’s capital management approach 
is focused on maintaining sufficient and appropriate capital 
resources across all regulated levels of its structure in order to 
prevent such exposures while optimising value for shareholders.

Measurement
The Group maintains capital levels across all regulated entities 
commensurate with a prudent level of solvency to achieve 
financial resilience and market confidence. To support this, capital 
risk appetite is calibrated by taking into consideration both an 
internal view of the amount of capital to hold as well as external 
regulatory requirements.

The Group assesses both its regulatory capital requirements and 
the quantity and quality of capital resources it holds to meet 
those requirements in accordance with the relevant provisions of 
the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) and Capital 
Requirements Regulation (UK CRR). This is supplemented through 
additional regulation set out under the PRA Rulebook and through 
associated statements of policy, supervisory statements and 
other regulatory guidance. 

Further details of the regulatory capital and leverage frameworks 
to which the Group is subject, including the means by which its 
capital and leverage requirements and capital resources are 
calculated, are provided in the Group’s Pillar 3 disclosures. 

The minimum amount of total capital, under Pillar 1 of the 
regulatory capital framework, is set at 8 per cent of total risk-
weighted assets. At least 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets are 
required to be met with common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and at 
least 6 per cent of risk-weighted assets are required to be met 
with tier 1 capital. Minimum Pillar 1 requirements are supplemented 
by both additional minimum requirements under Pillar 2A of the 
regulatory capital framework, the aggregate of which is referred 
to as the Group’s Total Capital Requirement (TCR), and by a 
number of regulatory capital buffers as described below.

Additional minimum capital requirements under Pillar 2A are set 
by the PRA as a firm-specific Individual Capital Requirement (ICR) 
reflecting a point in time estimate, which may change over time, 
of the minimum amount of capital to cover risks that are not fully 
covered by Pillar 1, such as credit concentration and operational 
risk, and those risks not covered at all by Pillar 1, such as pension 
obligation risk and interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB). 
This is set as a variable amount for Pillar 2A (being a set 
percentage of risk-weighted assets), with fixed add-ons for 
certain risk types. The Group’s Pillar 2A capital requirement is 
currently the equivalent of around 2.6 per cent of risk-weighted 
assets, of which the minimum amount to be met by CET1 capital is 
the equivalent of around 1.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets. 

The Group is also required to hold a number of regulatory capital 
buffers which must be met with CET1 capital.

Systemic buffers are designed to hold systemically important 
banks to higher capital standards, so that they can withstand a 
greater level of stress before requiring resolution.

The Group is not currently classified as a global systemically 
important institution (G-SII) but has been classified as an ‘other’ 
systemically important institution (O-SII) by the PRA
The O-SII buffer applies to the Group’s RFB sub-group and is 
currently set at 2.0 per cent of the RFB sub-group’s risk-
weighted assets. The FPC amended the O-SII buffer framework 
in 2022, changing the metric for determining the buffer rate 
from total assets to the UK leverage exposure measure. The 
first review point under the revised framework occurred during 
December 2023 (based upon the RFB sub-group’s UK leverage 
exposure measure as at 31 December 2022) which resulted in 
no change to the current buffer. This currently equates to 
1.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at Group level, with the 
difference reflecting the risk-weighted assets of the Group that 
are not in the RFB sub-group and for which the O-SII buffer 
does not therefore apply. It is the PRA’s policy to include this in 
the Group’s PRA Buffer. 

The capital conservation buffer (CCB) is a standard buffer of 
2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets designed to provide for losses 
in the event of stress.

The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is time-varying and is 
designed to require banks to hold additional capital to remove or 
reduce the build-up of systemic risk in times of credit boom, 
providing additional loss-absorbing capacity and acting as an 
incentive for banks to constrain further credit growth. The amount 
of the buffer is determined by reference to buffer rates published 
by the FPC for the individual countries where the Group has 
relevant credit exposures. The FPC also sets the UK CCyB rate 
which is currently set at 2 per cent, following a 1 per cent increase 
in July 2023. The FPC judges that the neutral rate for the UK CCyB is 
around 2 per cent. 

Given the Group’s UK-focused business model, the Group’s CCyB 
at 31 December 2023 was 1.8 per cent of risk-weighted assets.

As part of the Group’s capital planning process, forecast capital 
positions are subjected to stress testing to determine the 
adequacy of the Group’s capital resources against minimum 
requirements, including the Pillar 2A requirement. The PRA 
considers outputs from both the Group’s internal stress tests and 
Bank of England (BoE) stress tests, in conjunction with other 
information, as part of the process for informing the setting of a 
bank-specific capital buffer for the Group, known as the PRA 
Buffer. The PRA requires this buffer to remain confidential.

Under recent Bank of England stress tests, the BoE has taken 
action to avoid an unwarranted de facto increase in capital 
requirements that could result from the interaction of IFRS 9. The 
stress hurdle rates for banks participating in the 2022/23 annual 
cyclical scenario (ACS) stress test exercise were adjusted to 
recognise the additional resilience provided by the earlier 
provisions taken under IFRS 9. The BoE is continuing to work 
towards a more enduring treatment of IFRS 9 for the purposes of 
future stress tests.

All buffers are required to be met with CET1 capital. Usage of the 
PRA Buffer would trigger a dialogue between the Group and the 
PRA to agree what action is required whereas a breach of the 
combined buffer (all other regulatory buffers, as referenced 
above) would give rise to mandatory restrictions upon any 
discretionary capital distributions. The PRA has previously 
communicated its expectation that banks’ capital and liquidity 
buffers can be drawn down as necessary to support the real 
economy through a shock and that sufficient time would be 
made available to restore buffers in a gradual manner. 

In addition to the risk-based capital framework outlined above, 
the Group is also subject to minimum capital requirements under 
the UK Leverage Ratio Framework. The leverage ratio is calculated 
by dividing tier 1 capital resources by the leverage exposure which 
is a defined measure of on-balance sheet assets and off-balance 
sheet items.

The minimum tier 1 leverage ratio requirement under the UK 
Leverage Ratio Framework is 3.25 per cent. This is supplemented 
by a time-varying countercyclical leverage buffer (CCLB) 
requirement which is determined by multiplying the Group’s CCyB 
rate by 35 per cent. As at 31 December 2023 the CCLB for the 
Group was 0.6 per cent. An additional leverage ratio buffer (ALRB) 
requirement of 0.7 per cent applies to the RFB sub-group and is 
determined by multiplying the RFB sub-group O-SII buffer by 
35 per cent. At Group level an equivalent buffer of 0.6 per cent 
applies.

At least 75 per cent of the 3.25 per cent minimum leverage ratio 
requirement as well as 100 per cent of regulatory leverage buffers 
must be met by CET1 capital.

The leverage ratio framework does not currently give rise to 
higher regulatory capital requirements for the Group than the 
risk-based capital framework.

Mitigation
The Group has a capital management framework that includes 
the setting of capital risk appetite and capital planning and stress 
testing activities. Close monitoring of capital, leverage and MREL 
ratios is undertaken to ensure the Group meets regulatory 
requirements and risk appetite levels and deploys its capital 
resources efficiently. 

The Group regularly refreshes and monitors its suite of early 
warning indicators and maintains a Capital Contingency 
Framework as part of a Recovery Plan, which is designed to 
identify and escalate emerging capital concerns at an early 
stage, so that mitigating actions can be taken, if needed. For 
example, the Group is able to accumulate additional capital 
through the retention of profits over time, which can be enhanced 
through reducing or cancelling proposed dividend payments and 
share buybacks, by raising new equity via, for example, a rights 
issue or debt exchange and by raising additional tier 1 or tier 2 
capital securities. The cost and availability of additional capital 
are dependent upon market conditions and perceptions at the 
time. 

The Group is also able to manage the demand for capital through 
management actions including adjusting its lending strategy, 
business disposals and through the efficient use of securitisations 
and other optimisation activity.

Capital policies and procedures are well established and subject 
to independent oversight.

Monitoring
The Group’s capital is actively managed and monitoring capital 
ratios is a key factor in the Group’s planning processes, which 
separately cover the RFB sub-group and key individual banking 
entities. Multi-year base case forecasts of the Group’s capital 
position, based upon the Group’s operating plan, are produced at 
least annually to inform the Group’s capital plan whilst shorter- 
term forecasts are more frequently undertaken to understand 
and respond to variations of the Group’s actual performance 
against the plan. The Group’s capital plan is tested for capital 
adequacy using relevant stress scenarios and sensitivities 
covering adverse economic conditions as well as other adverse 
factors that could impact the Group.

Regular monitoring of the capital position is undertaken by a 
range of committees, including Group Capital Risk Committee 
(GCRC), Group Financial Risk Committee (GFRC), Group and Ring-
Fenced Banks Asset and Liability Committees (GALCO), Group and 
Ring-Fenced Banks Risk Committees (GRC), Board Risk Committee 
(BRC) and the Board. This includes reporting of actual ratios 
against forecasts and risk appetite, base case and stress scenario 
projected ratios, and review of early warning indicators and 
assessment against the Capital Contingency Framework.

The regulatory capital framework within which the Group 
operates continues to evolve and further detail on this is provided 
in the Group’s Pillar 3 disclosures. The Group continues to monitor 
prudential developments very closely, analysing the potential 
capital impacts to ensure that, through organic capital 
generation and management actions, the Group continues to 
maintain a strong capital position that exceeds both minimum 
regulatory requirements and the Group’s risk appetite and is 
consistent with market expectations.

Target capital ratios
The Board’s revised view of the ongoing level of CET1 capital 
required by the Group to grow the business, meet current and 
future regulatory requirements and cover economic and business 
uncertainties is 13.0 per cent which includes a management buffer 
of around 1 per cent. This takes into account, amongst other 
considerations:
•

The minimum Pillar 1 CET1 capital requirement of 4.5 per cent of 
risk-weighted assets
The Group’s Pillar 2A capital requirement, set by the PRA, of 
which the minimum amount to be met with CET1 capital is the 
equivalent of around 1.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets 
The Group’s current CCyB requirement which is 1.8 per cent of 
risk-weighted assets
The CCB requirement of 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets
The RFB sub-group’s O-SII buffer of 2.0 per cent of risk-weighted 
assets, which equates to 1.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at 
Group level 
The Group’s PRA Buffer
The likely performance of the Group in various potential stress 
scenarios and ensuring capital remains resilient in these
The economic outlook for the UK and business outlook for the 
Group

Capital returns
The Group has in place a progressive and sustainable ordinary 
dividend policy which allows for flexibility to return surplus capital 
to shareholders through share buybacks or special dividends. 

Surplus capital represents capital over and above the amount 
management wish to retain to grow the business, meet current 
and future regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties. The 
amount of required capital may vary from time to time 
depending on circumstances and by its nature there can be no 
guarantee that any return of surplus capital will be made.

Given the Group’s robust financial performance and strong 
capital position at the year end, the Board has recommended a 
final ordinary dividend of 1.84 pence per share. This is in addition to 
the interim ordinary dividend of 0.92 pence per share that was 
announced as part of the 2023 half year results and paid in 
September 2023. The total ordinary dividend for the year is 
therefore 2.76 pence per share. The Group also intends to 
implement a share buyback programme of up to £2.0 billion 
which will commence as soon as is practicable and is expected 
to be completed by 31 December 2024. 

The Board remains committed to future capital returns. Going 
forward, the Board intends to maintain its progressive and 
sustainable ordinary dividend policy alongside further returns of 
surplus capital at the end of the year as appropriate. The Board 
will continue to give due consideration at year end to the size of 
the final dividend payment and to the return of any surplus 
capital based upon the circumstances at the time.

The ability of the Group to pay a dividend is also subject to 
constraints including the availability of distributable reserves, 
legal and regulatory restrictions and the Group’s financial and 
operating performance.

Analysis of CET1 capital position
The Group’s pro forma CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2023 was 
13.7 per cent (31 December 2022: 14.1 per cent pro forma). Capital 
generation before regulatory headwinds during the year was 
223 basis points, reflecting strong banking build, the £250 million 
dividend received from the Insurance business and other 
movements. These impacts were partially offset by risk-weighted 
asset increases (before CRD IV model updates within Retail 
secured and net of optimisation) and the full year payment 
(£800 million) of fixed pension deficit contributions made to the 
Group’s three main defined benefit pension schemes. Regulatory 
headwinds of 50 basis points largely reflect a £5 billion risk-
weighted assets adjustment for part of the impact of Retail 
secured CRD IV model updates. They also reflect the end of IFRS 9 
static transitional relief and the reduction in the transitional factor 
applied to IFRS 9 dynamic relief. Capital generation after the 
impact of these regulatory headwinds was 173 basis points. This 
benefited by just under 30 basis points from an impairment credit 
driven by a significant write-back in the fourth quarter which was 
materially offset by around 15 basis points in relation to the 
£450 million charge arising from the potential impact of the FCA 
review of historical motor finance commission arrangements.

The impact of the interim ordinary dividend paid in September 
2023 and the accrual for the recommended final ordinary 
dividend equated to 86 basis points, with a further 98 basis points 
utilised to cover the accrual for the announced ordinary share 
buyback programme and 9 basis points for variable pension 
contributions reflecting the payment to address the £250 million 
residual aggregate deficit in the fourth quarter. The acquisition of 
Tusker utilised 21 basis points of capital.

Excluding the Insurance dividend received in February 2024 and 
the full impact of the announced ordinary share buyback 
programme, the Group's CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2023 
was 14.6 per cent (31 December 2022: 15.1 per cent).

The full impact of the share buyback will be accrued for through 
the Group’s actual capital position during the first quarter of 2024. 

On 1 January 2024, the transitional factor applied to IFRS 9 
dynamic relief reduced by a further 25 per cent, resulting in a 
reduction of 4 basis points. The Group’s pro forma CET1 capital 
ratio at 31 December 2023 does not include the impact of the 
reduced relief.

Total capital requirement
The Group’s total capital requirement (TCR) as at 31 December 
2023, being the aggregate of the Group’s Pillar 1 and current 
Pillar 2A capital requirements, was £23,322 million (31 December 
2022: £22,550 million).

Capital and MREL resources
An analysis of the Group’s capital position and MREL resources as 
at 31 December 2023 is presented in the following section. This 
reflects the application of the transitional arrangements for IFRS 9. 

Risk management continued

Distributable reserves are determined as required by the 
Companies Act 2006 by reference to a company’s individual 
financial statements. At 31 December 2023 Lloyds Banking Group 
plc (‘the Company’) had accumulated distributable reserves of 
approximately £12 billion. Substantially all of the Company’s 
merger reserve is available for distribution under UK company law 
as a result of transactions undertaken to recapitalise the 
Company in 2009.

Lloyds Banking Group plc acts as a holding company which also 
issues capital and other securities to capitalise and fund the 
activities of the Group. The profitability of the holding company, 
and its ability to sustain dividend payments, is therefore 
dependent upon the continued receipt of dividends and interest 
from its main operating subsidiaries, including Lloyds Bank plc (the 
Ring-Fenced Bank), Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, LBG Equity 
Investments Limited and Scottish Widows Group Limited (the 
Insurance business). The principal operating subsidiary is Lloyds 
Bank plc which, at 31 December 2023, had a consolidated CET1 
capital ratio that exceeded minimum regulatory requirements 
and internal risk appetite levels. A number of Group subsidiaries, 
principally those with banking and insurance activities, are subject 
to regulatory capital requirements which require minimum 
amounts of capital to be maintained relative to their size and risk. 
The Group actively manages the capital of its subsidiaries, which 
includes monitoring the regulatory capital ratios for its banking 
and insurance subsidiaries and, on a consolidated basis, the RFB 
sub-group against approved risk appetite levels. The Group 
operates a formal capital management policy which requires all 
subsidiary entities, subject to agreement by their governing 
bodies, to remit surplus capital to their parent companies.

Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities 
(MREL)
Global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are subject to an 
international standard on total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). 
The standard is designed to enhance the resilience of the global 
financial system by ensuring that failing G-SIBs have sufficient 
capital to absorb losses and recapitalise under resolution, whilst 
continuing to provide critical banking services.

In the UK, the Bank of England has implemented the requirements 
of the international TLAC standard through the establishment of a 
framework which sets out MREL. The purpose of MREL is to require 
firms to maintain sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities that 
are capable of credibly bearing losses or recapitalising a bank 
whilst in resolution. MREL can be satisfied by a combination of 
regulatory capital and certain unsecured liabilities (which must 
be subordinate to a firm’s operating liabilities).

Although the Group is not classified as a G-SIB it is subject to the 
Bank of England’s MREL framework, including the statement of 
policy on MREL (the ‘MREL SoP’) which requires the Group to 
maintain a minimum level of MREL resources. 

Under the requirements of the framework, the Group operates a 
single point of entry (SPE) resolution strategy, with Lloyds Banking 
Group plc as the designated resolution entity.

Applying the MREL SoP to minimum capital requirements at 
31 December 2023, the Group’s MREL, excluding regulatory capital 
and leverage buffers, is the higher of 2 times Pillar 1 plus 2 times 
Pillar 2A, equivalent to 21.3 per cent of risk-weighted assets, or 
6.5 per cent of the UK leverage ratio exposure measure. 

In addition, CET1 capital cannot be used to meet both MREL and 
capital or leverage buffers.

Internal minimum requirements for own funds and eligible 
liabilities (Internal MREL) also apply to the Group’s material sub-
groups and entities, including the RFB sub-group, Lloyds Bank plc, 
Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc.

2022 comparatives have been restated to reflect the impact of IFRS 17. The CET1 deconsolidation adjustments applied to shareholders’ equity increased by £3.6 billion to 
reflect the full offset of the impact of IFRS 17 on the Group’s opening shareholders’ equity position per the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. For regulatory capital 
purposes, the Group’s Insurance business is deconsolidated and replaced by the amount of the Group’s investment in the business. A part of this amount is deducted 
from capital (via ‘significant investments’ in the table above) and the remaining amount is risk-weighted, forming part of threshold risk-weighted assets.
Preference shares, preferred securities and other subordinated liabilities are reported as subordinated liabilities in the balance sheet.
Instruments with less than or equal to one year to maturity or instruments not issued out of the holding company.

Under the regulatory capital framework, profits made by Insurance are removed from CET1 capital. However, when dividends are paid to the Group by Insurance these 
are recognised through CET1 capital. 

2  Reflects the reversal of the brought forward accrual for the final 2022 ordinary dividend, net of the accrual for the final 2023 ordinary dividend. 
3  Received in February 2023. 

The Group’s CET1 capital ratio reduced from 15.1 per cent at 31 December 2022 to 14.6 per cent at 31 December 2023, reflecting the 
increase in risk-weighted assets.

CET1 capital resources increased marginally by £32 million, with banking business profits for the year, the receipt of the dividend paid up 
by the Insurance business in February 2023 and other increases through reserves predominantly offset by:
•
• An increase in goodwill and other intangible assets, which included the acquisition of Tusker in February 2023
•

Pension deficit contributions (fixed and variable) paid during the year into the Group’s three main defined benefit pension schemes

The interim ordinary dividend paid in September 2023, the accrual for the final 2023 ordinary dividend of 1.84 pence per share and 
distributions on other equity instruments
The ordinary share buyback programme that was announced as part of the Group’s 2022 year end results and completed in August 
2023

•

The full capital impact of the ordinary share buyback programme and the Insurance dividend received in February 2023 were reflected 
through the Group’s pro forma CET1 ratio of 14.1 per cent at 31 December 2022. The Group’s pro forma CET1 ratio of 13.7 per cent at 
31 December 2023 reflects the full capital impact of the ordinary share buyback programme announced as part of the Group’s 2023 
year end results and the Insurance dividend received in February 2024.

The IFRS 9 transitional arrangements for static relief ended on 1 January 2023 and therefore no static relief exists at 31 December 2023 
(31 December 2022: £232 million). Dynamic relief amounted to £196 million (31 December 2022: £358 million) through CET1 capital. 

Movements in total capital and MREL
The Group’s total capital ratio increased to 19.8 per cent at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 19.7 per cent) primarily reflecting AT1 
and Tier 2 issuance. This was largely offset by the increase in risk-weighted assets and other movements in Tier 2 capital instruments, 
which included the impact of a call and regulatory amortisation.

The MREL ratio increased to 31.9 per cent at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 31.7 per cent) reflecting the increase in both total 
capital resources and other eligible liabilities, largely offset by the increase in risk-weighted assets. The increase in other eligible 
liabilities was primarily driven by new issuances, partially offset by a call and the exclusion of instruments maturing in 2024.

Threshold risk-weighted assets are included within Other IRB Approach and Standardised (STA) Approach.
Threshold risk-weighted assets reflect the element of significant investments and deferred tax assets that are permitted to be risk-weighted instead of being deducted 
from CET1 capital. Significant investments primarily arise from investment in the Group’s Insurance business.

Risk-weighted assets have increased by £8 billion during the year to £219 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: £211 billion). 
This includes the impact of Retail secured CRD IV model updates of £5 billion. Excluding this, lending, operational and market risk 
increases, a modest uplift from credit and model calibrations and other movements were partly offset by optimisation, including 
capital efficient securitisation activity within the balance sheet. 

In relation to the Retail secured CRD IV models, it is estimated that a further £5 billion increase will be required over 2024 to 2026, noting 
that this will be subject to final model outcomes.

The average UK leverage ratio is based on the average of the month end tier 1 capital position and average exposure measure over the quarter (1 October 2023 to 
31 December 2023). The average of 5.7 per cent compares to 5.7 per cent at the start and 5.8 per cent at the end of the quarter.

Analysis of leverage movements
The Group’s UK leverage ratio increased to 5.8 per cent (31 December 2022: 5.6 per cent) reflecting the increase in the total tier 1 capital 
position. This was partially offset by the increase in the leverage exposure measure following increases in financial and other assets 
(excluding central bank claims), net of reductions in off-balance sheet items and the measure for securities financing transactions.

Stress testing
The Group undertakes a wide-ranging programme of stress 
testing, providing a comprehensive view of the potential impacts 
arising from the risks to which the Group and its key legal entities 
are exposed. One of the most important uses of stress testing is to 
assess the resilience of the operational and strategic plans of the 
Group and its legal entities to adverse economic conditions and 
other key vulnerabilities. 

As part of this programme the Group participated in the delayed 
2022 Annual Cyclical Scenario stress test run by the Bank of 
England, which was submitted to the regulator in January 2023. 
This assesses the Group’s resilience to a severe economic shock 
where the House Price Index (HPI) falls by 31 per cent, Commercial 
Real Estate (CRE) falls by 45 per cent, unemployment peaks at 
8.5 per cent and the Base Rate peaks at 6 per cent. The results of 
this exercise were published by the Bank of England on 12 July 
2023. The Bank of England calculated the Group’s transitional CET1 
ratio, after the application of management actions, as 11.6 per 
cent and its Tier 1 leverage ratio as 4.5 per cent, significantly 
exceeding the hurdle rates of 6.6 per cent and 3.5 per cent, 
respectively. The Group also continues to internally assess 
vulnerabilities to adverse economic conditions.

G-SIB indicators
Although the Group is not currently classified as a Global 
Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB), by virtue of the Group’s 
leverage exposure measure exceeding €200 billion the Group is 
required to report G-SIB indicator metrics to the PRA. The Group’s 
indicator metrics used within the 2023 Basel G-SIBs annual 
exercise will be disclosed at the end of April 2024 and the results 
are expected to be made available by the Basel Committee later 
this year.

Insurance business
The business transacted by the insurance companies within the 
Group comprises both life insurance business and general 
insurance business. Life insurance comprises unit-linked, non-
profit and With-Profits business.

Scottish Widows Limited (SW Ltd) holds the only With-Profits funds 
managed by the Group. The UK insurance companies within the 
Group are regulated by the PRA. SW Ltd’s European insurance 
subsidiary is regulated by the CAA.

The Solvency II regime for insurers and insurance groups came 
into force from 1 January 2016 and was most recently updated in 
December 2023 as part of the Solvency UK framework. Insurance 
is required to calculate solvency capital requirements and 
available capital on a risk-based approach. Insurance calculates 
regulatory capital on the basis of an internal model, which has 
been approved by the PRA.

The minimum required capital must be maintained at all times 
throughout the year. These capital requirements and the capital 
available to meet them are regularly estimated in order to ensure 
that capital maintenance requirements are being met.

All minimum regulatory requirements of the insurance companies 
have been met during the year.

Change and execution risk
Definition
Change and execution risk is defined as the risk that, in delivering 
its change agenda, the Group fails to ensure compliance with 
laws and regulation, maintain available and effective customer 
and colleague services, and/or operate within the Group’s risk 
appetite.

Exposures
Change and execution risks arise when the Group undertakes 
activities which require products, processes, people, systems or 
controls to change. These changes can be as a result of external 
drivers (for example, a new piece of regulation that requires the 
Group to put in place a new process or reporting) and/or internal 
drivers including business process changes, technology upgrades 
and strategic business or technology transformation.

Measurement
The Group currently measures change and execution risk against 
defined risk appetite metrics which are a combination of leading, 
quality and delivery indicators across the investment portfolio. 
These indicators are reported through internal governance 
structures and monthly execution risk metrics; which form part of 
the Board risk appetite metrics, and are under ongoing evolution 
and enhancement to ensure they support the Group’s change 
and transformation agenda.

Mitigation
The Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to 
change and execution risk. These include the following:
•

The Board establishes a Group-wide risk appetite and metric 
for change and execution risk
Ensuring compliance with the change policy and associated 
policies and procedures, which set out the principles and key 
controls that apply across the business and are aligned to the 
Group risk appetite
Businesses assess the potential impacts of undertaking 
any change activity on their ability to execute effectively, 
on customers and colleagues and on the potential 
consequences for existing business risk profiles
The implementation of effective governance and control 
frameworks to ensure adequate controls are in place to 
manage change activity and act to mitigate the change and 
execution risks identified. These controls are monitored in line 
with the change policy and enterprise risk management 
framework
Events and incidents related to change activities are escalated 
and managed appropriately in line with risk framework 
guidance
Ensuring there are sufficient, appropriately skilled resources to 
support the safe delivery of the Group’s current and future 
change portfolio 

•

•

•

•

•

Monitoring
Change and execution risks are monitored and reported through 
to the Board and Group Governance Committees in accordance 
with the Group’s enterprise risk management framework. Risk 
exposures are assessed monthly through established governance 
in the Group’s functions and business unit risk committees with 
escalation to executive committees where required. Material 
change and execution related risk events or incidents are 
escalated in accordance with the Group operational risk policy 
and change policy. In addition there is oversight, challenge and 
reporting within Risk function to support overall management of 
risks and ongoing effectiveness of controls.

Risk management continued

Climate risk
Definition
The Group defines climate risk as the risk that the Group 
experiences losses and/or reputational damage, either from the 
impacts of climate change and the transition to net zero 
(inbound) or as a result of the Group’s response to tackling 
climate change (outbound).

Embedding
Climate risk is considered as a principal risk within the Group’s 
ERMF, reflecting the importance of the topic and the focus 
required to manage these risks. This ensures a consistent 
approach to embedding the consideration of climate risk in 
activities across the Group, while also enhancing Board level 
insight.

The Group’s climate risk policy provides an overarching 
framework for managing climate risks. This policy continues to be 
refined, to ensure awareness of key climate-related risks across 
different areas of the Group and appropriate processes and 
controls are in place to mitigate these risks. This includes 
requirements in relation to governance, scenario analysis and 
management for climate risks, as well as governance 
requirements for different aspects of the Group’s net zero 
strategy. Activity across the Group to meet these requirements is 
actively monitored, including through the development of the 
Group’s climate risk profile.

The Group continues to consider climate risk through an evolving 
view of ‘Double Materiality’. This reflects the concept that climate 
risks can materialise through inbound risk, outbound risk or 
potentially both.
•

Inbound risk: impacts of a risk on the Group’s balance sheet, 
which can lead to a financial loss. Managing inbound risks is 
critical to mitigate this potential impact, including supporting 
customers to be aware of potential risks. Examples include 
property devaluation from physical and transition risks and 
extreme weather events increasing insurance losses
• Outbound risk: impacts of the Group’s balance sheet or 

activity on the environment driven by our strategy or purpose. 
Examples include insufficient consideration of climate risk in 
external disclosure or external perception of the Group’s 
actions, claims and disclosures

The Group is continuing to develop its understanding of Double 
Materiality, as well as reflecting how it applies across broader ESG 
risks. This approach allows an assessment of the impact of risks to 
the Group in addition to identification of the impact of the Group’s 
balance sheet on society and the planet.

Within the Group’s risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) system 
for risk management, key climate-related risks have been 
prioritised into five broad themes in line with this view of inbound 
and outbound risks:

Climate risk

The impacts from climate risk largely manifest through other 
principal risks. Therefore, in order to ensure these impacts are 
appropriately managed, the Group is embedding consideration of 
climate risk into its approach for managing other principal risks.

New and existing controls have also been mapped to key climate-
related regulatory obligations to support identification, 
measurement, management and reporting of the impacts of 
climate change.

Exposures
Climate risks can arise through two channels, physical or 
transition risks: 
• Physical risks from changes in climate or weather patterns. 
These can either be acute (event driven such as floods or 
storms) or chronic (longer-term shifts such as rising sea levels 
or droughts)

• Transition risks due to changes associated with moving 

towards a low carbon economy, including changes to policy, 
legislation and regulation, technology and market, or legal risks 
from failing to manage the transition

As part of the Group’s ERMF, risks are proactively identified 
considering various internal and external sources, including 
environmental factors such as climate change. The Group has 
identified the sectors at increased risk from the impacts of 
climate change and continues to monitor its loans and advances 
to customers in these sectors, see page 110 in the Group’s 
sustainability report 2023. 

This has informed identification of the key climate-related risks at 
a Group level, with input from other entities to capture any 
material risks not reflected. The table on page 155 provides a high-
level overview of the Group’s key climate risks, across the five 
main inbound and outbound themes highlighted in the climate 
risk diagram. This has also included consideration of the cross-
cutting impacts across other principal risks in the Group’s ERMF. A 
similar exercise has been carried out for Scottish Widows, as 
outlined on page 171 in the Group’s sustainability report 2023.

The materiality of the Group’s key climate risks reflects their 
potential impact on the Group, considering key impacts across a 
range of factors including: customer; reputation; financial losses; 
colleagues; and business objectives. These impacts are 
considered on an ongoing basis through the Group’s continuous 
risk management approach, with formal assessment at least 
annually. This assessment is supported by horizon scanning of 
climate-related developments across the Group and additional 
quantitative and qualitative analysis, including scenario analysis 
results.

Measurement
There are a number of different ways to measure the relative size 
of the key climate risks facing the Group. However, in order to 
quantify the impact, scenario analysis is required to understand 
their effects, particularly given the different potential outcomes 
and time horizons over which the risks may manifest. 

From an outbound perspective, the Group measures its emissions 
relating to activities across bank finance, Scottish Widows’ 
investments, supply chain and own operations. This helps to 
provide a view on the impact of the Group’s activities, as well as 
identifying the areas where the Group can most effectively 
reduce emissions to support the transition to net zero. These 
calculations follow the relevant industry standards and guidelines, 
noting that such methodologies will continue to evolve. Further 
detail on the approach for each of these areas is provided on 
page 113 in the Group’s sustainability report 2023.

For inbound risks, the levels of climate risk impacting different 
areas of the Group are assessed through a variety of metrics and 
approaches: 
•

For Commercial lending, the Group’s ESG tool helps to identify 
and assess the impact of climate risk for individual 
Commercial customers as part of the credit decisioning 
process

For Retail lending, levels of flood risk and energy efficiency, via 
energy performance certificates (EPC), are measured for the 
Homes portfolio to inform the physical and transition risk we 
face. For the motor portfolio, the transition from internal 
combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EVs) is a key 
consideration in measuring residual value risk
For Home insurance business, there is a dedicated weather 
modelling team, comprised of specialists in hydrology, 
meteorology and probabilistic modelling. The team develops a 
baseline view of physical risk for the UK and conducts forward-
looking climate stress testing on this. This team has been in 
place since 2016 and has monitored and applied climate 
change science onto the view of risk used for capital, pricing, 
reinsurance, and planning

Scenario analysis
Given the range of outcomes over which climate risks and 
opportunities may materialise, scenario analysis is a key tool for 
understanding the potential impacts on the Group. The Group 
continues to develop its climate scenario analysis capabilities to 
inform analysis of climate risks, as well as to help shape the 
Group’s strategy to reflect climate opportunities and assess its 
resilience, building on lessons learned from the Bank of England’s 
2021 Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES). The subsequent 
analysis has focused on understanding the areas of the Group 
most impacted by climate change, as well as assessing the 
impact from key climate-related risks. 

Separate assessments have been undertaken for the Group’s 
Commercial lending and Scottish Widows investments portfolios 
to identify the sectors most exposed to climate risks.
•

For Commercial lending clients, this has been based on 
estimated financial impacts from physical and transition risk. 
The relative difference between this climate estimate and a 
baseline provides an indicative foresight view of discounted 
cash flow and hence net present value (NPV) of the entity from 
present day to 2050

•

For Scottish Widows’ investments, the analysis focused on the 
impact of climate risk on broadly defined sectors, considering 
the quantitative impact of transition risk alone in the high 
transition scenarios. The chart below is based on projected 
equity values at 2050, with currency movements hedged and 
compared to counterfactual projections

Risk management continued

Both assessments have been modelled across two climate 
scenarios consistent with the Network for Greening the Financial 
System (NGFS), Net Zero 2050 (Orderly) and Divergent Net Zero 
(Divergent). The Net Zero 2050 scenario was chosen as it 
describes the ideal outcome that the Group’s net zero targets are 
aiming for. The Divergent Net Zero scenario provides a useful 
comparison, given it reaches the same end goal although at 
higher overall cost.

Mitigation
The Group manages climate-related risk in different ways across 
the five key inbound and outbound themes identified. The 
following sections provide an overview of the Group’s mitigation 
approach, including the relevant cross-cutting impacts, across 
each of these themes. Scottish Widows provide further detail on 
its approach in its own risk management section on page 171 of 
the Group’s sustainability report 2023.

The results across both assessments are broadly in line with each 
other, highlighting that high emitting sectors, such as coal mining 
and oil and gas, are expected to face a substantial adverse 
impact, with considerable effects in other sectors, such as 
automotive and transport. However, these impacts will vary 
significantly by company and will be most notably observed in the 
power sector. Further details of the analysis supporting these 
assessments is outlined in the Group’s sustainability report 2023. 

The Group has a relatively low commercial lending exposure to 
the sectors which experience the most significant negative 
impacts, based on this assessment. Note 52 on page 312 provides 
further detail of the Group’s lending by sector. 

The above assessment also supports the view of the sectors with 
the greatest potential climate-related impact for the Group. 
Alongside lending exposure, this analysis validates the focus for 
the Group’s environmental sustainability strategy, including the 
banking sectors for which NZBA targets have been set. Further 
detail on the Group’s strategy and targets is outlined in the 
transition plan in the Group’s sustainability report 2023. 

Climate risks also transmit via trading book assets and the Group 
has undertaken climate scenario analysis across three bespoke 
climate scenarios to understand the impact of very short-term 
market risk factor shocks stemming from both physical and 
transition risks. Resulting stressed valuations fell within existing 
stress test framework outcomes demonstrating the resilience of 
existing risk management approaches.

Impact assessment
This scenario analysis is intended to inform the Group’s view of the 
financial impacts from the risks relating to change, which would 
principally arise through asset impairments or credit losses. 
Building on this assessment of the sectors at increased risk from 
climate change, the Group has incorporated consideration of 
some climate risks into its calculation of ECL. For Commercial 
Banking clients in these sectors most materially impacted, a top-
down sector level approach has been used to estimate impacts 
in a disorderly scenario, resulting an estimated impact on ECL of 
less than £15 million. This uses a combination of sector level NPV 
impact estimates, NGFS Gross Domestic Product (GDP) pathways, 
historic impairment data and other inputs to assess the impact of 
physical and transition risks. 

Furthermore, the UK Mortgages portfolio has been assessed for 
physical and transition risk. This assessment considered the 
impact of the UK introducing minimum EPC requirements and the 
estimated retrofitting costs to meet these. These additional costs 
then translated into Probability of Default (PD) uplifts, resulting in 
an estimated increase in ECL of less than £5 million for the Group’s 
buy-to-let portfolio. A similar exercise was undertaken for flood 
risk, also with an estimated impact of less than £5 million. 
Measurement of the physical and transition risk impacts 
continues to progress, with ongoing development of a Residential 
Real Estate Climate Impact model to estimate potential impacts. 
Further detail on this is provided on page 153 of the Group’s 
sustainability report 2023.

These estimated impacts are below the Group’s materiality 
thresholds, therefore, no adjustments have been made to the 
expected credit losses measured as at 31 December 2023. Note 24 
on page 278 provides further information on the assessment of 
climate risks in the Group’s measurement of expected credit 
losses.

Net Zero
The Group considers how its different areas are supporting the 
transition to net zero. The Group has set ambitions to reduce 
emissions across four key areas of activity. This is supported 
through development of appropriate plans and strategies, as well 
as sector specific targets for bank financed emissions. We aim to 
monitor progress against these targets through the Group Net 
Zero Committee on a quarterly basis.

The 2023 Group climate transition plan sets out the steps it will 
take to reduce emissions to net zero for its own operations and 
supply chain, as well as specific activities happening in relation to 
the Group’s lending and investments. For further details, please 
see the Group’s sustainability report 2023.

Disclosures
The Group’s external disclosures are subject to a robust 
governance process, including appropriate legal review. This 
includes an assessment of the relevant regulatory requirements, 
particularly to ensure alignment with CFD requirements and Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
recommendations. External disclosures will continue to progress in 
line with the changing regulatory landscape, and the Group will 
look to ensure suitable controls remain in place as these develop.

Greenwashing 
The Group’s understanding of greenwashing continues to evolve, 
with adoption of various methods across the Group to continue to 
build this understanding, including development of training 
materials to avoid greenwashing for all colleagues. Current 
priorities relate to any sustainability related claims in external 
disclosures and development of consideration of ESG criteria 
(including climate-related factors) for relevant products across 
the Group.

The Group will look to ensure that its disclosures outline a clear 
and accurate message of what it is doing to support the 
transition to net zero. An external legal review provides assurance 
on the suitability of content in disclosures within the sustainability 
report and annual report and accounts. The Group expects its 
controls and processes will continue to evolve, reflecting 
increasing understanding of greenwashing, as well as the 
changing regulatory landscape, such as the FCA’s Sustainability 
Disclosure Requirements anti-greenwashing rule. In 2023, for 
example, Scottish Widows launched a Green Claims Framework, 
under which first line risk teams assess green claims prior to 
publication of communications to ensure any claims are 
accurate, clear, not misleading and can be substantiated.

In 2023, the Group product policy was redesigned to ensure 
compliance with Consumer Duty and focus on customer 
outcomes. As part of this, initial guidance in relation to climate 
considerations was strengthened to introduce more 
comprehensive ESG considerations for all products in line with the 
Group’s updated values. Dedicated ESG guidance has been 
introduced to support product governance processes, ensuring 
climate-related factors and wider ESG risks are appropriately 
considered and managed throughout the product life cycle. In 
2024, further support will be provided to upskill colleagues and 
ensure the guidance is enhanced in line with the ESG risks 
landscape.

Inbound physical and transition risks 
The impacts from physical and transition risks cut across other 
principal risks in different ways for different areas of the Group, as 
outlined below. 

Commercial and Retail lending
The Group continues to integrate climate risk and broader ESG 
considerations in its credit process, with continued progress in 
2023. This is through a credit risk integration strategy, which 
includes development of an ESG credit risk framework and 
policies, as well as portfolio and case management. Further detail 
on management of climate-related and ESG credit risks is 
provided on page 150 of the Group’s sustainability report 2023.

Operations and supply chain
Climate risk is embedded in the Group approach for managing 
operational resilience, as one of the key drivers within the Group 
strategy, considering the impact on and from climate as part of 
ensuring its operations remain resilient. Climate-related impacts 
could affect operational resilience through properties, IT systems, 
people and third party suppliers. The Group approach primarily 
focuses on the potential impact from physical risks, although 
transition risk impacts may require further consideration as the 
approach evolves.

The Group has processes in place to consider the resilience of its 
property in relation to physical risks, particularly focused on its 
offices, data centres and branch network, to minimise the risk of 
service disruption. Insurers periodically highlight the Group’s 
buildings that are subject to high flood risk. These sites are then 
surveyed in detail to quantify that risk and determine appropriate 
flood defence mitigation. The Group proactively monitors the 
temperature and humidity in its data centres, with root cause 
analysis undertaken for any incidents to identify any local climate 
issues and remediate. Additionally, resilient tech rooms have been 
created where power, temperature and humidity are robustly 
controlled.

The Group expects its third party suppliers to review their business 
continuity plans and recovery strategies, ensuring these are 
appropriately updated to mitigate potential risks posed by 
climate change, to ensure continued provision of service. The 
Group’s Code of Supplier Responsibility also outlines expectations 
for the third parties in relation to environmental sustainability. This 
includes expectations for the Group’s suppliers to proactively 
identify, manage and reduce their environmental impact, as well 
as adopting the principles of the Emerald Standard which the 
Group launched in 2022, as detailed on page 101 of the Group’s 
sustainability report 2023.

Regulatory compliance
The Group’s monitoring of regulatory expectations includes 
understanding the current relevant requirements, and its activity 
and progress towards these, as well as horizon scanning for new 
developments. Monitoring progress against current expectations, 
for example Dear CEO and CFO letters, supports regular 
engagement with regulators on respective plans and priorities. In 
addition, the Group maintains a view of how its disclosures 
support the relevant regulatory requirements, as outlined above.

The Group also maintains an awareness of regulatory 
developments and seeks to include and map regulatory 
obligations within its risk and control profile in support of 
compliance traceability.

Monitoring
The Group ensures visibility and awareness of climate risks 
wherever they present themselves across its risk profile, with 
regular reporting and tracking of any identified risks. 

Management Information (MI) across a range of themes is 
regularly assessed to provide insight into and oversight of 
management of climate risk, together with tracking of associated 
action plans and identification of triggers for reassessment. This is 
reported through appropriate Risk governance, across the 
relevant business units. 

Climate risk is also considered through Risk governance on a 
monthly basis through the Consolidated Risk Report, supported by 
assessment of identified climate risks across the Group and 
appropriate analysis of Group Board risk appetite metrics. This 
provides insight into any changes to the risk profile together with 
their rationale for awareness and scrutiny by senior leaders. In 
addition, climate risk MI is reported through this process, with 
standalone deep dive discussions on climate risk at Board Risk 
Committee on a half-yearly basis.

Conduct risk
Definition
Conduct risk is defined as the risk of customer detriment across 
the customer lifecycle including: failures in product management, 
distribution and servicing activities; from other risks materialising, 
or other activities which could undermine the integrity of the 
market or distort competition, leading to unfair customer 
outcomes, regulatory censure, reputational damage or financial 
loss. 

Harm or detriment is defined as loss, distress or inconvenience to 
customers due to breaches of regulatory or internal requirements 
or our wider duty to act fairly and reasonably.

Exposures
The Group faces significant conduct risks, which affect all aspects 
of the Group’s operations and all types of customers. The 
introduction of Consumer Duty has increased regulatory 
expectations in relation to customer outcomes, including how the 
Group demonstrates and measures them. 

Conduct risks can impact directly or indirectly on the Group’s 
customers and could materialise from a number of areas across 
the Group, including:
•

Business and strategic planning that does not sufficiently 
consider customer needs
Ineffective development, management and monitoring of 
products, their distribution (including the sales process, fair 
value assessment and responsible lending criteria) and post- 
sales service (including the management of customers in 
financial difficulties)

•

• Unclear, unfair, misleading or untimely customer 

communications

• A culture that is not sufficiently customer-centric
•

Poor governance of colleagues’ incentives and rewards and 
approval of schemes which lead to behaviours that drive 
unfair customer outcomes 
Ineffective identification, management and oversight of legacy 
conduct issues
Ineffective management and resolution of customers’ 
complaints or claims

•

•

• Outsourcing of customer service and product delivery to third 
parties that do not have the same level of control, oversight 
and culture as the Group

The Group is also exposed to the risk of engaging in activities or 
failing to manage conduct which could constitute market abuse, 
undermine the integrity of a market in which it is active, distort 
competition or create conflicts of interest.

There is a high level of scrutiny from regulatory bodies, the media, 
politicians, and consumer groups regarding financial institutions’ 
treatment of customers, especially those with characteristics of 
vulnerability. The Group continues to apply significant focus to its 
treatment of all customers, in particular those in financial 
difficulties and those with characteristics of vulnerability, to 
ensure good outcomes.

The Group is continuing to liaise closely with the FCA and Financial 
Ombudsman Service on the historical motor commission 
arrangements.

• Continued focus on market conduct; member of the Fixed 

Income, Currencies and Commodities Markets Standard Board; 
and committed to conducting its market activities consistent 
with the principles of the UK Money Markets Code, the Global 
Precious Metals Code and the FX Global Code

• Adoption of robust change delivery methodology to enable 
prioritisation and delivery of initiatives to address conduct 
challenges

• Continued focus on proactive identification and mitigation of 

conduct risk in the Group’s strategy

• Active engagement with regulatory bodies and other 

stakeholders to develop understanding of concerns related to

• Creation of tools and additional support for customers 

impacted by the rising cost of living, including Cost-of-Living 
Hub and interest-free overdraft buffer

• A programme of work in place to deliver the enhanced 

expectations of Consumer Duty

Monitoring
Conduct risk is governed through divisional risk committees and 
significant issues are escalated to the Group Risk Committee, in 
accordance with the Group’s ERMF, as well as through the monthly 
Risk Reporting. The risk exposures are reported, discussed and 
challenged at divisional risk committees. Remedial action is 
recommended, if required. All material conduct risk events are 
escalated in accordance with the Group operational risk policy. 

A number of activities support the close monitoring of conduct 
risk including:
•

The use of CRAMs across the Group, with an escalation route to 
Board

• Oversight and assurance activities across the three lines of 

defence 

• Horizon scanning

Risk management continued

The Group continuously adapts to market developments that 
could pose heightened conduct risk, and actively monitors for 
early signs of financial difficulties driven by pressures from a rising 
cost of living and rising interest rates.

Other key areas of focus include transparency and fairness of 
pricing communications; ensuring victims of Authorised Push 
Payment Fraud receive good outcomes; and a mindset shift 
regarding customer outcomes in line with the FCA’s Consumer 
Duty Regulation.

Measurement
To articulate its conduct risk appetite, the Group has Conduct Risk 
Appetite Metrics (CRAMs) and tolerances that aim to indicate 
where it may be operating outside its conduct risk appetite.

CRAMs have been designed for services and products offered by 
the Group and are measured by a set of common metrics. These 
contain a range of product design, sales and process metrics 
(including outcome testing results) to provide a more holistic view 
of conduct risks; some products also have a suite of additional 
bespoke metrics.

Each of the tolerances for the metrics are agreed for the 
individual product or service and are regularly tracked. At a 
consolidated level these metrics are part of the Board risk 
appetite. The Group has, and continues to, evolve its approach to 
conduct risk measurements, to include emerging conduct 
themes.

Mitigation
The Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to 
conduct risk and remains focused on delivering a leading 
customer experience. 

The Group’s ongoing commitment to good customer outcomes 
sets the tone from the top and supports the development our 
values-led culture with customers at the heart, strengthening links 
between actions to support conduct, culture and customer and 
enabling more effective control management. Actions to 
encourage good conduct include:
• Conduct risk appetite established at Group and divisional level, 

•

with metrics included in the Group risk appetite to ensure 
ongoing focus

Credit risk
Definition
Credit risk is defined as the risk that parties with whom the Group 
has contracted fail to meet their financial obligations (both on 
and off-balance sheet).

Exposures
The principal sources of credit risk within the Group arise from 
loans and advances, contingent liabilities, commitments and debt 
securities to customers, financial institutions and sovereigns. The 
credit risk exposures of the Group are set out in note 52 on page 
313.

In terms of loans and advances (for example, mortgages, term 
loans and overdrafts) and contingent liabilities (for example, 
credit instruments such as guarantees and documentary letters 
of credit), credit risk arises both from amounts advanced and 
commitments to extend credit to a customer or bank. With 
respect to commitments to extend credit, the Group is also 
potentially exposed to an additional loss up to an amount equal 
to the total unutilised commitments. However, the likely amount of 
loss may be less than the total unutilised commitments, as most 
retail and certain commercial lending commitments may be 
cancelled based on regular assessment of the prevailing 
creditworthiness of customers. Commercial term commitments 
are also contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit 
standards.

Credit risk also arises from debt securities and derivatives. The 
total notional principal amount of interest rate, exchange rate, 
credit derivative and other contracts outstanding at 31 December 
2023 is shown on page 173. The notional principal amount does 
not, however, represent the Group’s credit risk exposure, which is 
limited to the current cost of replacing contracts with a positive 
value to the Group. Such amounts are reflected in note 52 on 
page 313.

Additionally, credit risk arises from leasing arrangements where 
the Group is the lessor. Note 2(J) on page 224 provides details on 
the Group’s approach to the treatment of leases.

Credit risk exposures in the Insurance, Pensions and Investments 
division relate mostly to bond and loan assets which, together 
with some related swaps, are used to fund annuity commitments 
within shareholder funds; plus balances held in liquidity funds to 
manage Insurance division’s liquidity requirements, and exposure 
to reinsurers.

The investments held in the Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes also expose the Group to credit risk. Note 16 on page 244 
provides further information on the defined benefit pension 
schemes’ assets and liabilities.

Loans and advances, contingent liabilities, commitments, debt 
securities and derivatives also expose the Group to refinance risk. 
Refinance risk is the possibility that an outstanding exposure 
cannot be repaid at its contractual maturity date. If the Group 
does not wish to refinance the exposure then there is refinance 
risk if the obligor is unable to repay by securing alternative 
finance. This may occur for a number of reasons which may 
include: the borrower is in financial difficulty, because the terms 
required to refinance are outside acceptable appetite at the time 
or the customer is unable to refinance externally due to a lack of 
market liquidity. Refinance risk exposures are managed in 
accordance with the Group’s existing credit risk policies, 
processes and controls, and are not considered to be material 
given the Group’s prudent credit risk appetite. Where heightened 
refinance risk exists exposures are minimised through intensive 
account management and, where appropriate, are classed as 
impaired and/or forborne.

Measurement
The process for credit risk identification, measurement and 
control is integrated into the Board-approved framework for 
credit risk appetite and governance.

Credit risk is measured from different perspectives using a range 
of appropriate modelling and scoring techniques at a number of 
levels of granularity, including total balance sheet, individual 
portfolio, pertinent concentrations and individual customer – for 
both new business and existing exposure. Key metrics, which may 
include but are not limited to, total exposure, ECL, risk-weighted 
assets, new business quality, concentration risk and portfolio 
performance, are reported monthly to risk committees and 
forums.

Measures such as ECL, risk-weighted assets, observed credit 
performance, predicted credit quality (usually from predictive 
credit scoring models), collateral cover and quality, and other 
credit drivers (such as cash flow, affordability, leverage and 
indebtedness) have been incorporated into the Group’s credit risk 
management practices to enable effective risk measurement 
across the Group.

The Group has also continued to strengthen its capabilities and 
abilities for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related 
risks and opportunities, recognising that climate change is likely to 
result in changes in the risk profile and outlook for the Group’s 
customers, the sectors the Group operates in and collateral/asset 
valuations. For further information, please refer to the 
sustainability report 2023.

In addition, stress testing and scenario analysis, including 
preparation of credit playbooks to analyse and forward plan for 
specific events and/or emerging issues, are used to estimate 
i
mpairment losses and capital demand forecasts for both 
regulatory and internal purposes and to assist in the formulation 
and calibration of credit risk appetite, where appropriate.

As part of the ‘three lines of defence’ model, the Risk division is the 
second line of defence providing oversight and independent 
challenge to key risk decisions taken by business management. 
The Risk division also tests the effectiveness of credit risk 
management and internal credit risk controls. This includes 
ensuring that the control and monitoring of higher risk and 
vulnerable portfolios and sectors is appropriate and confirming 
that appropriate loss allowances for impairment are in place. 
Output from these reviews helps to inform credit risk appetite, 
credit policy and portfolio mandates.

As the third line of defence, Group Internal Audit undertakes 
regular risk-based reviews to assess the effectiveness of credit 
risk management and controls.

Mitigation
The Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk.

Prudent credit principles, risk policies and appetite statements: 
the independent Risk division sets out the credit principles, credit 
risk policies and credit risk appetite statements. These are subject 
to regular review and governance, with any changes subject to 
an approval process. Risk teams monitor credit performance 
trends and the outlook. Risk teams also test the adequacy of and 
adherence to credit risk policies and processes throughout the 
Group. This includes tracking portfolio performance against an 
agreed set of credit risk appetite tolerances.

Robust models and controls: see model risk on page 191.

Limitations on concentration risk: there are portfolio controls on 
certain industries, sectors and products to reflect risk appetite as 
well as individual, customer and bank limit risk tolerances. Credit 
policies, appetite statements and mandates are aligned to the 
Group’s risk appetite and restrict exposure to higher risk countries 
and potentially vulnerable sectors and asset classes. Note 52 on 
page 314 provides an analysis of loans and advances to 
customers by industry (for commercial customers) and product 
(for retail customers). Exposures are monitored to prevent both an 
excessive concentration of risk and single name concentrations. 
These concentration risk controls are not necessarily in the form 
of a maximum limit on exposure, but may instead require new 
business in concentrated sectors to fulfil additional minimum 
policy and/or guideline requirements. The Group’s largest credit 
limits are regularly monitored by the Board Risk Committee and 
reported in accordance with regulatory requirements.

Risk management continued

Defined country risk management framework: the Group sets a 
broad maximum country risk appetite. Risk-based appetite for all 
countries is set within the independent Risk division, taking into 
account economic, financial, political and social factors as well as 
the approved business and strategic plans of the Group.

Specialist expertise: credit quality is managed and controlled by 
a number of specialist units within the business and Risk division, 
which provide for example: intensive management and control; 
security perfection; maintenance of customer and facility records; 
expertise in documentation for lending and associated products; 
sector-specific expertise; and legal services applicable to the 
particular market segments and product ranges offered by the 
Group.

Stress testing: the Group’s credit portfolios are subject to regular 
stress testing. In addition to the Group-led, PRA and other 
regulatory stress tests, exercises focused on individual divisions 
and portfolios are also performed. For further information on the 
Group wide stress testing process, methodology and governance 
see page 143.

Frequent and robust credit risk assurance: assurance of credit 
risk is undertaken by an independent function operating within the 
Risk division which is part of the Group’s second line of defence. Its 
primary objective is to provide reasonable and independent 
assurance and confidence that credit risk is being effectively 
managed and to ensure that appropriate controls are in place 
and being adhered to. Group Internal Audit also provides 
assurance to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of credit 
risk management controls across the Group’s activities.

Collateral
The principal types of acceptable collateral include:
•
• Charges over business assets such as inventory and accounts 

Residential and commercial properties

receivable
Financial instruments such as debt securities

•
• Vehicles
• Cash
• Guarantees received from third parties

The Group maintains appetite parameters on the acceptability of 
specific classes of collateral.

For non-mortgage retail lending to small businesses, collateral 
may include second charges over residential property and the 
assignment of life cover.

Collateral held as security for financial assets other than loans 
and advances is determined by the nature of the underlying 
exposure. Debt securities, including treasury and other bills, are 
generally unsecured, with the exception of asset-backed 
securities and similar instruments such as covered bonds, which 
are secured by portfolios of financial assets. Collateral is generally 
not held against loans and advances to financial institutions. 
However, securities are held as part of reverse repurchase or 
securities borrowing transactions or where a collateral 
agreement has been entered into under a master netting 
agreement. Derivative transactions with financial counterparties 
are typically collateralised under a Credit Support Annex (CSA) in 
conjunction with the International Swaps and Derivatives 
Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. Derivative transactions with 
non-financial customers are not usually supported by a CSA.

The requirement for collateral and the type to be taken at 
origination will be based upon the nature of the transaction and 
the credit quality, size and structure of the borrower. For non-retail 
exposures, if required, the Group will often seek that any collateral 
includes a first charge over land and buildings owned and 
occupied by the business, a debenture over the assets of a 
company or limited liability partnership, personal guarantees, 
limited in amount, from the directors of a company or limited 
liability partnership and key man insurance. The Group maintains 
policies setting out which types of collateral valuation are 
acceptable, maximum loan to value (LTV) ratios and other criteria 
that are to be considered when reviewing an application. The 
fundamental business proposition must evidence the ability of the 
business to generate funds from normal business sources to 
repay a customer or counterparty’s financial commitment, rather 
than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.

Although lending decisions are primarily based on expected cash 
flows, any collateral provided may impact the pricing and other 
terms of a loan or facility granted. This will have a financial impact 
on the amount of net interest income recognised and on internal 
loss given default estimates that contribute to the determination 
of asset quality and returns.

The Group requires collateral to be realistically valued by an 
appropriately qualified source, independent of both the credit 
decision process and the customer, at the time of borrowing. In 
certain circumstances, for Retail residential mortgages this may 
include the use of automated valuation models based on market 
data, subject to accuracy criteria and LTV limits. Where third 
parties are used for collateral valuations, they are subject to 
regular monitoring and review. Collateral values are subject to 
review, which will vary according to the type of lending, collateral 
involved and account performance. Such reviews are undertaken 
to confirm that the value recorded remains appropriate and 
whether revaluation is required, considering, for example, account 
performance, market conditions and any information available 
that may indicate that the value of the collateral has materially 
declined. In such instances, the Group may seek additional 
collateral and/or other amendments to the terms of the facility. 
The Group adjusts estimated market values to take account of the 
costs of realisation and any discount associated with the 
realisation of the collateral when estimating credit losses.

The Group considers risk concentrations by collateral providers 
and collateral type with a view to ensuring that any potential 
undue concentrations of risk are identified and suitably managed 
by changes to strategy, policy and/or business plans.

The Group seeks to avoid correlation or wrong-way risk where 
possible. Under the Group’s repurchase (repo) policy, the issuer of 
the collateral and the repo counterparty should be neither the 
same nor connected. The same rule applies for derivatives. The 
Risk division has the necessary discretion to extend this rule to 
other cases where there is significant correlation. Countries with a 
rating equivalent to AA- or better may be considered to have no 
adverse correlation between the counterparty domiciled in that 
country and the country of risk (issuer of securities).

Refer to note 52 on page 313 for further information on collateral.

Additional mitigation for Retail customers
The Group uses a variety of lending criteria when assessing 
applications for mortgages and unsecured lending. The general 
approval process uses credit acceptance scorecards and 
involves a review of an applicant’s previous credit history using 
internal data and information held by Credit Reference Agencies 
(CRA).

The Group also assesses the affordability and sustainability of 
lending for each borrower. For secured lending this includes use of 
an appropriate stressed interest rate scenario. Affordability 
assessments for all lending are compliant with relevant regulatory 
and conduct guidelines. The Group takes reasonable steps to 
validate information used in the assessment of a customer’s 
income and expenditure.

In addition, the Group has in place quantitative limits such as 
maximum limits for individual customer products, the level of 
borrowing to income and the ratio of borrowing to collateral. 
Some of these limits relate to internal approval levels and others 
are policy limits above which the Group will typically reject 
borrowing applications. The Group also applies certain criteria 
that are applicable to specific products, for example applications
for buy-to-let mortgages.

For UK mortgages, the Group’s policy permits owner occupier 
applications with a maximum LTV of 95 per cent. This can increase 
to 100 per cent for specific products where additional security is 
provided by a supporter of the applicant and held on deposit by 
the Group. Applications with an LTV above 90 per cent are subject 
to enhanced underwriting criteria, including higher scorecard cut-
offs and loan size restrictions.

Buy-to-let mortgages within Retail are limited to a maximum loan 
size of £2,000,000 and 75 per cent LTV for a single property. Buy-to-
let applications must pass a minimum rental cover ratio of 125 per 
cent under stressed interest rates, after applicable tax liabilities. 
Portfolio landlords (customers with four or more mortgaged buy-
to-let properties) are subject to additional controls including 
evaluation of overall portfolio resilience.

The Group’s policy is to reject any application for a lending 
product where a customer is registered as bankrupt or insolvent, 
or has a recent County Court Judgment or financial default 
registered at a CRA used by the Group above de minimis 
thresholds. In addition, the Group typically rejects applicants 
where total unsecured debt, debt-to-income ratios, or other 
indicators of financial difficulty exceed policy limits.

Where credit acceptance scorecards are used, new models, 
model changes and monitoring of model effectiveness are 
independently reviewed and approved in accordance with the 
governance framework set by the Group Model Governance 
Committee.

Additional mitigation for Commercial customers
Individual credit assessment and independent sanction of 
customer and bank limits: with the exception of small exposures 
to small to medium-sized enterprises (SME) customers where 
certain relationship managers have limited delegated credit 
approval authority, credit risk in commercial customer portfolios is 
subject to approval by the independent Risk division, which 
considers the strengths and weaknesses of individual 
transactions, the balance of risk and reward, and how credit risk 
aligns to the Group and divisional risk appetite. Exposure to 
individual counterparties, groups of counterparties or customer 
risk segments is controlled through a tiered hierarchy of credit 
authority delegations and risk-based credit limit guidances per 
client group for larger exposures. Approval requirements for each 
decision are based on a number of factors including, but not 
limited to, the transaction amount, the customer’s aggregate 
facilities, any risk mitigation in place, credit policy, risk appetite, 
credit risk ratings and the nature and term of the risk. The Group’s 
credit risk appetite criteria for counterparty and customer loan 
underwriting is generally the same as that for loans intended to 
be held to maturity. All hard loan/bond underwriting must be 
approved by the Risk division. A pre-approved credit matrix may 
be used for ‘best efforts’ underwriting.

Counterparty credit limits: limits are set against all types of 
exposure in a counterparty name, in accordance with an agreed 
methodology for each exposure type. This includes credit risk 
exposure on individual derivatives and securities financing 
transactions, which incorporates potential future exposures from 
market movements against agreed confidence intervals. 
Aggregate facility levels by counterparty are set and limit 
breaches are subject to escalation procedures.

Daily settlement limits: settlement risk arises in any situation 
where a payment in cash, securities or equities is made in the 
expectation of a corresponding receipt in cash, securities or 
equities. Daily settlement limits are established for each relevant 
counterparty to cover the aggregate of all settlement risk arising 
from the Group’s market transactions on any single day. Where 
possible, the Group uses Continuous Linked Settlement in order to 
reduce foreign exchange (FX) settlement risk.

Master netting agreements
It is credit policy that a Group-approved master netting 
agreement must be used for all derivative and traded product 
transactions and must be in place prior to trading, with separate 
documentation required for each Group entity providing facilities. 
This requirement extends to trades with clients and the 
counterparties used for the Group’s own hedging activities, which 
may also include clearing trades with Central Counterparties 
(CCPs).

Any exceptions must be approved by the appropriate credit 
approver. Master netting agreements do not generally result in an 
offset of balance sheet assets and liabilities for accounting 
purposes, as transactions are usually settled on a gross basis. 
However, within relevant jurisdictions and for appropriate 
counterparty types, master netting agreements do reduce the 
credit risk to the extent that, if an event of default occurs, all 
trades with the counterparty may be terminated and settled on a 
net basis. The Group’s overall exposure to credit risk on derivative 
instruments subject to master netting agreements can change 
substantially within a short period, since this is the net position of 
all trades under the master netting agreement.

Other credit risk transfers
The Group also undertakes asset sales, credit derivative based 
transactions, securitisations (including significant risk transfer 
transactions), purchases of credit default swaps and purchase of 
credit insurance as a means of mitigating or reducing credit risk 
and/or risk concentration, taking into account the nature of assets 
and the prevailing market conditions.

Monitoring
In conjunction with the Risk division, businesses identify and define 
portfolios of credit and related risk exposures and the key 
behaviours and characteristics by which those portfolios are 
managed and monitored. This entails the production and analysis 
of regular portfolio monitoring reports for review by senior 
management. The Risk division in turn produces an aggregated 
view of credit risk across the Group, including reports on material 
credit exposures, concentrations, concerns and other 
management information, which is presented to senior officers, 
divisional credit risk forums, business unit committees and forums, 
Group Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.

Models
The performance of all models used in credit risk is monitored in 
line with the Group’s model governance framework – see model 
risk on page 191.

Intensive care of customers in financial difficulty
The Group operates a number of solutions to assist borrowers 
who are experiencing financial stress. The material elements of 
these solutions through which the Group has granted a 
concession, whether temporarily or permanently, are set out 
below.

Forbearance
The Group’s aim in offering forbearance and other assistance to 
customers in financial distress is to benefit both the customer and 
the Group by supporting its customers and acting in their best 
interests by, where possible, bringing customer facilities back into 
a sustainable position.

The Group’s underlying ECL allowance on loans and advances to 
customers decreased in the year to £4,292 million (31 December 
2022: £5,222 million).

Group Stage 2 loans and advances to customers reduced to 
£56,545 million (31 December 2022: £65,728 million) and as a 
percentage of total lending to 12.5 per cent (31 December 2022: 
14.3 per cent). This is due to improvements in the macroeconomic 
outlook transferring assets to Stage 1, along with impacts from 
securitisations of legacy Retail mortgages in the first quarter and 
Retail unsecured loans in the fourth quarter. Of the total Group 
Stage 2 loans and advances to customers, 91.3 per cent are up to 
date (31 December 2022: 92.7 per cent). Stage 2 coverage reduced 
slightly to 3.0 per cent (31 December 2022: 3.2 per cent).

Stage 3 loans and advances to customers reduced to 
£10,110 million (31 December 2022: £10,753 million), and as a 
percentage of total lending decreased slightly to 2.2 per cent 
(31 December 2022: 2.3 per cent). This reduction is largely following 
the full repayment of debt from a single name client in 
Commercial Banking and securitisation activity, partially offset by 
flow to default increases in the UK mortgages portfolio. Stage 3 
coverage decreased by 6.8 percentage points to 15.8 per cent 
(31 December 2022: 22.6 per cent).

Prudent risk appetite and risk management
•

The Group continues to take a prudent and proactive 
approach to credit risk management and credit risk appetite 
whilst, in line with the Group’s strategy, supporting clients to 
grow, as well as working closely with customers to help them 
through cost of living pressures and the impacts of higher 
interest rates and any deterioration in broader economic 
conditions
Sector, asset and product concentrations within the portfolios 
are closely monitored and controlled, with mitigating actions 
taken where appropriate. Sector and product risk appetite 
parameters help manage exposure to certain higher risk and 
cyclical sectors, segments and asset classes
The Group’s effective risk management seeks to ensure early 
identification and management of customers and 
counterparties who may be showing signs of distress
The Group will continue to work closely with its customers to 
ensure that they receive the appropriate level of support, 
embracing the standards outlined in the Mortgage Charter 
and including where customers are leveraging Pay As You

Risk management continued

The Group offers a range of tools and assistance to support 
customers who are encountering financial difficulties. Cases are 
managed on an individual basis, with the circumstances of each 
customer considered separately and the action taken judged as 
being appropriate and sustainable for both the customer and the 
Group.

Forbearance measures consist of concessions towards a debtor 
that is experiencing or about to experience difficulties in meeting 
its financial commitments. This can include modification of the 
previous terms and conditions of a contract or a total or partial 
refinancing of a troubled debt contract, either of which would not 
have been required had the debtor not been experiencing 
financial difficulties.

The provision and review of such assistance is controlled through 
the application of an appropriate policy framework and 
associated controls. Regular review of the assistance offered to 
customers is undertaken to confirm that it remains appropriate, 
alongside monitoring of customers’ performance and the level of 
payments received.

The Group classifies accounts as forborne at the time a customer 
in financial difficulty is granted a concession.

Balances in default or classified as Stage 3 are always considered 
to be non-performing. Balances may be non-performing but not 
in default or Stage 3, where for example they are within their non-
performing forbearance cure period. 

Non-performing exposures can be reclassified as performing 
forborne after a minimum 12-month cure period, providing there 
are no past due amounts or concerns regarding the full 
repayment of the exposure. A minimum of a further 24 months 
must pass from the date the forborne exposure was reclassified 
as performing forborne before the account can exit forbearance. 
If conditions to exit forbearance are not met at the end of this 
probation period, the exposure shall continue to be identified as 
forborne until all the conditions are met.

The Group’s treatment of loan renegotiations is included in the 
impairment policy in note 2(H) on page 223.

Customers receiving support from UK Government sponsored 
programmes
To assist customers in financial distress, the Group participates in 
UK Government sponsored programmes for households, including 
the Income Support for Mortgage Interest programme, under 
which the government pays the Group all or part of the interest on 
the mortgage on behalf of the customer. This is provided as a 
government loan which the customer must repay.

The Group credit risk portfolio in 2023
Overview
The Group’s portfolios are well-positioned for the current 
macroeconomic environment. The Group retains a prudent 
approach to credit risk appetite and risk management, with 
strong credit origination criteria and robust LTVs in the secured 
portfolios.

Observed credit performance remains resilient, despite the 
continued economic uncertainty with only modest evidence of 
deterioration to date. In UK mortgages, new to arrears were 
relatively stable throughout 2023, having increased slightly at the 
start of the year, largely driven by legacy vintages (mortgages 
originated in the period 2006 to 2008). Flows to default increased 
during the year for the same reason with trends stabilising in the 
second half. Unsecured portfolios continue to exhibit stable new 
to arrears and flow to default trends, broadly at or below pre-
pandemic levels. The Group continues to monitor the impacts of 
the economic environment carefully through a suite of early 
warning indicators and governance arrangements that ensure 
risk mitigating action plans are in place to support customers and 
protect the Group’s positions. 

The underlying impairment charge in 2023 was £308 million, down 
from a charge of £1,510 million in 2022. This is as a result of a 
significant write-back following the full repayment of debt from a 
single name client in the fourth quarter and improvements in the 
Group’s macroeconomic outlook, the latter resulting in a release 
of £257 million (2022: a charge of £595 million).

Group loans and advances to customers
The following pages contain analysis of the Group’s loans and 
advances to customers by sub-portfolio. Loans and advances to 
customers are categorised into the following stages:
•

Stage 1 assets comprise of newly originated assets (unless 
purchased or originated credit-impaired), as well as those 
which have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk. 
These assets carry an expected credit loss allowance 
equivalent to the expected credit losses that result from those 
default events that are possible within 12 months of the 
reporting date (12 month expected credit losses)
Stage 2 assets are those which have experienced a significant 
increase in credit risk since origination. These assets carry an 
expected credit loss allowance equivalent to the expected 
credit losses arising over the lifetime of the asset (lifetime 
expected credit losses)
Stage 3 assets have either defaulted or are otherwise 
considered to be credit-impaired. These assets carry a lifetime 
expected credit loss
Purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) are 
those that have been originated or acquired in a credit-
impaired state. This includes within the definition of credit-
impaired the purchase of a financial asset at a deep discount 
that reflects impaired credit losses

Credit risk balance sheet basis of presentation
The balance sheet analyses which follow have been presented on 
two bases; the statutory basis which is consistent with the 
presentation in the Group’s accounts and the underlying basis 
which is used for internal management purposes. A reconciliation 
between the two bases has been provided.

In the following statutory basis tables, purchased or originated 
credit- impaired (POCI) assets include a fixed pool of mortgages 
that were purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition at a deep 
discount to face value reflecting credit losses incurred from the 
point of origination to the date of acquisition. The residual 
expected credit loss (ECL) allowance and resulting low coverage 
ratio on POCI assets reflects further deterioration in the 
creditworthiness from the date of acquisition. Over time, these 
POCI assets will run off as the loans redeem, pay down or as loans 
are written off.

The Group uses the underlying basis to monitor the 
creditworthiness of the lending portfolio and related ECL 
allowances because it provides a better indication of the credit 
performance of the POCI assets purchased as part of the HBOS 
acquisition. The underlying basis assumes that the lending assets 
acquired as part of a business combination were originated by 
the Group and are classified as either Stage 1, 2 or 3 according to 
the change in credit risk over the period since origination. 
Underlying ECL allowances have been calculated accordingly.

Includes forbearance, client and product-specific indicators not reflected within quantitative PD assessments.
Includes assets that have triggered PD movements, or other rules, given that being 1 to 29 days in arrears in and of itself is not a Stage 2 trigger.
Expected credit loss allowance on loans and advances to customers (drawn and undrawn).

The Group’s assessment of a significant increase in credit risk, and resulting categorisation of Stage 2, includes customers moving into 
early arrears as well as a broader assessment that an up to date customer has experienced a level of deterioration in credit risk since 
origination. A more sophisticated assessment is required for up to date customers, which varies across divisions and product type. This 
assessment incorporates specific triggers such as a significant proportionate increase in probability of default relative to that at 
origination, recent arrears, forbearance activity, internal watch lists and external bureau flags. Up to date exposures in Stage 2 are likely 
to show lower levels of expected credit loss (ECL) allowance relative to those that have already moved into arrears given that an 
arrears status typically reflects a stronger indication of future default and greater likelihood of credit losses.

Additional information
ECL sensitivity to economic assumptions
The measurement of ECL reflects an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future economic outcomes. The Group achieves 
this by generating four economic scenarios to reflect the range of outcomes; the central scenario reflects the Group’s base case 
assumptions used for medium-term planning purposes, an upside and a downside scenario are also selected together with a severe 
downside scenario. If the base case moves adversely, it generates a new, more adverse downside and severe downside which are 
then incorporated into the ECL. Consistent with prior years, the base case, upside and downside scenarios carry a 30 per cent 
weighting; the severe downside is weighted at 10 per cent. 

The table below shows the Group’s ECL for the probability-weighted, upside, base case, downside and severe downside scenarios, with 
the severe downside scenario incorporating adjustments made to CPI inflation and UK Bank Rate paths. The stage allocation for an 
asset is based on the overall scenario probability-weighted probability of default and hence the staging of assets is constant across all 
the scenarios. In each economic scenario the ECL for individual assessments is held constant reflecting the basis on which they are 
evaluated. Judgemental adjustments applied through changes to model inputs or parameters, or more qualitative post model 
adjustments, are apportioned across the scenarios in proportion to modelled ECL where this better reflects the sensitivity of these 
adjustments to each scenario. The probability-weighted view shows the extent to which a higher ECL allowance has been recognised 
to take account of multiple economic scenarios relative to the base case; the uplift being £678 million compared to £692 million at 
31 December 2022.

Retail
•

The Retail portfolio has remained resilient and well-positioned,
despite pressure on consumer finances and affordability from
a higher cost of living, inflationary pressures and rising interest
rates. Robust risk management remains in place, with strong
affordability and indebtedness controls for both new and
existing lending and a prudent risk appetite approach
The Retail lending book is concentrated in lower risk segments
which are better able to withstand the cost of living challenge
and higher interest rates
In UK mortgages, new to arrears were relatively stable
throughout 2023, having increased slightly at the start of the
year, largely driven by legacy vintages (mortgages originated
in the period 2006 to 2008). Flows to default increased during
the year for the same reason with trends stabilising in the
second half

•

•

•

• Unsecured portfolios continue to exhibit stable new to arrears
and flow to default trends, broadly at, or below pre-pandemic
levels
The Group is closely monitoring the impacts of a higher cost of
living on consumers to ensure it remains vigilant for any signs
of deterioration. Lending strategies are under continuous
review and have been proactively managed and calibrated to
the latest macroeconomic outlook, with actions taken to
enhance both living and housing cost assumptions in
affordability assessments
The Retail impairment charge in 2023 was £831 million and is
materially lower than the charge of £1,373 million for 2022,
largely due to favourable updates to the Group’s
macroeconomic outlook, driving a £233 million release
compared to a charge of £600 million last year. This is partially
offset by an increase in charges in relation to underlying
performance to £1,064 million, compared to £773 million from
2022, predominately as a result of flow to default increases in
UK mortgages and the impact of higher discount rates
reducing the value of future recoveries

•

• All existing IFRS 9 staging rules and triggers have been

maintained across Retail from the 2022 year end. Retail
customer related ECL allowance as a percentage of drawn
loans and advances (coverage) is stable at 0.9 per cent
(31 December 2022: 0.9 per cent)

Favourable updates to the Group’s macroeconomic outlook
have reduced Stage 2 loans and advances to 13.3 per cent of
the Retail portfolio (31 December 2022: 14.8 per cent), of which
91.0 per cent are up to date loans (31 December 2022: 92.3 per
cent). Stage 2 ECL coverage also reduces slightly to 2.6 per
cent (31 December 2022: 3.0 per cent)
Increased flows to default within UK mortgages result in an
increase in Stage 3 loans and advances to 2.2 per cent of total
loans and advances (31 December 2022: 2 per cent). Retail
Stage 3 ECL coverage decreases to 13.9 per cent (31 December
2022: 16.4 per cent) due to portfolio mix changes; notably
because UK mortgages hold comparatively lower coverage in
comparison to other Retail products due to security. Underlying
Stage 3 loans and advances, and Stage 3 coverage for all
other Retail products excluding UK mortgages remain broadly
stable

UK mortgages 
•

The UK mortgages portfolio is well positioned with low arrears
and a strong loan to value (LTV) profile. The Group has actively
improved the quality of the portfolio over the years using
robust affordability and credit controls, while the balances of
higher risk legacy vintages have continued to reduce

• New to arrears in the UK mortgages portfolio were relatively

•

stable throughout 2023, having increased slightly at the start of
the year, largely driven by legacy vintages, where there is a
high concentration of variable rate customers. The Group is
proactively monitoring existing mortgage customers as they
reach the end of fixed rate deals with customers’ immediate
behaviour remaining stable
Total loans and advances decreased to £307.6 billion
(31 December 2022: £312.7 billion), with an increase in average
LTV to 43.6 per cent (31 December 2022: 41.6 per cent). The
proportion of balances with a LTV greater than 90 per cent
increased to 2.9 per cent (31 December 2022: 1.4 per cent). The
average LTV of new business remained stable at 61.7 per cent
(31 December 2022: 61.7 per cent)

• Updated macroeconomic assumptions within the ECL model,

•

•

most notably to account for more resilient house price
performance than previously anticipated, resulted in a net
impairment release of £51 million for 2023 compared to a
charge of £295 million for 2022. Total ECL coverage decreased
to 0.4 per cent (31 December 2022: 0.5 per cent)
Favourable macroeconomic updates also result in reductions
to Stage 2 loans and advances to 13.6 per cent of the portfolio
(31 December 2022: 14.8 per cent), largely from up to date loans,
and Stage 2 ECL coverage falling slightly to 1.1 per cent
(31 December 2022: 1.5 per cent)
Stage 3 loans and advances increased to 2.4 per cent of the
portfolio (31 December 2022: 2.1 per cent) due to increases in
legacy variable rate customers triggering 90 days past due.
Stage 3 ECL coverage decreased to 10.4 per cent (31 December
2022: 12.5 per cent) due to the favourable macroeconomic
outlook

Credit cards 
• Credit cards balances increased to £15.8 billion (31 December
2022: £15.0 billion) due to continued recovery in customer
spend
The credit card portfolio is a prime book, arrears rates are
broadly similar to pre-pandemic levels with continued strong
repayment rates
Impairment charge of £457 million for 2023, is lower than the
charge of £571 million in 2022 as increased arrears and default
flows as a result of high inflation and cost of living pressures
have not emerged as previously anticipated. Total ECL
coverage remains stable at 5.1 per cent (31 December 2022:
5.1 per cent)
Favourable updates to the macroeconomic outlook result in a
reduction in Stage 2 loans and advances to 18.4 per cent of the
portfolio (31 December 2022: 21.9 per cent), with Stage 2 ECL
coverage broadly stable at 15.3 per cent (31 December 2022:
14.5 per cent)
Resilient underlying arrears and default performance has also
resulted in stable Stage 3 loans and advances at 1.8 per cent of
the portfolio (31 December 2022: 1.9 per cent) and Stage 3 ECL
coverage is broadly stable at 49.4 per cent (31 December 2022:
50.9 per cent)

•

•

Loans and overdrafts 
•

Loans and advances for personal current account and the
personal loans portfolios reduced to £8.5 billion (31 December
2022: £10.3 billion) driven by a £2.7 billion securitisation in the
loans portfolio
Impairment charge of £251 million for 2023 is lower than the
charge of £499 million for 2022 again due to favourable
macroeconomic updates and a more resilient underlying
performance than previously anticipated
ECL coverage levels at a total level and by individual stage all
remain broadly stable

•

•

UK Motor Finance 
•

The UK Motor Finance portfolio increased to £15.7 billion
(31 December 2022: £14.6 billion), with lower new car supply
versus pre-COVID being offset by used vehicle sales

• Updates to Residual Value (RV) and Voluntary Termination (VT)
risk held against Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) and Hire
Purchase (HP) lending are included within the impairment
charge. Recent falls in used car prices have resulted in a
notable increase in this item to £187 million as at 31 December
2023 (31 December 2022: £92 million)

• Updates to account for adverse used car price performance,

including RV/VT risk, result in an impairment charge of
£169 million for 2023, that is materially higher than a credit of
£2 million for 2022, which benefited from more stable used car
prices, partially driven by global supply issues following the
pandemic
ECL coverage levels at a total level and by individual stage all
increased. Total ECL coverage to 2.2 per cent (31 December
2022: 1.7 per cent), Stage 2 ECL coverage to 4.5 per cent
(31 December 2022: 3.4 per cent) and Stage 3 ECL to 56.3 per

Interest-only mortgages
The Group provides interest-only mortgages to owner occupier mortgage customers whereby only payments of interest are made for 
the term of the mortgage with the customer responsible for repaying the principal outstanding at the end of the loan term. At 
31 December 2023, owner occupier interest-only balances as a proportion of total owner occupier balances had reduced to 14.4 per 
cent (31 December 2022: 16.4 per cent). The average indexed loan to value remained low at 36.9 per cent (31 December 2022: 35.5 per 
cent).

For existing interest-only mortgages, a contact strategy is in place during the term of the mortgage to ensure that customers are 
aware of their obligations to repay the principal upon maturity of the loan.

Treatment strategies are in place to help customers anticipate and plan for repayment of capital at maturity and support those who 
may have difficulty in repaying the principal amount. A dedicated specialist team supports customers who have passed their 
contractual maturity date and are unable to fully repay the principal. A range of treatments are offered to customers based on their 
individual circumstances to create fair and sustainable outcomes.

Retail forbearance
The basis of disclosure for forbearance is aligned to definitions used in the European Banking Authority’s FINREP reporting. On an 
underlying basis, total forbearance for the major retail portfolios has reduced by £0.5 billion to £4.0 billion. This reduction is primarily 
driven by decreases in customers with a historical capitalisation treatment (where arrears were reset) and the impact of removing 
mortgage balances following the securitisation of legacy Retail mortgage accounts. On a statutory basis the equivalent total 
forbearance position improved by £0.4 billion to £3.9 billion.

The main customer treatments included are: repair, where arrears are added to the loan balance and the arrears position cancelled; 
instances where there are suspensions of interest and/or capital repayments; and refinance personal loans.

As a percentage of loans and advances, forbearance loans remain broadly static at 1.2 per cent at 31 December 2023 (31 December 
2022: 1.2 per cent).

As at 31 December 2023, 97.0 per cent of forbearance loans are captured in Stage 2 or Stage 3 for IFRS 9 and hold provision on a lifetime 
basis (31 December 2022: 96.5 per cent).

Total expected credit losses (ECL) as a proportion of loans and advances which are forborne has decreased to 11.2 per cent 
(31 December 2022: 12.1 per cent).

The Commercial portfolio credit quality remains resilient
overall, with a focused approach to credit underwriting and
monitoring standards and proactively managing exposures to
higher risk and vulnerable sectors. While some of the Group’s
metrics indicate limited deterioration, especially in consumer-
led sectors, these are not considered to be material
The Group is cognisant of a number of risks and headwinds
associated with a heightened inflationary and interest rate
environment especially in, but not limited to, sectors reliant
upon consumer discretionary spend. Risks include, but are not
limited to, reduced asset valuation and refinancing risk, a
reduction in market liquidity impacting credit supply and
pressure on both household discretionary spending and
business margins
The Group has reduced overall exposure to cyclical sectors
since 2019 and continues to closely monitor credit quality,
sector and single name concentrations. Sector and credit risk
appetite continue to be proactively managed to ensure clients
continue to be supported in the right way and the Group is
protected
The Group continues to provide early support to its more
vulnerable customers through focused risk management via
its Watchlist and Business Support framework, within which
volumes have increased marginally in 2023. The Group
continues to balance prudent risk appetite with ensuring
support for financially viable clients

There was a net impairment release of £511 million in 2023,
compared to a net impairment charge of £517 million in 2022.
This largely reflects the full repayment of debt from a single
name client in the fourth quarter offset by additional charges
on existing Stage 3 clients
ECL allowances decreased in the year to £1,165 million at
31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: £1,849 million). The ECL
provision at 31 December 2023 includes the capture of the
impact of inflationary pressures and heightened interest rates
and assumes additional losses will emerge as a result of these
and other emerging risks, through the multiple economic
scenarios
Stage 2 loans and advances decreased to £7,987 million
(31 December 2022: £11,493 million), largely as a result of
improvements in the Group’s forward-looking modelled
macroeconomic assumptions, with 92.8 per cent of Stage 2
balances up to date (31 December 2022: 94.8 per cent). Stage 2
as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers
decreased to 8.9 per cent (31 December 2022: 12.1 per cent).
Stage 2 ECL coverage was higher at 5.6 per cent (31 December
2022: 4.4 per cent) with the increase in coverage largely a
result of the change in the forward-looking multiple economic
scenarios
Stage 3 loans and advances reduced to £2,068 million
(31 December 2022: £3,371 million) and as a proportion of total
loans and advances to customers, reduced to 2.3 per cent
(31 December 2022: 3.5 per cent). Stage 3 ECL coverage
reduced to 24.1 per cent (31 December 2022: 38.9 per cent).
These reductions are largely driven by the full repayment of
debt from a single name client

Commercial Banking UK Real Estate
• Commercial Banking UK Real Estate committed drawn lending
stood at c.£10 billion at 31 December 2023 (net of £3.6 billion
exposures subject to protection through Significant Risk
Transfer (SRT) securitisations). In addition there are undrawn
lending facilities of £3.6 billion to predominantly investment
grade rated corporate customers
The Group classifies Direct Real Estate as exposure which is
directly supported by cash flows from property activities (as
opposed to trading activities, such as hotels, care homes and
housebuilders). Exposures of £7.0 billion to social housing
providers are also excluded

•

• Despite some headwinds, including the inflationary

environment and the impact of heightened interest rates, the
portfolio continues to remain well-positioned and proactively
managed with conservative LTVs, good levels of interest cover
and appropriate risk mitigants in place

• Overall performance of the portfolio has remained resilient. The

•

•

•

Group has seen an increase in cases in its more closely
monitored Watchlist category, however this has only translated
into a modest flow into Business Support. Rent collection has
largely stabilised, although challenges remain in some sectors
Lending continues to be heavily weighted towards investment
real estate (c.91 per cent) rather than development. Of these
investment exposures, c.90 per cent have an LTV of less than
70 per cent, with an average LTV of 46 per cent. The average
interest cover ratio was 3.3 times, with 78 per cent having
interest cover of above 2 times. In SME, LTV at origination has
been typically limited to c.55 per cent, given prudent
repayment cover criteria (including notional base rate stress)
The portfolio is well diversified with no speculative commercial
development lending (defined as property not pre-sold or pre-
let at a level to fully repay the debt or generate sufficient
income to meet the minimum interest cover requirements).
Approximately 49 per cent of exposures relate to commercial
real estate, including c.14 per cent secured by office assets, c.10
per cent by retail assets and c.12 per cent by industrial assets.
Approximately 49 per cent of the portfolio relates to residential
Recognising this is a cyclical sector, total (gross and net) and
asset type quantum caps are in place to control origination
and exposure, including several asset type categories. Focus
remains on the UK market and new business has been written
in line with a prudent risk appetite criteria including
conservative LTVs, strong quality of income and proven
management teams. Development lending criteria also
includes maximum loan to gross development value and
maximum loan to cost, with funding typically only released
against completed work, as confirmed by the Group’s
monitoring quantity surveyor

• Use of SRT securitisations also acts as a risk mitigant in this

portfolio, with run-off of these carefully managed
and sequenced

Data risk
Definition
Data risk is defined as the risk of the Group failing to effectively 
govern, manage and protect its data throughout its lifecycle, 
including data processed by third parties, or failure to drive value 
from data; leading to unethical decision making, poor customer 
outcomes, loss of value to the Group and mistrust.

Exposures
Data risk is present in all aspects of the business where data is 
processed, both within the Group and by third parties including 
colleague and contractor, and prospective and existing 
customers. Data risk manifests:
• When data policies, standards and governance are not

adhered to

• When data is processed and fails to meet compliance
requirements, for example the General Data Protection
Regulations (GDPR) and other data regulatory obligations
• When data-related issues such as quality are not identified,

assessed and managed appropriately

• When data is not created, retained, protected, destroyed or

retrieved appropriately

Measurement
Data risk covers data governance, data management and data 
privacy and ethics and is measured through a series of 
quantitative and qualitative metrics. 

Mitigation
The Group continues to invest to reduce data risk exposure to 
within appetite. Examples include: 
• Delivering a data strategy
•
•

Enhancing data quality and capability
Embedding data by design and ethics

Monitoring
The Group continues to monitor and respond to data-related 
regulatory initiatives, such as the new Digital Protection and Digital 
Information Bill expected in 2024, and other legal regimes, for 
example, the European Commission’s Artificial Intelligence Act. 

Data risk is governed through Group and sub-group committees. 
Significant issues are escalated to Group Risk Committee, in 
accordance with the Group’s enterprise risk management 
framework, and RCSA frameworks.

A number of activities support the close monitoring of data risk 
including:
• Design and monitoring of data risk appetite metrics, including

key risk and performance indicators

• Monitoring of significant data-related issues, complaints,

events and breaches in accordance with Group Operational
Risk and Data policies
Identification and mitigation of data risk when planning and
implementing transformation or business change

•

Funding and liquidity risk 
Definition
Funding risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have 
sufficiently stable and diverse sources of funding or the funding 
structure is inefficient. Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the 
Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its 
commitments as they fall due, or can only secure them at 
excessive cost.

Exposure
Liquidity exposure represents the potential stressed outflows in 
any future period less expected inflows. The Group considers 
liquidity exposure from both an internal and a regulatory 
perspective.

Measurement
Liquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and 
reports that are primarily based on contractual maturities with 
behavioural overlays as appropriate. Note 52 on page 323 sets out 
an analysis of assets and liabilities by relevant maturity grouping. 
The Group undertakes quantitative and qualitative analysis of the 
behavioural aspects of its assets and liabilities in order to reflect 
their expected behaviour.

Mitigation
The Group manages and monitors liquidity risks and ensures that 
liquidity risk management systems and arrangements are 
adequate with regard to the internal risk appetite, Group strategy 
and regulatory requirements. Liquidity policies and procedures 
are subject to independent internal oversight by Risk. Overseas 
branches and subsidiaries of the Group may also be required to 
meet the liquidity requirements of the entity’s domestic country. 
Management of liquidity requirements is performed by the 
overseas branch or subsidiary in line with Group policy. Liquidity 
risk of the Insurance business is actively managed and monitored 
within the Insurance business. The Group plans funding 
requirements over its planning period, combining business as 
usual and stressed conditions. The Group manages its liquidity 
position paying regard to its internal risk appetite, Liquidity 
Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as 
required by the PRA, the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) 
and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) liquidity 
requirements.

The Group’s funding and liquidity position is underpinned by its 
significant customer deposit base and is supported by strong 
relationships across customer segments. The Group has 
consistently observed that, in aggregate, the retail deposit base 
provides a stable source of funding. Funding concentration by 
counterparty, currency and tenor is monitored on an ongoing 
basis and, where concentrations do exist, these are managed as 
part of the planning process and limited by the internal funding 
and liquidity risk monitoring framework, with analysis regularly 
provided to senior management.

To assist in managing the balance sheet, the Group operates a 
Liquidity Transfer Pricing (LTP) process which: allocates relevant 
interest expenses from the centre to the Group’s banking 
businesses within the internal management accounts; helps drive 
the correct inputs to customer pricing; and is consistent with 
regulatory requirements. LTP makes extensive use of behavioural 
maturity profiles, taking account of expected customer loan 
prepayments and stability of customer deposits, modelled on 
historic data.

The Group can monetise liquid assets quickly, either through the 
repurchase agreements (repo) market or through outright sale. In 
addition, the Group has pre-positioned a substantial amount of 
assets at the Bank of England’s Discount Window Facility which 
can be used to access additional liquidity in a time of stress. The 
Group considers diversification across geography, currency, 
markets and tenor when assessing appropriate holdings of liquid 
assets. The Group’s liquid asset buffer is available for deployment 
at immediate notice, subject to complying with regulatory 
requirements.

Risk management continued

Liquidity risk within the Insurance business may result from: the 
inability to sell financial assets quickly at fair value; an insurance 
liability falling due for payment earlier than expected; the inability 
to generate cash inflows as anticipated; an unexpected large 
operational event; or from a general insurance catastrophe, for 
example, a significant weather event. Liquidity risk is actively 
managed and monitored within the Insurance business to ensure 
that it remains within approved risk appetite, so that even under 
stress conditions, there is sufficient liquidity to meet obligations.

Monitoring
Daily monitoring and control processes are in place to address 
internal and regulatory liquidity requirements. The Group monitors 
a range of market and internal early warning indicators on a daily 
basis for early signs of liquidity risk in the market or specific to the 
Group. This captures regulatory metrics as well as metrics the 
Group considers relevant for its liquidity profile. These are a 
mixture of quantitative and qualitative measures, including: daily 
variation of customer balances; changes in maturity profiles; 
funding concentrations; changes in LCR outflows; credit default 
swap (CDS) spreads; and basis risks.

The Group carries out internal stress testing of its liquidity and 
potential cash flow mismatch position over both short (up to one 
month) and longer-term horizons against a range of scenarios 
forming an important part of the internal risk appetite. The 
scenarios and assumptions are reviewed at least annually to 
ensure that they continue to be relevant to the nature of the 
business, including reflecting emerging horizon risks to the Group. 
For further information on the Group’s 2023 liquidity stress testing 
results refer to page 183.

The Group maintains a Liquidity Contingency Framework as part 
of the wider Recovery Plan which is designed to identify emerging 
liquidity concerns at an early stage, so that mitigating actions can 
be taken to avoid a more serious crisis developing. The Liquidity 
Contingency Framework has a foundation of robust and regular 
monitoring and reporting of key performance indicators, early 
warning indicators and risk appetite by both Group Corporate 
Treasury (GCT) and Risk up to and including Board level. Where 
movements in any of these metrics and indicator suites point to a 
potential issue, SME teams and their directors will escalate this 
information as appropriate.

Funding and liquidity management in 2023
The Group has maintained its strong funding and liquidity position 
with a loan to deposit ratio of 95 per cent as at 31 December 2023 
(31 December 2022: 96 per cent). Total wholesale funding 
decreased to £98.7 billion as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 
2022: £100.3 billion) driven by a small reduction in Money Market 
funding. The Group maintains its access to diverse sources and 
tenors of funding.

The Group’s liquid assets continue to exceed the regulatory 
minimum and internal risk appetite, with a liquidity coverage ratio 
(LCR) of 142 per cent (based on a monthly rolling average over the 
previous 12 months) as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 
144 per cent) calculated on a Group consolidated basis based on 
the PRA rulebook. The decrease in LCR is explained primarily by a 
reduction in customer deposits. All assets within the liquid asset 
portfolio are hedged for interest rate risk. Following the 
implementation of structural reform, liquidity risk is managed at a 
legal entity level with the Group consolidated LCR representing the 
composite of the Ring-Fenced Bank and Non-Ring-Fenced Bank 
entities.

LCR eligible assets have reduced to £136.0 billion, from £144.7 billion 
as at 31 December 2022, driven by a reduction in customer 
deposits. In addition to the Group’s reported LCR eligible assets, 
the Group maintains borrowing capacity at central banks which 
averaged £74 billion in the 12 months to 31 December 2023. The net 
stable funding ratio remains strong at 130 per cent as at 
31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 130 per cent). 

During 2023, the Group accessed wholesale funding across a 
range of currencies and markets with term issuance volumes 
totalling £16.1 billion, compared to full year guidance of around 
£15 billion of wholesale issuance needs. In 2024, the Group expects 
to have term wholesale issuance requirements of around 
£15 billion. The total outstanding amount of drawings from the 
TFSME has remained stable at £30.0 billion at 31 December 2023 
(31 December 2022: £30.0 billion), with maturities in 2025, 2027 and 
beyond. 

The Group’s credit ratings continue to reflect the strength of its 
business model and balance sheet. The rating agencies continue 
to monitor the impact of economic conditions and elevated rates 
for the UK banking sector. The strength of the Group’s 
management and franchise, along with its robust financial 
performance, capital and funding position, are reflected in the 
Group’s strong ratings.

Liquidity portfolio
At 31 December 2023, the Group had £136.0 billion of highly liquid unencumbered LCR eligible assets, based on a monthly rolling average 
over the previous 12 months post any liquidity haircuts (31 December 2022: £144.7 billion), of which £131.3 billion is LCR level 1 eligible 
(31 December 2022: £140.4 billion) and £4.7 billion is LCR level 2 eligible (31 December 2022: £4.3 billion). These assets are available to meet 
cash and collateral outflows and regulatory requirements. The Insurance business manages a separate liquidity portfolio to mitigate 
insurance liquidity risk.

Based on 12 months rolling average to 31 December. Eligible assets are calculated as an average of month-end observations over the previous 12 months post any 
liquidity haircuts.

The Group also has a significant amount of non-LCR eligible liquid assets which are eligible for use in a range of central bank or similar 
facilities. Future use of such facilities will be based on prudent liquidity management and economic considerations, having regard to 
external market conditions.

Stress testing results
Internal liquidity stress testing results at 31 December 2023 (calculated as an average of month end observations over the previous 
12 months) showed that the Group had liquidity resources representing 136 per cent of modelled outflows under the Group’s most 
severe liquidity stress scenario (31 December 2022: 147 per cent). The decrease in ratio is explained primarily by an increase in modelled 
stress outflows.

This scenario includes a two notch downgrade of the Group’s current long-term debt rating and accompanying one notch short-term 
downgrade implemented instantaneously by all major rating agencies.

Encumbered assets
This disclosure provides further detail on the availability of assets that could be used to support potential future funding requirements 
of the Group.

The disclosure is not designed to identify assets that would be available in the event of a resolution or bankruptcy.

The Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) monitors and manages total balance sheet encumbrance, including via a defined 
risk appetite. At 31 December 2023, the Group had £38.0 billion (31 December 2022: £35.5 billion) of externally encumbered on-balance 
sheet assets with counterparties other than central banks. The increase in encumbered assets was primarily driven by securitisation 
and covered bond issuances. The Group also had £704.5 billion (31 December 2022: £705.9 billion) of unencumbered on-balance sheet 
assets, and £139.0 billion (31 December 2022: £132.0 billion) of pre-positioned and encumbered assets held with central banks; the 
increase in the latter was primarily driven by additional assets pre-positioned at the Bank of England. Primarily, the Group encumbers 
mortgages, unsecured lending, credit card receivables and car loans through the issuance programmes and tradable securities 
through securities financing activity. The Group mainly pre-positions mortgage assets at central banks.

Insurance underwriting risk
Definition
Insurance underwriting risk is defined as the risk of adverse 
developments in the timing, frequency and severity of claims for 
insured/underwritten events, in customer behaviour and in 
expense costs, leading to reductions in earnings and/or value.

Exposures
The major source of insurance underwriting risk within the Group 
arises from the Insurance business.

Longevity and persistency are key risks within the life and pensions 
business. Longevity risk arises from the annuity portfolios where 
policyholders’ future cash flows are guaranteed at retirement and 
increases in life expectancy beyond current assumptions will 
increase the cost of annuities. Longevity risk exposures are 
expected to increase with the insurance business growth in the 
annuity market. Customer behaviour may result in increased 
cancellations or cessation of contributions, giving rise to the 
persistency exposure.

The Group’s defined benefit pension schemes also expose the 
Group to longevity risk. For further information please refer to the 
defined benefit pension schemes component of the market risk 
section and note 16 to the financial statements.

Property insurance risk is a key risk within the General Insurance 
business, arising from home insurance. Exposures can arise, for 
example, from extreme weather conditions such as flooding, 
when property damage claims are higher than expected.

Expenses are incurred in writing insurance business, with the risk of 
costs being higher than expected managed through regular cost 
initiatives and operating model reviews.

Measurement
Insurance underwriting risks are measured using a variety of 
techniques including stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, 
as well as stochastic modelling. Current and potential future 
insurance underwriting risk exposures are assessed and 
aggregated across a range of stresses with risk measures based 
on 1-in-200 year stresses for the Insurance business’ regulatory 
capital assessments and other supporting measures where 
appropriate, including those set out in note 36 to the financial 
statements.

Mitigation
Insurance underwriting risk is mitigated in a number of ways:
Risks are identified, measured, managed, monitored and
•
reported using the RCSA process
Embedded insurance processes for underwriting, claims and
expense management, pricing, product design and use of
reinsurance

•

• Annual review and setting of demographic and expense best

•

•

•

estimate assumptions
Exposure limits by risk type are assessed through the business
planning process and used as a control mechanism to ensure
risks are taken within risk appetite
Longevity risk transfer and hedging solutions are considered on
a regular basis
Life Insurance exposure to demographic risks are mitigated
through the use of reinsurance, where there is a clear benefit
that outweighs the value of retaining the risks, or where there
are risks which are less well understood

• General Insurance exposure to accumulations of risk and

possible catastrophes is mitigated by reinsurance
arrangements spread over a range of reinsurers. Detailed
modelling, including that of the potential losses under various
catastrophe scenarios, supports the choice of reinsurance
arrangements

Monitoring
Insurance underwriting risks are monitored by Insurance senior 
executive committees and ultimately the Insurance Board. 
Significant risks from the Insurance business and the defined 
benefit pension schemes are reviewed by the Group Executive 
and Group Risk Committees and Board.

Insurance underwriting risk exposures are monitored against risk 
appetite with persistency, expenses and GI claims also analysed 
monthly. The Insurance business monitors experiences against 
expectations, for example business volumes and mix, claims, 
expenses and persistency experience. The effectiveness of 
controls put in place to manage insurance underwriting risk is 
evaluated and significant divergences from experience or 
movements in risk exposures are investigated and remedial 
action taken.

Assets and liabilities are classified as trading book if they meet the requirements as set out in the Capital Requirements Regulation, article 104.

The defined benefit pension schemes’ assets and liabilities are 
included under other assets and other liabilities in this table and 
note 16 on page 244 provides further information.

The Group’s trading book assets and liabilities are originated 
within the Commercial Banking business units. Within the 
Group’s balance sheet these fall under the trading assets and 
liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The assets and 
liabilities are classified as trading book if they meet the 
requirements as set out in the Capital Requirements Regulation, 
article 104. Further information on these activities can be found 
under the Trading portfolios section on page 190.

Derivative assets and liabilities are held by the Group for three 
main purposes: to provide risk management solutions for clients, 
to manage portfolio risks arising from client business and to 
manage and hedge the Group’s own risks. 

Insurance business assets and liabilities relate to policyholder 
funds, as well as shareholder invested assets, including annuity 
funds. 

The Group ensures that it has adequate cash and balances at 
central banks and stocks of high quality liquid assets (for example, 
gilts or US Treasury securities) that can be converted easily into 
cash to meet liquidity requirements. The majority of these assets 
are asset swapped and held at fair value through other 
comprehensive income. Further information on these balances 
can be found under funding and liquidity risk on page 179.

The majority of debt issuance originates from the Group’s capital 
and funding activities and the interest rate risk of the debt issued 
is hedged by swapping them into a floating rate.

The non-trading book primarily consists of customer on-balance 
sheet activities and the Group’s capital and funding activities, 
which expose it to the risk of adverse movements in market rates 
or prices, predominantly interest rates, credit spreads, exchange 
rates and equity prices, as described in further detail within the 
Banking activities section on page 187.

Measurement
Group risk appetite is calibrated primarily to a number of multi-
risk Group economic scenarios, and is supplemented with 
sensitivity-based measures. The scenarios assess the impact of 
unlikely, but plausible, adverse stresses on income with the worst 
case for banking activities, defined benefit pensions, insurance 
and trading portfolios reported against independently, and across 
the Group as a whole.

The Group risk appetite is cascaded first to the Group Asset and 
Liability Committee (GALCO), chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, 
where risk appetite is approved and monitored by risk type, and 
then to the Group Market Risk Committee (GMRC) where risk 
appetite is sub-allocated by business unit. These metrics are 
reviewed regularly by senior management to inform effective 
decision making.

Mitigation
GALCO is responsible for approving and monitoring market risk 
management techniques, market risk measures, behavioural 
assumptions, and the market risk policy. Various mitigation 
activities are assessed and undertaken across the Group to 
manage portfolios and seek to ensure they remain within 
approved limits. The mitigation actions will vary dependent on 
exposure but will, in general, look to reduce risk in a cost effective 
manner by offsetting balance sheet exposures and externalising 
to the financial markets dependent on market liquidity. The 
market risk policy is owned by Group Corporate Treasury (GCT) 
and refreshed annually. The policy is underpinned by 
supplementary market risk procedures, which define specific 
market risk management and oversight requirements.

Monitoring
GALCO and GMRC regularly review high level market risk exposures 
as part of the wider risk management framework. They also make 
recommendations to the Board concerning overall market risk 
appetite and market risk policy. Exposures at lower levels of 
delegation are monitored at various intervals according to their 
volatility, from daily in the case of trading portfolios to monthly or 
quarterly in the case of less volatile portfolios. Levels of exposures 
compared to approved limits and triggers are monitored by Risk 
and appropriate escalation procedures are in place.

How market risks arise and are managed across the Group’s 
activities is considered in more detail below.

Banking activities
Exposures
The Group’s banking activities expose it to the risk of adverse 
movements in market rates or prices, predominantly interest 
rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices. The 
volatility of market rates or prices can be affected by both the 
transparency of prices and the amount of liquidity in the market 
for the relevant asset, liability or instrument.

Interest rate risk
Yield curve risk in the Group’s divisional portfolios, and in the 
Group’s capital and funding activities, arises from the different 
repricing characteristics of the Group’s non-trading assets, 
liabilities and off-balance sheet positions.

Basis risk arises from the potential changes in spreads between 
indices, for example where the bank lends with reference to a 
central bank rate but funds with reference to a market rate, for 
example, SONIA, and the spread between these two rates widens 
or tightens.

Optionality risk arises predominantly from embedded optionality 
within assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet items where either 
the Group or the customer can affect the size or timing of cash 
flows. One example of this is mortgage prepayment risk where the 
customer owns an option allowing them to prepay when it is 
economical to do so. This can result in customer balances 
amortising more quickly or slowly than anticipated due to 
customers’ response to changes in economic conditions.

Foreign exchange risk
Economic foreign exchange exposure arises from the Group’s 
investment in its overseas operations (net investment exposures 
are disclosed in note 52 on page 312). In addition, the Group incurs 
foreign exchange risk through non-functional currency flows from 
services provided by customer-facing divisions, the Group’s debt 
and capital management programmes and is exposed to 
volatility in its CET1 ratio, due to the impact of changes in foreign 
exchange rates on the retranslation of non-Sterling-denominated 
risk-weighted assets.

Equity risk
Equity risk arises primarily from three different sources:
•

The Group’s private equity exposure from investments held by
Lloyds Development Capital and its stake in BGF, both within
the Equities sub-group

• A small number of legacy strategic equity holdings, for

example Visa Inc Preference Shares, and recently acquired
minority fintech stakes, all held in the Equities sub-group

• A small exposure to Lloyds Banking Group share price through
deferred shares and deferred options granted to employees
as part of their benefits package

Credit spread risk
Credit spread risk arises largely from: (i) the liquid asset portfolio 
held in the management of Group liquidity, comprising 
government, supranational and other eligible assets; (ii) the Credit 
Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) 
sensitivity to credit spreads; (iii) a number of the Group’s 
structured medium-term notes where the Group has elected to 
fair value the notes through the profit and loss account; and (iv) 
banking book assets in Commercial Banking held at fair value 
under IFRS 9.

Measurement
Interest rate risk exposure is monitored monthly using, primarily:

Market value sensitivity: this methodology considers all repricing 
mismatches (behaviourally adjusted where appropriate) in the 
current balance sheet and calculates the change in market value 
that would result from an instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis 
points parallel rise or fall in the yield curve. Sterling interest rates 
are modelled with a floor below zero per cent, with negative rate 
floors also modelled for non-Sterling currencies where 
appropriate (product-specific floors apply). The market value 
sensitivities are calculated on a static balance sheet using 
principal cash flows excluding interest, commercial margins and 
other spread components and are therefore discounted at the 
risk-free rate.

Interest income sensitivity: this measures the impact on future net 
interest income arising from various economic scenarios. These 
include instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis point parallel shifts in 
all yield curves and the Group economic scenarios. Sterling 
interest rates are modelled with a floor below zero per cent, with 
negative rate floors also modelled for non-Sterling currencies 
where appropriate (product-specific floors apply). These 
scenarios are reviewed every year and are designed to replicate 
severe but plausible economic events, capturing risks that would 
not be evident through the use of parallel shocks alone such as 
basis risk and steepening or flattening of the yield curve. 

Unlike the market value sensitivities, the interest income 
sensitivities incorporate additional behavioural assumptions as to 
how and when individual products would reprice in response to 
changing rates. 

Reported sensitivities are not necessarily predictive of future 
performance as they do not capture additional management 
actions that would likely be taken in response to an immediate, 
large, movement in interest rates. These actions could reduce the 
net interest income sensitivity, help mitigate any adverse impacts 
or they may result in changes to total income that are not 
captured in the net interest income.

Structural hedge: the structural hedging programme managing 
interest rate risk in the banking book relies on assumptions made 
around customer behaviour. A number of metrics are in place to 
monitor the risks within the portfolio.

Risk management continued

The Group has an integrated Asset and Liability Management (ALM) system which supports non-traded asset and liability management 
of the Group. This provides a single consolidated tool to measure and manage interest rate repricing profiles (including behavioural 
assumptions), perform stress testing and produce forecast outputs. The Group is aware that any assumptions-based model is open to 
challenge.

A full behavioural review is performed annually, or in response to changing market conditions, to ensure the assumptions remain 
appropriate and the model itself is subject to annual re-validation, as required under the Group model governance policy. The key 
behavioural assumptions are:
•
•

Embedded optionality within products
The duration of balances that are contractually repayable on demand, such as current accounts and overdrafts, together with net
free reserves of the Group
The re-pricing behaviour of managed rate liabilities, such as variable rate savings

•

The table below shows, split by material currency, the Group’s market value sensitivities to an instantaneous parallel up and down 25 
and 100 basis points change to all interest rates.

This is a risk-based disclosure and the amounts shown would be amortised in the income statement over the duration of the portfolio.

The market value sensitivity has increased year-on-year as a result of small differences in the hedging profile of fixed mortgages.

The table below shows supplementary value sensitivity to a steepening and flattening (c.100 basis points around the three-year point) 
in the yield curve. This ensures there are no unintended consequences to managing risk to parallel shifts in rates.

Year 1 net interest income sensitivity, to both up and down shocks, 
has decreased slightly year-on-year mostly as a result of 
changing customer deposit behaviour and structural hedge 
activity. 

The three year net interest income sensitivity to an up 25 basis 
points and 50 basis points shock is largely due to reinvestment of 
structural hedge maturities in years two and three. 

The sensitivities are illustrative and do not reflect new business 
margin implications and/or pricing actions, other than as outlined.

The Group makes use of both accounting and economic foreign 
exchange exposures, as an offset against the impact of changes 
in foreign exchange rates on the value of non-Sterling-
denominated risk-weighted assets. This involves the holding of a 
structurally open currency position; sensitivity is minimised where, 
for a given currency, the ratio of the structural open position to 
risk-weighted assets equals the CET1 ratio. Continually evaluating 
this structural open currency position against evolving non-
Sterling-denominated risk-weighted assets mitigates volatility in 
the Group’s CET1 ratio.

The following assumptions have been applied:
•

Instantaneous parallel shift in interest rate curve, including 
bank base rate
Balance sheet remains constant
Illustrative 50 per cent pass-through on deposits and 100 per 
cent pass-through on assets, which could be different in 
practice. 

•
•

Basis risk, foreign exchange, equity and credit spread risks are 
measured primarily through scenario analysis by assessing the 
impact on profit before tax over a 12-month horizon arising from a 
change in market rates, and reported within the Board risk 
appetite on a monthly basis. Supplementary measures such as 
sensitivity and exposure limits are applied where they provide 
greater insight into risk positions. Frequency of reporting 
supplementary measures varies from daily to quarterly 
appropriate to each risk type.

Mitigation
The Group’s policy is to optimise reward while managing its 
market risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by the 
Board. The Group market risk policy and procedures outlines the 
hedging process, and the centralisation of risk from divisions into 
Group Corporate Treasury (GCT), for example via the transfer 
pricing framework. GCT is responsible for managing the 
centralised risk and does this through natural offsets of matching 
assets and liabilities, and appropriate hedging activity of the 
residual exposures, subject to the authorisation and mandate of 
GALCO within the Board risk appetite. The hedges are externalised 
to the market by derivative desks within GCT and the Commercial 
Bank. The Group mitigates income statement volatility through 
hedge accounting. This reduces the accounting volatility arising 
from the Group’s economic hedging activities and any hedge 
accounting ineffectiveness is continuously monitored.

The largest residual risk exposure arises from balances that are 
deemed to be insensitive to changes in market rates (including 
current accounts, a portion of variable rate deposits and 
investable equity), and is managed through the Group’s structural 
hedge. Consistent with the Group’s strategy to deliver stable 
returns, GALCO seeks to minimise large reinvestment risk, and to 
smooth earnings over a range of investment tenors. The structural 
hedge consists of longer-term fixed rate assets or interest rate 
swaps and the amount and duration of the hedging activity is 
reviewed regularly by GALCO.

While the Group faces uncertainty in customer behaviour due to a 
higher rate environment, its exposure to increased pipeline and 
prepayment risks are managed through hedging in line with 
expected customer behaviour. These are appropriately monitored 
and controlled through divisional Asset and Liability Committees 
(ALCOs).

Net investment foreign exchange exposures are managed 
centrally by GCT, by hedging non-Sterling asset values with 
currency borrowing. Economic foreign exchange exposures 
arising from non-functional currency flows are identified by 
divisions and transferred and managed centrally. The Group also 
has a policy of forward hedging its forecasted currency profit and 
loss to year end.

Monitoring
The appropriate limits and triggers are monitored by senior 
executive committees within the Banking divisions. Banking assets, 
liabilities and associated hedging are actively monitored and if 
necessary rebalanced to be within agreed tolerances.

Defined benefit pension schemes
Exposures
The Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are exposed to 
significant risks from their assets and liabilities. The liability 
discount rate exposes the Group to interest rate risk and credit 
spread risk, which are partially offset by fixed interest assets (such 
as gilts and corporate bonds) and swaps. Equity and alternative 
asset risk arises from direct asset holdings. Scheme membership 
exposes the Group to longevity risk. Increases to pensions in 
deferment and in payment expose the Group to inflation risk.

For further information on defined benefit pension scheme assets 
and liabilities please refer to note 16 on page 244.

Measurement
Management of the schemes’ assets is the responsibility of the 
Trustees of the schemes who are responsible for setting the 
investment strategy and for agreeing funding requirements with 
the Group. The Group will be liable for meeting any funding deficit 
that may arise. As part of the triennial valuation process, the 
Group will agree with the Trustees a funding strategy to eliminate 
the deficit over an appropriate period.

Longevity risk is measured using both 1-in-20 year stresses (risk 
appetite) and 1-in-200 year stresses (regulatory capital).

Mitigation
The Group takes an active involvement in agreeing mitigation 
strategies with the schemes’ Trustees. An interest rate and 
inflation hedging programme is in place to reduce liability risk. The 
schemes have also reduced equity allocation and invested the 
proceeds in credit assets. The Trustees have put in place longevity 
swaps to mitigate longevity risk. The merits of longevity risk 
transfer and hedging solutions are reviewed regularly.

Monitoring
In addition to the wider risk management framework, governance 
of the schemes includes a specialist pension committee.

The surplus, or deficit, in the schemes is tracked monthly along 
with various single factor and scenario stresses which consider 
the assets and liabilities holistically. Key metrics are monitored 
monthly including the Group’s capital resources of the scheme, 
the performance against risk appetite triggers, and the 
performance of the hedged asset and liability matching positions.

Insurance business
Exposures
The main elements of market risk to which the Group is exposed 
through the Insurance business are equity, credit default spread, 
interest rate and inflation.
•

Equity risk arises indirectly through the value of future 
management charges on policyholder funds

• Credit default spread risk mainly arises from annuities where 

policyholders’ future cash flows are guaranteed at retirement. 
Exposure arises if the market value of the assets moves 
differently to the liabilities they back. This exposure arises from 
credit downgrades and defaults
Interest rate risk arises through credit and interest assets which 
are mainly held to cover the annuity and general insurance 
liabilities
Inflation exposure arises from inflation-linked policyholder 
benefits and future expenses

Risk management continued

Measurement
Current and potential future market risk exposures within 
Insurance are assessed using a range of techniques including 
stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, as well as stochastic 
modelling.

Risk measures include 1-in-200 year stresses for the Insurance 
business’ regulatory capital assessments and other supporting 
measures where appropriate, including those set out in note 36 
on page 298.

Mitigation
Equity and credit spread risks are closely monitored. Asset liability 
matching, hedging and unit matching are all used to reduce the 
sensitivity of equity movements.

Interest rate risk in the annuity book is monitored and mitigated 
by investing in assets whose cash flows closely match those on 
the projected future liabilities. It is not possible to eliminate the risk 
completely as the timing of insured events is uncertain and bonds 
are not available for all required maturities.

Other market risks (e.g. interest rate exposure outside the annuity 
book and inflation) are also closely monitored and where 
considered appropriate, hedges are put in place to reduce 
exposure.

The costs and benefits of market risk mitigation are considered in 
strategy and business planning decisions, with consideration 
given to the impacts to various metrics.

Monitoring
Market risks in the Insurance business are monitored by Insurance 
senior executive committees and ultimately the Insurance Board. 
Monitoring includes the progression of market risk capital against 
risk appetite limits, as well as the sensitivity of profit before tax to 
combined market risk stress scenarios and in-year market 
movements. Asset and liability matching positions and hedges in 
place are actively monitored and if necessary rebalanced to be 
within agreed tolerances. In addition, market risk is controlled via 
approved investment policies and mandates.

Trading portfolios
Exposures
The Group’s trading activity is small relative to its peers. The 
Group’s trading activity is undertaken primarily to meet the 
financial requirements of commercial and retail customers for 
foreign exchange, credit, interest rate and inflation products. 
These activities support customer flow and market making 
activities.

All trading activities are performed within the Commercial 
Banking division. While the trading positions taken are generally 
small, any extreme moves in the main risk factors and other 
related risk factors could cause significant losses in the trading 
book depending on the positions at the time. The average 95 per 
cent 1-day trading VaR (Value at Risk; diversified across risk 
factors) was £2.3 million for 31 December 2023 compared to 
£1.5 million for 31 December 2022.

Trading market risk measures are applied to all of the Group’s 
regulatory trading books and they include daily VaR (see trading 
portfolios: VaR table), sensitivity-based measures, and stress 
testing calculations.

Measurement
The Group internally uses VaR as the primary risk measure for all 
trading book positions.

The trading portfolios: VaR table shows some relevant statistics for 
the Group’s 1-day 95 per cent confidence level VaR that are based 
on 300 historical consecutive business days to year-end 2022 and 
year-end 2021. 

The risk of loss measured by the VaR model is the loss in earnings 
which is not expected to be exceeded with 95 per cent 
confidence. The total and average trading VaR numbers reported 
below have been obtained after the application of the 
diversification benefits across the five risk types, but do not reflect 
any diversification between Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc 
and any other entities. The maximum and minimum VaR reported 
for each risk category did not necessarily occur on the same day 
as the maximum and minimum VaR reported at Group level.

The market risk for the trading book continues to be low relative to 
the size of the Group and in comparison to peers. This reflects the 
fact that the Group’s trading operations are customer-centric 
and focused on hedging and recycling client risks.

Although it is an important market standard measure of risk, VaR 
has limitations. One of them is the use of a limited historical data 
sample which influences the output by the implicit assumption 
that future market behaviour will not differ greatly from the 
historically observed period. Another known limitation is the use of 
defined holding periods which assumes that the risk can be 
liquidated or hedged within that holding period. Also calculating 
the VaR at the chosen confidence interval does not give enough 
information about potential losses which may occur if this level is 
exceeded. The Group fully recognises these limitations and 
supplements the use of VaR with a variety of other measurements 
which reflect the nature of the business activity. These include 
detailed sensitivity analysis, position reporting and a stress testing 
programme.

Trading book VaR (1-day 99 per cent) is compared daily against 
both hypothetical and actual profit and loss. The 1-day 99 per cent 
VaR chart can be found in the Group’s Pillar 3 disclosures.

Mitigation
The level of exposure is controlled by establishing and 
communicating the approved risk limits and controls through 
policies and procedures that define the responsibility and 
authority for risk taking. Market risk limits are clearly and 
consistently communicated to the business. Any new or emerging 
risks are brought within risk reporting and defined limits.

Monitoring
Trading risk is monitored daily against 1-day 95 per cent VaR and 
stress testing limits. These limits are complemented with position 
level action triggers and profit and loss referrals. Risk and position 
limits are set and managed at both desk and overall trading book 
levels. They are reviewed at least annually and can be changed 
as required within the overall Group risk appetite framework.

Model risk
Definition
Model risk is defined as the risk of financial loss, regulatory 
censure, reputational damage or customer detriment, as a result 
of deficiencies in the development, application and ongoing 
operation of models and rating systems.

Models are defined as quantitative methods that process input 
data into quantitative outputs, or qualitative outputs (including 
ordinal letter output) which have a quantitative measure 
associated with them. Model governance policy is restricted to 
specific categories of application of models, principally financial 
risk, treasury and valuation, with certain exclusions, such as 
prescribed calculations and project appraisal calculations.

Exposures
The Group makes extensive use of models. They perform a variety 
of functions including:
• Capital calculation
• Credit decisioning, including fraud
•
•
•
• Market risk measurement

Pricing models
Impairment calculation
Stress testing and forecasting

As a result of the wide scope and breadth of coverage, there is 
exposure to model risk across a number of the Group’s principal 
risk categories.

Model risk remained elevated in 2023, following the pandemic 
related government-led support schemes weakening the 
relationships between model inputs and outputs in 2022. The 
economy has steadied somewhat compared to 2022, now being 
more typical of the environment used to build the models, 
reducing need for judgemental overlays to account for this, but 
many of the effects of the pandemic and other stresses to the 
economy are still working their way through.

The control environment for model risk continues to be 
strengthened to meet revised internal and regulatory 
requirements. In addition, in common with the rest of the industry, 
changes required to capital models following new regulations 
have created a temporary increase in the risk relating to these 
models during the period of transition. Further information on 
capital impacts are detailed in the capital risk section on pages 
146 to 153.

Measurement
The Board risk appetite metric is the key component for 
measuring the Group’s most material models; performance is 
reported monthly to the Group and Board Risk Committees.

Mitigation
The model risk management framework, established by and with 
continued oversight from an independent team in the Risk 
division, provides the foundation for managing and mitigating 
model risk within the Group. Accountability is cascaded from the 
Board and senior management via the Group enterprise risk 
management framework.

This provides the basis for the Group’s model governance policy, 
which defines the mandatory requirements for models across the 
Group, including:
•
• Model materiality
•

The scope of models covered by the policy

Roles and responsibilities, including ownership, independent
oversight and approval
Key principles and controls regarding data integrity,
development, validation, implementation, ongoing
maintenance and revalidation, monitoring, and the process for
non-compliance

•

The model owner takes responsibility for ensuring the fitness for 
purpose of the models and rating systems, supported and 
challenged by the independent specialist Group function.

The above ensures all models in scope of policy, including those 
involved in regulatory capital calculation, are developed 
consistently and are of sufficient quality to support business 
decisions and meet regulatory requirements.

Monitoring
The Group Model Governance Committee is the primary body for 
overseeing model risk. Policy requires that key performance 
indicators are monitored for every model to ensure they remain fit 
for purpose and all issues are escalated appropriately. Material 
model issues are reported to the Group and Board Risk 
Committees monthly, with more detailed papers as necessary to 
focus on key issues.

Risk management continued

Operational risk
Definition
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss from inadequate or 
failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external 
events.

Exposures
The principal operational risks to the Group which could result in 
customer detriment, unfair customer outcomes, financial loss, 
disruption and/or reputational damage include:
•

IT systems: including cyber-attacks, or the failure of IT systems
due to volume of change and/or aged infrastructure

• Fraud: including intentional acts of deception or omission by

external or internal parties

• Financial crime: including failures relating to anti-money
laundering, anti-bribery, counter-terrorist financing and
financial sanctions and prohibitions laws and regulations

• Security: including the confidentiality, integrity and/or

availability of the Group’s assets (such as physical, data and
information) being compromised

• Business process: including failed transaction processing or

process management

A number of these risks could increase where there is a reliance 
on third party suppliers to provide services to the Group or its 
customers.

Measurement
Operational risk is managed across the Group through an 
operational risk framework and policies. This framework includes a 
risk and control self-assessment process, risk impact likelihood 
matrix, risk and control indicators, risk appetite setting, a robust 
operational loss event management and escalation process, and 
a scenario analysis and operational loss forecasting process. This 
is supplemented by Group level and local management 
information and reporting across a suite of governed metrics. 

The operational risk events by risk category table below shows 
high level loss and event trends for the Group using Basel II 
categories. Based on data captured on the Group’s RCSA, in 2023 
the highest frequency of events occurred in external fraud with 
90.93 per cent of the total volume. Clients, products and business 
practices accounted for 52.19 per cent of losses by value.

Operational risk losses and scenario analysis is used to inform the 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). The Group 
calculates its minimum (Pillar I) operational risk capital 
requirements using The Standardised Approach (TSA). Pillar II is 
calculated using internal and external loss data and extreme but 
plausible scenarios that may occur in the next 12 months. 

Mitigation
The Group continues to focus on risk management requirements 
and developing the processes, systems and people skills and 
capabilities needed to mitigate risks. Risks, including IT systems 
and security-related risks, are reported and discussed at local 
governance forums and escalated to executive management 
and the Board as appropriate to ensure the correct level of 
visibility and engagement. The Group employs a range of risk 
management strategies, including: avoidance, mitigation, transfer 
(including insurance) and acceptance within appetite or 
tolerance. Where there is a reliance on third party suppliers to 
provide services, including the areas of IT systems and 
information security, the Group’s sourcing policy ensures that 
outsourcing initiatives follow a defined process including due 
diligence, risk evaluation and ongoing assurance.

The Board has overall oversight responsibility for the Group’s IT 
systems and information security risk management and 
delegates this oversight to the Group Risk Committee (GRC). GRC 
is responsible for ensuring that management has processes in 
place designed to identify and evaluate IT systems and 
information security risks that the Group is exposed to and 
implementing processes and programmes to manage these risks 
and mitigate related incidents within appetite. GRC also reports 
material IT systems and information security risks to the Board via 
the Board Risk Committee. Management is responsible for 
identifying, considering and assessing material IT systems and 
information security risks on an ongoing basis, establishing 
processes to ensure that such potential risk exposures are 
monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures and 
maintaining control improvement programmes.

The Group classifies the potential IT systems and information 
security risk of its suppliers based on the nature and criticality of 
the information accessed or processed. These assessments are 
completed at initial service onboarding and periodically 
throughout the supplier lifecycle. These assessments drive the 
level of ongoing supplier governance, assurance and monitoring. 
The Group provides training and other resources to its suppliers to 
support IT systems and information security resiliency in its supply 
chain. The Group also requires its suppliers to comply with its 
standard information security terms and conditions as a 
condition of doing business with it. Suppliers are required to 
provide management information to review and assess any 
potential information security related risks depending on the 
nature of the services being provided.

Mitigating actions to the principal operational risks include the 
following:
•

The Group has set out key controls, aligned to the Group’s risk
appetite, via its policies, procedures and enterprise risk
management framework, ensuring businesses assess the
potential impacts of activity on customers, markets, colleagues
and business risk profiles
The Group adopts a risk-based approach to mitigate the
internal and external fraud risks it faces, reflecting the current
and emerging fraud risks within the market. Fraud risk appetite
metrics holistically cover the impacts of fraud in terms of
losses to the Group, costs of fraud systems and operations,
and customer experience of actual and attempted fraud.
Oversight of the appropriateness and performance of these
metrics is undertaken regularly through business area and
Group-level committees. This approach drives a continual
programme of prioritised enhancements to the Group’s
technology and process and people-related controls; with an
emphasis on preventative controls supported by real time
detective controls wherever feasible. Group-wide policies and
operational control frameworks are maintained and designed
to provide customer confidence, protect the Group’s
commercial interests and reputation, comply with legal
requirements and meet regulatory requirements. The Group’s
fraud awareness programme remains a key component of its
fraud control environment, and awareness of fraud risk is
supported by mandatory training for all colleagues. This is
further strengthened by material annual investment into both
technology and the personal development needs of
colleagues. The Group also plays an active role with other
financial institutions, industry bodies and law enforcement
agencies in identifying and combatting fraud
The Group adopts a risk-based approach to mitigate cyber
threats it faces. The effective operation of the Group’s estate is
supported by an IT and Cyber Security Governance framework,
guided by a threat-based strategy which underpins
investment decisions. The ongoing protection of the estate and
confidentiality of material information is ensured through
adherence to the Group Security Policy which has been
aligned to industry good practice including the NIST Cyber
Security Framework; and material laws and regulations. The
Group’s IT systems and information security risk management
processes, which includes assessment, documentation and
treatment have been integrated into its overall enterprise risk
management framework. The Group engages a specialist third
party consultancy on a periodic basis, to assess the maturity of
its cyber security programme, in assessing, identifying and
managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. During the
handling of an incident, the Cyber Security team will
continuously monitor and assess the impact to the Group.
Thresholds have been set that, once triggered, will bring the
information security risk owning business representatives, legal
and compliance teams together as a subcommittee. The
subcommittee will own the invocation of crisis management,
Board notification and the drafting of any regulatory
notifications. In the event of a major information security
incident, including those with a material impact on the Group,
the Chief Security Officer (CSO) maintains engagement with
the executive, supported by the Group incident management
teams
The Group has adopted policies and procedures designed to
detect and prevent the use of its banking network for money
laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, tax evasion, human
trafficking, modern-day slavery and wildlife trafficking, and
activities prohibited by legal and regulatory sanctions. Against
a background of complex and detailed laws and regulations,
and of continued criminal and terrorist activity, the Group
regularly reviews and assesses its policies, procedures and
organisational arrangements to keep them current, effective
and consistent across markets and jurisdictions

•

•

The Group requires mandatory training on these topics for all
employees. Specifically, the anti-money laundering procedures
include ‘know-your-customer’ requirements, transaction
monitoring technologies, reporting of suspicions of money
laundering or terrorist financing to the applicable regulatory
authorities, and interaction between the Group’s Integrated
Intelligence and Investigations team and external agencies
and other financial institutions. The Group economic crime
prevention policy prohibits the payment, offer, acceptance or
request of a bribe, including ‘facilitation payments’ by any
employee or agent and provides a confidential reporting
service for anonymous reporting of suspected or actual
bribery activity. The Group economic crime prevention policy
also sets out a framework of controls for compliance with legal
and regulatory sanctions
In addition to its efforts internally, the Group also contributes to
economic crime prevention by supporting and championing
industry-level activity, including:
– Representing large retail banks at the National Economic
Crime Centre (NECC) led Public Private Operating Board
(PPOB); co-chairing the Public Private Threat Group leading
the UK’s response to money laundering; chairing the Joint
Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (JMLIT) senior
management team and providing expert resource to the
NECC’s operational threat cells

– Collaborating with peer bank to take forward the second

phase of data fusion (large-scale information sharing and
analysis) with the National Crime Agency (NCA)

– Holding bilateral discussions with the Home Office on using

suspected criminal funds to fund economic crime initiatives,
in advance of the provisions being included in the Criminal
Justice Bill

– In conjunction with UK Finance and peer banks, developing

a pilot to use the newly acquired information sharing
provisions contained within the Economic Crime and
Corporate Transparency Act

– Being an active member of UK Finance where the Group has
representation on every economic crime committee and
panel. This includes attending the Sanctions and Fraud
Committees, which are the industries’ primary forums for
considering and responding to issues of mutual interest
– Helping fund the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit
to investigate fraud cases, target and where appropriate
arrest and gain prosecution of offenders

– Being a member of Cifas, the largest cross-sector fraud

sharing organisation, where the Group shares and receives
internal and first party fraud data to detect, deter and
prevent criminals exploiting our banking facilities
– Engagement with Europol and International Law

Enforcement to share fraud and financial crime intelligence
– In partnership with the City of London Police, a pilot scheme
was launched to use the proceeds of crime to fund fraud-
fighting and victim support programmes: Cyber Detectives:
a primary school education programme on fraud and cyber
protection and Crooks on Campus: a fraud education
programme on money mules which brings to life the reality
of organised financial crime for university students

– The Group is an active supporter of Stop Scams UK. Working
in partnership with other banks, telecoms and technology
companies, the telephone hotline number - 159 - has been
rolled out across the UK with excellent results

Risk management continued

Monitoring
Monitoring and reporting of operational risk is undertaken at 
Board, Group, legal entity and business unit and functional 
committees. Each committee monitors key risks, control 
effectiveness, indicators, events, operational losses, risk appetite 
metrics and the results of independent testing conducted by Risk 
division and/or Group Internal Audit. Additionally, the Group’s IT 
and information security processes are validated and audited by 
internal experts within the Risk function and Group Internal Audit.

The Group maintains a formal approach to operational risk event 
escalation, whereby events are identified, captured and 
escalated, where appropriate based on materiality. Root causes 
of events are determined, and action plans put in place to ensure 
an optimum level of control to keep customers and the business 
safe, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.

The insurance policies are monitored and reviewed regularly, with 
recommendations being made to the Group’s senior 
management annually prior to each renewal. Insurers are 
monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure counterparty risk is 
minimised. A process is in place to manage any insurer rating 
changes or insolvencies.

Operational resilience risk
Definition
Operational resilience risk is defined as the risk that the Group fails 
to design resilience into business operations including those that 
are outsourced, underlying infrastructure and controls (people, 
property, process, technology) so that it is able to withstand 
external or internal events which could impact the continuation of 
operations, and fails to respond in a way which meets customer 
and stakeholder expectations and needs when the continuity of 
operations is compromised.

Exposures
Ineffective operational resilience risk management could lead to 
important services not being available to customers, and in 
extreme circumstances, bank failure could result. The Group has in 
place a transparent and effective operating model to identify, 
monitor and test important business services and critical business 
processes from a customer, Group and systemic perspective. The 
failure to adequately build resilience into an important business 
service or critical business process may occur in a variety of ways, 
including:
•

The Group being overly reliant on one location to deliver a
critical business process
The Group not having an adequate succession plan in place
for designated subject matter experts
The Group being overly reliant on a supplier which fails to
provide a service

•

•

• A shortcoming in the Group’s ability to respond and/or recover

•

in a timely manner following a cyber incident
The Group failing to upgrade its IT systems and leaving them
vulnerable to failure

Effective operational resilience ensures the Group designs 
resilience into its systems, is able to withstand and/or recover 
from a significant unexpected event occurring and can continue 
to provide services to its customers. A significant outage could 
result in customers being unable to access accounts or conduct 
transactions, which as well as presenting significant reputational 
risk for the Group would negatively impact the Group’s purpose. 
Operational resilience is also an area of continued regulatory and 
industry focus, similar in importance to financial resilience.

194 Lloyds Banking Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Lloyds Banking Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Failure to manage operational resilience effectively could impact 
the following other risk categories:
•

Regulatory compliance: non-compliance with new/existing
operational resilience regulations, for example, through failure
to identify emerging regulation or not embedding regulatory
requirements within the Group’s policies, processes and
procedures or identify further future emerging regulation

• Operational risk: being unable to safely provide customers with

business services

• Conduct risk: an operational resilience failure may render the

Group liable to fines from the FCA for poor conduct

• Market risk: the Group being unable to provide key services
could have ramifications for the wider market and could
impact share price

Measurement
Operational resilience risk is managed across the Group through 
the Group’s enterprise risk management framework and 
operational risk policy and associated standards. Board risk 
appetite metrics for operational resilience are in place and are 
well understood. These specific measures are subject to ongoing 
monitoring and reporting, including a mandatory review of 
metrics and thresholds on at least an annual basis. To strengthen 
the management of operational resilience risk, the Group 
mobilised an operational resilience enhancement programme 
which is designed to focus on end-to-end resilience and the 
management of key risks to important processes.

Mitigation
The Group has increased its focus on operational resilience and 
has updated its operational resilience strategy to reflect 
changing priorities of both customers and regulators. 
Furthermore, the Group is in the process of responding to the 
publication of regulatory policy statements. Focus has been given 
to ensure compliance, and existing frameworks have been 
adapted to consider important business services and impact 
tolerances. At the core of its approach to operational resilience 
are the Group’s important business services and critical business 
processes which drive activity, including scenario testing to 
identify and drive remediation of vulnerabilities that could impact 
delivery of an important business service. The Group continues to 
maintain and develop playbooks that guide its response to a 
range of interruptions from internal and external threats and tests 
these through scenario-based testing and exercising.

The Group’s strategy considers the evolving risk management 
requirements, adapting the change delivery model to be more 
agile and develop the people skills and capabilities needed. The 
Group continues to review and invest in its control environment to 
ensure it addresses the risks it faces. Risks are reported and 
discussed at local governance forums and escalated to executive 
management and the Board as appropriate. The Group employs 
a range of risk management strategies, including: avoidance, 
mitigation, transfer (including insurance) and acceptance. Where 
there is a reliance on third party suppliers to provide services, the 
Group’s sourcing policy ensures that outsourcing initiatives follow 
a defined process including due diligence, risk evaluation and 
ongoing assurance.

Mitigating actions to the principal operational resilience risk are:

Cyber: Whilst the Group did not identify any cyber threats that 
materially affected its business strategy, results of operations or 
financial condition in 2023, the Group remains exposed to the risk 
of cyber threats and future interruptions that could potentially 
disrupt business operations and materially adversely affect the 
Group’s performance. The Board continues to invest heavily to 
protect the Group from cyber-attacks. Investment continues to 
focus on improving the Group’s approach to identity and access 
management, data loss prevention, improving capability to 
detect, respond and recover from cyber-attacks and improved 
ability to manage vulnerabilities across the estate.

To deal with cybersecurity threats, the Group has a dedicated 
Cyber Security function led by a certified CSO with over 12 years of 
experience in this field. The CSO actively participates in Audit 
Committee and Board meetings and is responsible for offering 
updates on information security risks and mitigation strategies to 
the Board and its subcommittees. GRC is responsible for the 
oversight of all risk policies, including the IT system and 
information security policy and commissions regular reviews and 
compliance updates to this policy. Additionally, the CSO chairs a 
subcommittee comprised of stakeholders including, but not 
limited to security representatives, risk management, compliance 
and Group Internal Audit. This subcommittee is focused on 
information security, to review major policy changes, strategies 
and key risk mitigations to enhance the governance of the 
information security strategies and policies.

IT resilience: the Group continues to optimise its approach to IT 
and operational resilience by investing in technology 
improvements and enhancing the resilience of systems that 
support the Group’s critical business processes and important 
business services, primarily through a portfolio of Technology 
Resilience and Security Change programmes. The Board 
optimises the role that resilient technology plays in maintaining 
banking services across the wider industry. As such, the Board 
dedicates considerable time and focus to this subject at both the 
Board and the Board Risk Committee, and continues to sponsor 
key investment programmes that enhance resilience.

People: the Group acknowledges the risks associated to the 
failure to maintain appropriately skilled and available colleagues. 
The Group continues to optimise its approach to ensure that, for 
example, the right number of colleagues are capable of 
supporting critical technology components. Key controls and 
processes are regularly reported to committee(s) and alignment 
with the Group’s strategy is closely monitored.

Property: the Group’s property portfolio remains a key focus in 
ensuring targeted resilience requirements are appropriately 
maintained, including energy resilience. Processes are in place to 
identify key buildings where an important business service or 
critical business process is performed. Depending on criticality, a 
number of mitigating controls are in place to manage the risk of 
severe critical business process disruption. The Group remains 
committed to investment in the upkeep of the property portfolio, 
primarily through the Group property upkeep investment 
programme.

Sourcing: the threat landscape associated with third party 
suppliers and the critical services they provide continues to 
receive a significant amount of regulatory attention. The Group 
acknowledges the importance of demonstrating control and 
responsibility for those important business services and critical 
business processes which could cause significant harm to the 
Group’s customers. The Group segments its suppliers by criticality 
and has processes in place to support ongoing supplier 
management.

Monitoring
Monitoring and reporting of operational resilience risk is 
undertaken at Board, Group, entity and divisional committees. 
Each committee monitors key risks, control effectiveness, key risk 
and control indicators, events, operational losses, risk appetite 
metrics and the results of independent testing conducted by Risk 
division and/or Group Internal Audit.

The Group maintains a formal approach to operational resilience 
risk event escalation, whereby material events are identified, 
captured and escalated. Root causes are determined, and action 
plans put in place to ensure an optimum level of control to keep 
customers and the business safe, reduce costs, and improve 
efficiency.

People risk
Definition
People risk is defined as the risk that the Group fails to provide an 
appropriate colleague and customer-centric culture, supported 
by robust reward and wellbeing policies and processes; effective 
leadership to manage colleague resources; effective talent and 
succession management; and robust control to ensure all 
colleague-related requirements are met.

Exposures
The Group’s management of material people risks is critical to its 
capacity to deliver against its strategic objectives, particularly in 
the context of organisational, political and external market 
change and increasing digitisation. The Group is exposed to the 
following key people risks:
•

Failure to recruit, develop and retain a diverse workforce, with
the appropriate mix and required level of skills and capabilities
to meet the current and future needs of the Group

• Non-inclusive culture, ineffective leadership, poor

•

•

•

•

•

communication, weak performance, inappropriate
remuneration policies and poor colleague conduct
Ineffective management of succession planning or failure to
identify appropriate talent pipeline
Failure to manage capacity, colleagues having excessive
demands placed on them resulting in wellbeing issues and
business objectives not being met
Failure to meet all colleague-related legal and regulatory
requirements
Inadequately designed people processes that are not resilient
to withstand unexpected events
The increasing digitisation of the business is changing the
capability mix required and may impact the Group’s ability to
attract and retain talent

• Colleague engagement and sentiment may be challenged by
a number of factors including changes to ways of working,
dissatisfaction with the colleague proposition, cost of living
pressures, and purpose of the business including changes to
culture and ethical considerations

Measurement
People risk is measured through a series of quantitative and 
qualitative indicators, aligned to key sources of people risk for the 
Group such as succession, diversity, retention, colleague 
engagement and wellbeing. In addition to risk appetite measures 
and limits, people risks and controls are monitored on a monthly 
basis via the Group’s risk governance framework and reporting 
structures.

Mitigation
The Group takes many mitigating actions with respect to people 
risk. Key areas of focus include:
•

Focusing on leadership and colleague engagement, through
delivery of strategies to attract, retain and develop high calibre
people together with a focus on creating a strong and resilient
talent pipeline

• Continued focus on the Group’s culture and inclusivity strategy

by developing and delivering initiatives that reinforce the
appropriate behaviours which generate the best possible
long-term outcomes for customers and colleagues

• Managing organisational capability and capacity through

divisional people strategies to ensure there are the right skills
and resources to meet customers’ needs and deliver the
Group’s strategic plan

• Maintaining an attractive colleague proposition to promote an

•

appropriate culture and colleague behaviours that meet
customer needs and regulatory expectations
Ensuring colleague wellbeing strategies and support are in
place to meet colleague needs, alongside skills and capability
growth required to maximise the potential of our people
Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements,
embedding compliant and appropriate colleague behaviours
in line with Group policies, values and its people risk priorities
• Ongoing consultation with the Group’s recognised unions on

Strategic risk
Definition
Strategic risk is defined as the risk which results from:
•

Incorrect assumptions about internal or external operating 
environments
Failure to understand the potential impact of strategic 
responses and business plans on existing risk types
Failure to respond or the inappropriate strategic response to 
material changes in the external or internal operating 
environments

•

•

Exposures
The Group faces significant risks due to the evolving external 
environment, changing regulatory and competitive environments 
in the financial services sector, with increased pace, scale and 
complexity of change. Customer, shareholder and employee 
expectations continue to evolve, together with societal trends and 
cost of living pressures.

Similar to emerging risks, strategic risks can manifest themselves 
in existing principal risks or as new exposures which could 
adversely impact the Group and its businesses. In considering 
strategic risks, a key focus is the interconnectivity of individual 
risks and the cumulative effect of different risks on the Group’s 
overall risk profile.

Measurement
The Group assesses and monitors strategic risk implications as 
part of business planning and in its day-to-day activities, ensuring 
it responds appropriately to internal and external factors 
including changes to regulatory, macroeconomic and 
competitive environments. An assessment is made of the key 
strategic risks that are considered to impact the Group, 
leveraging internal and external information and the key mitigants 
or actions that could be taken in response.

Mitigation
The range of mitigating actions includes the following: 
• Horizon scanning is conducted across the Group to identify 

•

•

potential threats, risks, emerging issues and opportunities and 
to explore future trends
The Group’s business planning processes include an 
assessment of the strategic risk implications of new business, 
product entries and other strategic initiatives
The Group’s governance framework mandates individuals’ and 
committees’ responsibilities and decision making rights, to 
ensure that strategic risks are appropriately reported and 
escalated

Monitoring
A review of the Group’s strategic risks is undertaken on at least an 
annual basis and the findings are reported to the Group and 
Board Risk Committees. During 2023, the process and analysis for 
strategic risks and emerging risks has highlighted the alignment 
and overlap between these risks. As a result, from 2024 onwards, 
we will iterate our reporting further and combine both into horizon 
and emerging risks. Further information on emerging risks can be 
found on pages 44 and 144.

Risk management continued

Monitoring
People risk appetite metrics and business risk indicators are 
reported at the People and Places Group and Business Risk 
Committee, Group and Ring-fenced Bank Risk Committee and 
Board Risk Committee, on a regular basis.

All material people risk events are escalated in accordance with 
the Group’s operational risk policy.

Regulatory and legal risk
Definition
Regulatory and legal risk is defined as the risk of financial 
penalties, regulatory censure, criminal or civil enforcement action 
or customer detriment as a result of failure to identify, assess, 
correctly interpret, comply with, or manage regulatory and/or 
legal requirements.

Exposures
The Group has a zero risk appetite for material legal or regulatory 
breaches. The Group remains exposed to the evolving legal and 
regulatory landscape, such as changes to the regulatory 
framework, changing regulatory and other standards as well as 
uncertainty arising from the current and future litigation 
landscape.

Measurement
Regulatory and legal risks are measured against a defined risk 
appetite metric, which is an assessment of material regulatory 
breaches and material legal incidents.

Mitigation
The Group undertakes a range of key mitigating actions to 
manage regulatory and legal risk. These include the following:
The Board has established a Group-wide risk appetite and 
•
metric for regulatory and legal risk

•

• Group policies and procedures set out the principles that 
should apply across the business which are aligned to the 
Group risk appetite. Mandated policies and processes require 
appropriate control frameworks, management information, 
standards and colleague training to be implemented to 
identify and manage regulatory and legal risk
Business units identify, assess and implement policy and 
regulatory requirements and establish local controls, 
processes, procedures and resources to ensure appropriate 
governance and compliance
Business units regularly produce management information to 
assist in the identification of issues and test management 
controls are working effectively
The Legal function provides legal advice and together, the Risk 
and Legal functions provide oversight, proactive support and 
constructive challenge to the business in identifying and 
managing regulatory and legal issues
Risk division conducts thematic reviews to provide oversight of 
regulatory compliance 

•

•

•

• Horizon scanning is conducted to identify and address 

•

•

changes in regulatory and legal requirements
The Group engages with regulatory authorities and industry 
bodies on forthcoming regulatory changes, market reviews 
and investigations, ensuring programmes are established to 
deliver new regulation and legislation
The Group has adapted quickly to evolving regulatory 
expectations due to cost of living pressures and continues to 
engage with regulatory authorities 

Monitoring
Material risks are managed through the relevant business 
committees, with review and escalation through Group-level 
committees where appropriate, including the escalation of any 
material regulatory breaches or material legal incidents.

Independent auditors’ report
To the Members of Lloyds Banking Group plc

Report on the audit of the financial statements

1. Opinion
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc (the ‘Parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’ or ‘LBG’) give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;

•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting 
standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB);
•  the Parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international 

accounting standards and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 

We have audited the financial statements which comprise the:

Group

Parent company

•  Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2023;
•  Consolidated income statement for the year then ended;
•  Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year 

then ended;

•  Balance sheet as at 31 December 2023;
•  Statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; 
•  Cash flow statement for the year then ended; and
•  Notes 1 to 13 to the financial statements, which include the 

•  Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then 

accounting principles and policies.

ended;

•  Consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
•  Notes 1 to 55 to the financial statements, which include the 

accounting principles and policies;

•  Directors’ remuneration report identified as ‘audited’; and;
•  Risk management section identified as ‘audited’.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom adopted 
international accounting standards, and as regards the Parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

2. Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of  
our report. 

We are independent of the Group and the Parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services 
provided to the Group and Parent company for the year are disclosed in note 17 to the financial statements. We confirm that we have 
not provided any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard to the Group or the Parent company.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

3. Summary of our Audit approach

Key audit matters

The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
•  Expected credit losses (‘ECL’) (Group)
•  Regulatory and litigation matters (Group)
•  IT systems that impact financial reporting (Group and Parent company)
•  Defined benefit obligations (Group)
•  Valuation of certain complex and illiquid financial instruments held at fair value (Group)
•  First time adoption of IFRS 17 (Group)

The first time adoption of IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ has been identified as a key audit matter  
given the judgement and complexity required to provide assurance over the Group’s first time 
reporting under this new standard which became effective from 1 January 2023, replacing IFRS 4 
‘Insurance Contracts’. 

Under IFRS 17 accounting, the volatility from the Group’s insurance actuarial assumptions impacting 
profit is reduced. Therefore, we no longer consider the Group’s Insurance Actuarial Assumptions as  
a key audit matter. 

Materiality

Our assessment of the level of risk for all other areas has remained consistent with the prior year. 

Overall materiality used for the Group consolidated financial statements was £344 million, which was 
determined on the basis of profit before tax and net assets. 
Overall materiality used for the Parent company financial statements was £344 million, which was 
determined on the basis of net assets and capped at Group materiality.

Scoping

Our audit scope covers 82 per cent of the Group’s revenue, 87 per cent of the Group’s profit before tax, 
96 per cent of the Group’s total assets and 93 per cent of the Group’s total liabilities.

Our audit approach
We structured our approach to the audit to reflect how the Group is organised as well as ensuring it was both effective and risk 
focused. It can be summarised into the following key activities through which we obtained sufficient audit evidence required to form 
our opinion on the Group and Parent company financial statements: 

• Audit planning and risk assessment
Our audit team has been structured in line with the Group’s three main operating divisions; Retail, Commercial Banking and Insurance,
Pensions and Investments. Our audit planning procedures considered the impact of internal and external factors affecting the Group’s
profitability and operations, key audit matters most relevant to the users of the financial statements, the appropriate scope of audit
work performed as well as the expectations and requirements of the Group’s investors and regulators.

In performing our audit risk assessments, we considered the impact of macroeconomic factors on the Group’s key accounting 
judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty. The key factors considered in our risk assessments were:
•

the impact of high interest rates, high inflation and cost of living pressures on the Group’s ECL and valuation of certain illiquid and
complex financial instruments;
the impact of the first time adoption of IFRS 17 on the Group’s Insurance business; and

•
• changes to the regulatory and litigation environment affecting the Group’s financial reporting.

We obtained the knowledge and information required to inform our audit planning and risk assessment decision making through 
regular meetings with Group and Divisional Finance and the extensive use of data and technology; 

• Execution of audit work 
Our audit is comprised of two distinct component audit teams covering the Group’s three operating segments, which are:

– The UK Banking component auditing the Group’s Retail and Commercial Banking operating segments; and
– The Insurance component auditing the Group’s Insurance, Pensions and Investments operations.

The group audit team met regularly and was in active dialogue with each component audit team throughout the audit to ensure 
appropriate oversight over audit activities performed within each audit component. Oversight activities included determining whether 
the planned work was performed in accordance with the overall Group audit strategy and in line with the Group audit instructions 
provided to the components. We were able to satisfy ourselves that our oversight and supervision was appropriate through in-person 
meetings, videoconferencing, direct reviews of work as well as through attending planning and clearance meetings with divisional 
management; 

• Audit procedures undertaken at both Group and Parent company level
We performed audit procedures over the Group and Parent company financial statements including the consolidation of the Group’s
results, the preparation of the financial statements, certain disclosures within the directors’ remuneration report, litigation provisions
and exposures, as well as the Group’s entity level and oversight controls relevant to financial reporting. Entities not covered by our audit
scope are subject to analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement in
the aggregated financial information;

Internal controls testing approach

•
Our internal controls testing approach was informed by our scoping and risk assessment activities. We have assessed the Group’s
end-to-end financial reporting processes supporting all in-scope financial statement balances and identified relevant controls to test
for these balances. This included the testing of general IT controls, process level controls and entity level controls at the Group level;
and

• The impact of climate change on our audit
In planning our audit, we have considered the impact of climate change on the Group’s operations and any subsequent impact on its
financial statements. The Group sets out its assessment of the potential impact on page 154 of the Risk Management section of the
Annual Report.

In conjunction with our climate risk specialists, we have held discussions with the Group to understand their: 
• process for identifying affected operations including the governance and controls over this process, and the subsequent effect

•

on the financial reporting for the Group; and
long-term strategy to respond to climate change risks and how this is factored into the Group’s forecasts, considering publicly
announced climate change commitments and any costs associated with the Group’s net zero targets.

Our audit work has involved: 
• evaluating climate as a factor in risk assessments for potentially affected balances;
• challenging the completeness of the physical and transition risks identified and considered in the Group’s climate risk assessment

•

and the conclusion that there continues to be no material impact of climate change risk on financial reporting;
reviewing the Group’s qualitative loan portfolio analysis, and challenging the key assumptions used by the Group with reference
to our own understanding of the portfolios and publicly available documentation; and

• assessing disclosures in the Annual Report and challenging the consistency between the financial statements and the remainder

of the Annual Report.

We have not identified any material inconsistencies or issues as a result of these procedures.

The Group’s progress on their Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) targets in not included within the scope of this audit.

Independent auditors’ report continued
To the Members of Lloyds Banking Group plc

We were engaged separately to provide independent limited assurance under International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(‘ISAE’) 3000 (Revised) and ISAE 3410 to the directors regarding the following ESG metrics and targets:
•

LBG’s own operations’ Scope 1, 2 and 3 energy consumption and GHG emissions data for the 12 months ended 30 September 2023
(page 134 to 135);

• Supply chain GHG emissions for the 12 months ended 30 September 2022 and 30 September 2023 (page 35);
• On-balance sheet financed emissions for 9 sectors for the year ended 31 December 2022 and for the defined baseline year for each

sector (pages 114 to 115 of the Sustainability Report);

• On and off-balance sheet financed emissions for Scottish Widows’ investment portfolio (page 35);
• Diversity and Inclusion metrics disclosing the proportion of women, Minority Ethnic and Black Heritage colleagues in senior roles

(page 32);

• Selected requirements from the Group’s Principles of Responsible Banking Reporting and Self-Assessment Template (page 3 to 22 of 

the Sustainability Reporting Framework); and

• The Group’s progress against five specific Sustainable Lending and Investment targets (page 15).

The procedures performed for a limited assurance engagement is substantially less than the work performed for a financial audit, 
which provides reasonable assurance. The Sustainability Report and our independent assurance report can be found at 
https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/sustainability.html where we explain the scope of work and procedures performed.

4. Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and Parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting included:
• using our knowledge of the Group and Parent company, the financial services industry, the financial services regulatory environment
and the general economic environment including, macroeconomic pressures affecting the Group’s operations, to identify inherent
risks in the business model and how such risks might affect the financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going
concern period;

• making enquiries of Group management about the assumptions, including climate risk considerations, used in their going concern

models, and assessing the reasonableness of those assumptions and historical forecasting accuracy;

• evaluating the Group’s strategic plans in light of the changing macroeconomic environment, short and longer term financial

budgets, funding, liquidity and capital adequacy plans including internal stress tests;

• considering the Group’s operational resilience;
•

reading analyst reports, industry data, Bank of England reports and other external information to determine if it provided
corroborative or contradictory evidence in relation to the Group’s assumptions;
reviewing correspondence and meeting with prudential and conduct regulators to assess whether there are any matters that may
impact the going concern assessment;
testing the underlying data generated to prepare the forecast scenarios and determined whether there was adequate support for
the assumptions underlying the forecasts; and

•

•

• evaluating the Group’s disclosures on going concern against the requirements of IAS 1.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and Parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for 
a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In relation to the reporting on how the Group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or 
draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of  
this report.

5. Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

Expected credit losses (Group) 

Key audit matter description

Refer to notes 2, 18, 23, 24 and 52 in the financial statements
The Group has recognised £4.1 billion of expected credit losses 
(“ECL”) as at 31 December 2023. The determination of ECL consists 
of a number of assumptions that are inherently uncertain and 
require a high degree of complex and subjective auditor 
judgement, specialised skills and knowledge, and complex 
impairment modelling and a high degree of estimation 
uncertainty. Specifically, the impact of high interest rates and 
inflation, as well as the economic impact of the rising cost of 
living on the ECL have been particularly judgemental in the 
current economic environment. 

The key areas we identified as having the most significant level 
of management judgement were in respect of: 
• Multiple economic scenarios (‘MES’);
• Collectively assessed ECL;
•
• ECL model adjustments.

Individually assessed ECL; and

Multiple economic scenarios
The measurement of expected credit losses is required to reflect 
an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future 
outcomes.

The Group’s economics team develops the future economic 
scenarios. Firstly, a base case forecast is produced based on a 
set of conditioning assumptions, which are designed to reflect the 
Group’s best view of future events. A full distribution of economic 
scenarios around this base case is produced using a Monte Carlo 
simulation and scenarios within that distribution are ranked using 
estimated relationships with industrywide historical loss data. 

In addition to the base case, three scenarios are derived from the 
distribution as averages of constituent modelled scenarios 
around the 15th, 75th and 95th percentiles of the distribution 
corresponding to an upside, a downside and a severe downside, 
respectively. The severe downside is then adjusted to incorporate 
non-modelled paths for inflation and interest rate assumptions. 
The upside, the base case and the downside scenarios are 
weighted at 30 per cent and the severe downside at 10 per cent.

These four scenarios are then used as key assumptions in the 
determination of the ECL allowance. 

How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter

We performed the following procedures:
• Tested the controls over the generation of the multiple
economic scenarios including those over the Group’s
governance processes to determine the base case, different
scenarios and the weightings applied to each scenario;

• Working with our internal economic specialists:

– Challenged and evaluated economic forecasts in the base

scenario such as the unemployment rate, House Price
Index, inflation and forecasted interest rates, and Gross
Domestic Product through comparison to independent
economic outlooks, other external analyses and market
data;

– Challenged and evaluated the appropriateness of

management’s change in both assumptions and the
model;

– Challenged and evaluated the appropriateness of the

methodology applied to generate alternative
macroeconomic scenarios, including associated
weightings and assumptions within; and

– Independently replicated the multiple economic scenario
model and compared the outputs of our independent
model to the Group’s output to test scenario generation;

• Tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used by the

model;

• Performed a stand back assessment of the appropriateness of

The development of these multiple economic scenarios is 
inherently uncertain, highly complex, and requires significant 
judgement. 

the weightings applied to each of the scenarios based on
publicly available data; and

• Evaluated the appropriateness of disclosures in respect of

The principal consideration for our determination that the 
multiple economic scenarios is a key audit matter was the high 
degree of management judgement which required specialised 
auditor knowledge and a high degree of audit effort in areas such 
as evaluating the forward-looking information used by 
management, and the weighting applied. 

This key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee’s report 
on page 98.

Independent auditors’ report continued
To the Members of Lloyds Banking Group plc

Collectively assessed ECL
The ECL for the Retail and Commercial Banking divisions, except 
for individually assessed stage 3 commercial loans, is determined 
on a collective basis using impairment models. These models use 
a number of significant judgements to calculate a probability 
weighted estimate by applying a probability of default, exposure 
at default and a loss given default, taking account of collateral 
held or other loss mitigants, discounted using the effective 
interest rate. 

We tested controls across the process to determine the ECL 
provisions including:
• Model governance including model validation and monitoring;
• Model assumptions;
• The allocation of assets into stages, including those to

determine the Credit Risk Rating in the Commercial Banking
division; and

• Data accuracy and completeness.

The key judgements and estimates in determining the ECL 
include: 
• modelling approach, modelling simplifications and

judgements, and selection of modelling data;

• behavioural lives for the Retail division;
• credit risk ratings for the Commercial Banking division, which

•

are performed on a counterparty basis for larger exposures by
a credit officer; and
the appropriate allocation of assets into the correct staging
taking into account any significant deterioration in credit risk
since inception of the loan.

This key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee’s report 
on page 98.

Working with our internal modelling specialists, our audit 
procedures over the key areas of estimation covered the 
following:
• Model estimations, where we:

– Evaluated the appropriateness of the modelling approach

and assumptions used;

– Independently replicated the models for all material

portfolios and compared the outputs of our independent
models to the Group’s outputs;

– Assessed model performance by evaluating variations

between observed data and model predictions;
– Developed an understanding and assessed model

limitations and remedial actions; and

– Tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used

in model execution and calibration.

• Allocation of assets into stages, where we:

– Evaluated the appropriateness of quantitative and

qualitative criteria used for allocation into IFRS 9 stages,
including independently assessing the credit rating of loans
in the commercial banking division;

– Tested the appropriateness of the stage allocation for

a sample of exposures; and

– Tested the data used by models in assigning IFRS 9

stages and evaluated the appropriateness of the model
logic used.

• For expected credit losses assessed individually we have:
– Selected senior team members with extensive IFRS 9

knowledge and expertise to design and lead the execution
of ECL recognised in respect of these exposures;

– Tested the controls over the determination of individually

assessed exposures including assumptions and inputs into
workout and recovery scenarios, as well as valuation
assumptions used; and

Individually assessed ECL
For individual provision assessments of larger exposures in stage 
3 in the Commercial Banking division, complex and subjective 
auditor judgement including specialised knowledge is required

inherently uncertain. The significant judgements in determining 
provisions are the:

• completeness and appropriateness of the potential workout

• probability of default assigned to each identified potential

workout scenarios; and

• valuation assumptions used in determining the expected

recovery strategies.

ECL model adjustments
Adjustments are made to models to address known model and 
data limitations, and emerging or non-modelled risks. The current 
economic environment, characterised by elevated cost of living 
pressures on borrowers and high inflation, has increased the 
uncertainty of credit losses. As a result, the amount and timing of 
adjustments recognised in the model to account for the impacts 
of the current economic environment are highly judgemental and 
inherently uncertain. These adjustments require specialist auditor 
judgement when evaluating the:
• completeness of adjustments; and
• methodology, models and inputs used in determining the

relevant adjustments.

Where impairment models do not incorporate all factors relevant 
to estimating the ECL, adjustments are made to address known 
model limitations and data limitations, emerging or non-
modelled risks and the impact of economic uncertainty on 
different industry sectors. The measurement of judgements 
around model adjustments to evaluate the completeness of 
adjustments, methodology and model inputs for these 
adjustments is highly judgemental and inherently uncertain. 

This key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee’s report 
on page 98.

•

In respect of the adjustment to models, we performed the
following procedures in conjunction with our specialists:
– Tested the controls over the valuation of in-model and

post-model adjustments;

– Evaluated the methodology, approach and assumptions in
developing the adjustments, and evaluated the Group’s
selection of approach;

– Tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in

formulating the judgements;

– Performed a recalculation of adjustments;
– Evaluated the completeness of adjustments based on our

understanding of both model and data limitations,
including those related to cost of living and high inflation
pressures; and

– Assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures and
whether the disclosures appropriately address the
uncertainty which exists in determining the ECL.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
We are satisfied that the ECL provisions are reasonable and recognised in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Appropriate 
methodologies using reasonable modelled assumptions were used in the calculations of the multiple economic scenarios, 
collectively assessed and in-model adjustments and post-model adjustments where they address model shortcomings. Overall ECL 
levels are reasonable compared to peer benchmarking information.

Regulatory and litigation matters (Group) 

Key audit matter description

How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter

Refer to notes 2 and 38 in the financial statements.
The Group operates in an environment where it is subject to 
regulatory investigations, litigation and customer remediation, 
including allegations of fraud and misconduct. The Group is 
currently exposed to a number of regulatory and litigation 
matters. The Group’s provision for these matters is £1.1 billion as at 
31 December 2023. In the current year, the Group recognised  
a provision of £450 million relating to motor finance commission 
arrangements.

Significant judgement is required by the Group in determining 
whether, under IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets’:
•

the amount recorded is representative of the Group’s best
estimate to settle the obligation based on the information
available to the Group, including in respect of motor finance
commission arrangements where there is significant
uncertainty around the final outcome of the on-going review by
the FCA; and

• any contingent liabilities and underlying significant estimation

uncertainties are adequately disclosed.

This key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee’s report 
on page 99.

We performed the following audit procedures: 
• Tested the Group’s controls over the completeness of

provisions, the review of the assessment of the provision
against the requirements of IAS 37, the review of the
appropriateness of judgements used to determine a ‘best
estimate’ and the completeness and accuracy of data used in
the process;

• Evaluated the assessment of the provisions, associated

•

probabilities, and potential outcomes in accordance with
IAS 37;
In respect of motor finance commission arrangements, we
inspected information available for the historical complaints,
both supportive and contradictory, and the limited number of
decisions made by the Financial Ombudsman Service. We
tested the methodology and assumptions applied to
determine the provision;

• Verified and evaluated whether the methodology, data and

significant judgements and assumptions used in the valuation
of the provisions are appropriate in the context of the
applicable financial reporting framework;Inspected
correspondence and, where appropriate, made direct inquiry
with the Group’s regulators and internal and external legal
counsel;

• Where no provision was made, we critically evaluated the

conclusion in the context of the requirements of IAS 37; and

• Evaluated whether the disclosures made in the financial

statements appropriately reflect the facts and key sources of
estimation uncertainty, including in respect of motor finance
commission arrangements.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
While there is significant judgement required in estimating the timing and value of future settlements, we are satisfied that the approach to the 
recognition, estimation and disclosures of these provisions and contingent liabilities is consistent with the requirements of IFRS.

IT systems that impact financial reporting (Group and Parent company) 

Key audit matter description

How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter

The Group’s IT environment is inherently complex due to the 
number of systems it operates and its reliance on automated and 
IT dependent manual controls. Together, these support a broad 
range of banking and insurance products as well as the 
processing of the Group’s significant volume of transactions, 
which impact all account balances. 

As such, IT systems within the Group form a critical component  
of the Group’s financial reporting activities. Due to the significant 
reliance on IT systems, effective General IT Controls (‘GITCs’) are 
critical to allow reliance to be placed on the completeness and 
accuracy of financial data and the integrity of automated system 
functionality, such as system calculations. 

We identified the IT systems that impact financial reporting as a 
key audit matter because of the:
• Pervasive reliance on complex technology that is integral to the
operation of key business processes and financial reporting;

• Reliance on technology which continues to develop in line

•

with the business strategy, such as the increase in the use of
automation across the Group and increasing reliance on third
parties; and
Importance of the IT controls in maintaining an effective control
environment. A key interdependency exists between the ability
to rely on IT controls and the ability to rely on financial data,
system configured automated controls and system reports.

IT controls, in the context of our audit scope, primarily relate to 
privileged access at the infrastructure level, user access security 
at the application level and change control. 

IT systems which impact financial reporting are discussed in the 
Audit Committee report on page 99.

Our IT audit scope covered the Group’s IT controls over 
information systems deemed relevant to the audit based on the 
financial data, system configured automated controls and/or key 
financial reports that reside within it. 

We used IT specialists to support our evaluation of the risks 
associated with IT in the following areas: 
• General IT Controls, including user access and change

management controls;

• Key financial reports and system configured automated

controls; and

• Cyber security risk assessment.

Where deficiencies in the IT control environment were identified, 
our risk assessment procedures included an assessment of those 
deficiencies to determine the impact on our audit plan. Where 
relevant, the audit plan was adjusted to mitigate the 
unaddressed IT risk. 

Where we were able to identify and test appropriate mitigating 
controls over affected financial statement line items, our testing 
approach remained unchanged. 

In a limited number of areas, we adopted a non-controls reliance 
approach and we therefore performed additional substantive 
procedures.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
We are satisfied that the Group’s overall IT control environment appropriately supports the financial reporting process and control 
deficiencies identified in respect of privileged user access to IT infrastructure and in application user access management were 
mitigated by compensating business controls.

Defined benefit obligations (Group) 

Key audit matter description

How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter

Refer to notes 2 and 16 in the financial statements 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit retirement schemes, 
the obligations for which totalled £30.2 billion as at 31 December 2023. 
Their valuation is determined with reference to key actuarial 
assumptions including mortality assumptions, discount rates and 
inflation rates. Due to the size of these schemes, small changes in 
these assumptions can have a material impact on the value of the 
defined benefit obligation and therefore, the determination of these 
assumptions require significant auditor judgement.

We performed the following audit procedures:
• Tested the Group’s controls over the valuation of the defined
benefit obligations, including controls over the assumptions
setting process; and

• Challenged the key actuarial assumptions used by comparing
these against ranges and expectations determined by our
internal actuarial experts, which are calculated with reference
to the central assumptions adopted by the actuarial firms for
whom we have reviewed and accepted their methodologies.

This key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee’s report 
on page 99.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
We are satisfied that the Group’s judgements in relation to the defined benefit obligations are reasonable.

Valuation of certain complex and illiquid financial instruments held at fair value (Group) 

Key audit matter description

How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter

Refer to notes 2, 20, 21 and 52 in the financial statements
Financial instruments are classified as level 1, 2 or 3 in accordance 
with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’. 

We tested the controls over the valuation of financial instruments, 
including controls over assumptions used in the valuation of 
these financial assets, and model review controls. 

i

S

r
a

The fair value of complex and illiquid financial instruments 
involves significant judgement. The extent of judgement applied 
by the Group in valuing the Group’s financial investments varies 
with the nature of assets held, the markets in which they are 
traded, and the valuation methodology applied.

We utilised our valuation specialists in our audit of the valuation 
of the level 3 portfolio loans and we performed the following 
procedures:
• Evaluated the appropriateness of loan valuation

methodologies;

The Group holds several portfolios of level 3 illiquid investments 
totalling £7.9 billion, the largest of which is held within the 
Insurance, Pensions and Investments division, and includes 
loans in the commercial real estate, social housing, infrastructure, 
and education sectors. The valuation of these loans uses complex 
valuation models as they are without readily determinable 
market values and were valued using significant unobservable 
inputs, such as loan-to-bond premium and calibration spread 
that involved considerable judgement by management.

We also consider these judgements to be at risk of management 
bias.

This key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee’s report 
on page 99.

• Calculated a range of comparable values for a sample of

modelled illiquid financial instruments using an independent
valuation model and considered reasonable alternative key
assumptions based on comparable securities and compared
results;

• Evaluated the appropriateness of the internal credit ratings

methodology and tested the appropriateness of the ratings for
a sample of credit files;

• Evaluated the consistency and appropriateness of inputs and

assumptions over time, challenging both significant
movements and non-movements where we expected change;
and

• Assessed the appropriateness of disclosures and sensitivity

analysis.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
We are satisfied that the valuation of these certain complex and illiquid financial instruments is reasonable and in accordance with 
IFRS 13.

First time adoption of IFRS 17 (Group) 

Key audit matter description

How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter

We performed the following audit procedures:
•  Tested the controls over the accounting methodologies applied 
in the new IFRS 17 calculation models, CSM and the estimated 
fulfilment of cash flows; 

•  Evaluated the appropriateness of key technical accounting 
decisions, judgements, assumptions and elections made in 
determining the impacts to assess compliance with the 
requirements of the standard; 

•  Involved our internal actuarial specialists in performing 

procedures to assess the Group’s implementation of the 
defined methodology and IFRS 17 calculation models, including 
those related to the estimate of the fulfilment cash flows and 
CSM; under both the full retrospective and fair value 
approaches, as applicable; 

•  Tested the completeness and accuracy of the incremental 
data and other information required for IFRS 17 calculations, 
including the attribution of cash flows and modelled results to 
the appropriate CSM calculation groups; and

•  Evaluated the new ongoing disclosures and the disclosures 

related to the transition impact and reconciled the disclosures 
to underlying accounting records and supporting data.

Refer to notes 1, 2, 30, 36 and 54 in the financial statements
IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ became effective from 1 January 
2023, replacing IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’. The new standard 
establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, 
presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts which are 
significantly different to those required under IFRS 4. 

As a result, comparative financial information has been restated 
from 1 January 2022, with the first time adoption of IFRS 17 resulting 
in a decrease in reserves by £1.9 billion upon transition. 

Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are categorised into groups 
with similar measurement characteristics and valued at a 
risk-adjusted present value of estimated future cash flows plus or 
minus an amount representing unearned profits. Unearned profits 
are recognised over the period of the insurance contract unless a 
group of contracts are loss-making, in which case losses would 
have to be recognised immediately. 

In accordance with the transition arrangements allowed under 
IFRS 17, from 1 January 2022 LBG adopted a fair value approach  
to certain groups of contracts, as it was determined to be 
impracticable to apply the standard on a fully retrospective basis. 
All other contracts were remeasured and recognised on a fully 
retrospective basis. 

This required a significant level of judgement in the interpretation 
and determination of accounting policies and methodologies to 
be applied to the IFRS 17 calculation models, primarily related to 
the estimate of the fulfilment cash flows and contractual service 
margin (‘CSM’); under both the full retrospective and fair value 
approaches. Determining the first time adoption of these 
judgements is inherently judgemental and complex, requiring 
significant auditor effort. 

Implementation of IFRS 17 has also required incremental data to 
be used within the new models and new disclosure requirements 
both on transition and on an ongoing basis.

This key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee’s report 
on page 100.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
We are satisfied that the Group’s insurance contracts are appropriately recognised under IFRS 17.

6. Our application of materiality
6.1 Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

i

S
t
r
a
t
e
g
c
r
e
p
o
r
t

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Materiality

£344 million (2022: £318 million)

£344 million (2022: £318 million)

Group financial statements

Parent company financial statements

Basis for determining 
materiality

Rationale for the 
benchmark applied

In determining our benchmark for materiality, we have 
considered the metrics used by investors and other 
users of the financial statements. We have determined 
the following benchmarks to be the most relevant to 
users of the financial statements:
•  Pre-tax profit, adjusted for non-recurring items; 

and 

•  Net assets

The determined materiality represents 5 per cent of 
adjusted pre-tax profit and 0.7 per cent of net assets.

Given the importance of these measures to investors 
and users of the financial statements, we have used 
pre-tax profits, adjusted for non-recurring items, as the 
primary benchmark for our determination of 
materiality, and net assets as a supporting benchmark. 

Component materiality allocated across both 
components range between £228 million and 
£132 million. In 2022, the range of component 
materialities was between £172 million and £115 million. 

Parent company materiality represents 0.7 per cent of 
net assets and is capped at Group materiality. 

The Parent company holds the Group’s investments and 
is not profit driven. The balance sheet is the key measure 
of financial health that is important to shareholders since 
the primary concern for the Parent company is the 
receipt and payment of dividends. However, given the 
size of the entity’s balance sheet, we have capped 
materiality at Group’s materiality. 

6.2 Performance materiality
We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 

Performance 
materiality

Basis and rationale 
for determining 
performance 
materiality

Group financial statements

Parent company financial statements

70 per cent of Group materiality at £240 million
(2022: 70 per cent at £191 million)

70 per cent of Parent company materiality at £240 million
(2022: 70 per cent at £191 million)

In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors: 
a. The quality of the control environment and whether we were able to rely on controls; 
b. Degree of centralisation and commonality of controls and processes;
c.  The uncertain economic environment;
d. The nature, volume and size of uncorrected misstatements arising in the previous audit; and
e.  The nature, volume and size of uncorrected misstatements that remain uncorrected in the current period. 

6.3 Error reporting threshold
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £17 million (2022: 
£16 million), as well as any differences below this threshold, which in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also 
report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.

7. Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other than the financial 
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information 
contained within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.

We have nothing to 
report in this regard.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in course of the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact.

To the Members of Lloyds Banking Group plc

We summarise below our work in relation to areas of the other information including those areas upon which we are specifically 
required to report:

Matters we are specifically required to report

Our responsibility

Our report

As set out in the section ‘Corporate governance 
statement’, we have nothing material to report, 
add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.

As set out in the section ‘Opinions on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies Act 2006’, in our 
opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited has been prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.

As set out in the section ‘Opinions on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies Act 2006’, in our 
opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit, the information in these reports is 
consistent with the audited financial statements and 
has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements.

As referenced on page 200, we have provided limited 
assurance in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) 
and ISAE 3410 over selected metrics.

In our opinion:
•  the use, calculation and disclosure of APMs is 

consistent with the Group’s published definitions 
and policies;

•  the use of APMs in the Group’s reporting results is 
consistent with the guidelines produced by ESMA 
and FRC; and

•  there is an appropriate balance between the use 
of statutory metrics and APMs, together with clear 
definitions and reconciliation for APMs used in 
financial reporting.

Principal risks and 
viability statement

Directors’ 
remuneration report

Review the confirmation and description in the light 
of the knowledge gathered during the audit, such  
as through considering the directors’ processes to 
support the statements made, challenging the 
Group’s key judgements and estimates, 
consideration of historical forecasting accuracy  
and evaluating macro-economic assumptions.

Consider if the statements are aligned with the 
relevant provisions of the Code.

Report whether the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited is properly 
prepared and the disclosures specified by the 
Companies Act have been made.

Strategic report and 
directors’ report

Report whether they are consistent with the audited 
financial statements and are prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Report if we have identified any material 
misstatements in either report in the light of the 
knowledge and understanding of the Group and of 
the Parent company and their environment obtained 
in the course of the audit.

Other reporting on other information

Alternative  
Performance  
Measures
(‘APMs’)

APMs are measures that are not defined by generally 
accepted accounting practice (‘GAAP’) and therefore 
are not typically included in the financial statement 
part of the Annual Report. The Group use APMs, 
such as adjusted profit, and banking net interest 
margin in its quarterly and annual reporting of 
financial performance.

We have reviewed and assessed the Group’s 
calculation and reporting of these metrics to assess 
consistency with the Group’s published definitions 
and policies for these items.

We have also considered and assessed whether  
the use of APMs in the Group’s reporting results is 
consistent with the guidelines produced by 
regulators such as the European Securities and 
Markets Authority (‘ESMA’) guidelines on the use of 
APMs and the FRC Alternative Performance Measures 
Thematic Review.

We also considered whether there was an 
appropriate balance between the use of statutory 
metrics and APMs, in addition to whether clear 
definitions and reconciliation for APMs used in 
financial reporting have been provided.

Dividends and 
distribution policy

Consider whether the dividends policy is transparent 
and the dividends paid are consistent with the policy.

In our opinion the dividends paid are consistent with  
the policy.

8. Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

9. Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is  
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities 

. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

10. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with 
our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to 
which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. 

Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities
In identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including
fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:
•  the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the Group’s 

remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;

•  the Group’s own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error that was discussed  

by the Audit Committee on 20 February 2024;

•  enquiring of management, in-house legal counsel, internal audit and the Audit Committee, including obtaining and reviewing 

supporting documentation, concerning the Group’s policies and procedures relating to:
– 

identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances  
of non-compliance;

–  detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and
–  the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or noncompliance with laws and regulations;

•  discussing among the engagement team including significant component audit teams and involving relevant internal specialists, 
including tax, valuations, pensions, credit modelling, actuarial, IT and industry specialists regarding how and where fraud might 
occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud; and

•  obtaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, focusing on those laws and 

regulations that had a direct effect on the financial statements, such as provisions of the UK Companies Act, pensions legislation 
and tax legislation or that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the Group, including regulation and supervisory 
requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Reporting Council and Financial Conduct Authority.

Audit response to risks identified
As a result of performing the above, we identified the Group’s determination of ‘Expected credit losses’ as key audit matters related to 
the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matter in more detail and also describes the specific 
procedures in response to those key audit matters. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific 
procedures to respond to the risk of management override.

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:
•  reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of 

relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;

•  enquiring of management, the Audit Committee and in-house and external legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation 

and claims;

•  performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material 

misstatement due to fraud;

•  reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and correspondence with 

regulators; and

•  in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and 

other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; 
and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including 
specialists, and component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations 
throughout the audit.

Independent auditors’ report continued
To the Members of Lloyds Banking Group plc

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

11. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
•  The information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 

are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

•  The strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the Parent company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

12. Corporate Governance Statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of 
the corporate governance statement relating to the Group’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
•  Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 
Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit: 

•  the directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 

uncertainties identified set out on page 45;

•  the directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the Group’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period 

is appropriate is set out on page 45;

•  the directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 136;
•  the Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 136;
•  the section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems 

set out on page 99; and

•  the section describing the work of the Audit Committee set out on pages 97 to 100.

13. Matters on which we are required to report by exception

Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
The Parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing 
to report in respect 
of these matters.

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures 
of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing 
to report in respect 
of these matters.

14. Other matters which we are required to address
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by shareholders at its annual general meeting on 
18 May 2023 to audit the financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2023 and subsequent 
financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement of the firm is accordingly three years.

Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit Committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee we are required to provide in accordance with  
ISAs (UK).

15. Use of our report 
This report is made solely to the Parent company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Parent company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Parent company and the Parent company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

As required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.1.15R – DTR 4.1.18R, these 
financial statements will form part of the Electronic Format Annual Financial Report filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the 
FCA in accordance with DTR 4.1.15R – DTR 4.1.18R. This auditors’ report provides no assurance over whether the Electronic Format Annual 
Financial Report has been prepared in compliance with DTR 4.1.15R – DTR 4.1.18R.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December

Note 1: Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (the Group) have been prepared in 
accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment 
properties, insurance and reinsurance contract assets and liabilities measured at their fulfilment values in accordance with IFRS 17, 
financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, trading securities and certain other financial assets and 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts. The directors consider that it is appropriate to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. In reaching this assessment, the directors have considered the 
impact of climate change upon the Group’s performance and projected funding and capital position. The directors have also taken 
into account the results from stress testing scenarios.

Except for accounting policies and methods of computation affected by IFRS 17 and the IAS 12 exception relating to the recognition and 
disclosure of the implication of certain potential deferred tax consequences, the Group’s accounting policies are consistent with those 
applied by the Group in its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 and there have been no changes in the Group’s 
methods of computation. Following amendments to IAS 12 by the IASB (International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules, issued in May 
2023) entities are not permitted to disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the Organisation for 
Economic, Co-operation and Development’s Pillar Two Model Rules, including any qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes. No 
changes arise to the Group’s deferred tax assets or liabilities as a result of the Group having applied the relevant exception.

Presentational changes
Changes have been made to the presentation of the Group’s income statement and the Group’s balance sheet arising from the 
adoption of IFRS 17. In addition to the impact of IFRS 17, the following changes have been made to the presentation of the Group’s 
income statement and balance sheet to provide a more relevant analysis of the Group’s financial performance and financial position:
• Movement in third party interests in consolidated funds are presented separately on the face of the income statement rather than 

•

•

within interest expense. There is no change to the balance sheet presentation of the third party interests
Items in the course of collection from banks are reported within other assets rather than separately on the face of the balance 
sheet
Investments in joint ventures and associates are reported within other assets rather than separately on the face of the balance 
sheet

• Goodwill and other intangible assets are aggregated on the face of the balance sheet
•

Items in the course of transmission to banks are reported within other liabilities rather than separately on the face of the balance 
sheet

Except for the impact of IFRS 17, there has been no change in the basis of accounting for any of the underlying transactions. 
Comparatives for 2022 have been restated for the impact of IFRS 17. Comparatives for 2022 and 2021 have been restated for all other 
changes.

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
On 1 January 2023, the Group adopted IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, which replaced IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. A summary of the impact 
is set out below.

IFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, including 
reinsurance contracts issued, participating investment contracts and reinsurance contracts held.

The Group’s change in accounting policies arising from the adoption of IFRS 17 has been made in accordance with the transitional 
provisions of the standard. IFRS 17 requires a full retrospective approach unless it is impracticable to do so. Under the full retrospective 
approach, transition impacts are calculated as if IFRS 17 had always applied and it prohibits the use of hindsight. This requires having 
full and granular data on assumptions and cash flows so that, at the point of contract recognition, the IFRS 17 contract value and 
contractual service margin (CSM) can be calculated and revalued up to the point of transition. If it is impracticable to apply IFRS 17 
retrospectively, a choice is permitted between a modified retrospective approach, provided qualifying conditions are met, or a fair 
value approach. The different approaches can be applied to different groups of insurance contracts.

On transition, the Group used the full retrospective approach for business written since 1 January 2016 using Solvency II modelling tools 
developed when Solvency II was implemented, which are only available to support the calculation of IFRS 17 results from that date. The 
full retrospective approach was deemed impracticable for contracts initially recognised prior to 1 January 2016 as the models required 
to calculate the risk adjustment were not in use within the business prior to this date. The Group opted to use the fair value approach 
for business initially recognised prior to 2016, and valuations supporting Solvency II at the transition date were used to support the fair 
value calculation for transition for that business.

Changes have also been made to the Group’s cash flow statement arising from the adoption of IFRS 17. As noted below, IFRS 17 has 
required several measurement changes to the balance sheet including the derecognition of the value of in-force (VIF) asset, the 
measurement of contract liabilities on a probability-weighted basis and the creation of a CSM liability. These changes, together with 
the presentation of the change in insurance contract liabilities within the change in operating liabilities, have resulted in a restatement 
of the adjustment for changes in both operating assets and liabilities as well as non-cash and other items. Cash and cash equivalents 
at 31 December 2022 were not impacted by the adoption of IFRS 17.

On transition to IFRS 17, the Group’s total equity at 1 January 2022 was reduced by £1,935 million from £53,152 million under IFRS 4 to 
£51,217 million under IFRS 17. The reduction in equity is primarily driven by the derecognition of the VIF asset (£5,317 million), the move to a 
probability-weighted estimate (expected value) of contract liabilities (£5,915 million), the creation of the new CSM liability (£1,927 million, 
net of reinsurance) and the establishment of the risk adjustment (£1,492 million, net of reinsurance).

Note 1: Basis of preparation continued
The CSM at the transition date is released to the income statement in future periods as insurance contract services are provided. The 
table below summarises the approach the Group has applied to groups of insurance contracts at the transition date and the resulting 
CSM.

The fair value element of the CSM was determined as the difference between the fair value of a group of contracts and the fulfilment cash flows at 1 January 2022. Fair 
value was determined using an economic value creation model which relied on a number of judgements, assumptions and non-observable inputs including: the market 
participant in the transaction shared the same characteristics as the Group, the best estimate assumptions were aligned to those used by the Group in its 1 January 2022 
regulatory calculations and the required capital in the model was based on the capital requirement, plus the additional internal capital buffer, at that date. The model 
considered the expected profit arising in each future period as the value of the realistic cash flow less the release of required capital. The stream of profits derived was 
then discounted at a required rate of return. The Group has applied the simplification permitting contracts in different annual cohorts to be grouped together into a 
single group for measurement purposes.

In addition to the impact of £1,935 million at 1 January 2022, at 31 December 2022, total equity is also impacted by the restatement of the 
income statement for the year ended 31 December 2022, resulting in a further reduction of £1,632 million in retained profits. This arose 
from the impact of revised income recognition requirements, changes in interest rates during 2022 and the effect of contract 
modifications. There is a further reduction in total equity of £43 million in respect of the foreign currency translation reserve and the 
reclassification of treasury shares on transition to IFRS 17. Total equity at 31 December 2022 reduced by £3,610 million, from £47,521 million 
under IFRS 4 to £43,911 million under IFRS 17.

Whilst IFRS 17 does not change the total profit recognised over the life of an insurance contract or participating investment contract, it 
does change both the phasing of profit recognition and the amounts recognised within individual income statement line items, 
including other income and operating expenses. Under IFRS 17, the Group is required to defer substantially all of the expected profit 
through the recognition of a CSM on the balance sheet; the CSM is subsequently released to the income statement over the coverage 
period of the product. The expected profit includes estimated future premiums and claims together with expected administration costs 
such as claims handling costs, costs incurred to provide contractual policyholder benefits and policy administration and maintenance 
costs.

The impact of IFRS 17 on the Group’s results for the year ended 31 December 2022 was to reduce profit before tax by £2,146 million and 
reduce profit after tax by £1,632 million compared to results reported under IFRS 4.

Future accounting developments
The IASB has issued a number of minor amendments to IFRSs effective 1 January 2024, including IFRS 16 Lease Liability in a Sale and 
Leaseback, IAS 1 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants, and IAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current. These 
amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group and have been endorsed for use in the UK.

Note 2: Accounting policies
The Group’s accounting policies are set out below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently.

(A)  Consolidation
The assets, liabilities and results of Group undertakings (including structured entities) are included in the financial statements on the 
basis of accounts made up to the reporting date. Group undertakings include subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. Details of the 
Group’s subsidiaries and related undertakings are given on pages 344 to 356. 

(1)  Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of its 
power. This generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights although in certain circumstances a 
holding of less than one half of the voting rights may still result in the ability of the Group to exercise control. The existence and effect of 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another 
entity. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there have been changes to 
any of the above elements. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group; they are de-
consolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group consolidates collective investment vehicles if its beneficial ownership interests give it substantive rights to remove the 
external fund manager of the investment activities of the fund. Where a subsidiary of the Group is the fund manager of a collective 
investment vehicle, the Group considers a number of factors in determining whether it acts as principal, and therefore controls the 
collective investment vehicle, including: an assessment of the scope of the Group’s decision making authority over the investment 
vehicle; the rights held by other parties including substantive removal rights without cause over the Group acting as fund manager; the 
remuneration to which the Group is entitled in its capacity as decision-maker; and the Group’s exposure to variable returns from the 
beneficial interest that it holds in the investment vehicle. Consolidation may be appropriate in circumstances where the Group has less 
than a majority beneficial interest. Where a collective investment vehicle is consolidated the interests of parties other than the Group 
are reported in other liabilities and the movement in those interests in movement in third party interests in consolidated funds.

Structured entities are entities that are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights. In assessing whether 
the Group has power over such entities in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the 
entity; its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity; the nature of the relationship with the entity; and the size of its 
exposure to the variability of returns of the entity.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 2: Accounting policies continued
The treatment of transactions with non-controlling interests depends on whether, as a result of the transaction, the Group loses control 
of the subsidiary. Changes in the parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as 
equity transactions; any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent entity. Where the Group loses 
control of the subsidiary, at the date when control is lost the amount of any non-controlling interest in that former subsidiary is 
derecognised and any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value; the gain or loss that is recognised in 
profit or loss on the partial disposal of the subsidiary includes the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the retained interest.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. The consideration for the acquisition 
of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The 
consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related 
costs are expensed as incurred except those relating to the issuance of debt instruments (see (E)(4) below) or share capital (see (Q) 
below). Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the 
acquisition date.

(2)  Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are joint arrangements over which the Group has joint control with other parties and has rights to the net assets of the 
arrangements. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement and only exists when decisions about the 
relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Associates are entities over which the Group has 
significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity, but is 
not control or joint control of those policies, and is generally achieved through holding between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the 
voting share capital of the entity.

The Group utilises the venture capital exemption for investments where significant influence or joint control is present and the business 
unit operates as a venture capital business. These investments are designated on initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. 
Otherwise, the Group’s investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

(B)  Goodwill
Goodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Where the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity is greater than the cost of acquisition, the excess is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.

Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is tested at least annually for impairment. For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to the cash-generating unit (CGU) or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination. The Group’s CGUs 
are largely product based for its Retail and Insurance businesses and client based for its Commercial Banking business. An impairment 
loss is recognised if the carrying amount of a CGU is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of 
a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If an impairment is identified the carrying value of the goodwill 
is written down immediately through the income statement and this is not subsequently reversed. At the date of disposal of a 
subsidiary, the carrying value of attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.

(C)  Other intangible assets
Intangible assets which have been determined to have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful life as follows: up to seven years for capitalised software; 10 to 15 years for brands and other intangible assets.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that they are 
impaired. If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and in the event that the asset’s carrying 
amount is greater than its recoverable amount, it is written down immediately. Certain brands have been determined to have an 
indefinite useful life and are not amortised. Such intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether the asset is impaired 
and to reconfirm that an indefinite useful life remains appropriate. In the event that an indefinite life is inappropriate, a finite life is 
determined and a further impairment review is performed on the asset.

(D)  Revenue recognition
(1)  Net interest income
Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method for all interest-bearing 
financial instruments, except for those classified at fair value through profit or loss. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the 
expected life of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash 
payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (before 
adjusting for expected credit losses) or to the amortised cost of the financial liability, including early redemption fees, other fees, and 
premiums and discounts that are an integral part of the overall return. In the case of financial assets that are purchased or originated 
credit-impaired, the effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows to the amortised cost of the 
instrument. Direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument are also taken into 
account. Interest income from non-credit-impaired financial assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross 
carrying amount of the asset; for credit-impaired financial assets, the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount after 
deducting the allowance for expected credit losses. Impairment policies are set out in (H) below.

(2)  Fee and commission income and expense
Fees and commissions receivable which are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are recognised as income as the Group 
fulfils its performance obligations. The Group’s principal performance obligations arising from contracts with customers are in respect 
of value added current accounts, credit cards and debit cards. These fees are received, and the Group provides the service, monthly; 
the fees are recognised in income on this basis. The Group also receives certain fees in respect of its asset finance business where the 
performance obligations are typically fulfilled towards the end of the customer contract; these fees are recognised in income on this 
basis. Where it is unlikely that the loan commitments will be drawn, loan commitment fees are recognised in fee and commission 
income over the life of the facility, rather than as an adjustment to the effective interest rate for the lending expected to be drawn. 
Incremental costs incurred to generate fee and commission income are charged to fee and commission expense as they are incurred.

(3)  Other
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

Revenue recognition policies specific to trading income are set out in (E)(3) below; those relating to life insurance and general 
insurance business are detailed below (see (M) and (N) below); and those relating to leases are set out in (J)(1) below.

(E)  Financial assets and liabilities
On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or 
fair value through profit or loss, depending on the Group’s business model for managing those financial assets and whether the 
resultant cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. The Group assesses its business models at a portfolio level 
based on its objectives for the relevant portfolio, how the performance of the portfolio is managed and reported, and the frequency of 
asset sales. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when considering their cash flow 
characteristics. The Group reclassifies financial assets only when its business model for managing those assets changes. A 
reclassification will only take place when the change is significant to the Group’s operations and will occur at a portfolio level and not 
for individual instruments; reclassifications are expected to be rare. Equity investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss 
unless the Group elects at initial recognition to account for the instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. For 
these instruments, principally strategic investments, dividends are recognised in profit or loss but fair value gains and losses are not 
subsequently reclassified to profit or loss following derecognition of the investment.

The Group initially recognises loans and advances, deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of securities and other financial 
assets and trading liabilities are recognised on trade date, being the date that the Group is committed to purchase or sell an asset.

Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when the Group 
has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either: substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred; or the Group has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards, but has 
transferred control.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.

(1)  Financial instruments measured at amortised cost
Financial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and 
interest are measured at amortised cost. A basic lending arrangement results in contractual cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Where the contractual cash flows introduce exposure to risks or volatility 
unrelated to a basic lending arrangement such as changes in equity prices or commodity prices, the payments do not comprise solely 
principal and interest. Financial assets measured at amortised cost are predominantly loans and advances to customers and banks, 
reverse repurchase agreements and certain debt securities used by the Group to manage its liquidity. Loans and advances and 
reverse repurchase agreements are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrower at fair value inclusive of transaction 
costs. Interest income is accounted for using the effective interest method (see (D) above).

Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading liabilities and other financial liabilities designated at fair value 
through profit or loss on initial recognition which are held at fair value.

Where changes are made to the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability that are economically equivalent and 
arise as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform, the Group updates the effective interest rate and does not recognise 
an immediate gain or loss.

(2)  Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Financial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows and for subsequent sale, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely 
payments of principal and interest, are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs. Interest 
calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on assets denominated in foreign currencies 
are recognised in the income statement. All other gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold or matures, at which time, other than in respect of equity shares, the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement. The cumulative 
revaluation amount in respect of equity shares is transferred directly to retained profits. The Group recognises a charge for expected 
credit losses in the income statement (see (H) below). As the asset is measured at fair value, the charge does not adjust the carrying 
value of the asset, and this is reflected in other comprehensive income.

(3)  Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost 
or fair value through other comprehensive income or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss to reduce an 
accounting mismatch. All derivatives are carried at fair value through profit or loss, other than those in effective cash flow and net 
investment hedging relationships. Derivatives are carried on the balance sheet as assets when their fair value is positive and as 
liabilities when their fair value is negative. Refer to note 21(2) (Financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value) 
for details of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.

Derivatives embedded in a financial asset are not considered separately; the financial asset is considered in its entirety when 
determining whether its cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities and 
insurance contracts (unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract) are treated as separate derivatives when their 
economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair 
value through profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the 
income statement.

The assets backing the insurance and investment contracts issued by the Group do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised 
cost or fair value through other comprehensive income as they are managed on a fair value basis and accordingly are measured at 
fair value through profit or loss. Similarly, trading securities, which are debt securities and equity shares acquired principally for the 
purpose of selling in the short term or which are part of a portfolio which is managed for short-term gains, do not meet these criteria 
and are also measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised 
in the balance sheet at their fair value. Fair value gains and losses together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised 
in the income statement within net trading income.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 2: Accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading liabilities or where they are designated at 
fair value through profit or loss in order to reduce an accounting mismatch; where the liabilities are part of a group of liabilities (or 
assets and liabilities) which is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis; or where the liabilities contain one or 
more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows arising under the contract and would otherwise need to be 
separately accounted for. Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the balance sheet at their 
fair value. Fair value gains and losses are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they 
occur, except in the case of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss where gains and losses attributable to 
changes in own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income.

The fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices, respectively, which include 
the expected effects of potential changes to laws and regulations, risks associated with climate change and other factors. If the 
market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques. The fair values of derivative financial instruments 
are adjusted where appropriate to reflect credit risk (via credit valuation adjustments (CVAs), debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) and 
funding valuation adjustments (FVAs)), market liquidity and other risks.

(4)  Borrowings
Borrowings (which include deposits from banks, customer deposits, repurchase agreements, debt securities in issue and subordinated 
liabilities) are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred. These instruments are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Preference shares and other instruments which carry a mandatory coupon or are redeemable on a specific date are classified as 
financial liabilities. The coupon on these instruments is recognised in the income statement as interest expense. Securities which carry 
a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments. Interest payments on 
these securities are recognised as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid. An exchange of financial liabilities on 
substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new 
financial liability. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability is 
recognised in profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.

When a financial liability is exchanged for an equity instrument, the new equity instrument is recognised at fair value and any 
difference between the carrying value of the liability and the fair value of the new equity instrument is recognised in profit or loss.

(5)  Sale and repurchase agreements (including securities lending and borrowing)
Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements (repos) continue to be recognised on the balance sheet where substantially all of 
the risks and rewards are retained. Funds received for repos carried at fair value are included within trading liabilities. Conversely, 
securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos), where the Group does not acquire substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of ownership, are measured at amortised cost or at fair value. Those measured at fair value are recognised within trading 
securities. The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using 
the effective interest method.

Securities borrowing and lending transactions are typically secured; collateral takes the form of securities or cash advanced or 
received. Securities lent to counterparties are retained on the balance sheet. Securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance 
sheet, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability. 
Cash collateral given or received is treated as a loan and advance measured at amortised cost or customer deposit.

(F)  Hedge accounting
As permitted by IFRS 9, the Group continues to apply the requirements of IAS 39 to its hedging relationships. 

Changes in the fair value of all derivative instruments, other than those in effective cash flow and net investment hedging relationships, 
are recognised immediately in the income statement. As noted in (2) and (3) below, the change in fair value of a derivative in an 
effective cash flow or net investment hedging relationship is allocated between the income statement and other comprehensive 
income.

Hedge accounting allows one financial instrument, generally a derivative such as a swap, to be designated as a hedge of another 
financial instrument such as a loan or deposit or a portfolio of such instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, formal 
documentation is drawn up specifying the hedging strategy, the hedged item, the hedging instrument and the methodology that will 
be used to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk. 
The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is tested both at inception and throughout its life and if at any point it is concluded that it 
is no longer highly effective in achieving its documented objective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Note 22 provides details of the 
types of derivatives held by the Group and presents separately those designated in hedge relationships. 

Where there is uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform, the Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark on which 
the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk are based, or the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging 
instrument are based, are not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform. The Group does not discontinue a hedging 
relationship during the period of uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark reform solely because the actual results of the 
hedge are not highly effective.

Where the contractual terms of a financial asset, financial liability or derivative are amended, on an economically equivalent basis, as 
a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform, the uncertainty arising from the reform is no longer present. In these 
circumstances, the Group amends the hedge documentation to reflect the changes required by the reform; these changes to the 
documentation do not in and of themselves result in the discontinuation of hedge accounting or require the designation of a new 
hedge relationship.

(1)  Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, 
together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk; this also applies if the 
hedged asset is classified as a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income. If the hedge no longer meets the 
criteria for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are no longer recognised in 
the income statement. The cumulative adjustment that has been made to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the 
income statement using the effective interest method over the period to maturity.

Note 2: Accounting policies continued
(2)  Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in 
other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which 
the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income 
statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.

(3)  Net investment hedges
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the 
income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of. The hedging instruments used in net investment hedges may include 
non-derivative liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments.

(G)  Offset
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right of 
offset and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Cash collateral on 
exchange traded derivative transactions is presented gross unless the collateral cash flows are always settled net with the derivative 
cash flows. In certain situations, even though master netting agreements exist, the lack of management intention to settle on a net 
basis results in the financial assets and liabilities being reported gross on the balance sheet.

(H)  Impairment of financial assets
The impairment charge in the income statement reflects the change in expected credit losses, including those arising from fraud. 
Expected credit losses are recognised for loans and advances to customers and banks, other financial assets held at amortised cost, 
financial assets (other than equity investments) measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and certain loan 
commitments and financial guarantee contracts. Expected credit losses are calculated as an unbiased and probability-weighted 
estimate using an appropriate probability of default, adjusted to take into account a range of possible future economic scenarios, and 
applying this to the estimated exposure of the Group at the point of default after taking into account the value of any collateral held, 
repayments, or other mitigants of loss and including the impact of discounting using the effective interest rate.

At initial recognition, allowance (or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial guarantees) is made for expected 
credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month expected credit losses). In the event of 
a significant increase in credit risk since origination, allowance (or provision) is made for expected credit losses resulting from all 
possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime expected credit losses). Financial assets where 12-
month expected credit losses are recognised are considered to be Stage 1; financial assets which are considered to have experienced 
a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are in Stage 2; and financial assets which have defaulted or are otherwise 
considered to be credit-impaired are allocated to Stage 3. Some Stage 3 assets, mainly in Commercial Banking, are subject to 
individual rather than collective assessment. Such cases are subject to a risk-based impairment sanctioning process, and these are 
reviewed and updated at least quarterly, or more frequently if there is a significant change in the credit profile. The collective 
assessment of impairment aggregates financial instruments with similar risk characteristics, such as whether the facility is revolving in 
nature or secured and the type of security held against financial assets.

An assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition considers the change in the risk of default 
occurring over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. In determining whether there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk, the Group uses quantitative tests based on relative and absolute probability of default (PD) movements linked to internal 
credit ratings together with qualitative indicators such as watchlists and other indicators of historical delinquency, credit weakness or 
financial difficulty. The use of internal credit ratings and qualitative indicators ensures alignment between the assessment of staging 
and the Group’s management of credit risk which utilises these internal metrics within distinct retail and commercial portfolio risk 
management practices. However, unless identified at an earlier stage, the credit risk of financial assets is deemed to have increased 
significantly when more than 30 days past due. The use of a payment holiday in and of itself has not been judged to indicate a 
significant increase in credit risk, with the underlying long-term credit risk deemed to be driven by economic conditions and captured 
through the use of forward-looking models. These portfolio-level models are capturing the anticipated volume of increased defaults 
and therefore an appropriate assessment of staging and expected credit loss. Where the credit risk subsequently improves such that it 
no longer represents a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the asset is transferred back to Stage 1.

Assets are transferred to Stage 3 when they have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit-impaired. Default is considered to 
have occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing financial difficulty which is likely to affect significantly the 
ability to repay the amount due. IFRS 9 contains a rebuttable presumption that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days 
past due which the Group now uses for all its products following changes to the definition of default for UK mortgages on 1 January 
2022. In addition, other indicators of mortgage default are added including end-of-term payments on past due interest-only accounts 
and loans considered non-performing due to recent arrears or forbearance. The use of payment holidays is not considered to be an 
automatic trigger of regulatory default and therefore does not automatically trigger Stage 3. Days past due will also not accumulate 
on any accounts that have taken a payment holiday including those already past due.

In certain circumstances, the Group will renegotiate the original terms of a customer’s loan, either as part of an ongoing customer 
relationship or in response to adverse changes in the circumstances of the borrower. In the latter circumstances, the loan will remain 
classified as either Stage 2 or Stage 3 until the credit risk has improved such that it no longer represents a significant increase since 
origination (for a return to Stage 1), or the loan is no longer credit-impaired (for a return to Stage 2). On renegotiation the gross carrying 
amount of the loan is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, which are discounted 
at the original effective interest rate. Renegotiation may also lead to the loan and associated allowance being derecognised and a 
new loan being recognised initially at fair value.

Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (POCI) include financial assets that are purchased or originated at a deep 
discount that reflects incurred credit losses. At initial recognition, POCI assets do not carry an impairment allowance; instead, lifetime 
expected credit losses are incorporated into the calculation of the effective interest rate. All changes in lifetime expected credit losses 
subsequent to the assets’ initial recognition are recognised as an impairment charge.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 2: Accounting policies continued
A loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any 
available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income 
statement. For both secured and unsecured retail balances, the write-off takes place only once an extensive set of collections 
processes has been completed, or the status of the account reaches a point where policy dictates that continuing attempts to recover 
are no longer appropriate. For commercial lending, a write-off occurs if the loan facility with the customer is restructured, the asset is 
under administration and the only monies that can be received are the amounts estimated by the administrator, the underlying assets 
are disposed and a decision is made that no further settlement monies will be received, or external evidence (for example, third party 
valuations) is available that there has been an irreversible decline in expected cash flows.

(I)  Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment (other than investment property) is included at cost less accumulated depreciation. The value of land 
(included in premises) is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the 
difference between the cost and the residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows: the shorter of 50 years and the 
remaining period of the lease for freehold/long and short leasehold premises; the shorter of 10 years and, if lease renewal is not likely, 
the remaining period of the lease for leasehold improvements; 10 to 20 years for fixtures and furnishings; and 2 to 8 years for other 
equipment and motor vehicles.

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and, if appropriate, revised at each balance sheet date.

Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. In assessing the recoverable amount of assets the Group considers the effects of potential or actual changes in 
legislation, customer behaviour, climate-related risks and other factors on the asset’s CGU. In the event that an asset’s CGU carrying 
amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount the asset is written down immediately.

Investment property comprises freehold and long leasehold land and buildings that are held either to earn rental income or for capital 
accretion or both, primarily within the life insurance funds. In accordance with the guidance published by the Royal Institution of 
Chartered Surveyors, investment property is carried at fair value based on current prices for similar properties, adjusted for the specific 
characteristics of the property (such as location or condition). If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation 
methods such as discounted cash flow projections or recent prices in less active markets. These valuations are reviewed at least 
annually by independent professionally qualified valuers. Investment property being redeveloped for continuing use as investment 
property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be valued at fair value.

(J)  Leases
Under IFRS 16, a lessor is required to determine whether a lease is a finance or operating lease. A lessee is not required to make this 
determination.

(1)  As lessor
Assets leased to customers are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee but not necessarily legal title. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When assets are subject to 
finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable, 
net of allowances for expected credit losses and residual value impairment, within loans and advances to banks and customers. The 
difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance lease income. 
Finance lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease using the net investment method (before tax) so as to 
give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease. Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed regularly to identify any 
impairment.

Operating lease assets are included within other assets at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The depreciation 
charge is based on the asset’s residual value and the life of the lease. Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the life of the lease.

The Group evaluates non-lease arrangements such as outsourcing and similar contracts to determine if they contain a lease which is 
then accounted for separately.

(2)  As lessee
Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by 
the Group. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease payments are discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Group’s incremental borrowing rate appropriate for 
the right-of-use asset arising from the lease, and the liability recognised within other liabilities.

Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period 
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in 
profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small 
items of office furniture.

(K)  Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, performance-based cash awards and social security costs, are 
recognised over the period in which the employees provide the related services.

(1)  Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees including both defined benefit and defined 
contribution pension plans. A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee 
will receive on retirement, dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of pensionable service and pensionable salary. A 
defined contribution plan is a pension plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions; there is no legal or constructive obligation to 
pay further contributions.

Note 2: Accounting policies continued
(i)  Defined benefit schemes
Scheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit 
method. The defined benefit scheme liabilities are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on 
high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. The Group’s income statement charge includes the current service cost of 
providing pension benefits, past service costs, net interest expense (income), and plan administration costs that are not deducted from 
the return on plan assets. Past service costs, which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment, are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. Net interest 
expense (income) is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.

Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense 
(income) and net of the cost of managing the plan assets), and the effect of changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) are reflected 
immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. 
Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are reflected immediately in retained profits and will not subsequently 
be reclassified to profit or loss.

The Group’s balance sheet includes the net surplus or deficit, being the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the 
discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date. Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable 
through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes. In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, the 
Group considers (i) its current right to obtain a refund or a reduction in future contributions and (ii) the rights of other parties existing at 
the balance sheet date. In determining the rights of third parties existing at the balance sheet date, the Group does not anticipate any 
future acts by other parties.

(ii)  Defined contribution schemes
The costs of the Group’s defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.

(2)  Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its 
employees. The value of the employee services received in exchange for equity instruments granted under these plans is recognised 
as an expense over the vesting period of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in equity. This expense is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest. The fair value of equity instruments granted is 
based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant. In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments at the date 
of grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a Black-Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo 
simulation. The determination of fair values excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, which are included in the 
assumptions used to estimate the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, this estimate is 
reassessed and if necessary revised. Any revision of the original estimate is recognised in the income statement, together with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity. Cancellations by employees of contributions to the Group’s Save As You Earn plans are treated as 
non-vesting conditions and the Group recognises, in the year of cancellation, the amount of the expense that would have otherwise 
been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period. Modifications are assessed at the date of modification and any incremental 
charges are charged to the income statement.

(L)  Taxation
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement except to 
the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different period, outside the income 
statement (either in other comprehensive income, directly in equity, or through a business combination), in which case the tax appears 
in the same statement as the transaction that gave rise to it. The tax consequences of the Group’s dividend payments (including 
distributions on other equity instruments), if any, are charged or credited to the statement in which the profit distributed originally 
arose.

Current tax is the amount of corporate income taxes expected to be payable or recoverable based on the profit for the period as 
adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible, and is calculated using tax rates and laws that were enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.

Current tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions when management expects that, upon examination of the 
uncertainty by His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or other relevant tax authority, it is more likely than not that an economic 
outflow will occur. Provisions reflect management’s best estimate of the ultimate liability based on their interpretation of tax law, 
precedent and guidance, informed by external tax advice as necessary. Changes in facts and circumstances underlying these 
provisions are reassessed at each balance sheet date, and the provisions are remeasured as required to reflect current information.

For the Group’s long-term insurance businesses, the tax expense is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders’ 
returns and tax that is payable on the shareholders’ returns. This allocation is based on an assessment of the rates of tax which will be 
applied to the returns under the current UK tax rules.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
in the balance sheet. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is 
settled.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences but not recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries where the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable 
that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on temporary differences that 
arise from goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised, and are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised in respect of temporary differences that arise on initial recognition of assets and 
liabilities acquired other than in a business combination. Deferred tax is not discounted.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 2: Accounting policies continued
(M) Insurance – IFRS 17
The Group undertakes both life insurance and general insurance business. Insurance and participating investment contracts, and 
reinsurance contracts issued and held, are accounted for under IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.

Products sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories:
•

•

•

Insurance contracts are contracts that transfer significant insurance risk and may also transfer financial risk. The Group defines 
significant insurance risk as the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured event which are significantly 
higher than the benefits payable if the insured event were not to occur. Once a contract has been classified as an insurance 
contract, it remains an insurance contract until all obligations are extinguished unless that contract is derecognised due to a 
contract modification. These contracts are classified as either direct participating contracts or contracts without direct 
participation features. Contracts without direct participation features are accounted for using the general measurement model 
(GMM) for life contracts or the premium allocation approach (PAA) for general insurance contracts. Direct participating contracts 
are contracts for which, at inception, the contractual terms specify the policyholders participate in a clearly identified pool of 
underlying items. Under the terms of these contracts the policyholders are entitled to a substantial share of the returns and change 
in fair value of the underlying items. These contracts are accounted for under the variable fee approach (VFA)
Participating investment contracts are investment contracts that contain a discretionary participation feature (DPF). They do not 
transfer significant insurance risk, but contain a contractual right to receive, as a supplement to an amount not subject to the 
discretion of the Group, additional amounts that are expected to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits. The timing 
or amount of these additional amounts are at the discretion of the Group and are contractually based on the returns on a specified 
pool of contracts or type of contract, returns on a specified pool of assets held by the Group or profit or loss of a fund
For certain insurance and investment contracts, the contract can be partly invested in units which contain a DPF and partly in units 
without. In these circumstances, where the contract also contains features that transfer significant insurance risk, they are classified 
as insurance contracts. Where this is not the case, and the discretionary cash flows are expected to be a significant portion of the 
total contractual benefits, they are classified as participating investment contracts. Where the discretionary cash flows are not 
expected to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits, they are classified as financial instruments. An investment 
component is defined as the amount that an insurance contract requires the entity to repay to a policyholder in all circumstances, 
regardless of whether an insured event occurs. The investment component of the insurance and participating investment contract 
is non-distinct and is not separated. The Group applies judgement to determine the investment component for each contract 
considering the extent to which insurance and investment components are highly interrelated or not applying factors such as: 
whether the policyholder is able to benefit from one component unless the other component is present; and whether the value of 
the investment component is dependent on the timing of the insured event. The value of the non-distinct investment component is 
determined on the following bases: for immediate annuities, full claim amount when within the guaranteed period; for unit-linked 
and With-Profits contracts, policyholder’s account value

The general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.

(1)  Life insurance business
(i)  Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts
Recognition
The Group aggregates insurance and participating investment contracts into portfolios of contracts subject to similar risks and 
managed together. Each portfolio of insurance contracts is divided into annual cohorts (by year of issue). Annual cohorts are divided 
into groups of insurance and participating investment contracts based on profitability expectations at initial recognition. The directly 
attributable costs of selling, underwriting and starting a group of insurance and participating investment contracts are allocated to the 
group of insurance and participating investment contracts using a systematic and rational method.

On initial recognition, a group of insurance and participating investment contracts is measured as the total of the fulfilment cash flows 
and the contractual service margin (CSM). The measurement includes all future cash flows that are within the contract boundary of 
each contract in the group. The fulfilment cash flows comprise unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of future cash flows, 
discounted to present value to reflect the time value of money and financial risks, plus an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk. 
The discount rate applied reflects the time value of money, the characteristics of the cash flows, the liquidity characteristics of the 
insurance and participating investment contracts and, where appropriate, is consistent with observable current market prices. The risk 
adjustment for non-financial risk for a group of insurance and participating investment contracts is the compensation required for 
bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk. Diversification benefit is 
calculated based on Group level diversification of risks. To determine the risk adjustments for non-financial risk for reinsurance 
contracts, the Group applies these techniques both gross and net of excess of loss reinsurance and derives the amount of risk being 
transferred to the reinsurer as the difference between the two results. The CSM of a group of insurance and participating investment 
contracts represents the unearned profit that the Group expects to recognise as it provides insurance contract services under those 
contracts in the future.

Contract boundaries
The measurement of a group of contracts includes all future cash flows within the boundary of each contract in the group.

Cash flows are within the contract boundary: 
•

For an insurance contract, if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the 
Group can compel the policyholder to pay premiums or has a substantive obligation to provide insurance contract services 
For a participating investment contract, if they result from a substantive obligation of the Group to deliver cash at a present or 
future date

•

A substantive obligation to provide insurance contract services ends when the Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of 
the particular policyholder, and can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects those reassessed risks; or the Group has the 
practical ability to reassess the risks of the portfolio that contains the contract and can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects 
the risks of that portfolio, and the pricing of the premiums up to the reassessment date does not take into account risks that relate to 
periods after the reassessment date.

For certain unitised With-Profits and unit-linked policies, a guaranteed minimum pension is payable at a vesting date. For certain 
conventional With-Profits pensions, policyholders have the option to convert to an annuity on guaranteed terms. There is no contract 
boundary at the vesting date of these policies; the pre and post vesting date phases are treated as a single insurance contract.

The contract boundary of each group is reassessed at the end of each reporting period.

Lloyds Banking Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Note 2: Accounting policies continued
Measurement
The carrying amount of a group of insurance and participating investment contracts at each reporting date is the sum of the liability 
for remaining coverage (LRC) and the liability for incurred claims (LIC). The LRC comprises the fulfilment cash flows that relate to 
services that will be provided under the contracts in future periods and any remaining CSM at that date. The LIC includes the fulfilment 
cash flows for incurred claims and expenses that have not yet been paid, including claims that have been incurred but not yet 
reported. The fulfilment cash flows of groups of insurance and participating investment contracts are measured at the reporting date 
using current estimates of future cash flows, current discount rates and current estimates of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk. 
Changes in fulfilment cash flows are recognised as follows:
• Changes related to future service are adjusted against the CSM unless the group is onerous in which case such changes are 

i

t
r
a
t
e
g
c
r
e
p
o
r
t

recognised in the insurance service result in profit or loss

• Changes related to past or current service are recognised in the insurance service result in profit or loss
•

The effects of the time value of money and financial risk are recognised as net finance income or expense from insurance, 
participating investment and reinsurance contracts in profit or loss

The carrying amount of the CSM is remeasured at the end of each reporting period. For contracts measured under the GMM, interest is 
accreted on the carrying amount of the CSM using the discount rate curve determined at the date of initial recognition of the group of 
contracts. The CSM is also adjusted for the changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service at the locked-in discount rates 
determined at initial recognition, unless the increases in fulfilment cash flows cause a group of contracts to become onerous or 
decreases in fulfilment cash flows are allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage.

The majority of the Group’s With-Profits and unit-linked insurance and participating investment contracts are direct participating 
contracts under which the Group’s obligation to the policyholder is the payment of an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying 
items, less a variable fee. On subsequent remeasurement of a group of direct participating contracts (measured under VFA), changes 
to the fulfilment cash flows, discounted at current rates, reflecting changes in the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal 
to the fair value of the underlying items are recognised in the income statement, within net finance income or expense from insurance, 
participating investment and reinsurance contracts. The CSM is adjusted for changes in the amount of the Group’s share of the fair 
value of the underlying items, which relate to future services, except where such changes result in recognition or reversal of the loss 
component for onerous groups, or where the Group applies the risk mitigation option. For certain contracts with direct participation 
features, the Group mitigates financial risks using equity and currency hedges. The Group does not adjust the CSM for changes in the 
fulfilment cash flows and/or entity’s share of the underlying items that reflect some of the changes in the effect of time value of money 
and financial risk. These amounts are instead reflected in profit or loss. The CSM is also adjusted for those fulfilment cashflows that do 
not vary based on the returns on underlying items that relate to future service (including the effect of time value of money and 
financial risks not arising from underlying items, such as the impact of minimum return guarantees), except where such changes result 
in recognition or reversal of the loss component for onerous groups. Changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service adjust 
the CSM using current discount rates.

For contracts measured under the GMM or VFA at the end of each reporting period the appropriate proportion of the CSM is recognised 
in the income statement to reflect the amount of profit related to the insurance contract services provided in the period. This is 
calculated using coverage units, a measure used to determine the allocation of the CSM over the remaining coverage periods. The 
number of coverage units in a group is the quantity of insurance contract services provided by the contracts in the group, determined 
by considering for each contract the quantity of the benefits provided and its expected coverage period.

Derecognition
The Group derecognises an insurance and participating investment contract when it is extinguished (that is, when the obligation 
specified in the contract expires or is discharged or cancelled) or if its terms are modified in a way that would have changed the 
accounting for the contract significantly had the new terms always existed.

If a contract is derecognised, then the fulfilment cash flows of the group are adjusted to eliminate the present value of the future cash 
flows and risk adjustment of the contract derecognised from the group, and the CSM of the group is adjusted for the change in 
fulfilment cash flows, except where such changes are allocated to the loss component.

If a contract is derecognised because its terms are modified, then the CSM of the existing group is also adjusted for the premium that 
would have been charged had the Group entered into a contract with the new contract’s terms at the date of modification, less any 
additional premium charged for the modification. A new modified contract is recognised assuming the Group received the premium 
that would have been charged had the Group entered into a contract with the new contract’s terms at the date of the modification.

Where the adjustments to CSM result in the CSM being reduced to nil, any further adjustments are recognised in the income statement 
in insurance service expense.

(2)  General insurance contracts
General insurance contracts issued by the Group are presented on the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance and 
participating investment contracts. The Group applies the PAA to the measurement of general insurance contracts, which either have a 
coverage period of each contract in the group of one year or less or have an annual re-pricing option. 

For a group of general insurance contracts that is not onerous at initial recognition, the Group measures the LRC as any premium 
received at initial recognition, less any insurance acquisition cash flows at that date, plus any other asset or liability previously 
recognised for cash flows related to the group of contracts that the Group pays or receives before the group of insurance contracts is 
recognised.

The Group estimates the LIC using the methodology described in the Measurement section for life insurance contracts above.

Where, during the coverage period, facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance contracts is onerous, the Group 
recognises a loss in the income statement for the net outflow, resulting in the carrying amount of the liability for the group being equal 
to the fulfilment cash flows. A loss component is established by the Group within the LRC for such onerous group. 

On subsequent measurement, the Group measures the carrying amount of the LRC at the end of each reporting period as the LRC at 
the beginning of the period plus premiums received in the period, less insurance acquisition cash flows, plus any amounts relating to 
the amortisation of the insurance acquisition cash flows recognised as an expense in the reporting period for the group, less the 
amount recognised as insurance revenue for the services provided in the period. For onerous groups, the LRC is also adjusted for the 
remeasurement of the loss component.

(3)  Reinsurance
(i)  Reinsurance contracts issued
Reinsurance contracts issued by the Group (where insurance risk is transferred to the Group) are accounted for under the GMM as 
insurance contracts. These contracts are presented within other assets or liabilities arising from insurance and participating 
investment contracts.

(ii)  Reinsurance contracts held
The classification of contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for amounts payable 
on one or more other contracts issued by the Group is dependent on whether the contract with the reinsurer transfers significant 
insurance risk to the reinsurer. Where the reinsurance contract transfers significant insurance risk (reinsurance contracts held), it is 
accounted for under the GMM, as modified for reinsurance contracts held. The Group adjusts the CSM of the group to which a 
reinsurance contract held belongs and as a result recognises income, when it recognises a loss on initial recognition of onerous 
underlying contracts.

Contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk to the reinsurer are recognised within financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss as they are within a portfolio of financial assets that is managed, and whose performance is evaluated, on a fair value 
basis. These contracts, while legally reinsurance contracts, do not meet the definition of a reinsurance contract under IFRS. Investment 
returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to these contracts are recognised on the face of the 
income statement within net trading income.

(4)  Non-participating investment contracts
The Group’s non-participating investment contracts are primarily unit-linked. These contracts are accounted for under IFRS 9 as 
financial liabilities whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the Group’s unitised investment funds. 
The value of the unit-linked financial liabilities is determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the 
contract holders at the balance sheet date. Their value is never less than the amount payable on surrender, discounted for the 
required notice period where applicable. Investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to 
those contracts are recognised in the income statement through change in non-participating investment contracts.

Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as 
adjustments to the non-participating investment contract liability.

The Group receives investment management fees in the form of an initial adjustment or charge to the amount invested. These fees are 
in respect of services rendered in conjunction with the issue and management of investment contracts where the Group actively 
manages the consideration received from its customers to fund a return that is based on the investment profile that the customer 
selected on origination of the contract. These services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over the lives of the individual 
contracts and, therefore, the Group defers these fees and recognises them over the estimated lives of the contracts, in line with the 
provision of investment management services.

Costs which are directly attributable and incremental to securing new non-participating investment contracts are deferred. This asset 
is subsequently amortised over the period of the provision of investment management services and its recoverability is reviewed in 
circumstances where its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the asset is greater than its recoverable amount it is written down 
immediately through fee and commission expense in the income statement. All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.

(N)  Insurance – IFRS 4
As permitted by IFRS 17, the Group’s income statement for the year ended 31 December 2021 has been prepared under IFRS 4 Insurance 
Contracts. The balance sheets as at 31 December 2023, 31 December 2022 and the opening balance sheet for IFRS 17 transition as at 
1 January 2022 are presented under IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.

Products sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories: insurance contracts, participating investment 
contracts and non-participating investment contracts.

For certain investment contracts, the contract can be partly invested in units which contain a discretionary participation feature (DPF) 
and partly in units without. Where switching levels for similar contracts are deemed to be significant, new investment contracts which 
contain an option to switch into investment contracts with DPF have been classified as participating investment contracts. Where the 
switching levels are not deemed to be significant, a new contract is split, with units containing a DPF being allocated as a participating 
investment contract and the units without a DPF as a non-participating investment contract. 

The general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.

(1)  Life insurance business
(i)  Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts
Premiums and claims
Premiums received in respect of insurance and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue when due except for 
unit-linked contracts on which premiums are recognised as revenue when received. Claims are recorded as an expense on the earlier 
of the maturity date or the date on which the claim is notified.

Liabilities
Changes in the value of liabilities are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims and changes in insurance and 
investment contract liabilities.
•

Insurance and participating investment contracts in the Group’s with-profit funds: liabilities of the Group’s with-profit funds, including 
guarantees and options embedded within products written by these funds, are stated at their realistic values in accordance with 
the Prudential Regulation Authority’s realistic capital regime, except that projected transfers out of the funds into other Group funds 
are recorded in the unallocated surplus (see below)
Insurance contracts which are not unit-linked or in the Group’s with-profit funds: a liability for contractual benefits that are expected 
to be incurred in the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised. The liability is calculated by estimating the future cash 
flows over the duration of in-force policies and discounting them back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence. 
The liability will vary with movements in interest rates and with the cost of life insurance and annuity benefits where future mortality 
is uncertain

Lloyds Banking Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Note 2: Accounting policies continued
Assumptions are made in respect of all material factors affecting future cash flows, including future interest rates, mortality and costs.
•

Insurance and participating investment contracts which are unit-linked; Liabilities for unit-linked insurance and participating 
investment contracts are stated at the bid value of units plus an additional allowance where appropriate (such as for any excess of 
future expenses over charges). The liability is increased or reduced by the change in the unit prices and is reduced by policy 
administration fees, mortality and surrender charges and any withdrawals. Benefit claims in excess of the account balances 
incurred in the period are also charged through insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities. 
Revenue consists of fees deducted for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges

Unallocated surplus
Any amounts in the with-profit funds not yet determined as being due to policyholders or shareholders are recognised as an 
unallocated surplus which is shown separately from liabilities arising from insurance and participating investment contracts.

(ii)  Accounting for non-participating investment contracts
The accounting policy is consistent with M(4) above, except that investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment 
income) allocated to those contracts are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims and changes in insurance 
and investment contract liabilities.

(2)  General insurance business
The Group both underwrites and acts as intermediary in the sale of general insurance products. Underwriting premiums are included in 
insurance premium income, net of refunds, in the period in which insurance cover is provided to the customer; premiums received 
relating to future periods are deferred in the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance and participating investment 
contracts on a basis that reflects the length of time for which contracts have been in-force and the projected incidence of risk over the 
term of the contract and only credited to the income statement when earned. Broking commission is recognised when the underwriter 
accepts the risk of providing insurance cover to the customer. Where appropriate, provision is made for the effect of future policy 
terminations based upon past experience.

The underwriting business makes provision for the estimated cost of claims notified but not settled and claims incurred but not 
reported at the balance sheet date. The provision for the cost of claims notified but not settled is based upon a best estimate of the 
cost of settling the outstanding claims after taking into account all known facts. In those cases where there is insufficient information to 
determine the required provision, statistical techniques are used which take into account the cost of claims that have recently been 
settled and make assumptions about the future development of the outstanding cases. Similar statistical techniques are used to 
determine the provision for claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. Claims liabilities are not discounted.

(3)  Liability adequacy test
At each balance sheet date liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of insurance and participating investment 
contract liabilities net of related deferred cost assets and value of in-force business. In performing these tests, current best estimates 
of discounted future contractual cash flows and claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income 
from the assets backing such liabilities, are used. Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially by writing off 
the relevant assets and subsequently by establishing a provision for losses arising from liability adequacy tests.

(4)  Reinsurance
The presentation of contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for amounts payable 
on one or more other contracts issued by the Group is dependent on whether the contract with the reinsurer transfers significant 
insurance risk to the reinsurer. Where the reinsurance contract transfers significant insurance risk, it is classified as an insurance 
contract and the asset is recognised separately on the balance sheet. Where the reinsurance contract does not transfer significant 
insurance risk to the reinsurer, the assets arising from contracts held with reinsurers are presented within financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss.

(i)  Contracts with reinsurers that transfer significant insurance risk
Amounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers are measured consistently with the amounts associated with the reinsured contracts 
and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract and are regularly reviewed for impairment. Premiums payable for 
reinsurance contracts are recognised as an expense when due within insurance premium income. Changes in the reinsurance 
recoverable assets are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment 
contract liabilities.

(ii)  Contracts with reinsurers that do not transfer significant insurance risk
Contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk to the reinsurer are recognised within financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss as they are within a portfolio of financial assets that is managed, and whose performance is evaluated, on a fair value 
basis. These contracts, while legally reinsurance contracts, do not meet the definition of a reinsurance contract under IFRS. Investment 
returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to these contracts are recognised in insurance claims 
and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities.

(O)  Foreign currency translation
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate 
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting 
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income 
as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges. Non-monetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated using the 
exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Translation differences on equities and similar non-monetary items held 
at fair value through profit and loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-
monetary financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, such as equity shares, are included in the fair 
value reserve in equity unless the asset is a hedged item in a fair value hedge.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 2: Accounting policies continued
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows: the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity, are translated into Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance 
sheet date; and the income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at average exchange rates unless these do 
not approximate to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the dates of the transactions.

Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in a separate component of equity together with exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and 
other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments (see (F)(3) above). On disposal or liquidation of a foreign 
operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to that foreign operation is reclassified from equity and included in 
determining the profit or loss arising on disposal or liquidation.

(P)  Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will 
be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence depends on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present 
obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in 
the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.

Provision is made for expected credit losses in respect of irrevocable undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts 
(see (H) above).

(Q)  Share capital
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Dividends paid on the Group’s ordinary shares are recognised as a reduction in equity in the 
period in which they are paid.

Where the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Company’s share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from 
shareholders’ equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled; if these shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration 
received is included in shareholders’ equity.

(R)  Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and non-mandatory deposits held with central 
banks, mandatory deposits held with central banks in demand accounts and amounts due from banks with an original maturity of less 
than three months that are available to finance the Group’s day-to-day operations.

Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Due 
to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ 
from those estimates. Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and 
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In preparing the 
financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its financial position and performance. While the 
effects of climate change represent a source of uncertainty, the Group does not consider there to be a material impact on its 
judgements and estimates from the physical, transition and other climate-related risks in the short term.

Retirement benefit obligations (note 16)

The significant judgements, apart from those involving estimation, made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
in these financial statements (critical judgements) and the key sources of estimation uncertainty that may have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year (key sources of estimation 
uncertainty), which together are considered critical to the Group’s results and financial position, are as follows:
•
• Uncertain tax positions (note 19)
•
Fair value of financial instruments (note 21)
• Allowance for expected credit losses (note 24)
• Valuation of liabilities arising from insurance business (notes 30 and 36)
•

Regulatory and legal provisions (note 38)

Consideration of climate change 
Financial statement preparation includes the consideration of the impact of climate change on the Group’s financial statements. There 
has been no material impact identified on the financial reporting judgements and estimates. In particular, the directors considered the 
impact of climate change in respect of the:
• Going concern of the Group for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements
• Assessment of impairment of non-financial assets including goodwill
• Carrying value and useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment
•

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities. These are generally based on market indicators which include the market’s assessment 
of climate risk
Initial assessments on expected credit loss, focussing on specific climate-related macroeconomic, physical and transition risk 
impacts on credit quality at a sector and segment level
Forecasting of the Group’s future UK taxable profits, which impacts deferred tax recognition

•

•

Whilst there is currently no material short-term impact of climate change expected, the Group acknowledges the long-term nature of 
climate risk and continues to monitor and assess climate risks highlighted in the risk management section on pages 154 to 157.

Note 4: Segmental analysis
Lloyds Banking Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services in the UK and in certain locations overseas.

The Group Executive Committee (GEC) has been determined to be the chief operating decision-maker, as defined by IFRS 8 Operating 
Segments, for the Group. The Group’s operating segments reflect its organisational and management structures. The GEC reviews the 
Group’s internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources. It considers interest 
income and expense on a net basis and consequently the total interest income and expense for all reportable segments is presented 
net. The segments are differentiated by the type of products provided and by whether the customers are individuals or corporate 
entities.

The segmental results and comparatives are presented on an underlying basis (pre-tax), the basis reviewed by the chief operating 
decision-maker. The underlying basis is derived from the recognition and measurement principles of IFRS with the effects of the 
following excluded in arriving at underlying profit:
•
• Volatility and other items, which includes the effects of certain asset sales, the volatility relating to the Group’s hedging 

Restructuring costs relating to merger, acquisition and integration activities

arrangements and that arising in the insurance businesses, the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments and the 
amortisation of purchased intangible assets
Losses from insurance and participating investment contract modifications relating to the enhancement to the Group’s 
longstanding and workplace pension business through the addition of a drawdown feature

•

For the purposes of the underlying income statement, operating lease depreciation (net of gains on disposal of operating lease assets) 
is shown as an adjustment to total income.

The Group has three operating and reportable segments: Retail; Commercial Banking; and Insurance, Pensions and Investments:
•

Retail offers a broad range of financial services products to personal customers, including current accounts, savings, mortgages, 
credit cards, unsecured loans, motor finance and leasing solutions

• Commercial Banking serves small and medium businesses and corporate and institutional clients, providing lending, transactional 

banking, working capital management, debt financing and risk management services 
Insurance, Pensions and Investments offers insurance, investment and pension management products and services

•

Other comprises income and expenditure not attributed to the Group’s operating segments. These amounts include those arising from 
the Group’s equities business, residual net interest income after transfer pricing (which includes the central recovery of the Group’s 
distributions on other equity instruments), in period gains from gilt sales and the unwind of associated hedging costs.

Inter-segment services are generally recharged at cost, although some attract a margin. In particular, a profit margin is charged on 
the internal commission arrangements between the branch network and other distribution channels and the insurance product 
manufacturing businesses within the Group. Inter-segment lending and deposits are generally entered into at market rates, except that 
non-interest bearing balances are priced at a rate that reflects the external yield that could be earned on such funds.

For the majority of those derivative contracts entered into by business units for risk management purposes, the business unit 
recognises the net interest income or expense on an accrual accounting basis and transfers the remainder of the movement in the 
fair value of the derivative to the central function where the resulting accounting volatility is managed where possible through the 
establishment of hedge accounting relationships. Any change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk is 
also recorded within the central function. This allocation of the fair value of the derivative and change in fair value of the hedged 
instrument attributable to the hedged risk avoids accounting asymmetry in segmental results and leads to accounting volatility, which 
is managed centrally and reported within Other.

investors in the Group's non-participating investment contracts and third party interests in consolidated funds. These items have no impact in total upon the profit 
attributable to equity shareholders and, in order to provide a clearer representation of the underlying trends within the business, these items are shown net within the 
underlying results.

Fees and commissions which are an integral part of the effective interest rate form part of net interest income shown in note 5. Fees 
and commissions relating to instruments that are held at fair value through profit or loss are included within net trading income shown 
in note 7.

In determining the disaggregation of fees and commissions the Group has considered how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty 
of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors, including those that are impacted by climate-related factors. It has 
determined that the above disaggregation by product type provides useful information that does not aggregate items that have 
substantially different characteristics and is not too detailed.

At 31 December 2023, the Group held on its balance sheet £163 million (31 December 2022: £173 million) in respect of services provided to 
customers and £69 million (31 December 2022: £74 million) in respect of amounts received from customers for services to be provided 
after the balance sheet date. Current unsatisfied performance obligations amount to £172 million (31 December 2022: £149 million); the 
Group expects to receive substantially all of this revenue by 2025.

Income recognised during the year included £32 million (2022: £8 million) in respect of amounts included in the contract liability 
balance at the start of the year and £2 million (2022: £1 million) in respect of amounts from performance obligations satisfied in 
previous years.

The most significant performance obligations undertaken by the Group are in respect of current accounts, the provision of other 
banking services for commercial customers and credit and debit card services.

In respect of current accounts, the Group receives fees for the provision of bank account and transaction services such as ATM 
services, fund transfers, overdraft facilities and other value-added offerings.

For commercial customers, alongside its provision of current accounts, the Group provides other corporate banking services including 
factoring and commitments to provide loan financing. Loan commitment fees are included in fees and commissions where the loan is 
not expected to be drawn down by the customer.

The Group receives interchange and merchant fees, together with fees for overseas use and cash advances, for provision of card 
services to cardholders and merchants.

2  During 2022, the Group enhanced its existing longstanding and workplace pension business through the addition of a drawdown feature. The Group applied judgement 

to determine that if the drawdown feature had been included in the contract terms at inception, the modified contracts would have had a substantially different 
contract boundary. As a result, the existing contracts were derecognised and the modified contracts recognised as new contracts. Judgement was also applied in 
determining the premium that would have been charged had the Group entered into a contract with the new contracts’ terms at the date of modification. The contracts 
were modified throughout 2022, in line with the dates of policyholder communication of enhanced benefits. The Group recognised a charge to its 2022 income statement 
of £1,242 million comprising:
–

The Group derecognised existing CSM relating to contracts modified of £399 million and recognised CSM of £1,730 million relating to the new contracts recognised. 
During 2022, the CSM increased by £1,331 million and will be released to the income statement, in line with service provided. The new CSM is larger than the previously 
existing CSM as (i) there were no acquisition costs incurred following modification, and (ii) the CSM for those contracts that were originally recognised prior to 
1 January 2016 was previously calculated using the fair value approach on transition
The new CSM also included additional future profit of £89 million expected to emerge from the addition of a drawdown feature, as a result of the increase in the 
expected length of the contract services period for this business. There has been an equivalent change in the fulfilment cash flows arising upon contract 
modification

–

3  During 2022, acquisition costs of £383 million related to contracts modified and derecognised in the year were excluded from both the amortisation of insurance 

acquisition cash flows and the recovery of insurance acquisition cash flows as there were no insurance contract services arising from the derecognition upon contract

Share-based payments impacted by partial consolidation of Group Performance Share into basic salary during 2023.

During the year ended 31 December 2023 the Group operated the following share-based payment schemes, all of which are mainly 
equity settled.

Group Performance Share plan
The Group operates a Group Performance Share plan that is part equity settled. Bonuses in respect of employee service in 2023 have 
been recognised in the charge in line with the proportion of the deferral period completed.

Save-As-You-Earn schemes
Eligible employees may enter into contracts through the Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) schemes to save up to £500 per month and, at the 
expiry of a fixed term of three years, have the option to use these savings within six months of the expiry of the fixed term to acquire 
shares in the Group at a discounted price of no less than 90 per cent of the market price at the start of the invitation period.

Movements in the number of share options outstanding under the SAYE schemes are set out below:

The weighted average fair value of options granted in the year was £0.41 (2022: £0.44). The fair values of options granted have been 
determined using a standard Black-Scholes model. The weighted average share price at the time that the options were exercised 
during 2023 was £0.46 (2022: £0.46). The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at the end of the year was 
6.3 years (2022: 6.0 years).

Included in the above are awards to the Group Chief Executive.

William Chalmers joined the Group on 3 June 2019 and was appointed as Chief Financial Officer on 1 August 2019. He was granted 
deferred share awards over 4,086,632 shares, to replace unvested awards from his former employer, Morgan Stanley, that were 
forfeited as a result of him joining the Group. The final tranche was exercised in 2022 and no options were outstanding for 2023.

Other share plans
Lloyds Banking Group Executive Group Ownership Share Plan
The plan, introduced in 2006, is aimed at delivering shareholder value by linking the receipt of shares to an improvement in the 
performance of the Group over a three-year period. Awards are made within limits set by the rules of the plan, with the limits 
determining the maximum number of shares that can be awarded equating to three times annual salary. In exceptional 
circumstances this may increase to four times annual salary.

At the end of the performance period for the 2021 grant, the targets had not been fully met and therefore these awards vested in 2023 
at a rate of 43.70 per cent.

The Executive Group Ownership awards were replaced by Long Term Share Plan awards in 2021.

Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Group’s shares are expected to fluctuate during the life of an option. The 
expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the closing daily share price over the most recent period that is 
commensurate with the expected life of the option. The historical volatility is compared to the implied volatility generated from market 
traded options in the Group’s shares to assess the reasonableness of the historical volatility and adjustments made where appropriate.

Share Incentive Plans
Matching shares
The Group undertakes to match shares purchased by employees up to the value of £45 per month; these matching shares are held in 
trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employee’s behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends 
paid on such shares. The award is subject to a non-market based condition: if an employee leaves within this three-year period for 
other than a ‘good’ reason, all of the matching shares are forfeited. Similarly, if the employees sell their purchased shares within three 
years, their matching shares are forfeited.

The number of shares awarded relating to matching shares in 2023 was 43,945,238 (2022: 43,378,504), with an average fair value of 
£0.46 (2022: £0.45), based on market prices at the date of award.

Fixed share awards
Fixed share awards were introduced in 2014 in order to ensure that total fixed remuneration is commensurate with role and to provide a 
competitive reward package for certain Lloyds Banking Group employees, with an appropriate balance of fixed and variable 
remuneration, in line with regulatory requirements. The fixed share awards are delivered in Lloyds Banking Group plc shares, and were 
initially released over five years with 20 per cent being released each year following the year of award. From June 2020, the fixed share 
awards are released over three years with one third being released each year following the year of award. The number of shares 
purchased in relation to fixed share awards in 2023 was 1,790,243 (2022: 7,261,080) with an average fair value of £0.46 (2022: £0.47) based 
on market prices at the date of the award.

The fixed share award is not subject to any performance conditions, performance adjustment or clawback. On an employee leaving 
the Group, there is no change to the timeline for which shares will become unrestricted.

Since the beginning of 2023 the number of recipients of these awards has been reduced to the executive directors only.

Free shares
An award of shares may be made annually to employees up to a maximum of £3,600. The shares awarded are held in trust for a 
mandatory period of three years on the employee’s behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such 
shares. The award is subject to a non-market based condition. If an employee leaves the Group within this three-year period for other 
than a ‘good’ reason, all of the shares awarded will be forfeited.

There have not been any awards made since 2021.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Discount rate applied to future cash flows

Key sources of estimation uncertainty:

Expected lifetime of the schemes’ members

Expected rate of future inflationary increases

The net asset recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2023 in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme 
obligations was £3,532 million, comprising an asset of £3,624 million and a liability of £92 million (2022: a net asset of £3,732 million
comprising an asset of £3,823 million and a liability of £91 million). The Group’s accounting policy for its defined benefit pension scheme 
obligations is set out in note 2(K).

Pension schemes
Defined benefit schemes
(i)  Characteristics of and risks associated with the Group’s schemes
The Group has established a number of defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas. All significant schemes are based in 
the UK, with the three most significant being the main sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1, the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme 
No. 2 and the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme. At 31 December 2023, these schemes represented 94 per cent of the Group’s total 
gross defined benefit pension assets (2022: 94 per cent). These schemes provide retirement benefits calculated as a proportion of final 
pensionable salary depending upon the length of pensionable service; the minimum retirement age under the rules of the schemes at 
31 December 2023 is generally 55, although certain categories of member are deemed to have a protected right to retire at 50.

The Group operates both funded and unfunded pension arrangements; the majority, including the three most significant schemes, are 
funded schemes in the UK. All of these UK funded schemes are operated as separate legal entities under trust law, are in compliance 
with the Pensions Act 2004 and are managed by a Trustee Board (the Trustee) whose role is to ensure that their scheme is 
administered in accordance with the scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interests of all 
members and beneficiaries. The Trustee is solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with 
the employer through the funding valuation process. The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the scheme 
membership along with a combination of independent and employer appointed trustees to comply with legislation and scheme rules.

A valuation to determine the funding status of each scheme is carried out at least every three years, whereby scheme assets are 
measured at market value and liabilities (technical provisions) are measured using prudent assumptions. If a deficit is identified a 
recovery plan is agreed between the employer and the scheme Trustee and sent to the Pensions Regulator for review. The Group does 
not provide for these deficit contributions as the future economic benefits arising from these contributions are expected to be 
available to the Group. The Group’s overseas defined benefit pension schemes are subject to local regulatory arrangements.

The Group has completed the triennial valuation of its main defined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2022. Following a fixed 
contribution of £800 million in the first half of 2023, a residual aggregate deficit of £250 million was agreed with the Trustee which the 
Group paid in December 2023. There will be no further deficit contributions, fixed or variable, for this triennial period (to 31 December 
2025).

The deficit contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet benefits accruing over the year, and to cover the expenses 
of running the schemes. The Group expects to pay contributions of at least £0.1 billion to its defined benefit schemes in 2024.

Note 16: Retirement benefit obligations continued
During 2009, the Group made one-off contributions to the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 and Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 2 in 
the form of interests in limited liability partnerships for each of the two schemes which hold assets to provide security for the Group’s 
obligations to the two schemes. At 31 December 2023, the limited liability partnerships held assets of £6.2 billion. The limited liability 
partnerships are consolidated fully in the Group’s balance sheet.

The Group has also established three private limited companies which hold assets to provide security for the Group’s obligations to the 
HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme, a section of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 and the Lloyds Bank Offshore Pension Scheme. At 
31 December 2023 these held assets of £4.1 billion in aggregate. The private limited companies are consolidated fully in the Group’s 
balance sheet. The terms of these arrangements require the Group to maintain assets in these vehicles to agreed minimum values in 
order to secure obligations owed to the relevant Group pension schemes. The Group has satisfied this requirement during 2023.

The last funding valuations of other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates. In order to report the position 
under IAS 19 as at 31 December 2023, the most recent valuation results for all schemes have been updated by qualified independent 
actuaries. The funding valuations use a more prudent approach to setting the discount rate and more conservative longevity and 
inflation assumptions than the IAS 19 valuations.

In a judgment in 2018, the High Court confirmed the requirement to equalise the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) benefits of men 
and women accruing between 1990 and 1997 from contracting out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. The Group 
recognised a past service cost of £108 million in respect of equalisation in 2018 and, following agreement of the detailed 
implementation approach with the Trustee, a further £33 million was recognised in 2019. A further hearing was held during 2020 which 
confirmed the extent of the Trustee’s obligation to revisit past transfers out of the schemes. The amount of any additional liability as a 
result of this judgment is not considered likely to be material.

The Group is aware of the High Court ruling in the case of Virgin Media Ltd v NTL Pension Trustees II Ltd & Ors and is waiting for the 
outcome of the appeal, scheduled for 25 June 2024, and any additional hearings, as well as confirmation from the Government as to 
whether it will issue new regulations in response to this issue.

The Trustee’s approach to investment is focused on acting in the members’ best financial interests, with the integration of ESG 
(environmental, social and governance) considerations into investment management processes and practices. This policy is reviewed 
annually (or more frequently as required) and has been shared with the schemes’ investment managers for implementation.

Climate change is one of the risks the schemes manage given its potential financial impact on valuation of assets.

(iv)  Assumptions
The principal actuarial and financial assumptions used in valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes were as follows:

Discount rate

Rate of inflation:

Retail Price Index (RPI)

Consumer Price Index (CPI)

Rate of salary increases

Weighted average rate of increase for pensions in payment

2023

 2.73 

2022
%

 4.93 

 3.13 

 2.69 

 0.00 

 2.84 

On 25 November 2020 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the outcome of a consultation into a reform of the calculation of 
RPI. It is now expected that from 2030 RPI will be aligned with CPIH (the Consumer Price Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs). 
To determine the RPI assumption a term-dependent inflation curve has been used adjusting for an assumed inflation risk premium. A 
gap of 130 basis points has been assumed between RPI and CPI in 2024 reducing to 120 basis points in 2025, 110 basis points in 2026 and 
100 basis points from 2027 to 2030; thereafter a 10 basis point gap has been assumed.

The mortality assumptions used in the UK scheme valuations are based on standard tables published by the Institute and Faculty of 
Actuaries which were adjusted in line with the actual experience of the relevant schemes. The table shows that a member retiring at 
age 60 at 31 December 2023 is assumed to live for, on average, 26.7 years for a male and 28.7 years for a female. In practice there will 
be much variation between individual members but these assumptions are expected to be appropriate across all members. It is 
assumed that younger members will live longer in retirement than those retiring now. This reflects the expectation that mortality rates 
will continue to fall over time as medical science and standards of living improve. To illustrate the degree of improvement assumed, 
the table also shows the life expectancy for members aged 45 now, when they retire in 15 years time at age 60. The Group uses the CMI 
mortality projections model and in line with actuarial industry recommendations has placed no weight on 2020 and 2021 mortality 
experience and 25 per cent weight on 2022 mortality experience.

Risk exposure of the defined benefit schemes
While the Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity-specific or scheme-specific risks in its defined benefit pension schemes, it is 
exposed to a number of significant risks, detailed below:

Inflation rate risk: The majority of the plans’ benefit obligations are linked to inflation both in deferment and once in payment. Higher 
inflation will lead to higher liabilities although this will be materially offset by holdings of inflation-linked gilts and, in most cases, caps on 
the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.

Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation is determined using a discount rate derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds. 
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities although this will be materially offset by an increase in the value of 
bond holdings and through the use of derivatives.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 16: Retirement benefit obligations continued
Longevity risk: The majority of the schemes’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.

Investment risk: Scheme assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equities and other return-seeking assets. If the 
assets underperform the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, it will reduce the surplus or increase the deficit. 
Volatility in asset values and the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension asset on the Group’s balance sheet and in other 
comprehensive income. To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the pension expense in the Group’s income statement.

In addition, the schemes themselves are exposed to liquidity risk with the need to ensure that liquid assets held are sufficient to meet 
benefit payments as they fall due and there is sufficient collateral available to support their hedging activity.

The ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions 
made. The assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost may be higher or lower than expected.

Sensitivity analysis
The effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the value of scheme liabilities and the resulting pension charge in the 
Group’s income statement and on the net defined benefit pension scheme asset, for the Group’s three most significant schemes, is set 
out below. The sensitivities provided assume that all other assumptions and the value of the schemes’ assets remain unchanged, and 
are not intended to represent changes that are at the extremes of possibility. The calculations are approximate in nature and full 
detailed calculations could lead to a different result. It is unlikely that isolated changes to individual assumptions will be experienced in 
practice. Due to the correlation of assumptions, aggregating the effects of these isolated changes may not be a reasonable estimate 
of the actual effect of simultaneous changes in multiple assumptions.

At 31 December 2023, the assumed rate of RPI inflation is 2.96 per cent and CPI inflation 2.47 per cent (2022: RPI 3.13 per cent and CPI 2.69 per cent).

1 
2  At 31 December 2023, the assumed discount rate is 4.70 per cent (2022: 4.93 per cent).

Sensitivity analysis method and assumptions
The sensitivity analysis above reflects the impact on the liabilities of the Group’s three most significant schemes which account for over 
90 per cent of the Group’s defined benefit obligations. While differences in the underlying liability profiles for the remainder of the 
Group’s pension arrangements mean that they may exhibit slightly different sensitivities to variations in these assumptions, the 
sensitivities provided above are indicative of the impact across the Group as a whole.

The inflation assumption sensitivity applies to the assumed rate of increase in both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Retail Price 
Index (RPI), and includes the impact on the rate of increases to pensions, both before and after retirement. These pension increases are 
linked to inflation (either CPI or RPI) subject to certain minimum and maximum limits.

The sensitivity analysis (including the inflation sensitivity) does not include the impact of any change in the rate of salary increases as 
pensionable salaries have been frozen since 2 April 2014.

The life expectancy assumption has been applied by allowing for an increase/decrease in life expectation from age 60 of one year, 
based upon the approximate weighted average age for each scheme. While this is an approximate approach and will not give the 
same result as a one year increase in life expectancy at every age, it provides an appropriate indication of the potential impact on the 
schemes from changes in life expectancy.

There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from the prior year.

Asset-liability matching strategies
The main schemes’ assets are invested in a diversified portfolio. Whilst c.50 per cent are held to generate the long-term returns 
required to support the funding position of the schemes, the remainder is invested in liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies which 
hedge the material risk exposures of the schemes. The investment strategy is not static and will evolve to reflect the structure of 
liabilities within the schemes. Specific strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the responsible governance 
body for each scheme and in consultation with the employer.

A significant goal of the strategies adopted by the schemes is to reduce volatility caused by changes in market expectations of interest 
rates and inflation. In the main schemes, this is achieved by investing scheme assets in bonds, primarily fixed interest gilts and index 
linked gilts, and by entering into interest rate and inflation swap arrangements. The assets in these LDI strategies represented 50 per 
cent of scheme assets at 31 December 2023.

These investments are structured to take into account the profile of scheme liabilities and actively managed to reflect both changing 
market conditions and changes to the liability profile. At 31 December 2023 the asset-liability matching strategy mitigated c.117 per cent 
of the liability sensitivity to interest rate movements and c.125 per cent of the liability sensitivity to inflation movements. In addition, a 
small amount of interest rate sensitivity arises through holdings of corporate and other debt securities. The higher level of hedging 
provides greater protection to the funding position of the schemes.

On 28 January 2020, the main schemes entered into a £10 billion longevity insurance arrangement to hedge part of the schemes’ 
exposure to unexpected increases in life expectancy. This arrangement forms part of the schemes’ investment portfolio and will 
provide income to the schemes in the event that pensions are paid out for longer than expected. The transaction was structured as a 
pass-through with Scottish Widows as the insurer, and onwards reinsurance to Pacific Life Re Limited.

On 28 January 2022, the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 entered into an additional £5.5 billion longevity insurance arrangement. The 
transaction is structured as a pass-through with Scottish Widows as the insurer, and onwards reinsurance to SCOR SE – UK Branch.

At 31 December 2023 the value of scheme assets included £(160) million representing the value of the longevity swaps (after allowing 
for the impact on the IAS 19 liabilities of the revisions to the base mortality assumptions).

In total the schemes have now hedged c.30 per cent of their longevity risk exposure.

Maturity analysis method and assumptions
The projected benefit payments are based on the assumptions underlying the assessment of the obligations, including allowance for 
expected future inflation. They are shown in their undiscounted form and therefore appear large relative to the discounted assessment 
of the defined benefit obligations recognised in the Group’s balance sheet. They are in respect of benefits that have been accrued 
prior to the respective year end date only and make no allowance for any benefits that may have been accrued subsequently.

Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally Your Tomorrow and the 
defined contribution sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1.

During the year ended 31 December 2023 the charge to the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 
£434 million (2022: £330 million; 2021: £302 million), representing the contributions payable by the employer in accordance with each 
scheme’s rules.

Note 16: Retirement benefit obligations continued
Other retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates a number of schemes which provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to certain employees, retired employees 
and their dependants. The principal scheme relates to former Lloyds Bank staff and under this scheme the Group has undertaken to 
meet the cost of post-retirement healthcare for all eligible former employees (and their dependants) who retired prior to 1 January 
1996. The Group has entered into an insurance contract to provide these benefits and a provision has been made for the estimated 
cost of future insurance premiums payable.

For the principal post-retirement healthcare scheme, the latest actuarial valuation of the liability was carried out at 31 December 2023 
by qualified independent actuaries. The principal assumptions used were as set out above, except that the rate of increase in 
healthcare premiums has been assumed at 10.00 per cent (2022: 6.74 per cent).

Movements in the other retirement benefits obligation:

At 1 January

Actuarial (losses) gains

totalled £9.1 million in 2023 (2022: £12.8 million; 2021: £6.5 million).

The following types of services are included in the categories listed above:

Audit fees: This category includes fees in respect of the audit of the Group’s annual financial statements (including work related to the 
adoption of new accounting standards) and other services in connection with regulatory filings. Other services supplied pursuant to 
legislation relate primarily to costs incurred in connection with client asset assurance and with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements 
associated with the audit of the Group’s financial statements filed on its Form 20-F.

Other audit-related fees: This category includes fees in respect of services for assurance and related services that are reasonably 
related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example acting as reporting accountants in respect 
of debt prospectuses required by the Listing Rules.

All other fees: This category includes other assurance services not related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial 
statements, for example, the review of controls operated by the Group on behalf of a third party. The auditors are not engaged to 
provide tax services.

It is the Group’s policy to use the auditors only on assignments in cases where their knowledge of the Group means that it is neither 
efficient nor cost effective to employ another firm of accountants.

The Group has procedures that are designed to ensure auditor independence, including prohibiting certain non-audit services. All audit 
and non-audit assignments must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee on an individual engagement basis; for certain types of 
non-audit engagements where the fee is ‘de minimis’ the Audit Committee has pre-approved all assignments subject to confirmation 
by management. On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee receives and reviews a report detailing all pre-approved services and 
amounts paid to the auditors for such pre-approved services.

During the year, the auditors also earned fees payable by entities outside the consolidated Lloyds Banking Group in respect of the 
following:

Audits of Group pension schemes

Audits of the unconsolidated Open-Ended Investment Companies managed by the Group

Reviews of the financial position of corporate and other borrowers

Factors affecting the tax expense for the year
The UK corporation tax rate for the year was 23.5 per cent (2022: 19.0 per cent; 2021: 19.0 per cent). The increase in applicable tax rate 
from 2022 relates to the change in statutory tax rate effective from 1 April 2023. An explanation of the relationship between tax expense 
and accounting profit is set out below.

The tax impact of the IFRS 17 adjustments is recognised at the rate of tax at which it is expected to be realised. For 2022, this includes the 
impact of the transitional tax provisions to allow spreading of life companies’ profit or loss arising on transition to IFRS 17 over 10 years.

On 17 November 2022 the UK Government confirmed its intention to implement the G20-OECD Inclusive Framework Pillar 2 rules in the 
UK, including a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax rule. This legislation, which was enacted in 2023, will seek to ensure that UK-
headquartered multinational enterprises pay a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent on UK and overseas profits arising after 31 December 
2023. As the UK rate of corporation tax in 2024 will be 25 per cent, and the Group’s business is primarily in the UK, the impact of these 
rules on the Group is not expected to be material.

The statutory position reflects the deferred tax assets and liabilities as disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet and takes into 
account the ability of the Group to net assets and liabilities where there is a legally enforceable right of offset. The tax disclosure of 
deferred tax assets and liabilities ties to the amounts outlined in the tables below which splits the deferred tax assets and liabilities by 
type, before such netting.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 19: Tax continued
At 31 December 2023 the Group carried net deferred tax assets on its balance sheet of £5,185 million (2022: £6,422 million) principally 
relating to tax losses carried forward.

Estimation of income taxes includes the assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to 
the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be recoverable based on existing tax laws and forecasts of future taxable 
profits against which the underlying tax deductions can be utilised. The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of £4,783 million 
(2022: £5,066 million) in respect of trading losses carried forward. Substantially all of these losses have arisen in Bank of Scotland plc 
and Lloyds Bank plc, and they will be utilised as taxable profits arise in those legal entities in future periods.

The Group’s expectations of future UK taxable profits require management judgement, and take into account the Group’s long-term 
financial and strategic plans and anticipated future tax-adjusting items. In making this assessment, account is taken of business plans, 
the Board-approved operating plan and the expected future economic outlook as set out in the strategic report, as well as the risks 
associated with future regulatory, climate-related and other change, in order to produce a base case forecast of future UK taxable 
profits. Under current law there is no expiry date for UK trading losses not yet utilised, and given the forecast of future profitability and 
the Group’s commitment to the UK market, in management’s judgement it is more likely than not that the value of the losses will be 
recovered by the Group while still operating as a going concern. Banking tax losses that arose before 1 April 2015 can only be used 
against 25 per cent of taxable profits arising after 1 April 2016, and they cannot be used to reduce the surcharge on banking profits. 
These restrictions in utilisation mean that the value of the deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses is only expected to be fully 
recovered by 2036 (2022: 2036) in the base case forecast. The rate of recovery of the Group’s tax loss asset is not a straight line, being 
affected by the relative profitability of the different legal entities in future periods, and the relative size of their tax losses carried 
forward. It is expected in the base case that 90 per cent of the value will be recovered by 2034, when Bank of Scotland plc will have 
utilised all of its available tax losses. It is possible that future tax law changes could materially affect the timing of recovery and the 
value of these losses ultimately realised by the Group.

A deferred tax asset of £118 million (2022: £8 million) has been recognised in respect of the future tax benefit of certain expenses of the 
life assurance business. The increase is driven by higher forecast investment returns in the long term projections for the life insurance 
business due to interest rate rises which increases the amount of expenses expected to be utilised. The deferred tax asset not 
recognised in respect of the remaining expenses is £88 million (2022: £339 million), and these expenses can be carried forward 
indefinitely. The unrecognised deferred tax asset has decreased in 2023 due to utilisation of expenses in the year and the higher 
expected investment returns in the long term projections for the life insurance business reducing the net amount of unutilised 
expenses in the long term.

Deferred tax not recognised
Deferred tax assets of £160 million (2022: £156 million) have not been recognised in respect of £635 million of UK tax losses and other 
temporary differences which can only be used to offset future capital gains. UK capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of foreign trade losses where it is not more likely than not that we will be able to utilise 
them in future periods. Of the asset not recognised, £51 million (2022: £53 million) relates to losses that will expire if not used within 
20 years, and £9 million (2022: £9 million) relates to losses with no expiry date.

As a result of parent company exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and on capital gains on disposal there are no significant 
taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint arrangements.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

Critical judgement:

The Group believes that its interpretation of the tax rules on group relief are correct

The Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which 
ceased trading on 31 December 2010. In 2013, HMRC informed the Group that its interpretation of the UK rules means that the group relief 
is not available. In 2020, HMRC concluded its enquiry into the matter and issued a closure notice. The Group’s interpretation of the UK 
rules has not changed and hence it appealed to the First Tier Tax Tribunal, with a hearing having taken place in May 2023. If the final 
determination of the matter by the judicial process is that HMRC’s position is correct, management believes that this would result in an 
increase in current tax liabilities of approximately £920 million (including interest) and a reduction in the Group’s deferred tax asset of 
approximately £285 million. The Group, following conclusion of the hearing and having taken appropriate advice, does not consider 
that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.

There are a number of other open matters on which the Group is in discussions with HMRC (including the tax treatment of certain costs 
arising from the divestment of TSB Banking Group plc), none of which is expected to have a material impact on the financial position of 
the Group.

Note 21: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
At 31 December 2023, the carrying value of the Group’s financial instrument assets held at fair value was £253,266 million (2022: 
£228,676 million), and its financial instrument liabilities held at fair value was £90,041 million (2022: £81,273 million).

(1)  Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received on sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. It is a measure as at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which 
will actually be paid or received on maturity or settlement date.

Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments 
to those held by the Group. Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have 
been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-
market observable inputs. Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where 
appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group. The Group measures 
valuation adjustments for its derivative exposures on the same basis as the derivatives are managed.

The carrying amount of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value: cash and balances at central 
banks, items in the course of collection from banks, items in course of transmission to banks and notes in circulation. Liabilities arising 
from non-participating investment contracts are carried at fair value.

Because a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between 
financial institutions may not be meaningful. Readers of these financial statements are thus advised to use caution when using this 
data to evaluate the Group’s financial position.

Fair value information is not provided for items that are not financial instruments or for other assets and liabilities which are not carried 
at fair value in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. These items include intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and 
shareholders’ equity. These items are material and accordingly the Group believes that any fair value information presented would not 
represent the underlying value of the Group.

Valuation control framework
The key elements of the control framework for the valuation of financial instruments include model validation, product implementation 
review and independent price verification. These functions are carried out by appropriately skilled risk and finance teams, independent 
of the business area responsible for the products.

Model validation covers both qualitative and quantitative elements relating to new models. In respect of new products, a product 
implementation review is conducted pre and post-trading. Pre-trade testing ensures that the new model is integrated into the Group’s 
systems and that the profit and loss and risk reporting are consistent throughout the trade lifecycle. Post-trade testing examines the 
explanatory power of the implemented model, actively monitoring model parameters and comparing in-house pricing to external 
sources. Independent price verification procedures cover financial instruments carried at fair value. The frequency of the review is 
matched to the availability of independent data, monthly being the minimum. Valuation differences in breach of established 
thresholds are escalated to senior management. The results from independent pricing and valuation reserves are reviewed monthly by 
senior management.

Formal committees, consisting of senior risk, finance and business management, meet at least quarterly to discuss and approve 
valuations in more judgemental areas, in particular for unquoted equities, structured credit, derivatives and the credit valuation 
adjustment (CVA), funding valuation adjustment (FVA) and other valuation adjustments.

Valuation of financial assets and liabilities
Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the 
quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.

Level 1
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise listed equity shares, treasury bills and other government securities.

Level 2
Level 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that 
is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are 
based significantly on observable market data. Examples of such financial instruments include most over-the-counter derivatives, 
financial institution issued securities, certificates of deposit and certain asset-backed securities.

Level 3
Level 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation is not based on 
observable market data. Such instruments would include the Group’s venture capital and unlisted equity investments which are valued 
using various valuation techniques that require significant management judgement in determining appropriate assumptions, including 
earnings multiples and estimated future cash flows. Certain of the Group’s asset-backed securities, loans and advances recognised at 
fair value and derivatives are also classified as level 3.

Transfers out of the level 3 portfolio arise when inputs that could have a significant impact on the instrument’s valuation become 
market observable after previously having been non-market observable. In the case of asset-backed securities this can arise if more 
than one consistent independent source of data becomes available. Conversely, transfers into the portfolio arise when consistent 
sources of data cease to be available.

Valuation methodology for financial assets (excluding derivatives)
Loans and advances to banks and customers
The fair value of these assets is determined using discounted cash flow techniques. The discount rates are derived from market 
observable interest rates, a risk margin that reflects loan credit ratings and an incremental illiquidity premium based on historical 
spreads at origination on similar loans.

Debt securities
Debt securities measured at fair value and classified as level 2 are valued by discounting expected cash flows using an observable 
credit spread applicable to the particular instrument.

Where there is limited trading activity in debt securities, the Group uses valuation models, consensus pricing information from third 
party pricing services and broker or lead manager quotes to determine an appropriate valuation. Debt securities are classified as level 
3 if there is a significant valuation input that cannot be corroborated through market sources or where there are materially 
inconsistent values for an input. Asset classes classified as level 3 mainly comprise venture capital investments.

Equity investments
Unlisted equity and fund investments are valued using different techniques in accordance with the Group’s valuation policy and 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.

Depending on the business sector and the circumstances of the investment, unlisted equity valuations are based on earnings 
multiples, net asset values or discounted cash flows.
• A number of earnings multiples are used in valuing the portfolio including price earnings, earnings before interest and tax and 

earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The particular multiple selected is appropriate for the size and type of 
business being valued and is derived by reference to the current market-based multiple. Consideration is given to the risk attributes, 
growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting the appropriate multiple

• Discounted cash flow valuations use estimated future cash flows, usually based on management forecasts, with the application of 
appropriate exit yields or terminal multiples and discounted using rates appropriate to the specific investment, business sector or 
recent economic rates of return. Recent transactions involving the sale of similar businesses may sometimes be used as a frame of 
reference in deriving an appropriate multiple
For fund investments the most recent capital account value calculated by the fund manager is used as the basis for the valuation 
and adjusted, if necessary, to align valuation techniques with the Group’s valuation policy

•

Unlisted equity investments and investments in property partnerships held in the life assurance funds are valued using third party 
valuations. Management take account of any pertinent information, such as recent transactions and information received on 
particular investments, to adjust the third party valuations where necessary

Liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss primarily represent debt securities in issue which either contain substantive 
embedded derivatives which would otherwise need to be recognised and measured at fair value separately from the related debt 
securities, or which are accounted for at fair value to significantly reduce an accounting mismatch.

The amount contractually payable on maturity of the debt securities held at fair value through profit or loss at 31 December 2023 was 
£10,433 million, which was £5,167 million higher than the balance sheet carrying value (2022: £11,195 million, which was £6,036 million 
higher than the balance sheet carrying value). At 31 December 2023 there was a cumulative £90 million decrease in the fair value of 
these liabilities attributable to changes in credit spread risk; this is determined by reference to the quoted credit spreads of Lloyds Bank 
plc, the issuing entity within the Group. Of the cumulative amount, an increase of £234 million arose in 2023 and a decrease of 
£519 million arose in 2022.

For the fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase agreements see note 52.

In addition to the liabilities above, the Group’s non-participating investment contracts are held at fair value through profit or loss and 
were all categorised as level 2.

Note 21: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities continued
Valuation methodology for financial liabilities (excluding derivatives)
Liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss
These principally comprise debt securities in issue which are classified as level 2 and their fair value is determined using techniques 
whose inputs are based on observable market data. The carrying amount of the securities is adjusted to reflect the effect of changes 
in own credit spreads and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.

In the year ended 31 December 2023, the own credit adjustment arising from the fair valuation of £5,265 million (2022: £5,159 million) of 
the Group’s debt securities in issue designated at fair value through profit or loss resulted in a loss of £234 million (2022: gain of 
£519 million), before tax, recognised in other comprehensive income.

Trading liabilities in respect of securities sold under repurchase agreements
The fair value of these liabilities is determined using discounted cash flow techniques. The discount rates are derived from observable 
repurchase agreement rate curves specific to the type of security sold under the repurchase agreement.

(C)  Derivatives
Valuation hierarchy
All of the Group’s derivative assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. At 31 December 2023, such assets totalled £22,356 million 
(2022: £24,753 million) and liabilities totalled £20,149 million (2022: £24,042 million). The table below analyses these derivative balances by 
valuation methodology (level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 257). The fair value measurement approach is recurring in nature. There 
were no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the year.

Valuation methodology for derivatives
The Group’s derivatives are valued using techniques including discounted cash flow and options pricing models, as appropriate. The 
types of derivatives classified as level 2 and the valuation techniques used include:
•

Interest rate swaps which are valued using discounted cash flow models; the most significant inputs into those models are interest 
rate yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates
•
Foreign exchange derivatives that do not contain options which are priced using rates available from publicly quoted sources
• Credit derivatives are valued using standard models with observable inputs, including publicly available yield and credit default 

•

swap (CDS) curves
Less complex interest rate and foreign exchange option products which are valued using volatility surfaces developed from publicly 
available interest rate cap, interest rate swaption and other option volatilities; option volatility skew information is derived from a 
market standard consensus pricing service.

Complex interest rate products where inputs to the valuation are significant and unobservable are classified as level 3.

Certain inputs used to calculate CVA, FVA, and own credit adjustments, are not significant in determining the classification of the 
derivative and debt instruments. Consequently, these inputs do not form part of the level 3 sensitivities presented.

Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments (CVA and DVA) are applied to the Group’s over-the-counter derivative exposures with 
counterparties that are not subject to strong interbank collateral arrangements. These exposures largely relate to the provision of risk 
management solutions for corporate customers within the Commercial Banking division.

A CVA is taken where the Group has a positive future uncollateralised exposure (asset). A DVA is taken where the Group has a negative 
future uncollateralised exposure (liability). These adjustments reflect interest rates and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness 
and the Group’s own credit spread respectively.

The CVA is sensitive to:
•
•
•

The current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised asset
Expectations of future market volatility of the underlying asset
Expectations of counterparty creditworthiness

Market Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads are used to develop the probability of default for quoted counterparties. For unquoted 
counterparties, internal credit ratings and market sector CDS curves and recovery rates are used. The loss given default (LGD) is based 
on market recovery rates and internal credit assessments.

The combination of a one-notch deterioration in the credit rating of derivative counterparties and a 10 per cent increase in LGD 
increases the CVA by £50 million. Current market value is used to estimate the projected exposure for products not supported by the 
model, which are principally complex interest rate options that are traded in very low volumes. For these, the CVA is calculated on an 
add-on basis (although no such adjustment was required at 31 December 2023).

The DVA is sensitive to:
•
•
•

The current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised liability
Expectations of future market volatility of the underlying liability
The Group’s own CDS spread

A 1 per cent rise in the CDS spread would lead to an increase in the DVA of £75 million.

The risk exposures that are used for the CVA and DVA calculations are strongly influenced by interest rates. Due to the nature of the 
Group’s business the CVA/DVA exposures tend to be on average the same way around such that the valuation adjustments fall when 
interest rates rise. A 1 per cent rise in interest rates would lead to a £39 million fall in the overall valuation adjustment to £118 million. The 
CVA model used by the Group does not assume any correlation between the level of interest rates and default rates.

The Group has also recognised a Funding Valuation Adjustment to adjust for the net cost of funding uncollateralised derivative 
positions. This adjustment is calculated on the expected future exposure discounted at a suitable cost of funds. A 10 basis points 
increase in the cost of funds will increase the funding valuation adjustment by £12 million.

(ii)  Market liquidity
The Group includes mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments against the expected cost of closing out the net market risk in the Group’s 
trading positions within a time frame that is consistent with historical trading activity and spreads that the trading desks have 
accessed historically during the ordinary course of business in normal market conditions.

At 31 December 2023, the Group’s derivative trading business held mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments of £52 million (2022: 
£61 million).

(D)  Sensitivity of level 3 valuations
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

Key sources of estimation uncertainty:

Interest rate spreads, credit spreads, earnings multiples and interest rate volatility

The Group’s valuation control framework and a description of level 1, 2 and 3 financial assets and liabilities is set out in section (1) above. 
The valuation techniques for level 3 financial instruments involve management judgement and estimates, the extent of which depends 
on the complexity of the instrument and the availability of market observable information. In addition, in line with market practice, the 
Group applies credit, debit and funding valuation adjustments in determining the fair value of its uncollateralised derivative positions. A 
description of these adjustments is set out in section (C)(i) above. A quantitative analysis of the sensitivities to market risk arising from 
the Group’s trading portfolios is set out in the tables marked audited on page 190.

Unobservable inputs
Significant unobservable inputs affecting the valuation of debt securities, unlisted equity investments and derivatives are as follows:
• Credit spreads represent the premium above the benchmark reference instrument required to compensate for lower credit quality; 

higher spreads lead to a lower fair value

• Volatility parameters represent key attributes of option behaviour; higher volatilities typically denote a wider range of possible 

•

outcomes
Earnings multiples are used to value certain unlisted equity investments. The earnings multiples used are derived from those of listed 
entities operating in the same sector with adjustments made for factors such as the size of the company and the quality of its 
earnings. The majority of the Group’s venture capital investments are valued using an estimate of the company’s maintainable 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture 
Capital Valuation Guidelines. A higher earnings multiple will result in a higher fair value

Reasonably possible alternative assumptions
Valuation techniques applied to many of the Group’s level 3 instruments often involve the use of two or more inputs whose relationship 
is interdependent. The calculation of the effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions included in the table above reflects 
such relationships.

Debt securities
Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Group’s structured credit investments by flexing 
credit spreads.

Derivatives
Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of swaptions in the Group’s derivative portfolios which 
are priced using industry standard option pricing models. Such models require interest rate volatilities which may be unobservable at 
longer maturities. To derive reasonably possible alternative valuations these volatility parameters have been flexed within a range of 
13 per cent to 200 per cent (2022: 17 per cent to 105 per cent).

Unlisted equity, venture capital investments and investments in property partnerships
The valuation techniques used for unlisted equity and venture capital investments vary depending on the nature of the investment. 
Reasonably possible alternative valuations for these investments have been calculated by reference to the approach taken, as 
appropriate to the business sector and investment circumstances and as such the following inputs have been considered:
•

For valuations derived from earnings multiples, consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing 
of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple
The discount rates used in discounted cash flow valuations
In line with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines, the values of underlying investments in fund investment

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Note 21: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities continued
Valuation methodology
Loans and advances to banks
The carrying value of short-dated loans and advances to banks is assumed to be their fair value. The fair value of other loans and 
advances to banks is estimated by discounting the anticipated cash flows at a market discount rate adjusted for the credit spread of 
the obligor or, where not observable, the credit spread of borrowers of similar credit quality.

Loans and advances to customers
The Group provides loans and advances to commercial, corporate and personal customers at both fixed and variable rates.

To determine the fair value of loans and advances to customers, loans are segregated into portfolios of similar characteristics. A 
number of techniques are used to estimate the fair value of fixed rate lending; these take account of expected credit losses based on 
historic trends, prevailing market interest rates and expected future cash flows. For retail exposures, fair value is usually estimated by 
discounting anticipated cash flows (including interest at contractual rates) at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and 
other financial institutions. Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to 
five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate. The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to market 
rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period. The fair value of commercial loans is estimated by 
discounting anticipated cash flows at a rate which reflects the effects of interest rate changes, adjusted for changes in credit risk.

Reverse repurchase agreements
The carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short-term nature of these instruments.

Debt securities
The fair values of debt securities are determined predominantly from lead manager quotes and, where these are not available, by 
alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with the same obligor, market standard consensus 
pricing services, broker quotes and other research data.

(B)  Financial liabilities

Valuation methodology
Deposits from banks and customer deposits
The fair value of bank and customer deposits repayable on demand is assumed to be equal to their carrying value.

The fair value for all other deposits is estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates, where applicable, or current 
rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Repurchase agreements at amortised cost
The carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short-term nature of these instruments.

Debt securities in issue at amortised cost
The fair value of short-term debt securities in issue is approximately equal to their carrying value. Fair value for other debt securities in 
issue is calculated based on quoted market prices where available. Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is 
estimated using discounted cash flow techniques at a rate which reflects market rates of interest and the Group’s own credit spread.

Subordinated liabilities
The fair value of subordinated liabilities is determined by reference to quoted market prices where available or by reference to quoted 
market prices of similar instruments. Subordinated liabilities are classified as level 2, since the inputs used to determine their fair value 
are largely observable.

(4)  Reclassifications of financial assets
There have been no reclassifications of financial assets in 2022 or 2023.

The notional amount of the contract does not represent the Group’s exposure to credit risk, which is limited to the current cost of 
replacing contracts with a positive value to the Group should the counterparty default. To reduce credit risk the Group uses a variety of 
credit enhancement techniques such as netting and collateralisation, where security is provided against the exposure; a large 
proportion of the Group’s derivatives are held through exchanges such as London Clearing House and are collateralised through those 
exchanges. Further details are provided in note 52 Credit risk.

The Group holds derivatives as part of the following strategies:
• Customer driven, where derivatives are held as part of the provision of risk management products to Group customers
•

To manage and hedge the Group’s interest rate and foreign exchange risk arising from normal banking business. The hedge 
accounting strategy adopted by the Group is to utilise a combination of fair value and cash flow hedge approaches as described in 
note 52

• Derivatives held in policyholder funds as permitted by the investment strategies of those funds

The principal derivatives used by the Group are as follows:
•

Interest rate related contracts include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options. An interest rate swap is an 
agreement between two parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments, based upon interest rates defined in the 
contract, without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Forward rate agreements are contracts for the payment of the 
difference between a specified rate of interest and a reference rate, applied to a notional principal amount at a specific date in the 
future. An interest rate option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on 
a future loan or deposit, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date
Exchange rate related contracts include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and options. A forward foreign 
exchange contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified future date at an agreed 
rate. Currency swaps generally involve the exchange of interest payment obligations denominated in different currencies; the 
exchange of principal can be notional or actual. A currency option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the 
obligation, to sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date

•

• Credit derivatives, principally credit default swaps, are used by the Group as part of its trading activity and to manage its own 
exposure to credit risk. A credit default swap is a swap in which one counterparty receives a premium at pre-set intervals in 
consideration for guaranteeing to make a specific payment should a negative credit event take place
Equity derivatives are also used by the Group as part of its equity-based retail product activity to eliminate the Group’s exposure to 
fluctuations in various international stock exchange indices. Index-linked equity options are purchased which give the Group the 
right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified amount of equities, or basket of equities, in the form of published indices on or 
before a specified future date

on purchase or origination, the increase in its carrying value is recognised within gross loans, rather than as a negative impairment allowance.
Includes a charge for methodology and model changes of £60 million, split by stage as £96 million charge for Stage 1, £33 million credit for Stage 2, £1 million credit for 
Stage 3 and £2 million credit for POCI.

3  Relates to the securitisations of legacy Retail mortgages and Retail unsecured loans. 
4  Allowance for expected credit losses on loans and advances to customers as a percentage of gross loans and advances to customers.

The total allowance for impairment losses includes £187 million (2022: £92 million) in respect of residual value impairment and voluntary 
terminations within the Group’s UK Motor Finance business.

Note 24: Allowance for expected credit losses continued
The calculation of the Group’s expected credit loss allowances and provisions against loan commitments and guarantees, which are 
set out above, under IFRS 9 requires the Group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates. The most significant are 
set out below:

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

default and loss given default parameter can be evaluated

Establishing the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

The individual assessment of material cases and the use of judgemental adjustments made to 
impairment modelling processes that adjust inputs, parameters and outputs to reflect risks not 
captured by models

Key source of estimation uncertainty:

Base case and multiple economic scenarios (MES) assumptions, including the rate of unemployment 
and the rate of change of house prices, required for creation of MES scenarios and forward-looking 
credit parameters

Definition of default
The probability of default (PD) of an exposure, both over a 12-month period and over its lifetime, is a key input to the measurement of 
the ECL allowance. Default has occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing significant financial difficulty which 
is likely to affect the ability to repay amounts due. The definition of default adopted by the Group is described in note 2(H) Impairment 
of financial assets. IFRS 9 contains a rebuttable presumption that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due 
which the Group now uses for all its products following changes to the definition of default for UK mortgages on 1 January 2022. In 
addition, other indicators of mortgage default include end-of-term payments on past due interest-only accounts and loans 
considered in probation due to recent arrears or forbearance, aligning the definition of Stage 3 credit-impaired for IFRS 9 to the CRD IV 
prudential regulatory definition of default.

Significant increase in credit risk
An ECL allowance equivalent to 12 months’ expected losses is established against assets in Stage 1; assets classified as Stage 2 carry an 
ECL allowance equivalent to lifetime expected losses. Assets are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2 when there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. Credit-impaired assets are transferred to Stage 3 with a lifetime expected losses 
allowance. The Group uses both quantitative and qualitative indicators to determine whether there has been a SICR for an asset. For 
Retail, the following tables set out the retail master scale (RMS) grade triggers which result in a SICR for financial assets and the PD 
boundaries for each RMS grade.

Probability-weighted annualised lifetime probability of default.

For Commercial a doubling of PD with a minimum increase in PD of 1 per cent and a resulting change in the underlying grade is treated 
as a SICR.

The Group uses the internal credit risk classification and watchlist as qualitative indicators to identify a SICR. The Group does not use 
the low credit risk exemption in its staging assessments. The use of a payment holiday in and of itself has not been judged to indicate a 
significant increase in credit risk, nor forbearance, with the underlying long-term credit risk deemed to be driven by economic 
conditions and captured through the use of forward-looking models. These portfolio level models are capturing the anticipated volume 
of increased defaults and therefore an appropriate assessment of staging and expected credit loss.

All financial assets are assumed to have suffered a SICR if they are more than 30 days past due; credit cards, loans and overdrafts 
financial assets are also assumed to have suffered a SICR if they are in arrears on three or more separate occasions in a rolling 12-
month period. Financial assets are classified as credit-impaired if they are 90 days past due.

A Stage 3 asset that is no longer credit-impaired is transferred back to Stage 2 as no general probation period is applied to assets in 
Stage 3. UK mortgages is an exception to this rule where a probation period is enforced for non-performing, forborne and defaulted 
exposures in accordance with prudential regulation. If an exposure that is classified as Stage 2 no longer meets the SICR criteria, which 
in some cases capture customer behaviour in previous periods, it is moved back to Stage 1.

The setting of precise trigger points combined with risk indicators requires judgement. The use of different trigger points may have a 
material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance. The Group monitors the effectiveness of SICR criteria on an ongoing basis.

Lifetime of an exposure
A range of approaches, segmented by product type, has been adopted by the Group to estimate a product’s expected life. These 
include using the full contractual life and taking into account behavioural factors such as early repayments, extensions and 
refinancing. For non-revolving retail assets, the Group has assumed the expected life for each product to be the time taken for all 
significant losses to be observed. For revolving retail products, the Group has considered the losses beyond the contractual term over 
which the Group is exposed to credit risk. For commercial overdraft facilities, the average behavioural life has been used. Changes to 
the assumed expected lives of the Group’s assets could impact the ECL allowance recognised by the Group. The assessment of SICR 
and corresponding lifetime loss, and the PD, of a financial asset designated as Stage 2, or Stage 3, is dependent on its expected life.

2022 includes £1 million which was previously reported within judgements due to COVID-19. 

Individual assessed ECL
Stage 3 ECL in Commercial Banking is largely assessed on an individual basis by the Business Support Unit using bespoke assessment of 
loss for each specific client based on potential recovery strategies. While these assessments are based on the Group’s latest economic 
view, the use of Group-wide multiple economic scenarios and weightings is not considered appropriate for these cases due to their 
individual characteristics. In place of this, a range of case-specific outcomes are considered with any alternative better or worse 
outcomes that carry a 25 per cent likelihood taken into account in establishing a probability-weighted ECL. At 31 December 2023, 
individually assessed provisions for Commercial Banking were £340 million (2022: £1,008 million) which reflected a range of £291 million 
to £413 million (2022: £908 million to £1,140 million), based on the range of alternative outcomes considered.

Application of judgement in adjustments to modelled ECL
Impairment models fall within the Group’s model risk framework with model monitoring, periodic validation and back testing performed 
on model components, such as probability of default. Limitations in the Group’s impairment models or data inputs may be identified 
through the ongoing assessment and validation of the output of the models. In these circumstances, management applies 
appropriate judgemental adjustments to the ECL to ensure that the overall provision adequately reflects all material risks. These 
adjustments are determined by considering the particular attributes of exposures which have not been adequately captured by the 
impairment models and range from changes to model inputs and parameters, at account level, through to more qualitative post-
model adjustments. Post-model adjustments are not typically calculated under each distinct economic scenario used to generate ECL, 
but on final modelled ECL. All adjustments are reviewed quarterly and are subject to internal review and challenge, including by the 
Audit Committee, to ensure that amounts are appropriately calculated and specific release criteria is identified.

During 2022 the intensifying inflationary pressures, alongside rising interest rates within the Group’s outlook created further risks not 
deemed to be fully captured by ECL models. These pressures played out in 2023 with households experiencing increased interest rates 
and living costs. These risks, whilst still present, are beginning to subside with inflation now reducing and interest rates now believed to 
have peaked. As a result, the judgements held in respect of inflationary and interest rate risks are at a slightly reduced level of 
£186 million (2022: £195 million). Other judgements continue to be applied for broader data and model limitations, both increasing and 
decreasing ECL. These include incremental risks associated with a material devaluation in commercial real estate prices present since 
2022. Given ECL models only capture future price movements, and not the suppressed level, there is a risk that further losses are yet to 
emerge as well as greater risk on specific sector valuations. At 31 December 2023 judgemental adjustments resulted in net additional 
ECL allowances totalling £28 million (2022: £330 million).

Judgements due to inflationary and interest rate risk 
UK mortgages: £61 million (2022: £49 million)
There has been only modest evidence of credit deterioration in the UK mortgages portfolio through 2023 despite the high levels of 
inflation and the rising interest rate environment. Increases in new to arrears and defaults that have emerged are mainly driven by 
variable rate customers, who have experienced material increases in their monthly payment. Mortgage ECL models use UK Bank Rate 
as a driver of predicted defaults largely capturing the stretch on customers due to increased payments, and that has contributed 
materially to the elevated levels of ECL at 31 December 2023. The impact is also partly mitigated by stressed affordability assessments 
applied at loan origination which means most customers have demonstrated the ability to absorb payment shocks. 

However, there remains a potential risk to affordability from continued inflationary pressures combined with higher interest rates, and 
that this may not be fully captured by the Group’s ECL models. The risk remains for customers maturing from low fixed rate deals, the 
accumulated impact on variable rate product holders, lower levels of real household income and rental cover value. Therefore a 
judgemental uplift in ECL has been taken in these segments of the mortgages portfolio, either where inflation is expected to present a 
more material risk, or where segments within the model do not recognise UK Bank Rate as a material driver of predicted defaults.

Credit cards: £92 million (2022: £93 million) and Other Retail: £33 million (2022: £53 million) 
The Group’s ECL models for credit cards and personal loan portfolios use predictions of wage growth to account for future affordability 
stress. As elevated inflation erodes nominal wage growth, adjustments have been made to the econometric models to account for 
real, rather than nominal, income to produce adjusted predicted defaults. These adjustments also include the specific risk to 
affordability from increased housing costs, not captured by CPI. As these adjustments are made within predicted default models, they 
are calculated under each economic scenario and impact the staging of assets through increased PDs.

Alongside these portfolio-wide adjustments management has also made an additional uplift to ECL for customers with lower income 
levels and higher indebtedness deemed most vulnerable to inflationary pressures and interest rate rises. Although this segment of 
customers has not exhibited any greater deterioration to date, uplifts continue to be applied to recognise that continued inflation and 
interest rates risks remain.

Other judgements
UK mortgages: £63 million (2022: £214 million)

These adjustments principally comprise:
Increase in time to repossession: £106 million (2022: £118 million)
Due to the Group suspending mortgage litigation activity between late-2014 and mid-2018 due to policy changes for the treatment of 
arrears, and as collections strategy normalises post COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s experience of possessions data on which our 
models rely is limited. This reflects an adjustment made to allow for an increase in the time assumed between default and 
repossession. A number of defaulted accounts, equivalent in scale to the estimated shortfall in possessions experienced, have had their 
provision coverage judgementally increased to the level of those accounts already in repossession. A further adjustment is made to 
accounts which have been in default for more than 24 months, with an arrears balance increase in the last six months. These accounts 
have their probability of possession judgmentally set to an increased level based on observed historical losses incurred on accounts 
that were of an equivalent status.

Asset recovery values: £nil (2022: £69 million)
The low level of repossession volumes throughout 2020 to 2022 restricted the calibration of Forced Sale Discount (FSD) model 
parameters which uses the achieved sales price experience over the last 12 months. Over this period management partly incorporated 
an increasing trend in FSD rates through judgementally extending the observation period. At December 2023 the level of sales volumes 
observed over the past 12 months has subsequently returned to an adequate level for model calibrations to again be performed 
removing the need for judgemental adjustment.

Adjustment for specific segments: £23 million (2022: £25 million)
The Group monitors risks across specific segments of its portfolios which may not be fully captured through wider collective models. 
The judgement for fire safety and cladding uncertainty has been maintained. Though experience remains limited the risk is considered 
sufficiently material to address through judgement, given that there is evidence of assessed cases having defective cladding, or other 
fire safety issues.

Adjustment for Stage 2 oversensitivity: £(68) million (2022: £nil)
Management has observed an increasing degree of oversensitivity in the number of recently originated low risk accounts moving to 
Stage 2 through the PD trigger mechanism. This arises from a blend of factors currently present, with the combination of the Group’s 
current MES assumptions and the uplift approach applied, disproportionately applying greater forward-looking uplifts to recent 
vintages. Given these accounts have shown no significant movement in observed credit scores and were originated under a similar or 
more adverse economic outlook, an adjustment has been made pending a model rebuild. Management has judgementally increased 
the threshold applied to these accounts by one further grade (to what is set out on page 277) which results in £6 billion of assets being 
moved back to Stage 1 which results in a lower 12-month ECL.

Credit cards: £15 million (2022: £(28) million) and Other Retail: £46 million (2022: £60 million)

These adjustments principally comprise:
Lifetime extension on revolving products: Credit cards: £67 million (2022: £82 million) and Other Retail: £10 million (2022: £14 million)
An adjustment is required to extend the lifetime used for Stage 2 exposures on Retail revolving products from a three-year modelled 
lifetime, which reflected the outcome data available when the ECL models were developed. Incremental defaults beyond year three 
are calculated through the extrapolation of the default trajectory observed throughout the three years and beyond. The judgement 
has reduced slightly in the period following refinement to the discounting methodology applied.

Adjustments to loss given defaults (LGDs): Credit cards: £(50) million (2022: £(96) million) and Other Retail: £37 million (2022: £13 million)
A number of adjustments have been made to the loss given default assumptions used within unsecured and motor credit models. For 
unsecured portfolios, the adjustments reflect the impact of changes in collection debt sale strategy on the Group’s LGD models, 
incorporating up to date customer performance and forward flow debt sale pricing. For motor, the adjustment captures a decline in 
used car prices. 

Commercial Banking: £(282) million (2022: £(111) million)

These adjustments principally comprise:
Corporate insolvency rates: £(292) million (2022: £(35) million)
During 2023, the volume of UK corporate insolvencies continued to exhibit an increasing trend beyond December 2019 levels, revealing 
a marked misalignment between observed UK corporate insolvencies and the Group’s credit performance. This dislocation gives rise to 
uncertainty over the drivers of observed trends and the appropriateness of the Group’s Commercial Banking model response which 
uses observed UK corporate insolvencies data to anchor future loss estimates to. Given the Group’s asset quality remains strong with 
low new defaults, a negative adjustment is applied by using the long-term average rate. The larger negative adjustment in the period 
reflects the widening gap between the increasing industry level and the long-term average rate used.

Adjustments to loss given defaults (LGDs): £(105) million (2022: £(105) million)
Following a review on the loss given default approach for commercial exposures, management deems that ECL should be adjusted to 
mitigate limitations identified in the approach which are causing loss given defaults to be inflated. These include the benefit from 
amortisation of exposures relative to collateral values at default and a move to an exposure-weighted approach being adopted. These 
temporary adjustments will be addressed through future model development.

for the year ended 31 December

Note 24: Allowance for expected credit losses continued
Commercial Real Estate (CRE) price reduction: £67 million (2022: £nil)
Rolling the forecast model forwards into the period has resulted in the material fall in CRE prices seen in late 2022 moving out of the 
model assumptions used to assess ECL. Given the model uses future changes in the metric as a driver of defaults and loss rates there is 
a risk that the model benefit that arises does not reflect the residual risk caused by the sustained low level of prices. Management 
therefore considers it appropriate to judgementally reinstate the CRE price drop within the ECL model assumptions given the materially 
reduced level in CRE prices could still trigger additional defaults Within this adjustment management has refined the potential impact 
on loss rates through capturing updated valuations as well as stressing valuations on specific sectors where evidence suggests 
valuations may lag achievable levels, notably in cases of stressed sale.

Generation of multiple economic scenarios
The estimate of expected credit losses is required to be based on an unbiased expectation of future economic scenarios. The 
approach used to generate the range of future economic scenarios depends on the methodology and judgements adopted. The 
Group’s approach is to start from a defined base case scenario, used for planning purposes, and to generate alternative economic 
scenarios around this base case. The base case scenario is a conditional forecast underpinned by a number of conditioning 
assumptions that reflect the Group’s best view of key future developments. If circumstances appear likely to materially deviate from 
the conditioning assumptions, then the base case scenario is updated.

The base case scenario is central to a range of future economic scenarios generated by simulation of an economic model, for which 
the same conditioning assumptions apply as in the base case scenario. These scenarios are ranked by using estimated relationships 
with industry-wide historical loss data. With the base case already pre-defined, three other scenarios are identified as averages of 
constituent scenarios located around the 15th, 75th and 95th percentiles of the distribution. The full distribution is therefore summarised 
by a practical number of scenarios to run through ECL models representing an upside, the base case, and a downside scenario 
weighted at 30 per cent each, together with a severe downside scenario weighted at 10 per cent. The scenario weights represent the 
distribution of economic scenarios and not subjective views on likelihood. The inclusion of a severe downside scenario with a smaller 
weighting ensures that the non-linearity of losses in the tail of the distribution is adequately captured. Macroeconomic projections may 
employ reversionary techniques to adjust the paths of economic drivers towards long-run equilibria after a reasonable forecast 
horizon. The Group does not use such techniques to force the MES scenarios to revert to the base case planning view. Utilising such 
techniques would be expected to be immaterial for expected credit losses since loss sensitivity is highest over the initial five years of 
the projections. Most assets are expected to have matured, or reached the end of their behavioural life before the five-year horizon.

A forum under the chairmanship of the Chief Economist meets at least quarterly to review and, if appropriate, recommend changes to 
the method by which economic scenarios are generated, for approval by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer. In June 2022, 
the Group judged it appropriate to include an adjusted severe downside scenario to incorporate a high CPI inflation and UK Bank Rate 
profiles and to adopt this adjusted severe downside scenario to calculate the Group’s ECL. This is because the historic macroeconomic 
and loan loss data upon which the scenario model is calibrated imply an association of downside economic outcomes with easier 
monetary policy, and therefore low interest rates. The adjustment is considered to better reflect the risks around the Group’s base case 
view in an economic environment where the potential for supply shocks remains an elevated concern. The Group has continued to 
include a non-modelled severe downside scenario for Group ECL calculations for 31 December 2023 reporting.

Base case and MES economic assumptions
The Group’s base case economic scenario has been updated to reflect ongoing geopolitical developments, and further evidence of 
easing of inflationary pressures allowing shifts to less restrictive monetary policies globally. The Group’s updated base case scenario 
has three conditioning assumptions: first, the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East remain geographically contained and do not lead to 
a major escalation in energy prices; second, China’s economic stabilisation policy is effective; and third, less restrictive monetary and 
fiscal policy throughout this year.

Based on these assumptions and incorporating the economic data published in the fourth quarter, the Group’s base case scenario is 
for slow expansion in GDP and a rise in the unemployment rate alongside modest changes in residential and commercial property 
prices. Following a reduction in inflationary pressures, UK Bank Rate is expected to be lowered during 2024. Risks around this base case 
economic view lie in both directions and are largely captured by the generation of alternative economic scenarios.

The Group has accommodated the latest available information at the reporting date in defining its base case scenario and generating 
alternative economic scenarios. The scenarios include forecasts for key variables in the fourth quarter of 2023, for which actuals may 
have since emerged prior to publication.

Scenarios by year
The key UK economic assumptions made by the Group are shown in the following tables across a number of measures explained 
below.

Annual assumptions
Gross domestic product (GDP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation are presented as an annual change, house price growth and 
commercial real estate price growth are presented as the growth in the respective indices over each year. Unemployment rate and 
UK Bank Rate are averages over the year.

Five-year average
The five-year average reflects the average annual growth rate, or level, over the five-year period. It includes movements within the 
current reporting year, such that the position as at 31 December 2023 covers the five years 2023 to 2027. The inclusion of the reporting 
year within the five-year period reflects the need to predict variables which remain unpublished at the reporting date and recognises 
that credit models utilise both level and annual changes. The use of calendar years maintains a comparability between the annual 
assumptions presented.

Five-year start to peak and trough
The peak or trough for any metric may occur intra year and therefore not be identifiable from the annual assumptions, so they are also 
disclosed. For GDP, house price growth and commercial real estate price growth, the peak, or trough, reflects the highest, or lowest 
cumulative quarterly position reached relative to the start of the five-year period, which as at 31 December 2023 is 1 January 2023. Given 
these metrics may exhibit increases followed by greater falls, the start to trough movements quoted may be smaller than the 
equivalent ‘peak to trough’ movement (and vice versa for start to peak). Unemployment, UK Bank Rate and CPI inflation reflect the 
highest, or lowest, quarterly level reached in the five-year period.

The adjustment to UK Bank Rate and CPI inflation in the severe downside is considered to better reflect the risks around the Group’s base case view in an economic 
environment where supply shocks are the principal concern.

Note 24: Allowance for expected credit losses continued
ECL sensitivity to economic assumptions
The table below shows the Group’s ECL for the probability-weighted, upside, base case, downside and severe downside scenarios, with 
the severe downside scenario incorporating adjustments made to CPI inflation and UK Bank Rate paths. The stage allocation for an 
asset is based on the overall scenario probability-weighted probability of default and hence the staging of assets is constant across all 
the scenarios. In each economic scenario the ECL for individual assessments is held constant reflecting the basis on which they are 
evaluated. Judgemental adjustments applied through changes to model inputs or parameters, or more qualitative post model 
adjustments, are apportioned across the scenarios in proportion to modelled ECL where this better reflects the sensitivity of these 
adjustments to each scenario. The probability-weighted view shows the extent to which a higher ECL allowance has been recognised 
to take account of multiple economic scenarios relative to the base case; the uplift being £678 million compared to £692 million at 
31 December 2022.

The impact of isolated changes in the UK unemployment rate and House Price Index (HPI) has been assessed on a univariate basis. 
Although such changes would not be observed in isolation, as economic indicators tend to be correlated in a coherent scenario, this 
gives insight into the sensitivity of the Group’s ECL to gradual changes in these two critical economic factors. The assessment has been 
made against the base case with staging held flat to the reported probability-weighted view and is assessed through the direct 
impact on modelled ECL and only includes judgemental adjustments applied through changes to model inputs.

The table below shows the impact on the Group’s ECL resulting from a 1 percentage point increase or decrease in the UK 
unemployment rate. The increase or decrease is presented based on the adjustment phased evenly over the first 10 quarters of the 
base case scenario. A more immediate increase or decrease would drive a more material ECL impact as it would be fully reflected in 
both 12-month and lifetime probability of defaults.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 24: Allowance for expected credit losses continued
The table below shows the Group’s ECL and drawn balances for the upside, base case, downside and severe downside scenarios, with 
staging of assets based on each specific scenario probability of default. In each economic scenario the ECL for individual assessments 
is held constant reflecting the basis on which they are evaluated. Judgemental adjustments applied through changes to model inputs 
or parameters, or more qualitative post-model adjustments, are apportioned across the scenarios in proportion to modelled ECL where 
this better reflects the sensitivity of these adjustments to each scenario. A probability-weighted scenario is not shown as this view does 
not reflect the basis on which ECL is calculated. Comparing the probability-weighted ECL in the table above to the base case ECL with 
base case scenario specific staging, as shown in the table below, results in an uplift of £596 million compared to £820 million at 
31 December 2022.

Note 24: Allowance for expected credit losses continued
Assessment of climate risk impacts on ECL
The Group continues to develop capabilities to quantify the potential impact of climate risks on ECL. This includes identifying the 
climate-related risk drivers that could influence future credit losses for loan portfolios that have the highest sensitivity to climate risks 
and commencing the use of more quantitative analysis on the impact of these risk drivers on ECL. This initial assessment has focused 
on specific climate-related risk drivers, with the intention to broaden and further develop the assessment in future years. The approach 
leverages the Group’s climate scenario analysis, to identify the potential physical and transition risk impacts on credit quality. Retail 
mortgages and Commercial Banking portfolios were identified to have the highest sensitivity to climate risk, with both physical and 
transition risk drivers assessed. The assessment used a combination of macroeconomic and sector level modelling alongside similar 
techniques used in estimating judgemental adjustments for non-climate related risks at sector and segment level. 

UK mortgages physical and transition risks – additional costs resulting in affordability pressure for buy-to-let (BTL) borrowers of UK 
properties assessed with a low EPC rating requiring retrofitting to meet potential legislative regulations; and similarly additional costs 
driven by increased flood risk through property repair or rebuild - discussed below. 

Commercial Banking physical and transition risks – chronic and acute impacts of rising temperatures on a company’s costs and 
revenues. Companies adapting to a sudden transition scenario could potentially lead to increased transition costs in operations, direct 
carbon costs, and deteriorating financial performance due to changing consumer perspectives - discussed below.

Macroeconomic and sector scenario risks assessments 
An assessment was performed on the Group’s internally generated economic scenarios used in the measurement of expected credit 
losses against external scenarios published by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) in November 2023. The analysis 
found the Group’s base case, incorporating the impact of assumed policies over a five-year planning horizon, was positioned broadly 
within the range of the NGFS climate scenarios considered to be the most plausible, with limited differences in both directions for key 
impairment drivers. The Group’s MES downside and severe downside together comprising 40 per cent weighting in ECL calculations, are 
generally more severe than the most adverse NGFS scenario (Net Zero 2050). The assessment suggests that no material changes are 
required to the Group’s existing suite of economic scenarios. 

In Retail, the potential incremental impact of climate factors on key economic drivers has been isolated from a range of NGFS 
scenarios management judged most plausible (Current Policies, Delayed Transition and Fragmented World scenarios). The incremental 
risk to ECL was then quantified by overlaying the specific climate impact of these scenarios on macroeconomic drivers, the Group’s 
base case and MES scenarios. Given these more plausible scenarios exhibited very similar impacts, management modelled the ECL 
impact from the Delayed Transition scenario, which assumes strong environmental policies are needed to compensate for the 
absence of early action. The results from the most material portfolios, UK mortgages and credit card ECL models allowed management 
to conclude on an immaterial ECL impact for Retail.

In Commercial Banking, an exploratory top-down analysis using newly developed sectoral modelling was adopted to estimate the ECL 
impact of climate risk on commercial credit conditions. This assessment specifically segmented agriculture, automotive, transport, oil 
and gas and real estate sectors where climate impacts were judged to be more significant. Sector-specific, climate-adjusted credit 
cycle indices (CCI) were used to calculate probability of default and resulting ECL. These adjusted CCI model inputs combined external 
NGFS scenarios with client level valuation impacts where available, alongside historic impairment data. Taking into account 
methodological limitations, the additional ECL required was shown to be immaterial. However, the analysis has been an informative 
exercise to take further forward in 2024. 

Physical and transition risks assessments
In 2023 the Group has progressed with third party consultants to enhance both its access to climate-related data and the 
development of climate modelling capabilities. 

In the UK mortgage portfolio, an affordability stress for customers was applied, by considering a scenario with minimum EPC 
requirements being introduced for the UK and estimated average retrofitting costs to bring the estimated EPC distribution for the 
current UK mortgage portfolio into alignment. The potential default risk from additional costs linked to retrofitting risks was assessed, 
with independent EPC data used to estimate the ECL impact from increased costs to customers for upgrading or retrofitting to meet a 
potential legislative target of EPC rating of C by 2028 for BTL. The provision impact was assessed using sensitivity analysis that utilises 
the relationship between disposable income and probability of default. The impact on ECL has been estimated to be less than 
£5 million for the potential legislative requirement in place for BTL.

Consideration has also been given to flooding risk – a delayed transition climate outlook, out to 2035 was assessed, resulting in over 
80 per cent of the book expected to have no risk of flood damage. The impact on ECL related to the affordability risk from flood 
damage has been estimated to be immaterial. Whilst this supports no judgemental adjustment to ECL being required, the narrow 
scope does not capture the wider impact on loss rates emanating from being located in a high risk area.

The assessments are limited due to the degree of uncertainty underpinning key assumptions used, as well as the developmental 
nature of the data, approach and models used in the quantification. These include, but are not limited to the analyses being restricted 
to PD impacts only, client level valuation impacts not incorporating climate transition plans, only considering the most material hazard 
(flooding) for UK mortgages and more broadly the political landscape, future climate data enhancements and further model 
development.

However, the conclusions made using the Group’s best internal view of likely outcomes across all analyses further strengthens 
management’s view there is a low residual risk of material error or omission in the Group’s financial statements due to climate-related 
risks at present and as a result no adjustments have been made to the ECL measured as at 31 December 2023. The current behavioural 
lives of the Group’s lending dilutes the potential exposure to the later emergence of potential physical climate impacts, with the 
incorporation of climate risk within underwriting assessments in Commercial Banking providing further mitigation on more recent 
originations.

See note 1 regarding changes to presentation.
For acquisitions made prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, cost is included net of amounts amortised up to 31 December 2003.
The charge for the year is recognised in operating expenses (note 14).
Includes core deposit intangible of £nil, cost of £2,770 million and accumulated amortisation of £2,770 million.

Goodwill
On 21 February 2023, Lloyds Bank Asset Finance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired 100 per cent of the ordinary 
share capital of Hamsard 3352 Limited (Tusker), which together with its subsidiaries operates a vehicle management and leasing 
business. The acquisition, which supports the Group’s sustainability ambitions, will enable the Group to expand its salary sacrifice 
proposition within motor finance. The total fair value of the purchase consideration was £331 million, settled in cash, and the business 
has been consolidated into the Group’s results since 21 February 2023. The acquisition is expected to provide significant growth 
opportunities and funding synergies. Goodwill of £143 million has been recognised on the transaction. None of the goodwill recognised 
is deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-related costs of £3 million have been included in operating expenses for the year ended 
31 December 2023. The revenue included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 21 February 2023 contributed 
by Tusker was £171 million, with net loss after tax of £11 million over the same period. Had Tusker been consolidated from 1 January 2023, 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income would have included revenue of £196 million and a net loss after tax of 
£6 million. 

The goodwill held in the Group’s balance sheet is tested at least annually for impairment. For the purposes of impairment testing the 
goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash-generating unit; of the total balance of £2,798 million (2022: £2,655 million), £2,171 million, or 
78 per cent (2022: £2,171 million, 82 per cent) has been allocated to the Life and pensions cash-generating unit; £302 million, or 11 per cent 
(2022: £302 million, 11 per cent) has been allocated to the Credit card cash-generating unit in the Group’s Retail division; and 
£309 million, or 11 per cent (2022: £166 million, 6 per cent) to the Motor business cash-generating units, both in the Group’s Retail division.

The recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows is based on a value-in-use calculation. The calculation uses pre-
tax projections of future cash flows based upon budgets and plans approved by management covering a four-year period, the related 
run-off of existing business in-force and a discount rate (pre-tax) of 11.0 per cent. The budgets and plans are based upon past 
experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes, product mix and margins having regard to expected 
market conditions (which will reflect current and future risks, such as climate and expected economic activity conditions) and 
competitor activity. The discount rate is determined with reference to internal measures and available industry information. New 
business cash flows beyond the four-year period have been extrapolated using a reducing balance growth rate that falls from 3.5 per 
cent to 2.0 per cent after 20 years, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the life assurance market. 
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of 
the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.

The recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to the Motor business is based on a value-in-use calculation using post-tax cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a four-year period and a discount rate (post-
tax) of 10.5 per cent, based on the Group’s cost of equity. This is equivalent to a pre-tax rate of 14.0 per cent. The budgets and plans are 
based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes having regard to expected market 
conditions and competitor activity. The cash flows beyond the four-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3.5 per cent 
which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which the Motor business participates. Management 
believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including from the impacts of climate change or climate-related 
legislation, would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to the Motor business to fall below the balance sheet 
carrying value.

flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a four-year period and a discount rate 
(post-tax) of 10.5 per cent, based on the Group’s cost of equity. This is equivalent to a pre-tax rate of 14.0 per cent. The budgets and 
plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in credit card volumes having regard to 
expected market conditions and competitor activity. The cash flows beyond the four-year period assume 3.5 per cent growth, which 
does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which the Cards business participates. Management believes 
that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating 
to Credit cards to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.

Other intangible assets
The acquired value of in-force non-participating investment contracts includes £93 million (2022: £106 million) in relation to OEIC 
business.

The brand arising from the acquisition of Bank of Scotland in 2009 is recognised on the Group’s balance sheet and has been 
determined to have an indefinite useful life. The carrying value at 31 December 2023 was £380 million (2022: £380 million). The Bank of 
Scotland name has been in existence for over 300 years and there are no indications that the brand should not have an indefinite 
useful life. The recoverable amount has been based on a value-in-use calculation. The calculation uses post-tax projections for a four-
year period of the income generated by the Bank of Scotland cash-generating unit, a discount rate of 10.5 per cent and a future growth 
rate of 3.5 per cent. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the 
recoverable amount of the Bank of Scotland brand to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.

Investment properties
The Group’s investment properties are predominantly held by the Insurance, Pensions and Investments business where they back 
policyholder liabilities. They are valued by external Chartered Surveyors using industry standard techniques based on guidance from 
the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. The valuation methodology includes an assessment of general market conditions and sector 
level transactions and takes account of expectations of occupancy rates, rental income and growth. Property valuations undergo 
individual scrutiny using cash flow analysis to factor in the timing of rental reviews, capital expenditure, lease incentives, dilapidation 
and operating expenses; these reviews utilise both observable and unobservable inputs. Within the fair value hierarchy, all of the 
Group’s investment properties are categorised as level 3 (see note 21 for details of levels in the fair value hierarchy). The table below 
analyses movements in level 3 investment properties, which are carried at fair value.

Covered bonds and securitisation programmes
At 31 December 2023, the bonds held by external parties and those held internally, were secured on certain loans and advances to 
customers amounting to £27,019 million (2022: £28,231 million) which have been assigned to bankruptcy remote limited liability 
partnerships to provide security for issues of covered bonds by the Group. The Group retains all of the risks and rewards associated 
with these loans and the partnerships are consolidated fully with the loans retained on the Group’s balance sheet and the related 
covered bonds in issue included within debt securities in issue at amortised cost.

The Group has two covered bond programmes, for which limited liability partnerships have been established to ring-fence asset pools 
and guarantee the covered bonds issued by the Group. At the reporting date the Group had over-collateralised these programmes to 
meet the terms of the programmes, to secure the rating of the covered bonds and to provide operational flexibility. From time to time, 
the obligations of the Group to provide collateral may increase due to the formal requirements of the programmes. The Group may 
also voluntarily contribute collateral to support the ratings of the covered bonds.

At 31 December 2023, the Group’s securitisation notes in issue held by external parties includes £23 million at fair value through profit or 
loss (2022: £26 million). Those notes held internally, are secured on loans and advances to customers amounting to £30,716 million (2022: 
£29,384 million), the majority of which have been sold by subsidiary companies to bankruptcy remote structured entities. As the 
structured entities are funded by the issue of debt on terms whereby the majority of the risks and rewards of the portfolio are retained 
by the subsidiary, the structured entities are consolidated fully and all of these loans are retained on the Group’s balance sheet, with 
the related notes in issue included within debt securities in issue at amortised cost.

Certain loans and advances to customers have been assigned to bankruptcy remote limited liability partnerships.

Cash deposits of £3,794 million (2022: £3,896 million) which support the debt securities issued by the structured entities, the term 
advances related to covered bonds and other legal obligations, are held by the Group. Additionally, the Group has certain contractual 
arrangements to provide liquidity facilities to some of these structured entities. At 31 December 2023 these obligations had not been 
triggered; the maximum exposure under these facilities was £29 million (2022: £25 million). 

The Group recognises the full liabilities associated with its securitisation and covered bond programmes within debt securities in issue, 
although the obligations of the Group in respect of its securitisation issuances are limited to the cash flows generated from the 
underlying assets. The Group could be required to provide additional support to a number of the securitisation programmes to support 
the credit ratings of the debt securities issued, in the form of increased cash reserves and the holding of subordinated notes. Further, 
certain programmes contain contractual obligations that require the Group to repurchase assets should they become credit-impaired 
or as otherwise required by the transaction documents. The Group has not provided financial or other support by voluntarily offering to 
repurchase assets from any of its public securitisation programmes during 2023 (2022: none).

The Group estimates future cash flows based on which cash flows are expected and the probability that they will occur as at the 
measurement date. The Group uses information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions to inform 
these expectations. The Group’s estimate of future cash flows is the mean of a range of scenarios that reflect the full range of possible 
outcomes, considering all reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date. The probability-weighted average 
of the future cash flows is calculated using a deterministic scenario representing the probability-weighted mean of a range of 
scenarios.

The Group uses assumptions to develop estimates of future cash flows. These assumptions are reassessed at each reported date to 
reflect conditions existing at the measurement date.

The Group has applied judgment in determining the characteristics which make a product illiquid, the level of illiquidity premium to 
apply to the discount rate of different products and how the illiquidity premium is determined, where material. 

The products to which an illiquidity premium has been applied to the discount rate are annuity contracts, due to the illiquid nature of 
their cash flows, certain reinsurance contracts held where the underlying contracts are annuity contracts, due to the transfer of 
longevity risk to the reinsurer, and whole of life protection contracts, due to the inherent policyholder value and zero surrender option.

For annuity contracts, at initial recognition, the illiquidity premium is calculated with reference to a strategic portfolio of assets, and 
subsequently measured to reflect the mix of actual assets backing annuity contracts, adjusted to reflect the impacts of transition from 
initial recognition. To reflect differences between the characteristics of insurance contracts and the derivation of discount rates based 
on a reference portfolio, adjustments for credit risk are required, and the Group uses the fundamental spread to maintain consistency 
with its Solvency II approach. For protection contracts, the illiquidity premium is based on the spread on a covered bond index.

The average yield curves (GBP currency) that were used to discount the estimates of future cash flows that do not vary based on the 
returns of the underlying items are as follows:

2023

2022

1 year

 5.37

The Group has also applied judgement to determine if a drawdown feature added to its longstanding and workplace pension products 
was a modification that required derecognition. See note 10 for more details. 

The Group determines the quantity of benefits provided under each contract as follows:

Product

Basis

With-Profits and unit linked

1
Policyholder account value

Annuities

2
: defined amount payable
Pre-vesting date
Post-vesting date: annuity payout

1  Or the guaranteed benefits, if higher.
2 

Immediate annuities have no pre-vesting date period.

Mortality
The mortality assumptions for the main classes of business are set with regard to recent Group experience and general industry trends, 
all of which are adjusted for smoker status and age/gender specific factors. The base mortality tables used for the annuities business 
for the year ended 31 December 2023 and the prior period were selected from the bespoke mortality tables. The mortality 
improvements adopt the 100% Bespoke tables and CMI 2022_{M/F}_(7.25)_{2.0/1.8}%_{0.0/0.2}A_2013 for the year ended 31 December 2023 
and the 100% Bespoke tables and CMI 2021_{M/F}_(7.25)_{2.0/1.8}%_{0.0/0.2}A_2013 for the prior period.

Lapse rates
Lapse rates refer to the rate of policy termination or the rate at which policyholders stop paying regular premiums due under the 
contract. Historical persistency experience is analysed using statistical techniques. As experience can vary considerably between 
different product types and for contracts that have been in force for different periods, the data is broken down into broadly 
homogeneous groups for the purposes of determining the Group’s lapse rate in determining the assumptions, which are set on a best 
estimates basis, based on investigations of historical experience with some expert judgement overlays reflecting expectations of future 
trends and other external data. The lapse rates for workplace pensions range from 0.8 per cent to 14.6 per cent (2022: 0.8 per cent to 
15.7 per cent) and for longstanding business range from 0.5 per cent to 74.1 per cent (2022: 0.5 per cent to 74.1 per cent), the wide range 
being a result of the age and variety of products.

2  Contracts initially recognised in the year, include present value of future cash flows of £2,281 million, risk adjustment of £(551) million and CSM of £(1,730) million relating to 

3 

contracts that were modified to add a drawdown feature and recognised as new contracts.
The Group derecognised present value of future cash flows of £2,175 million, risk adjustment of £(534) million and CSM of £(399) million relating to contracts that were 
derecognised due to a contract modification to add a drawdown feature. The amounts derecognised are included within changes in estimates that adjust the CSM and 
changes that result in losses and reversal of losses on onerous contracts. A loss on contract derecognition modification of £1,242 million arose and was recognised in 
insurance service expense. Further details are provided in note 10.

Note 32: Reconciliation of measurement components of insurance contract balances continued
The Group estimates the risk adjustment separately from other components of the fulfilment cash flows using an explicit margins 
approach such that a confidence level scenario is used to determine the margins to be applied to the best estimate assumptions. The 
risk adjustment represents the difference in the value of the best estimate cash flows with and without these margins. The risk 
adjustment is calculated at a policy level.

The confidence level corresponding to the risk adjustment is 90 per cent (2022: 90 per cent). The risk adjustment is calibrated to the 
value at risk over a one-year time horizon at this confidence level for non-financial risks. This is translated, using statistical 
approximations, into an equivalent confidence level on a value at risk basis over the expected lifetime of in-force policies of 
approximately 70 per cent (2022: 70 per cent) at end of the reporting period.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 36: Life insurance sensitivity analysis
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

Key sources of estimation uncertainty:

Future investment returns, mortality rates and expenses, annuitant mortality, future maintenance and 
investment expenses, widening of credit default spreads and increase in illiquidity premia

The following table demonstrates the effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on profit before tax and equity 
disclosed in these financial statements assuming that the other assumptions remain unchanged. In practice this is unlikely to occur, 
and changes in some assumptions may be correlated. The sensitivities below are on a gross of reinsurance basis, which do not differ 
materially from the sensitivities net of reinsurance. These amounts include movements in liabilities relating to insurance and 
participating investment contracts and related assets in order to demonstrate the impacts on shareholder profit and equity. Therefore, 
these sensitivities have not been applied to the proportion of assets and liabilities where the risks are borne by the policyholder and 
where assets and liabilities are well matched so as not to have a significant impact on shareholder profit.

This sensitivity shows the impact on the annuity and deferred annuity business of reducing/increasing mortality rates to 95/105 per cent of the expected rate. 
This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing/increasing maintenance expenses and investment expenses to 90/110 per cent of the expected rate.
This sensitivity shows the impact of a 100 basis point increase/decrease in the risk-free rate, including illiquidity premia. This impacts both the related assets and liabilities.
This sensitivity shows the impact of a 25 basis point increase in credit default spreads on corporate bonds and the corresponding reduction in market values. Swap 
curves, the risk-free rate and illiquidity premia are all assumed to be unchanged and therefore this sensitivity impacts the related assets.
This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing/increasing mortality and morbidity rates on non-annuity business to 95/105 per cent of the expected rate.

Note 38: Provisions
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

Critical judgement:

Determining whether a present obligation exists and whether it is more likely than not that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle that obligation

Key sources of estimation uncertainty:

Populations impacted, response rates and uphold rates

Determining the amount of the provisions, which represent management’s best estimate of the cost of settling these issues, requires 
the exercise of significant judgement and estimation. It will often be necessary to form a view on matters which are inherently 
uncertain, such as the scope of reviews required by regulators, and to estimate the number of future complaints, the extent to which 
they will be upheld, the average cost of redress and the impact of decisions reached by legal and other review processes that may be 
relevant to claims received. Consequently the continued appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis 
against actual experience and other relevant evidence and adjustments made to the provisions where appropriate.

Provisions for financial commitments and guarantees
Provisions are recognised for expected credit losses on undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantees.

Regulatory and legal provisions 
In the course of its business, the Group is engaged on a regular basis in discussions with UK and overseas regulators and other 
governmental authorities on a range of matters, including legal and regulatory reviews and, from time to time, enforcement 
investigations (including in relation to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as those relating to prudential regulation, 
consumer protection, investment advice, business conduct, systems and controls, environmental, competition/anti-trust, tax, anti-
bribery, anti-money laundering and sanctions). Any matters discussed or identified during such discussions and inquiries may result in, 
among other things, further inquiry or investigation, other action being taken by governmental and/or regulatory authorities, increased 
costs being incurred by the Group, remediation of systems and controls, public or private censure, restriction of the Group’s business 
activities and/or fines. The Group also receives complaints in connection with its past conduct and claims brought by or on behalf of 
current and former employees, customers (including their appointed representatives), investors and other third parties and is subject 
to legal proceedings and other legal actions from time to time. Any events or circumstances disclosed could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s financial position, operations or cash flows. Provisions are held where the Group can reliably estimate a probable 
outflow of economic resources. The ultimate liability of the Group may be significantly more, or less, than the amount of any provision 
recognised. If the Group is unable to determine a reliable estimate, a contingent liability is disclosed. The recognition of a provision 
does not amount to an admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of the Group. During the year ended 31 December 2023 the 
Group charged a further £675 million in respect of legal actions and other regulatory matters and the unutilised balance at 
31 December 2023 was £1,105 million (31 December 2022: £803 million). The most significant items are outlined below.

Motor commission review
A £450 million provision, all recognised in the fourth quarter, has been established for the potential impact of the recently announced 
FCA review into historical motor finance commission arrangements and sales.

As disclosed in previous periods, the Group continues to receive a number of court claims and complaints in respect of motor finance 
commissions and is actively engaging with the FOS in its assessment of these complaints. On 10 January 2024, the FOS issued its Final 
Decision on a complaint relating to the Group, as well as decisions relating to other industry participants. On 11 January 2024, the FCA 
announced a section 166 review of historical motor finance commission arrangements and sales and plans to communicate a 
decision on next steps in the third quarter of 2024 on the basis of the evidence collated in the review. The FCA has indicated that such 
steps could include establishing an industry-wide consumer redress scheme and/or applying to the Financial Markets Test Case 
Scheme, to help resolve any contested legal issues of general importance.

Following the FCA Motor Market Review in March 2019, the FCA issued a policy statement in July 2020 prohibiting the use of discretionary 
commission models from 28 January 2021, which the Group adhered to. The Group continues to believe that its historical practices were 
compliant with the law and regulations in place at that time. 

As noted above, in response to both the FOS decisions and the FCA announcement the Group has recognised a charge of £450 million. 
This includes estimates for operational and legal costs, including litigation costs, together with estimates for potential awards, based 
on various scenarios using a range of assumptions, including for example, commission models, commission rates, applicable time 
periods (between 2007 and 2021), response rates and uphold rates. Costs and awards could arise in the event that the FCA concludes 
there has been misconduct and customer loss that requires remediation, or from adverse litigation decisions. However, while the FCA 
review is progressing there is significant uncertainty as to the extent of misconduct and customer loss, if any, the nature and extent of 
any remediation action, if required, and its timing. The ultimate financial impact could therefore materially differ from the amount 
provided, both higher or lower. The Group welcomes the FCA intervention through an independent section 166 review.

HBOS Reading – review
The Group continues to apply the recommendations from Sir Ross Cranston’s review, issued in December 2019, including a 
reassessment of direct and consequential losses by an independent panel (the Foskett Panel), an extension of debt relief and a wider 
definition of de facto directors. The Foskett Panel’s full scope and methodology was published on 7 July 2020. The Foskett Panel’s stated 
objective is to consider cases via a non-legalistic and fair process and to make its decisions in a generous, fair and common sense 
manner, assessing claims against an expanded definition of the fraud and on a lower evidential basis.

In June 2022, the Foskett Panel announced an alternative option, in the form of a fixed sum award which could be accepted as an 
alternative to participation in the full re-review process, to support earlier resolution of claims for those deemed by the Foskett Panel to 
be victims of the fraud. Around 90 per cent of the population have now had outcomes via this new process. The provision is unchanged 
in 2023. Notwithstanding the settled claims and the increase in outcomes which builds confidence in the full estimated cost, 
uncertainties remain and the final outcome could be different from the current provision once the re-review is concluded by the 
Foskett Panel. There is no confirmed timeline for the completion of the Foskett Panel re-review process nor the review by Dame Linda 
Dobbs. The Group is committed to implementing Sir Ross Cranston’s recommendations in full.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 38: Provisions continued
Payment protection insurance (PPI)
The Group has incurred costs for PPI over a number of years totalling £21,960 million. The Group continues to challenge PPI litigation 
cases, with mainly legal fees and operational costs associated with litigation activity recognised within regulatory and legal provisions.

Customer claims in relation to insurance branch business in Germany
The Group continues to receive claims from customers in Germany relating to policies issued by Clerical Medical Investment Group 
Limited (subsequently renamed Scottish Widows Limited), with smaller numbers of claims received from customers in Austria and Italy. 
The total provision made to 31 December 2023, was £709 million (31 December 2022: £709 million) with £13 million utilisation of the 
provision during the year, leaving an unutilised provision at 31 December 2023 of £75 million. The ultimate financial effect, which could 
be significantly different from the current provision, will be known only once all relevant claims have been resolved.

Other
The Group carries provisions of £137 million (2022: £112 million) in respect of dilapidations, rent reviews and other property-related 
matters.

Provisions are also made for staff and other costs related to Group restructuring initiatives at the point at which the Group becomes 
committed to the expenditure; at 31 December 2023 provisions of £245 million (31 December 2022: £112 million) were held.

The Group carries provisions of £46 million (2022: £86 million) for indemnities and other matters relating to legacy business disposals in 
prior years. Whilst there remains significant uncertainty as to the timing of the utilisation of the provisions, the Group expects the 
majority of the remaining provisions to have been utilised by 31 December 2026.

Issuances in the year generated cash inflows of £1,417 million (2022: £838 million); the repurchases and redemptions resulted in cash outflows of £1,745 million (2022: 
£2,216 million).

2  Other movements include hedge accounting movements and cash payments in respect of interest on subordinated liabilities in the year amounting to £623 million 

(2022: £603 million) offset by the interest expense in respect of subordinated liabilities of £712 million (2022: £681 million).

Note 39: Subordinated liabilities continued
Certain of the above securities were issued or redeemed under exchange offers, which did not result in an extinguishment of the 
original financial liability for accounting purposes.

These securities will, in the event of the winding-up of the issuer, be subordinated to the claims of depositors and all other creditors of 
the issuer, other than creditors whose claims rank equally with, or are junior to, the claims of the holders of the subordinated liabilities. 
The subordination of specific subordinated liabilities is determined in respect of the issuer and any guarantors of that liability. The 
claims of holders of preference shares and preferred securities are generally junior to those of the holders of undated subordinated 
liabilities, which in turn are junior to the claims of holders of the dated subordinated liabilities. The Group has not had any defaults of 
principal or interest or other breaches with respect to its subordinated liabilities during 2023 (2022: none).

Companies House on 12 January 2005, a copy of which is available from Companies House (www.companieshouse.gov.uk), and, in 
respect of the other classes of preference shares, in the prospectus dated 20 November 2008 and published on the National Storage 
Mechanism on that date, a copy of which prospectus is available on the National Storage Mechanism (www.data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/

All of the Company’s various classes of preference shares (apart from 400 Non-Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares of 
GBP0.25 each) are listed (i.e. the free float percentage of the listed preference shares is over 99.99 per cent of all preference shares in 
issue, by both number of shares and nominal value) and none of those shares have any multiple or unequal voting rights.

Ordinary shares
As permitted by the Companies Act 2006, the Company removed references to authorised share capital from its articles of association 
at the annual general meeting on 5 June 2009. This change took effect from 1 October 2009. There are no restrictions on the transfer of 
shares in the Company other than as set out in the articles of association and:
• Certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by law and regulations (for example, insider trading laws)
• Where directors and certain employees of the Company require the approval of the Company to deal in the Company’s shares
•

Pursuant to the rules of some of the Company’s employee share plans where certain restrictions may apply while the shares are 
subject to the plans

Where, under an employee share plan operated by the Company, participants are the beneficial owners of shares but not the 
registered owners, the voting rights are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the participant. Outstanding 
awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any 
performance conditions at that time.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 40: Share capital continued
All of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital is listed (i.e. the free float percentage of the ordinary shares is 100 per cent) and 
none of the shares have any multiple or unequal voting rights; each share carries one vote. In addition, the Company is not aware of 
any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights. 

The directors have authority to allot and issue ordinary and preference shares and to make market purchases of ordinary and 
preference shares as granted at the annual general meeting on 18 May 2023. The authority to issue shares and the authority to make 
market purchases of shares will expire at the next annual general meeting. Shareholders will be asked, at the annual general meeting, 
to give similar authorities.

Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every holder of 
shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member present and entitled to vote has 
one vote for every share held. The special rights attached to any class of shares in the Company may, subject to the statutory 
provisions, be varied or abrogated either with the consent in writing of the holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued 
shares of the class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of the class 
(but not otherwise).

The holders of ordinary shares, who held 100 per cent of the total ordinary share capital at 31 December 2023, are entitled to receive the 
Company’s report and accounts, attend, speak and vote at general meetings and appoint proxies to exercise voting rights. Holders of 
ordinary shares may also receive a dividend (subject to the provisions of the Company’s articles of association) and on a winding-up 
may share in the assets of the Company.

The rights and obligations attached to the Company’s ordinary shares are set out in the Company’s articles of association, a copy of 
which can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/group-overview/corporate-governance.html.

Preference shares
The Company has in issue various classes of preference shares which are all classified as liabilities under accounting standards and 
which are included in note 39.

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the year, which has been calculated after deducting 180 million (2022: 198 million; 2021: 19 million) 
ordinary shares representing the Group’s holdings of own shares in respect of employee share schemes.

For the calculation of diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares that arise in respect of share options and awards granted to employees. The number 
of shares that could have been acquired at the annual average price of the Company’s shares based on the monetary value of the 
subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards is determined. This is deducted from the number of shares 
issuable under such options and awards to leave a residual bonus amount of shares which are added to the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue, but no adjustment is made to the profit attributable to equity shareholders.

There were 41 million anti-dilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share (2022: 
63 million; 2021: 143 million).

redemption an amount of £17 million was transferred from the distributable merger reserve to the capital redemption reserve and £597 million was transferred from the 
distributable merger reserve to the share premium account, with these amounts representing the nominal value of the shares redeemed and premium upon original 
issuance respectively.

The merger reserve primarily comprises the premium on shares issued in January 2009 as part of the recapitalisation of the Group and 
the acquisition of HBOS plc.

The capital redemption reserve represents transfers from distributable reserves in accordance with companies’ legislation upon the 
redemption of ordinary and preference share capital.

The revaluation reserves in respect of debt securities and equity shares held at fair value through other comprehensive income 
represent the cumulative after-tax unrealised change in the fair value of financial assets so classified since initial recognition; or in the 
case of financial assets obtained on acquisitions of businesses, since the date of acquisition.

The cash flow hedging reserve represents the cumulative after-tax gains and losses on effective cash flow hedging instruments that 
will be reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.

The foreign currency translation reserve represents the cumulative after-tax gains and losses on the translation of foreign operations 
and exchange differences arising on financial instruments designated as hedges of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations.

The payment of dividends by subsidiaries and the ability of members of the Group to lend money to other members of the Group may 
be subject to regulatory or legal restrictions, the availability of reserves and the financial and operating performance of the entity. A 
number of Group subsidiaries, principally those with banking and insurance activities, are subject to regulatory capital requirements 
which require minimum amounts of capital to be maintained relative to their size and risk. The Group actively manages the capital of 
its subsidiaries, which includes monitoring the regulatory capital ratios for its banking and insurance subsidiaries and, on a 
consolidated basis, the Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group, against approved risk appetite levels.

The AT1 securities are Fixed Rate Resetting Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities with no fixed maturity or 
redemption date. The principal terms of the AT1 securities are described below:
•

The securities rank behind the claims against Lloyds Banking Group plc of (a) unsubordinated creditors, (b) claims which are, or are 
expressed to be, subordinated to the claims of unsubordinated creditors of Lloyds Banking Group plc but not further or otherwise, or 
(c) whose claims are, or are expressed to be, junior to the claims of other creditors of Lloyds Banking Group, whether subordinated or 
unsubordinated, other than those whose claims rank, or are expressed to rank, pari passu with, or junior to, the claims of the holders 
of the AT1 securities in a winding-up occurring prior to a conversion event being triggered
The securities bear a fixed rate of interest until the first reset date. After the first reset date or any reset date thereafter, in the event 
that they are not redeemed, the AT1 securities will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on 
market rates
Interest on the securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of Lloyds Banking Group plc, and Lloyds Banking Group 
plc may at any time elect to cancel any interest payment (or any part thereof) which would otherwise be payable on any interest 
payment date. There are also certain restrictions on the payment of interest as specified in the terms
The securities are undated and are repayable, at the option of Lloyds Banking Group plc, in whole at the first call date or period, or 
on any fifth anniversary after the first call date or period. In addition, the AT1 securities are repayable, at the option of Lloyds Banking 
Group plc, in whole for certain regulatory or tax reasons. Any repayments require the prior consent of the PRA
The securities convert into ordinary shares of Lloyds Banking Group plc, at a pre-determined price, should the CET1 ratio of the Group 
fall below 7.0 per cent

Note 46: Dividends on ordinary shares
The directors have recommended a final dividend, which is subject to approval by the shareholders at the annual general meeting on 
16 May 2024, of 1.84 pence per ordinary share (2022: 1.60 pence per ordinary share), equivalent to £1,169 million, before the impact of any 
cancellations of shares under the Company’s buyback programme (2022: £1,059 million, following cancellations of shares under the 
Company’s 2023 buyback programme up to the record date), which will be paid on 21 May 2024. These financial statements do not 
reflect the recommended dividend.

Note 47: Related party transactions continued
Subsidiaries
Details of the Group’s subsidiaries and related undertakings are given on pages 344 to 356. In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated 
Financial Statements, transactions and balances with subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation.

Pension funds
The Group provides banking and some investment management services to certain of its pension funds. At 31 December 2023, 
customer deposits of £133 million (2022: £155 million) related to the Group’s pension funds. As disclosed in note 16, the Group’s main 
pension funds have entered into a longevity insurance arrangement that was structured as a pass-through involving Scottish Widows.

Collective investment vehicles
The Group manages 129 (2022: 125) collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) and of these 
68 (2022: 73) are consolidated. The Group invested £55 million (2022: £196 million) and redeemed £210 million (2022: £486 million) in the 
unconsolidated collective investment vehicles during the year and had investments, at fair value, of £1,448 million (2022: £1,491 million) at 
31 December. The Group earned fees of £72 million from the unconsolidated collective investment vehicles during 2023 (2022: 
£80 million).

Joint ventures and associates
At 31 December 2023 there were loans and advances to customers of £47 million (2022: £21 million) outstanding and balances within 
customer deposits of £6 million (2022: £58 million) relating to joint ventures and associates.

During the year the Group paid fees of £4 million (2022: £5 million) to its Schroders Personal Wealth joint venture and no payment was 
made (2022: £18 million) under the terms of agreements put in place on the establishment of the joint venture.

In addition to the above balances, the Group has a number of other associates held by its venture capital business that it accounts for 
at fair value through profit or loss. At 31 December 2023, these companies had total assets of £7,519 million (2022: £4,709 million), total 
liabilities of £5,927 million (2022: £5,557 million) and for the year ended 31 December 2023 had turnover of £3,381 million (2022: 
£4,196 million) and made a net loss of £293 million (2022: net loss of £228 million). In addition, the Group has provided £1,574 million (2022: 
£1,466 million) of financing to these companies on which it received £120 million (2022: £98 million) of interest income in the year.

Note 48: Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees
Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees arising from the banking business
At 31 December 2023 contingent liabilities, such as performance bonds and letters of credit, arising from the banking business were 
£2,849 million (2022: £2,986 million).

The contingent liabilities of the Group arise in the normal course of its banking business and it is not practicable to quantify their future 
financial effect. Total commitments and guarantees were £143,319 million (2022: £143,795 million), of which in respect of undrawn formal 
standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend, £75,080 million (2022: £74,692 million) was irrevocable.

Capital commitments
Excluding commitments in respect of investment property (note 27), capital expenditure contracted but not provided for at 
31 December 2023 amounted to £1,240 million (2022: £1,663 million) and related to assets to be leased to customers under operating 
leases. The Group’s management is confident that future net revenues and funding will be sufficient to cover these commitments.

Interchange fees
With respect to multi-lateral interchange fees (MIFs), the Group is not a party in the ongoing or threatened litigation which involves the 
card schemes Visa and Mastercard (as described below). However, the Group is a member/licensee of Visa and Mastercard and other 
card schemes. The litigation in question is as follows:
•

Litigation brought by or on behalf of retailers against both Visa and Mastercard in the English Courts, in which retailers are seeking 
damages on grounds that Visa and Mastercard’s MIFs breached competition law (this includes a judgment of the Supreme Court in 
June 2020 upholding the Court of Appeal’s finding in 2018 that certain historic interchange arrangements of Mastercard and Visa 
infringed competition law)
Litigation brought on behalf of UK consumers in the English Courts against Mastercard

•

Any impact on the Group of the litigation against Visa and Mastercard remains uncertain at this time, such that it is not practicable for 
the Group to provide an estimate of any potential financial effect. Insofar as Visa is required to pay damages to retailers for 
interchange fees set prior to June 2016, contractual arrangements to allocate liability have been agreed between various UK banks 
(including the Group) and Visa Inc, as part of Visa Inc’s acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016. These arrangements cap the maximum 
amount of liability to which the Group may be subject and this cap is set at the cash consideration received by the Group for the sale 
of its stake in Visa Europe to Visa Inc in 2016. In 2016, the Group received Visa preference shares as part of the consideration for the sale 
of its shares in Visa Europe. A release assessment is carried out by Visa on certain anniversaries of the sale (in line with the Visa Europe 
sale documentation) and as a result, some Visa preference shares may be converted into Visa Inc Class A common stock from time to 
time. Any such release and any subsequent sale of Visa common stock does not impact the contingent liability.

LIBOR and other trading rates
Certain Group companies, together with other panel banks, have been named as defendants in ongoing private lawsuits, including 
purported class action suits, in the US in connection with their roles as panel banks contributing to the setting of US Dollar, Japanese 
Yen and Sterling London Interbank Offered Rate and the Australian BBSW reference rate.

Certain Group companies are also named as defendants in (i) UK-based claims, and (ii) two Dutch class actions, raising LIBOR 
manipulation allegations. A number of claims against the Group in the UK relating to the alleged mis-sale of interest rate hedging 
products also include allegations of LIBOR manipulation.

It is currently not possible to predict the scope and ultimate outcome on the Group of any private lawsuits or ongoing related 
challenges to the interpretation or validity of any of the Group’s contractual arrangements, including their timing and scale. As such, it 
is not practicable to provide an estimate of any potential financial effect.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 48: Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees continued
Tax authorities
The Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which 
ceased trading on 31 December 2010. In 2013, HMRC informed the Group that its interpretation of the UK rules means that the group relief 
is not available. In 2020, HMRC concluded its enquiry into the matter and issued a closure notice. The Group’s interpretation of the UK 
rules has not changed and hence it appealed to the First Tier Tax Tribunal, with a hearing having taken place in May 2023. If the final 
determination of the matter by the judicial process is that HMRC’s position is correct, management believes that this would result in an 
increase in current tax liabilities of approximately £920 million (including interest) and a reduction in the Group’s deferred tax asset of 
approximately £285 million. The Group, following conclusion of the hearing and having taken appropriate advice, does not consider 
that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.

There are a number of other open matters on which the Group is in discussions with HMRC (including the tax treatment of certain costs 
arising from the divestment of TSB Banking Group plc), none of which is expected to have a material impact on the financial position of 
the Group.

FCA investigation into the Group’s anti-money laundering control framework
The FCA has opened an investigation into the Group’s compliance with domestic UK money laundering regulations and the FCA’s rules 
and Principles for Businesses, with a focus on aspects of its anti-money laundering control framework. The Group has been fully co-
operating with the investigation. It is not currently possible to estimate the potential financial impact, if any, to the Group.

Other legal actions and regulatory matters
In addition, in the course of its business the Group is subject to other complaints and threatened or actual legal proceedings (including 
class or group action claims) brought by or on behalf of current or former employees, customers (including their appointed 
representatives), investors or other third parties, as well as legal and regulatory reviews, enquiries and examinations, requests for 
information, audits, challenges, investigations and enforcement actions, which could relate to a number of issues. This includes matters 
in relation to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as those relating to prudential regulation, consumer protection, 
investment advice, business conduct, systems and controls, environmental, competition/anti-trust, tax, anti-bribery, anti-money 
laundering and sanctions, some of which may be beyond the Group’s control, both in the UK and overseas. Where material, such 
matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the 
likelihood of the Group incurring a liability. The Group does not currently expect the final outcome of any such case to have a material 
adverse effect on its financial position, operations or cash flows. Where there is a contingent liability related to an existing provision the 
relevant disclosures are included within note 38.

Note 49: Structured entities
The Group’s interests in structured entities are both consolidated and unconsolidated. Details of the Group’s interests in consolidated 
structured entities are set out in note 29 for securitisations and covered bond vehicles, note 16 for structured entities associated with 
the Group’s pension schemes, and below in part (A) and (B). Details of the Group’s interests in unconsolidated structured entities are 
included below in part (C).

(A)  Asset-backed conduits
In addition to the structured entities discussed in note 29, which are used for securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group 
sponsors an active asset-backed conduit, Cancara, which invests in client receivables and debt securities. The total consolidated 
exposure of Cancara at 31 December 2023 was £2,808 million (2022: £2,357 million), comprising £1,521 million of loans and advances 
(2022: £1,464 million), £698 million of debt securities (2022: £850 million) and £589 million of financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss (2022: £43 million).

All lending assets and debt securities held by the Group in Cancara are restricted in use, as they are held by the collateral agent for the 
benefit of the commercial paper investors and the liquidity providers only. The Group provides liquidity facilities to Cancara under 
terms that are usual and customary for standard lending activities in the normal course of the Group’s banking activities. During 2023 
there have continued to be planned drawdowns on certain liquidity facilities for balance sheet management purposes, supporting the 
programme to provide funding alongside the proceeds of the asset-backed commercial paper issuance. The Group could be asked to 
provide support under the contractual terms of these arrangements including, for example, if Cancara experienced a shortfall in 
external funding, which may occur in the event of market disruption.

The external assets in Cancara are consolidated in the Group’s financial statements.

(B)  Consolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships
The assets of the Insurance business held in consolidated collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies 
and limited partnerships, are not directly available for use by the Group. However, the Group’s investment in the majority of these 
collective investment vehicles is readily realisable. As at 31 December 2023, the total carrying value of these consolidated collective 
investment vehicle assets and liabilities held by the Group was £58,351 million (2022: £54,749 million).

The Group has no contractual arrangements (such as liquidity facilities) that would require it to provide financial or other support to 
the consolidated collective investment vehicles; the Group has not previously provided such support and has no current intentions to 
provide such support.

(C)  Unconsolidated structured entities
The Group considers itself the sponsor of a structured entity where it is primarily involved in the design and establishment of the 
structured entity and further where the Group transfers assets to the structured entity, markets products associated with the structured 
entity in its own name and/or provides guarantees regarding the structured entity’s performance.

The Group sponsors a range of diverse investment funds and limited partnerships where it acts as the fund manager or equivalent 
decision-maker and markets the funds under one of the Group’s brands.

During the year the Group has not provided any non-contractual financial or other support to these entities and has no current 
intention of providing any non-contractual financial or other support in the future.

The fee income earned from unconsolidated structured entities that the Group sponsors but does not have an interest in was 
£72 million (2022: £80 million) for collective investment vehicles and £nil (2022: £nil) for securitisation vehicles. The carrying amount of 
assets transferred to securitisation vehicles at the time of transfer was £5,625 million and the Group recognised a gain of £31 million on 
transfer.

Continuing involvement in financial assets that have been derecognised
The Group has derecognised financial assets in their entirety following transactions with securitisation vehicles, as noted above. The 
continuing involvement largely arises from funding provided to the vehicles through the purchase of issued notes. The majority of these 
notes are recognised as debt securities held at amortised cost. The remaining notes held by the Group, together with interest rate 
derivatives transacted with the vehicles, are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. The carrying amount of these interests and 
the maximum exposure to loss is included in the table above. At 31 December 2023 the fair value of the retained notes was 
£4,142 million. The income from the Group’s interest in these structures for the year ended 31 December 2023 and cumulatively for the 
lifetime was £133 million.

Note 50: Transfers of financial assets
Transferred financial assets derecognised in their entirety with ongoing exposure
Through asset securitisations, the Group has transferred financial assets which were derecognised in their entirety, with some 
continuing involvement. Further details are available in note 49.

Transferred financial assets that continue to be recognised
Details of transferred financial assets that continue to be recognised in full are as follows.

The Group enters into repurchase and securities lending transactions in the normal course of business that do not result in 
derecognition of the financial assets as substantially all of the risks and rewards, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and other 
price risks are retained by the Group. In all cases, the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the assets concerned.

As set out in note 29, included within financial assets measured at amortised cost are loans transferred under the Group’s securitisation 
and covered bond programmes. As the Group retains all or a majority of the risks and rewards associated with these loans, including 
credit, interest rate, prepayment and liquidity risk, they remain on the Group’s balance sheet. Assets transferred into the Group’s 
securitisation and covered bond programmes are not available to be used by the Group while the assets are within the programmes. 
However, the Group retains the right to remove loans from the covered bond programmes where they are in excess of the 
programme’s requirements. In addition, where the Group has retained some of the notes issued by securitisation and covered bond 
programmes, the Group has the ability to sell or pledge these retained notes.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 52: Financial risk management
As a bancassurer, financial instruments are fundamental to the Group’s activities and, as a consequence, the risks associated with 
financial instruments represent a significant component of the risks faced by the Group.

The primary risks affecting the Group through its use of financial instruments are: market risk, which includes interest rate risk and 
foreign exchange risk; credit risk; liquidity risk; capital risk; and insurance risk. The following disclosures provide quantitative and 
qualitative information about the Group’s exposure to these risks.

Market risk
(A)  Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from the different repricing characteristics of the Group’s assets and liabilities. Liabilities are generally either 
insensitive to interest rate movements, for example interest free or very low interest customer deposits, or are sensitive to interest rate 
changes but bear rates which may be varied at the Group’s discretion and that for competitive reasons generally reflect changes in 
the UK Bank Rate, set by the Bank of England. The rates on the remaining liabilities are contractually fixed for their term to maturity.

Many banking assets are sensitive to interest rate movements; there is a large volume of managed rate assets such as variable rate 
mortgages which may be considered as a natural offset to the interest rate risk arising from the managed rate liabilities. However, a 
significant proportion of the Group’s lending assets, for example many personal loans and mortgages, bear interest rates which are 
contractually fixed. Interest rate sensitivity analysis relating to the Group’s banking activities is set out in the tables marked audited on 
page 188.

The Group’s risk management policy is to optimise reward while managing its market risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by 
the Board. The largest residual risk exposure arises from balances that are deemed to be insensitive to changes in market rates 
(including current accounts, a portion of variable rate deposits and investable equity), and is managed through the Group’s structural 
hedge. The structural hedge consists of longer-term fixed rate assets or interest rate swaps and the amount and duration of the 
hedging activity is reviewed regularly by the Group Asset and Liability Committee.

The Group establishes hedge accounting relationships for interest rate risk components using cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. 
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated 
debt. The derivatives used to manage the structural hedge may be designated into cash flow hedges to manage income statement 
volatility. The economic items related to the structural hedge, for example current accounts, are not eligible hedged items under IAS 39 
for inclusion into accounting hedge relationships. The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate customer loans, its 
fixed rate customer deposits and the majority of its subordinated debt, and to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and 
deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt. The Group applies netting between similar risks before applying hedge 
accounting.

Hedge ineffectiveness arises during the management of interest rate risk due to residual unhedged risk. Sources of ineffectiveness, 
which the Group may decide to not fully mitigate, can include basis differences, timing differences and notional amount differences. 
The effectiveness of accounting hedge relationships is assessed between the hedging derivatives and the documented hedged item, 
which can differ to the underlying economically hedged item.

At 31 December 2023 the aggregate notional principal of interest rate and other swaps (predominantly interest rate) designated as fair 
value hedges was £153,639 million (2022: £152,662 million) with a net fair value liability of £345 million (2022: liability of £493 million) (note 
22). The losses on the hedging instruments were £2,663 million (2022: gains of £1,284 million). The gains on the hedged items attributable 
to the hedged risk were £2,396 million (2022: losses of £1,325 million). The gains and losses relating to the fair value hedges are recorded 
in net trading income.

The notional principal of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at 31 December 2023 was £463,660 million (2022: 
£249,703 million) with a net fair value asset of £1 million (2022: liability of £2 million) (note 22). In 2023, ineffectiveness recognised in the 
income statement that arises from cash flow hedges was a gain of £19 million (2022: loss of £10 million).

Interest rate benchmark reform
Following the completion of industry events, including the two London Clearing House USD derivatives transition events in the second 
quarter of the year, together with bilateral customer consents, the Group has transitioned materially all of its LIBOR linked products. We 
continue to work with customers to transition a small number of remaining contracts that were not subject to the above events and 
either have a future dated transition trigger or have defaulted to the relevant synthetic LIBOR benchmark in the interim. Each remaining 
contract has a known path to transition which is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.

While the volume of outstanding transactions impacted by IBOR benchmark reforms continues to reduce, the Group does not expect 
material changes to its risk management approach.

(B)  Foreign exchange risk
The corporate and retail businesses incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers. All non-structural 
foreign exchange exposures in the non-trading book are managed centrally within allocated exposure limits. Trading book exposures in 
the authorised trading centres are allocated exposure limits. The limits are monitored daily by the local centres and reported to the 
market and liquidity risk function in London. Associated VaR and the closing, average, maximum and minimum are disclosed in the 
tables marked audited on page 190.

The Group manages foreign currency accounting exposure via cash flow hedge accounting, utilising currency swaps and forward 
foreign exchange trades.

Risk arises from the Group’s investments in its overseas operations. The Group’s structural foreign currency exposure is represented by 
the net asset value of the foreign currency equity and subordinated debt investments in its subsidiaries and branches. Gains or losses 
on structural foreign currency exposures are taken to reserves. The Group’s main overseas operations are in the Americas and Europe.

Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk exposure arises in respect of the instruments below and predominantly in the United Kingdom. Credit risk 
appetite is set at Board level and is described and reported through a suite of metrics devised from a combination of accounting and 
credit portfolio performance measures, which include the use of various credit risk rating systems as inputs and assess credit risk at a 
counterparty level using three components: (i) the probability of default by the counterparty on its contractual obligations; (ii) the 
current exposures to the counterparty and their likely future development, from which the Group derives the exposure at default; and 
(iii) the likely loss ratio on the defaulted obligations, the loss given default. The Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk, 
including internal control policies, obtaining collateral, using master netting agreements and other credit risk transfers, such as asset 
sales and credit derivatives based transactions.

(A)  Maximum credit exposure
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is detailed below. No 
account is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss, which includes amounts held to cover unit-linked and With-
Profits Funds liabilities, is considered to be the balance sheet carrying amount or, for non-derivative off-balance sheet transactions 
and financial guarantees, their contractual nominal amounts.

(B)  Concentrations of exposure
The Group’s management of concentration risk includes portfolio controls on certain industries, sectors and products to reflect risk 
appetite as well as individual, customer and bank limit risk tolerances. Credit policies and appetite statements are aligned to the 
Group’s risk appetite and restrict exposure to higher risk countries and potentially vulnerable sectors and asset classes. Exposures are 
monitored to prevent both an excessive concentration of risk and single name concentrations. The Group’s largest credit limits are 
regularly monitored by the Board Risk Committee and reported in accordance with regulatory requirements. As part of its credit risk 
policy, the Group considers sustainability risk (which incorporates environmental (including climate), social and governance) in the 
assessment of Commercial Banking facilities.

At 31 December 2023 the most significant concentrations of exposure were in mortgages.

Credit risk in respect of trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held within the Group’s unit-linked funds is 
borne by the policyholders and credit risk in respect of With-Profits funds is largely borne by the policyholders. Consequently, the Group 
has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back those contract liabilities.

Loans and advances banks
Significantly all of the Group’s loans and advances to banks are assessed as Stage 1.

Loans and advances to customers
The analysis of lending has been prepared based on the division in which the asset is held; with the business segment in which the 
exposure is recorded reflected in the ratings system applied. The internal credit ratings systems used by the Group differ between 
Retail and Commercial, reflecting the characteristics of these exposures and the way that they are managed internally; these credit 
ratings are set out below. All probabilities of default (PDs) include forward-looking information and are based on 12-month values, with 
the exception of credit-impaired.

Average PD grade
The table below shows the average PD for the major portfolios used in the calculation of ECL and therefore Stage 2 average PD reflects 
the lifetime value. These reflect the forward-looking view under the Group’s base case scenario prior to the application of MES and 
post-model adjustments which further impact ECL.

Reverse repurchase agreement held at amortised cost
All of the Group’s reverse repurchase agreements held at amortised cost are assessed as Stage 1.

Debt securities held at amortised cost
At 31 December 2023 £15,240 million of gross debt securities held at amortised cost were investment grade (credit ratings equal to or 
better than ‘BBB’) (2022: £9,919 million), £20 million were sub-investment grade (2022: £nil) and £106 million not rated (2022: £16 million).

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (excluding equity shares)
At 31 December 2023 £27,267 million of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (excluding equity shares) 
were investment grade (credit ratings equal to or better than ‘BBB’) (2022: £22,761 million), £80 million were sub-investment grade (2022: 
£71 million) and £13 million not rated (2022: £39 million).

Financial guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments
Financial guarantees represent undertakings that the Group will meet a customer’s obligation to third parties if the customer fails to do 
so. Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to extend credit in the form of loans, guarantees or 
letters of credit. The Group is theoretically exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total guarantees or unused commitments, 
however, the likely amount of loss is expected to be significantly less. Most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon 
customers maintaining specific credit standards.

(D)  Collateral held as security for financial assets
The principal types of collateral accepted by the Group include: residential and commercial properties; charges over business assets 
such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable; financial instruments; cash; and guarantees from third parties. The terms and 
conditions associated with the use of the collateral are varied and are dependent on both the type of agreement and the 
counterparty. The Group holds collateral against loans and advances and irrevocable loan commitments; qualitative and, where 
appropriate, quantitative information is provided in respect of this collateral below. Collateral held as security for financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss and for derivative assets is also shown below.

The Group holds collateral in respect of loans and advances to customers and reverse repurchase agreements as set out below. The 
Group does not hold collateral against debt securities which are classified as financial assets held at amortised cost.

Loans and advances to customers
Retail lending
UK mortgages
An analysis by loan-to-value ratio of the Group’s UK residential mortgage lending is provided below. The value of collateral used in 
determining the loan-to-value ratios has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account 
subsequent movements in house prices. The market takes into account many factors, including environmental considerations such as 
flood risk and energy efficient additions, in arriving at the value of a home.

In some circumstances, where the discounted value of the estimated net proceeds from the liquidation of collateral (i.e. net of costs, 
expected haircuts and anticipated changes in the value of the collateral to the point of sale) is greater than the estimated exposure at 
default, no credit losses are expected and no ECL allowance is recognised.

The above data is sourced using the latest available government EPC information as at the relevant balance sheet date. The Group has 
no EPC data available for 20.2 per cent (2022: 25.0 per cent) of the UK mortgage portfolio; this portion is classified as unrated properties.

EPC ratings are not considered to be a material credit risk factor, and do not form part of the Group’s credit risk calculations. 

Other
The majority of other retail lending is unsecured. At 31 December 2023, Stage 3 other retail lending amounted to £378 million, net of an 
impairment allowance of £358 million (2022: £475 million, net of an impairment allowance of £372 million).

Stage 1 and Stage 2 other retail lending amounted to £55,814 million (2022: £53,825 million). Lending decisions are predominantly based 
on an obligor’s ability to repay rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided. Where the lending is secured, collateral 
values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination and are thereafter monitored in accordance with business unit credit 
policy.

The Group’s credit risk disclosures for unimpaired other retail lending show assets gross of collateral and therefore disclose the 
maximum loss exposure. The Group believes that this approach is appropriate.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December

Note 52: Financial risk management continued
Commercial lending
Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured lending
For Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending, the Group reports assets gross of collateral and therefore discloses the maximum 
loss exposure.

Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending is predominantly managed on a cash flow basis. On occasion, it may include an 
assessment of underlying collateral, although, for Stage 3 lending, this will not always involve assessing it on a fair value basis. No 
aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired secured commercial lending portfolio is provided to key management 
personnel.

Stage 3 secured lending
The value of collateral is re-evaluated and its legal soundness reassessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower; 
this evaluation is used to determine potential loss allowances and management’s strategy to try to either repair the business or 
recover the debt.

At 31 December 2023, Stage 3 secured commercial lending amounted to £507 million, net of an impairment allowance of £133 million 
(2022: £410 million, net of an impairment allowance of £160 million). The fair value of the collateral held in respect of impaired secured 
commercial lending was £608 million (2022: £484 million). In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been 
attributed to the costs of realisation. For the purposes of determining the total collateral held by the Group in respect of impaired 
secured commercial lending, the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding 
advance in order to eliminate the effects of any over-collateralisation and to provide a clearer representation of the Group’s exposure.

Stage 3 secured commercial lending and associated collateral relates to lending to property companies and to customers in the 
financial, business and other services; transport, distribution and hotels; and construction industries.

Reverse repurchase agreements
There were reverse repurchase agreements which are accounted for as collateralised loans with a carrying value of £38,771 million 
(2022: £44,865 million), against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of £38,510 million, capped at the reverse repurchase 
agreement carrying value (2022: £33,715 million). These transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and 
customary for standard secured lending activities.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (excluding equity shares)
Included in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are reverse repurchase agreements treated as collateralised loans with a 
carrying value of £17,413 million (2022: £11,781 million). Collateral is held with a fair value of £17,301 million, capped at the reverse 
repurchase agreement carrying value (2022: £9,598 million), all of which the Group is able to repledge. At 31 December 2023, 
£9,926 million had been repledged (2022: £5,232 million).

In addition, securities held as collateral in the form of stock borrowed amounted to £17,280 million (2022: £26,368 million). Of this amount, 
£9,363 million (2022: £14,375 million) had been resold or repledged as collateral for the Group’s own transactions.

These transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.

Derivative assets, after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements
The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly 
liquid securities. In respect of the net derivative assets after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements of £12,494 million 
(2022: £12,423 million), cash collateral of £3,361 million (2022: £3,951 million) was held.

Irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies
At 31 December 2023, the Group held irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies of £77,929 million (2022: 
£77,678 million). Collateral is held as security, in the event that lending is drawn down, on £13,036 million (2022: £16,442 million) of these 
balances.

Collateral repossessed
During the year, £229 million of collateral was repossessed (2022: £219 million), consisting primarily of residential property.

In respect of retail portfolios, the Group does not take physical possession of properties or other assets held as collateral and uses 
external agents to realise the value as soon as practicable, generally at auction, to settle indebtedness. Any surplus funds are returned 
to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations. In certain circumstances the Group 
takes physical possession of assets held as collateral against commercial lending. In such cases, the assets are carried on the Group’s 
balance sheet and are classified according to the Group’s accounting policies.

(E)  Collateral pledged as security
The Group pledges assets primarily for repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions which are generally conducted 
under terms that are usual and customary for standard securitised borrowing contracts.

Repurchase transactions
Amortised cost
There are balances arising from repurchase transactions of £37,703 million (2022: £48,596 million), which include amounts due under 
the Bank of England’s Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME). The fair value of the collateral provided under 
these agreements at 31 December 2023 was £37,655 million, capped at the repurchase agreement carrying value (2022: £53,827 million 
including over collaterisation).

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
The fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase transactions, accounted for as secured borrowing, where the secured 
party is permitted by contract or custom to repledge was £17,941 million, capped at the repurchase agreement carrying value (2022: 
£10,427 million).

Securitisations and covered bonds
In addition to the assets detailed above, the Group also holds assets that are encumbered through the Group’s asset-backed conduits 
and its securitisation and covered bond programmes. Further details of these assets are provided in note 29.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its commitments as they fall due, or can 
only secure them at excessive cost. Liquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based 
on contractual maturity. The Group carries out monthly stress testing of its liquidity position against a range of scenarios, including 
those prescribed by the PRA. The Group’s liquidity risk appetite is also calibrated against a number of stressed liquidity metrics.

The table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group, other than liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts, into 
relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining contractual period at the balance sheet date; balances with no fixed maturity are 
included in the over 5 years category. Liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts are analysed on a behavioural basis. 
Certain balances, included in the table below on the basis of their residual maturity, are repayable on demand upon payment of a 
penalty.

The above table is provided on a contractual basis. The Group’s assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later 
than implied by their contractual terms and readers are, therefore, advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group’s 
liquidity position. In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short 
notice. However, in practice, these deposits are not usually withdrawn on their contractual maturity.

The table below analyses financial instrument liabilities of the Group, excluding those arising from insurance and participating 
investment contracts, on an undiscounted future cash flow basis according to contractual maturity, into relevant maturity groupings 
based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date; balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.

The majority of the Group’s non-participating investment contract liabilities are unit-linked. These unit-linked products are invested in 
accordance with unit fund mandates. Clauses are included in policyholder contracts to permit the deferral of sales, where necessary, 
so that linked assets can be realised without being a forced seller.

The principal amount for undated subordinated liabilities with no redemption option is included within the over 5 years column; interest 
of £16 million (2022: £17 million) per annum which is payable in respect of those instruments for as long as they remain in issue is not 
included beyond 5 years.

An analysis of the Group’s total wholesale funding by residual maturity and by currency is set out on page 182.

The following table presents the estimated amount and timing of the remaining contractual discounted cash flows arising from 
insurance liabilities The amounts presented do not include those relating to LRC of contracts that are measured under the PAA.

For insurance contracts which are neither unit-linked nor in the Group’s with-profit funds, in particular annuity liabilities, the aim is to 
invest in assets such that the cash flows on investments match those on the projected future liabilities.

Some of the Group’s insurance and participating investment contract liabilities are payable on demand as shown in the table below:

Capital risk
Capital is actively managed on an ongoing basis for both the Group and its regulated banking subsidiaries, with associated capital 
policies and procedures subjected to regular review. The Group assesses both its regulatory capital requirements and the quantity and 
quality of capital resources it holds to meet those requirements in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Capital Requirements 
Directive (CRD V) and Capital Requirements Regulation (UK CRR). This is supplemented through additional regulation set out under the 
PRA Rulebook and through associated statements of policy, supervisory statements and other regulatory guidance. Regulatory capital 
ratios are considered a key part of the budgeting and planning processes and forecast ratios are reviewed by the Group Asset and 
Liability Committee. Target capital levels take account of current and future regulatory requirements, capacity for growth and to cover 
uncertainties. Details of the Group’s capital resources are provided in the table marked audited on page 149.

Each insurance company within the Group is regulated by the PRA. The insurance businesses are required to calculate solvency capital 
requirements and available capital in accordance with Solvency II. The Group complied with these requirements in 2023 and 2022. The 
Insurance business of the Group calculates regulatory capital on the basis of an internal model, which was approved by the PRA on 
5 December 2015, with the latest major change to the model approved in November 2020. The capital position of the Group’s insurance 
businesses is reviewed on a regular basis by the Insurance, Pensions and Investments Executive Committee.

Insurance risk
Insurance underwriting risk is the risk of adverse developments in the timing, frequency and severity of claims for insured/underwritten 
events and in customer behaviour, leading to reductions in earnings and/or value and arises within the Group’s Insurance business. 
Insurance underwriting risk is measured using a variety of techniques including stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, as well as 
stochastic modelling. Current and potential future insurance underwriting risk exposures are assessed and aggregated on a range of 
stresses including risk measures based on 1-in-200 year stresses for the Insurance business’s regulatory capital assessments and other 
supporting measures where appropriate. The Group also mitigates insurance underwriting risk via the use of reinsurance 
arrangements. The Group's critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty for its Insurance business are set 
out in note 36.

1  Movement in third party interests in consolidated funds is reclassified from interest expense to a separate line on the face of the income statement.
2 
3 

Insurance premium income is removed as this is no longer presented in the income statement under IFRS 17.
Insurance revenue includes the CSM released to the income statement and changes in the risk adjustment related to current service (for more details on IFRS 17 
measurement see note 1).
Insurance services expense includes incurred claims excluding any investment components, attributable service expenses and losses as a result of contract 
modifications.
The change in operating income is primarily driven by the removal of the movement in the value of in-force asset.

5 
6  These changes are analysed using different line items under IFRS 17.
7 
8  Change in non-participating investment contracts is presented as a separate line item.
9  Maintenance expenses are included within insurance service expense and acquisition expenses are deferred within the CSM under IFRS 17.

Finance related changes to the carrying value of insurance, participating investment and reinsurance contracts.

Note 55: Events since the balance sheet date
Share buyback
The Board has announced its intention to implement an ordinary share buyback of up to £2.0 billion. This represents the return to 
shareholders of capital, surplus to that required to provide capacity to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory 
requirements and cover uncertainties. The share buyback programme will commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be 
completed, subject to continued authority from the PRA, by 31 December 2024.

Notes to the parent company financial statements
for the year ended 31 December

Note 1: Basis of preparation and accounting policies
The financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in 
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial 
assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts. The accounting policies of the Company are the 
same as those of the Group, which are set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Investments in subsidiaries are 
carried at historical cost, less any provisions for impairment. Fees payable to the Company’s auditors by the Group are set out in note 17 
to the consolidated financial statements.

Note 2: Measurement basis of financial assets and liabilities
Measurement basis of financial assets and liabilities
The accounting policies in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describe how different classes of financial instruments are 
measured, and how income and expenses, including fair value gains and losses, are recognised. The following table analyses the 
carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities by category and by balance sheet heading.

Note 2: Measurement basis of financial assets and liabilities continued
The assets held at fair value through profit or loss represent holdings of debt securities issued by subsidiaries. The contractual terms of 
such instruments contain certain write-down and conversion features and so are not considered to satisfy the solely payments of 
principal and interest test.

Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss represent debt securities in issue which are accounted for at fair value 
to significantly reduce an accounting mismatch. The changes in the credit risk of these liabilities are linked to the changes in credit risk 
on corresponding assets that the Company holds at fair value through profit or loss, representing debt securities issued by subsidiaries. 
Given the economic relationship between these assets and liabilities, the Company presents changes in the credit risk of its liabilities in 
profit or loss in order to avoid creating or enlarging an accounting mismatch.

The amount contractually payable on maturity of the debt securities held at fair value through profit or loss at 31 December 2023 was 
£18,397 million, which was £76 million lower than the balance sheet carrying value (2022: £14,433 million, which was £568 million higher 
than the balance sheet carrying value). At 31 December 2023 there was a cumulative £756 million increase in the fair value of these 
liabilities attributable to changes in credit risk (2022: increase of £425 million), of which a £331 million increase arose in 2023 and a 
£117 million decrease arose in 2022; this is determined by reference to the quoted credit spreads of the Company.

Note 3: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The valuation techniques for the Company’s financial instruments are as discussed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.

Valuation hierarchy
The table below analyses the assets and liabilities of the Company. With the exception of derivatives and those financial assets and 
liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss, all assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost. They are categorised into levels 
1 to 3 based on the degree to which their fair value is observable. No assets or liabilities were categorised as level 1 (2022: none).

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents (2023: £17 million; 2022: £48 million) is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Note 4: Amounts due from subsidiaries
These comprise short-term lending to subsidiaries, repayable on demand. As required by IFRS 9, the Company has established an 
allowance for impairment losses for amounts due from its subsidiaries (31 December 2023: £6 million; 31 December 2022: £16 million) 
based on the probability of its subsidiaries defaulting on the amounts payable in the next 12 months. The carrying value of the amounts 
owed by subsidiaries is a reasonable approximation to fair value.

Note 5: Deferred tax
As at 31 December 2023 the Company carried a deferred tax asset of £74 million (2022: £93 million); there was no deferred tax liability at 
31 December 2023 or 31 December 2022. The movement in the deferred tax asset during 2023 primarily related to financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit and loss (giving rise to a £33 million charge to the income statement) and shared-based payments (giving rise 
to a £11 million credit in equity).

Note 6: Debt securities in issue at amortised cost
These comprise notes issued by the Company in a number of currencies, although predominantly US Dollars and Euros, with maturity 
dates ranging up to 2038.

Issuances in the year generated cash inflows of £1,416 million (2022: £838 million); the repurchases and redemptions resulted in cash outflows of £643 million (2022: £nil). 
Cash payments in respect of interest on subordinated liabilities in the year amounted to £466 million (2022: £370 million).

Note 8: Share capital, share premium account and other equity instruments
Details of the Company’s share capital, share premium account and other equity instruments are as set out in notes 40, 42 and 45 to 
the consolidated financial statements.

Note 9: Merger reserve and capital redemption reserve
The merger reserve comprises the premium on shares issued on 13 January 2009 under the placing and open offer and shares issued

redemption an amount of £17 million was transferred from the distributable merger reserve to the capital redemption reserve and £597 million was transferred from the 
distributable merger reserve to the share premium account, with these amounts representing the nominal value of the shares redeemed and premium upon original 
issuance respectively.

The capital redemption reserve represents transfers from the merger reserve in accordance with companies’ legislation and amounts 
transferred from share capital following the cancellation of shares.

Details of the subsidiaries and related undertakings are given on pages 344 to 356 and are incorporated by reference.

Certain subsidiary companies currently have insufficient distributable reserves to make dividend payments; however, there were no 
further significant restrictions on any of the Company’s subsidiaries in paying dividends or repaying loans and advances. All regulated 
banking and insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain capital at levels agreed with the regulators; this may impact the ability of 
those subsidiaries to make distributions.

Note 12: Financial risk management

Market risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk and currency risk on its debt securities in issue and its subordinated debt.

As discussed in note 11, the Company has entered into interest rate and currency swaps with its subsidiary, Lloyds Bank Corporate 
Markets plc, to manage these risks.

Credit risk
The majority of the Company’s credit risk arises from amounts due from its wholly owned subsidiaries, principally Lloyds Bank plc.

Liquidity risk
The table below analyses financial instrument liabilities of the Company on an undiscounted future cash flow basis according to 
contractual maturity, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date; balances with no 
fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.

Security – share fraud and scams
Shareholders should exercise caution when unsolicited callers offer the chance to buy or sell shares with promises of huge returns. 
If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is and we would ask that shareholders take steps to protect themselves. We strongly 
recommend seeking advice from an independent financial adviser authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
Shareholders can verify whether a firm is authorised via the Financial Services Register which is available at www.fca.org.uk 

.

If a shareholder is concerned that they may have been targeted by such a scheme, please contact the FCA Consumer Helpline 
on 0800 111 6768 or use the online ‘Share Fraud Reporting Form’ available from their website (see above). We would also recommend 
contacting the Police through Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or visiting www.actionfraud.org.uk 

 for further information.

Forward-looking statements

This document contains certain forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, as amended, and section 27A of the US Securities Act 
of 1933, as amended, with respect to the business, strategy, plans 
and/or results of Lloyds Banking Group plc together with its 
subsidiaries (the Group) and its current goals and expectations. 
Statements that are not historical or current facts, including 
statements about the Group’s or its directors’ and/or 
management’s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking 
statements. Words such as, without limitation, ‘believes’, 
‘achieves’, ‘anticipates’, ‘estimates’, ‘expects’, ‘targets’, ‘should’, 
‘intends’, ‘aims’, ‘projects’, ‘plans’, ‘potential’, ‘will’, ‘would’, ‘could’, 
‘considered’, ‘likely’, ‘may’, ‘seek’, ‘estimate’, ‘probability’, ‘goal’, 
‘objective’, ‘deliver’, ‘endeavour’, ‘prospects’, ‘optimistic’ and similar 
expressions or variations on these expressions are intended to 
identify forward-looking statements. These statements concern 
or may affect future matters, including but not limited to: 
projections or expectations of the Group’s future financial 
position, including profit attributable to shareholders, provisions, 
economic profit, dividends, capital structure, portfolios, net 
interest margin, capital ratios, liquidity, risk-weighted assets 
(RWAs), expenditures or any other financial items or ratios; 
litigation, regulatory and governmental investigations; the 
Group’s future financial performance; the level and extent of 
future impairments and write-downs; the Group’s ESG targets 
and/or commitments; statements of plans, objectives or goals of 
the Group or its management and other statements that are not 
historical fact and statements of assumptions underlying such 
statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve 
risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend 
upon circumstances that will or may occur in the future. Factors 
that could cause actual business, strategy, targets, plans and/or 
results (including but not limited to the payment of dividends) to 
differ materially from forward-looking statements include, but are 
not limited to: general economic and business conditions in the 
UK and internationally; acts of hostility or terrorism and responses 
to those acts, or other such events; geopolitical unpredictability; 
the war between Russia and Ukraine; the conflicts in the Middle 
East; the tensions between China and Taiwan; political instability 
including as a result of any UK general election; market related 
risks, trends and developments; changes in client and consumer 
behaviour and demand; exposure to counterparty risk; the ability 
to access sufficient sources of capital, liquidity and funding when 
required; changes to the Group’s credit ratings; fluctuations in 
interest rates, inflation, exchange rates, stock markets and 
currencies; volatility in credit markets; volatility in the price of the 
Group’s securities; tightening of monetary policy in jurisdictions in 
which the Group operates; natural pandemic and other disasters; 
risks concerning borrower and counterparty credit quality; risks 
affecting insurance business and defined benefit pension 
schemes; changes in laws, regulations, practices and accounting 
standards or taxation; changes to regulatory capital or liquidity 
requirements and similar contingencies; the policies and actions 
of governmental or regulatory authorities or courts together with 
any resulting impact on the future structure of the Group; risks 

associated with the Group’s compliance with a wide range of 
laws and regulations; assessment related to resolution planning 
requirements; risks related to regulatory actions which may be 
taken in the event of a bank or Group failure; exposure to legal, 
regulatory or competition proceedings, investigations or 
complaints; failure to comply with anti-money laundering, 
counter terrorist financing, anti-bribery and sanctions regulations; 
failure to prevent or detect any illegal or improper activities; 
operational risks including risks as a result of the failure of third 
party suppliers; conduct risk; technological changes and risks to 
the security of IT and operational infrastructure, systems, data 
and information resulting from increased threat of cyber and 
other attacks; technological failure; inadequate or failed internal 
or external processes or systems; risks relating to ESG matters, 
such as climate change (and achieving climate change 
ambitions) and decarbonisation, including the Group’s ability 
along with the government and other stakeholders to measure, 
manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively, 
and human rights issues; the impact of competitive conditions; 
failure to attract, retain and develop high calibre talent; the ability 
to achieve strategic objectives; the ability to derive cost savings 
and other benefits including, but without limitation, as a result of 
any acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions; 
inability to capture accurately the expected value from 
acquisitions; assumptions and estimates that form the basis 
of the Group’s financial statements; and potential changes in 
dividend policy. A number of these influences and factors are 
beyond the Group’s control. Please refer to the latest Annual 
Report on Form 20-F filed by Lloyds Banking Group plc with the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), which is available 
on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov, for a discussion of certain 
factors and risks. Lloyds Banking Group plc may also make or 
disclose written and/or oral forward-looking statements in other 
written materials and in oral statements made by the directors, 
officers or employees of Lloyds Banking Group plc to third parties, 
including financial analysts. Except as required by any applicable 
law or regulation, the forward-looking statements contained in 
this document are made as of today’s date, and the Group 
expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release 
publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking 
statements contained in this document whether as a result of 
new information, future events or otherwise. The information, 
statements and opinions contained in this document do not 
constitute a public offer under any applicable law or an offer 
to sell any securities or financial instruments or any advice 
or recommendation with respect to such securities or 
financial instruments.
