Burberry 2022/23Strategic Report | Chair’s Letter

Chair’s Letter

“Burberry is in very good shape financially,  
operationally and strategically, thanks to our  
leadership team and the energy and commitment  
of our exceptional colleagues around the world.”

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to report that Burberry is in very good shape financially, operationally and 

strategically, thanks to our leadership team and the energy and commitment of our 

exceptional colleagues around the world. Jonathan Akeroyd, who joined Burberry as 

Chief Executive Officer just before the start of FY 2022/23, has set out a clear ambition  

for Burberry’s longer-term growth as the quintessential British luxury brand and has set 

about achieving that ambition with great urgency.

Performance
Burberry is performing well and delivered record sales, profits and earnings per share. 

This strong financial performance has been achieved against a background of continuing 

global uncertainty, high inflation and ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, 

especially in our important Asian markets where international travel and tourism are still  

well below pre-pandemic levels, and clearly demonstrates again the agility and resilience of 

our business.

As well as delivering for shareholders, we continued to bring Burberry’s purpose to life, 

supporting all of our colleagues to reach their full potential and ensuring that Burberry is 

always and everywhere a welcoming, inclusive, fair and safe place to work and one that 

reflects, and is enriched by, the diversity of the communities in which we operate. 

Our brand is rooted in the enduring values of our founder, Thomas Burberry. As a modern 

British luxury brand, we are using our products to drive positive change. During FY 2022/23, 

we renewed our commitment to act responsibly under the banner ‘Burberry Beyond’, laying 

out ambitious targets in relation to climate change and preserving the natural world, notably 

our determination to become Climate Positive by 2040. In this context, we are deepening our 

engagement with suppliers and continue to strengthen and enforce our rigorous ethical 

trading standards in our supply chain.

As he signalled a year ago, and detailed at our interim

Board changes
We recently said goodbye to Julie Brown who, as 

Chief Operating and Financial Officer over the last 

six years, has made a very significant contribution  

to Burberry’s transformation and delivering our 

sustainability ambitions. As announced on 15 March

ambitious goals Jonathan has set for Burberry, 

adding new talent and ideas to our deeply committed 

and enthusiastic team.

Governance developments 
Our new Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which will 

be presented to shareholders for approval at the 

Annual General Meeting in July 2023, is set out  

on pages 212 to 225. Danuta Gray, Chair of our 

Remuneration Committee conducted an extensive 

engagement programme, engaging with shareholders 

controlling around 65% of our issued share capital. 

We are very grateful for the feedback we have 

received. Danuta’s letter on pages 200 to 207 

provides more detail regarding our proposed policy 

and the consultation process and we look forward to 

receiving your support.

Matthew Key will retire from the Board and as Chair 

of our Audit Committee at the end of the 2023 AGM 

having served as a Non-Executive Director for just 

over nine years. On behalf of the Board, I would like  

to thank Matthew for his wise counsel, outstanding 

service to Burberry and his leadership of the Audit 

Committee since becoming Chair in February 2019. 

As previously announced, Alan Stewart, who joined 

the Board as a Non-Executive Director in September 

2022 and has extensive experience as a chief financial 

officer and non-executive director of major international 

public companies, will take over as Chair of the Audit 

Committee when Matthew retires. 

Dividend
Overall, given the continuing performance of the 

Group and its strong financial position, the Directors 

are pleased to recommend a final dividend of 44.5p 

per ordinary share subject to approval at the Annual 

General Meeting. This is consistent with our Capital 

Allocation Framework and gives a full year dividend 

per ordinary share of 61.0p (FY 2021/22: 47.0p) 

representing a pay-out ratio of around 50%. Also 

consistent with our Capital Allocation Policy, the 

Board has also approved a £400 million share 

buyback to be completed in FY 2023/24.

upon the foundations laid down in recent years. 

In closing, I want to express my thanks to Jonathan,

Chief Executive Officer’s Letter

“We are well positioned to leverage the unique 
attributes that make Burberry special to drive 
revenue growth and acceleration.”

Dear Shareholder,

When I first wrote to you last year, I spoke of my admiration for Burberry, its position as a 

unique British brand with an extraordinary heritage, iconic products and house codes, and 

strong culture and values. 

Over the last 12 months, I have had the opportunity to really get to know the business, visiting 

many of our stores in key luxury locations around the world and seeing our manufacturing 

facilities, both here in the UK and in Italy. I have been impressed by what I have seen and I 

believe we are well positioned to leverage the unique attributes that make Burberry special to 

drive revenue growth and acceleration.

FY 2022/23 performance
Thanks to these strong foundations, we delivered a strong financial performance in 

FY 2022/23.

•  Revenue reached £3.1 billion, up 5% at constant exchange rates (CER) and 10% at reported rates

•  Adjusted operating profit was £634 million, up 8% at CER

•  Reported operating profit was £657 million, up 21%

•  Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPSA) was 122.5p, up 16% at CER and 30% 

at reported rates

•  Reported diluted EPS was 126.3p, up 29%

Revenue accelerated in the fourth quarter as growth rebounded in Mainland China following 

the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. Having travelled there to visit some of our stores and 

meet with retail partners in person, I was very encouraged by the excitement surrounding 

Burberry in the market. We also generated strong growth in EMEIA as tourism returned. 

Our performance in both regions helped compensate for a softening in the Americas. 

Despite the slowing economy there, I was pleased with the direction in which our business  

is evolving as we recruited more higher-spending women to our brand, buying into higher  

value products, particularly leather goods.

with the great British outdoors. Opening the show

refocusing on Britishness and broadening our appeal. 

In February, we launched a new brand identity with  

a fresh expression of our wordmark and a modern 

evolution of our iconic Equestrian Knight Design. 

We rolled this out across multiple touchpoints 

including the facades and interiors of our stores 

in London, Paris, Milan and New York.

Alongside this new creative expression, we launched 

Daniel’s first campaign for Burberry. Shot in London, 

the multimedia campaign featured a cast of eclectic 

talent including Vanessa Redgrave, Georgia May Jagger 

and Kano whom Daniel styled in our iconic rainwear 

and Burberry Check. It reached an estimated half 

a billion people in its first week alone and helped drive 

a very strong acceleration in heritage rainwear sales 

in the fourth quarter.

Operational delivery
To drive the delivery of our growth ambition, we have 

made changes to our operating model and hired 

specialists in new leadership roles. We created an 

innovation function and integrated responsibility for 

global e-commerce, digital product and analytics 

under a new Chief Digital, Customer and Innovation 

Officer Giorgio Belloli. We streamlined our commercial 

collection structure and strengthened the connection 

between product merchandising, planning and design 

under a new Chief Merchandising Officer Delphine 

Sonder. We brought together supply chain and product 

development under a new Chief Supply Chain and 

Industrial Officer Klaus Bierbrauer to improve 

efficiency, while ensuring end-to-end ownership  

for delivery. We also appointed Melissa Johnston  

to the newly-created role of Chief Visual Officer,  

with responsibility for visual merchandising and 

architecture. The positive impact of these changes  

is already being felt.

ambition is to develop Burberry into a £5 billion revenue brand.

Americas
In the Americas, the personal luxury goods market 

grew 26% in 2022 versus 2021, and 34% versus 2019. 

This was due to an increase in local demand and a 

rebound in tourism. Across the region, performance 

was particularly strong in the first half of 2022, while 

consumption softened in the second half of the year. 

In the US, traditional luxury hubs such as New York 

and Los Angeles returned to growth post lockdowns 

and demand in second-tier markets, including Chicago 

and Houston, remained strong. Since the start of 

2023, the outlook for the personal luxury goods 

market in the Americas has become more uncertain.

Europe and Middle East
Europe’s luxury market surpassed pre-pandemic levels, 

growing 26% versus 2021 and 6% versus 2019, following 

strong local demand (+50%) and increased tourist 

spending from intra-regional and extra-regional 

travellers (+50%). International tourism, particularly 

in France and Italy, was led by tourists from the 

Americas who have more than doubled their spending 

versus 2019 due to a strong dollar. The Middle East 

continued to experience strong growth, consistent 

with trends seen in Europe.

modern British luxury as a desirable and 

relatable lifestyle with the launch of

We delivered a strong financial performance in FY 2022/23, delivering high single-digit growth

progress in our core leather goods and outerwear categories, with revenue accelerating in the 
fourth quarter as growth rebounded in Mainland China.

through a series of Burberry Alpine

range of ready-to-wear items. 

We followed this with our Festive

celebrated the excitement and 

anticipation of festive preparations.

We celebrated our heritage later in  

the year with the launch of our first 

book, Burberry, in partnership with 

Assouline. The richly illustrated volume 

depicts our evolution from a family-run 

company to a renowned global luxury 

brand, and is filled with content from 

the Burberry archive.

In October 2022, we began an exciting 

new chapter in Burberry’s history  

with the appointment of Daniel Lee  

as our Chief Creative Officer. Born and 

raised in Bradford, UK, Daniel is an

Burberry 2022/23Strategic Report | Strategy Overview

A new creative expression 
inspired by our heritage
In early February 2023, we revealed a 

new brand identity with a new Burberry 

wordmark. Alongside this, we refreshed 

our iconic EKD. This is a heritage mark 

from our archive that has existed since 

1901. Daniel revisited it and brought it 

to life in a bold new colour. 

We launched the new branding across 

multiple touchpoints, including the 

facades and interiors of our stores in 

key fashion cities. In each location, we 

presented the EKD in a unique way, 

through colours, textures and shapes 

specifically designed for each space. 

For example, for our store in Rue 

Saint-Honoré Paris, we collaborated 

with British artist Tom Atton Moore, 

who created seven back-to-back 

suspended works to hang in the store’s 

windows as well as a bespoke rug 

installation. This brought to life our new 

vision in a cohesive yet highly localised 

way, elevating the customer experience 

in each store.

Alongside this, we launched Daniel’s 

first campaign for Burberry. Shot in 

London, the multimedia campaign 

featured a cast of eclectic talent 

including Vanessa Redgrave, Georgia 

May Jagger and Kano whom Daniel 

styled in our iconic rainwear and 

Burberry Check. The campaign also 

drew on our British heritage through 

symbols including English roses 

and swans. 

The campaign presented a sharper and 

more coherent brand image, which we 

rolled out across a number of customer 

touchpoints, including Burberry.com  

and high visibility out-of-home displays. 

We also took a fresh approach to  

social media to deliver a more 

inspirational experience.

26

Burberry 2022/23 
Strategic Report | Strategy Overview

Fashion tailored to the outdoors

Building on the momentum and excitement generated by the introduction of our new 

brand identity, we returned to the London Fashion Week schedule with our Autumn 

Winter 2023 show. For Daniel’s debut collection, we built a custom-made tent in 

Kennington Park, London to create a show space that reinforced our connection with 

the great British outdoors. 

The collection introduced a bold new colour palette to our aesthetic and reimagined 

codes synonymous with Burberry such as gabardine, the Equestrian Knight and 

check. It also brought function to luxury fashion.

Drawing on our unique Archive, the story of Burberry was told through oversized 

trench coats, tartan-inspired kilts over trousers, chunky Aran and Argyle jumpers 

and whimsical touches, such as oversized hats and ultra-cosy hot water bottles.

The collection featured new families of distinctive bags, including saddle bags and 

satchels in sturdy fabrics, inspired by Burberry’s connection with the outdoors. 

It also introduced a broader shoe offer including equestrian and rubber rain boots, 

which nodded to Burberry’s legacy of equipping explorers, and sandals, mules and 

pumps in faux fur and shearling. Daniel also presented a fresh take on ready-to-

wear, with a fuller offer for the Burberry woman.

Guests from the worlds of fashion, film, sport and music attended the show, 

alongside many of the cast members from Daniel’s debut campaign. The show was 

very well received and together with our new creative expression generated over 

4,000 pieces of coverage with an estimated reach of 4 billion.

Free cash flow was £393m in the year (FY 2021/22: £340m). 

The major components were: 

•  Cash generated from operating activities increased to £912m from £909m, inclusive of a working capital outflow of £76m 

(FY 2021/22: £54m inflow) 

•  Capital expenditure of £179m (FY 2021/22: £161m) 

•  Tax cash of £140m, down £40m compared to the prior year which included one-off payments

Cash net of overdrafts on 1 April 2023 was £961m, compared to £1,177m on 2 April 2022. On 1 April 2023 borrowings were 

£298m from the bond issue leaving cash net of overdrafts and borrowings of £663m (2 April 2022: £879m). With lease liabilities 

of £1,123m, net debt in the period was £460m (2 April 2022: £179m). 

Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA was 0.5x, at the lower end of our target range of 0.5x to 1.0x. The increase in leverage from 0.2x at 

the FY 2021/22 year end has primarily been driven by the share buyback programme.

Sourcing certified materials 

Raw material sourcing 
Having substantially met our previous target to 

achieve 100% of products with more than one 

positive attribute by the end of FY 2021/22,  

we set a new target of 100% of key raw materials  

in our products to be certified and traceable.

We have also started implementing a traceability 

programme to enable us to assess more closely and 

manage the carbon, biodiversity and social impacts of 

raw material sourcing. We commenced a traceability 

pilot project with a number of our key suppliers, using 

a third-party traceability tool that tracks materials 

back to farm and country of origin. We have started 

to scale this and plan to extend this trial to other 

This includes: cotton, nylon, polyester, viscose, wool, 

supply chain partners in FY 2023/24. We aim to have 

leather, feather and down. 

In FY 2022/23, we developed internal action plans 

and created working groups to govern the data 
required to meet these raw material targets. Based 

on this work, we have revised the time horizon for 

meeting these targets from FY 2025/26 to 

FY 2029/30 to align with our traceability project 

delivery. This decision was approved by the Board. 

In terms of volume, we also increased our use of raw 

materials, which are certified to sustainability 

standards, in FY 2022/23. (See progress table on 

page 51 for details.)

We aim to source 100% certified wool and this year 

full traceability of all certified key raw materials in 

our products by FY 2029/30.

Our commitment to source more sustainable raw 
materials also supports our climate and biodiversity 

goals. Around 40% of our total greenhouse gas 

(GHG) emissions come from raw materials used 

in our products. We are working to reduce this by 

increasing our use of recycled and lower-carbon-

footprint materials as well as through sustainable 

manufacturing programmes. See page 56 

for further details of  our emissions targets.

Burberry applies an operational control approach to defining its organisational boundaries. Data is reported for sites where it is considered that Burberry has the ability to 
influence energy management. Data is not reported for sites where Burberry has a physical presence but does not influence the energy management for those sites, such as 
a concession within a department store. Overall, the emissions inventory reported equates to 100% of our net selling space square footage. Burberry uses the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol (using a location- and market-based approach to reporting scope 2 emissions) to estimate emissions and applies conversion factors from UK BEIS, IEA and 
RE-DISS. All material sources of emissions are reported. Refrigerant gases were deemed not material and are not reported. Market-based emissions globally and for the UK 
relating to purchased electricity within our operations (scope 2) are stated as zero due to us procuring an amount of renewable electricity equivalent to 100% of our annual 
consumption. Combustion of fuel use from owned or leased transport is reported from FY 2018/19 onward. GHG emissions data reported is based on the period from 1 April 
2022 to 31 March 2023. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company’s financial accounting period is from 3 April 2022 to 1 April 2023. However, references to FY 2022/23 for

Embedding sustainable manufacturing 
processes across our supply chain

Supply chain energy and waste 
We are working closely with supply chain partners to 

promote energy efficiency and renewable electricity 

in our supply chain. More specifically, we track energy 

and waste performance across our finished goods 

production sites. 

Key areas of progress in FY 2022/23 include: 

•  73% of finished goods vendors globally used 

electricity from renewable sources 

As part of our Water Conservation Programme, we 

have developed a water resilience assessment (as 

shown in the diagram on page 63). This allows us to 

evaluate and monitor the progress of our supply chain 

water resilience profile, and is foundational to our 

ability to reduce our water footprint and impacts. 

Using the WWF Water Risk Filter, we assess three 

variables: our partners’ water management against 

best-in-class practices; their sites’ water intensity 

(absolute and relative), and their geographical water 

risk. These three variables help us identify potential 

hotspots, which are sites where water management

Our assessment serves as a roadmap for improved 

water management at our partners’ sites, including 

promoting better understanding of their water 

demand, driving water efficiency, promoting water 

recycling and encouraging greater disclosure. Since 

2020, Burberry has completed the assessment of 

84% of our supply chain partners. We have improved

engagement, capacity building and direct support. 

of manufacturing wastes. Globally, 33 finished 

goods vendors took part in this programme in 

FY 2022/23 

Water 
At Burberry we value water as a precious resource to 

our environment, our communities and our business. 

Our dedicated Sustainable Manufacturing team is 

responsible for implementing and monitoring projects 

to improve the management of water and chemicals 

in our supply chain. Our Water Conservation 

programme’s mission is to preserve water for our 

future by delivering water-responsible luxury fashion. 

This includes continuing to progress our supply chain 

water profile by increasing resource efficiency, 

reducing our water impacts and increasing our water 

resilience. To achieve this, we work closely with our 
supply chain partners1, cultivating a culture of 
openness and transparency to understand and 

monitor our water impacts at the manufacturing 

stage of our value chain.

Waste
We seek to minimise waste across our supply  

chain and to send zero waste to landfill across our 

key operations, abiding by clear waste hierarchy 

principles. These comprise reuse, resell, repurpose, 

donate and recycle. We also focus on limiting the 

causes of waste across design, supply chain 

and merchandising. 

We continue to expand existing routes, while developing 

new partnerships and revaluation solutions. We manage 

our stock position closely by proactively allocating 

current stock across channels and regions to 
meet demand. 

Textile and leather waste 
While we seek to minimise waste at all stages of our 

value chain, we also recognise the fashion industry’s 

shared challenge with respect to the carbon impacts 

of excess fabric and textile waste. Supply chain 

efficiency and management of materials is a key area 

of focus. By putting in place systems to optimise the 

procurement and utilisation of our materials and 

finished goods, we can reduce their associated 

climate impacts. 

We continue to support creative communities  

and promote a circular economy by donating to 

schools through the British Fashion Council (BFC). 

This programme provides donations of leftover 

fabrics to fashion students, upcycling surplus fabric 

and saving it from going to waste. The total amount 

of fabric donated in FY 2022/23 totalled more than 

220,000 metres and was distributed equally to 

32 universities, including Central Saint Martins in 

London. This programme encourages the next 

generation to consider new ways of thinking about 

their creative methods and material sourcing, and 

gives them the opportunity to develop tomorrow’s 

approach to fashion design and production.

in terms of strength, abrasion resistance and

has resulted in the development of a prototype for an 

artificial intelligence (AI) garment-sorting algorithm, 

which speeds up the process of identifying garment 

type, material, fabric construction and colour, so 

increasing yield and accuracy for recycling.

We invest in the development of revaluing solutions 

for challenging materials, such as leather. Since 2018, 

we have donated leather hides and skins to the Alta 

Scuola di Pelletteria in Florence to be used as part  

of the school’s training activities. This school offers 
professional leather training courses to young people 

who want to learn a specific skill. Through this 

partnership, we aim to help to bridge a skills gap 

faced by the leather manufacturing companies in 

Tuscany and connect them to young people, many  

of whom are categorised as not in employment, 

education or training (NEET). In FY 2022/23, the 

school offered 10 leather work and leather craft 

courses, and 109 students benefited from our 

donation of hides and skins.

Our four Diversity, Equity and Inclusion pillars

Attracting and retaining 
diverse talent

Fostering an open and 
inclusive culture

Attracting and retaining the best people at Burberry 

is a critical part of our global Diversity, Equity and 

Internal networks 
Our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) create space  

Inclusion strategy and we are committed to ensuring 

for colleagues to come together to mark cultural 

that our processes are fair and inclusive. 

moments and share knowledge, experiences and 

Recruitment
We make every effort to ensure that every stage of 
our recruitment process is fair. Steps we have taken 

include ensuring all job descriptions are gender 

neutral, using standardised interview forms, and 

running mandatory unconscious bias training for 

talent acquisition teams and hiring managers. 

Talent pipeline 
We forge strategic partnerships with key organisations, 

charities and communities, including: The Outsiders 

Perspective, Mobolise and Generation, to build a 

diverse talent pipeline.

Early careers
In FY 2022/23, our dedicated Early Careers team 

launched our first Design Graduate Programme  

and our first Undergraduate Placement Year 

Programme to help over 30 graduates and students 

begin their careers at Burberry in roles across 

several departments. 

learnings. Our ERGs include: Asians in Americas; Pride; 

Sustainability; Women Empowered; Latinxs of Burberry; 

Empowered Black Network; Working Parents at 
Burberry; and Women in Tech. 

This year, the chair of the Women Empowered ERG 

discussed women championing change in a globally 

streamed panel curated by leading Esports organisation 

Gen.G. Our Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 

spoke at the Snapchat DEI Innovation Summit, discussing 

how businesses can ensure diversity, equity and inclusion 

in the workplace. Our Pride ERG Co-Chair also spoke at 

a #ProudinBusiness event in New York City in 

partnership with Verizon. This was one of two events 

that the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion team ran in 

London and NYC with Verizon. 

Disability inclusion 
We endeavour to ensure our colleagues feel valued and 

have the support they need to thrive at Burberry. We 

have incorporated inclusive hiring procedures across 

Burberry to ensure fair practices are upheld and that 

people with disabilities are equally considered. We are 

making reasonable adjustments for people with 

disabilities throughout their career at Burberry and work 

with external organisations to ensure our sites, policies 

and processes are inclusive of people with both visible 

and non-visible disabilities. 

During FY 2022/23, we continued our relationship with the 

Business Disability Forum, the leading business membership 

organisation in disability inclusion, to evaluate our policies 

and ensure that we are removing all barriers to access. 

Diversity information 
We support our colleagues of all identities and 

encourage all to voluntarily and confidentially share data 

on ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation and 

visible and non-visible disabilities. This information 

provides us with a more complete picture of our 

colleague population, allowing us to identify areas for 

improvement and set objectives accordingly.

Educating and raising awareness 

Implementing a global approach

Internal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Conference 
In October 2022, we hosted our first internal

the world, including organisations, charities and 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Conference called The

leadership, intersectionality, gender balance and the 
role men can play in delivering our diversity, equity 

and inclusion ambitions. Attended by over 300 

leaders, the conference was conducted in person for 

those based in London and virtually for leaders based 

around the world. Many parts of the conference were 

also streamed to the wider business and featured 

speakers from several of our ERGs, including Women 

Empowered, the Empowered Black Network and 

Women in Tech. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Education Programme 
Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Education 

Programme includes Understanding Allyship and 

Mitigating Bias training episodes, and a 

Demonstrating Allyship workshop. Across the 

business 90% of colleagues have completed episode 1 

and 96% of colleagues have completed episode 2.

A third episode on Microaggressions is in 

development and will be launched in FY 2023/24. 

Some examples of this include curating workshops 

and panel discussions with the expert insight of 

Stonewall, Global Butterflies and Investing in 

Ethnicity, and sponsoring The British Diversity 

Awards, which celebrates individuals, organisations 

and initiatives creating positive change. 

Accountability
All leaders across the business are accountable for 

the delivery of our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 

objectives. Our Executive Committee members have 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion objectives as part of 

their goals, with attracting and retaining diverse 

talent and promoting an inclusive culture within 

Burberry being key priorities. Supporting Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion plans both visibly and authentically 

is also the responsibility of our line managers and is 

assessed as part of our Leadership Standards.

To ensure our Diversity and Inclusion initiatives are 

aligned with best practice, we take part in industry- 

wide benchmarking. In FY 2022/23 Burberry was 

recognised by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index 

(GEI) for the third consecutive year. We also 

maintained a leading position in the 2023 FTSE 

Women Leaders Review, being named as a top 

performer in the Women in Leadership ranking. We 

performed above the average across leadership and 

talent pipeline, inclusive culture and external brand. 

The results highlighted areas in which our Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion strategy is successfully enacting 

change across the business and enabled us to identify 

areas where we can further support our colleagues 

and communities.

Human rights 

Human rights statement 
We are committed to respecting and upholding 

human rights wherever we operate. Our Human 

Rights Policy sets out our approach to managing 

human rights risks across our own operations and 

extended supply chain. The policy is aligned with 

international standards, including the International 

Bill of Human Rights and the UN Guiding Principles 

on Business and Human Rights. Responsibility  

for the policy lies with Burberry’s Chief Executive 

Officer. Our Human Rights Policy is available on 
Burberryplc.com. 

Burberry’s Ethics Committee oversees human rights 

risks and due diligence, and reports to the Audit 

Committee (see page 164 for further details of our 

governance structure). Our General Counsel and 

Global Human Resources team are responsible for 

ensuring our Human Rights Policy is upheld in our 

direct operations. Our Chief Supply Chain and 

Our latest impact assessment took place in the 

fourth quarter of FY 2022/23, where in addition  

to our standard assessment we conducted a 

supplementary analysis looking at where migrant 

workers’ human rights may mostly be affected. 

This assessment also included considerations related 

to the United Nations General Assembly’s recognition 

of the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable 

environment, under international law. We used this 

opportunity to explore what this could mean for the 

workers throughout our supply chain, who carry out a 

variety of manufacturing processes, in many different 

environments across the world.

These assessments identified the following key areas 

where human rights violations are more likely to be 

identified across our finished goods vendors and raw 

materials suppliers. These are:

•  Working and living conditions, including access to 

health services 

•  Worker voice

them. The Principles include our Ethical Trading Code 

of Conduct, which sets out standards to protect the 

rights of workers across our supply chain, as well as 

suppliers, and we will continue to enhance our risk 

mitigation in these areas of our supply chain.

In FY 2022/23, we conducted 449 audits and 19 

engagement activities across our global supply chain 

partners. During the audits, we conduct interviews 
with workers to better understand their needs and 

perceptions, while gathering insights into the direct

workshops were held to share the results and support 

the management team in identifying strengths and 

opportunities and guide them through areas of 

improvement. Based on the needs outlined by the 

survey, we have begun working with our key vendors 
and manufacturing facilities to develop specific action 

plans and monitor the progress made. 

During FY 2023/24, we plan to maintain engagement 

with current participants, working with them to 

strengthen the improvements achieved, measure the 

results obtained and cascade the project to their own 

supply chain where applicable. Moreover, we are 

planning to include more key vendors and 

manufacturing facilities to broaden our positive 

impacts across our supply chain. 

Worker grievance mechanism
We seek to ensure that colleagues and workers in our 

supply chain have access to confidential support and 

advice. We provide grievance mechanisms for our 

colleagues, including a global helpline which is 

managed by an independent company. We also 

sponsor confidential hotlines run by NGOs for 

workers in our supply chain, which provide advice on 

workers’ rights and wellbeing and confidential 

support. These worker hotlines are in place across 

38 factories in our supply chain, covering more than 

27,000 workers compared to 19,000 workers in 

FY 2021/22. During FY 2022/23, Burberry-sponsored 

hotlines received 502 calls (compared to 435 calls in 

FY 2021/22). Grievance resolution is monitored by 

the Corporate Responsibility team.

Embedding responsibility targets into our

The remuneration of the Executive Directors is 

partly linked to our progress in building a more 

sustainable future, including progress towards the 

Group’s longer term climate goals, via the annual 

bonus plan and a sustainability underpin in the 

Burberry Share Plan (BSP).

For FY 2023/24, 25% of the Executive Director’s 

bonus is once again linked to strategic measures 

including environmental and social measures and 

there will also be a sustainability underpin in the 2023 
BSP award. 

Building on this, in FY 2023/24 we are 

introducing specific sustainability metrics linked to 

our ambition to become Climate Positive by 2040

Burberry is committed to using its position and 

influence to drive social and environmental 

improvements and foster sustainability innovation in 

the value chain, from the sourcing of raw materials to 

the manufacturing of finished products and distribution 

through our stores and wholesalers. We are also 

committed to enlisting the support of investors in 

delivering these ambitions by linking Burberry’s 

Sustainability strategy to its funding requirements. 

Burberry issued a debut five-year sterling 

Sustainability Bond on 21 September 2020 for 

£300 million at a coupon of 1.125% (the “Sustainability 
Bond”). As part of the Sustainability Bond Framework1 
(the “Framework”), a commitment was made to 

publish a use of proceeds report within one year of the 

issuance of the Bond and annually thereafter. 

This report constitutes Burberry’s third use of

Potential areas of impact 

An increase in the frequency and severity of acute weather events may impact raw 

material sourcing, disrupt operations and damage facilities. Facility disruption may result 

from an increased risk of tropical windstorms and floods in Asia as well as increased risk of 

droughts and heatwaves in Asia, Europe and the Americas. 

The impact of physical risks will become more significant in the medium and longer term, 

particularly in the >4˚C and 2˚C to 3˚C scenarios. The impact of chronic physical risks, 

such as increasing global temperatures, will be particularly impactful over this time period.

Key assumptions 

•  Scenario analysis is based on our current asset base and value chain. Planned changes to 

our asset base and sourcing locations have not been taken into consideration in 

quantifying the five-year earnings at risk 

•  We have considered the extent to which financial impacts may be passed on to 

consumers. This has been assessed in line with expectations of market capacity for price 

increases and impact on net cash

•  Update in methodology in FY 2022/23 to include range of Representative Concentration 

Pathways (RCPs), Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase (CMIP6) data, updated 

hazard definitions and improved granularity when considering likelihood of hazards

Our strategic response 

•  We are committed to reducing our impact on the environment, promoting more 

sustainable practices in our supply chain, and ensuring that we build resilience in our 

operations. The quantifiable financial investments associated with these actions are 

included in our financial plans

•  We are committed to sourcing 100% certified organic cotton, which holds environmental 

benefits and is traced via a chain of custody by FY 2029/30

•  We continue to develop our business continuity and resilience plans to allow us to 

respond to the impacts of physical risks at key locations such as our distribution centres. 

Our Incident Management teams were convened to respond to a number of weather-

related events in FY 2022/23

•  We require regular effluent testing and work with over 40 wet processing facilities to 

monitor and improve effluent management practices. We also work with suppliers to 

identify water-saving opportunities, such as water recycling and leak repairs

•  We continue to monitor and adapt our supply chain to ensure we are able to both

How we modelled the risk 

We quantified how the implementation of carbon pricing may result in increased costs 

associated with production, distribution and raw materials.

Carbon prices and projected changes in these have been considered at a country level.

Potential areas of impact 

An increase in costs of production, distribution and raw materials in the short to medium 

term, with a higher carbon price required to achieve a lower temperature scenario.

 * Under a >4°C scenario there is potential for a minimal positive impact due to reversal of current carbon pricing policies.

Key assumptions 

•  Scenario analysis and quantification of the five-year earnings at risk does not take into 

consideration our actions to be Climate Positive by 2040 and therefore assumes a growth 

in GHG emissions aligned to an average growth rate used in our financial forecast

•  GHG emissions are based on our assured FY 2021/22 emissions footprint

•  We have considered the extent to which financial impacts incurred may be passed on to 

consumers. This has been assessed in line with expectations of market capacity for price 

increases and impact on net cash. Global carbon prices used in the modelling are shadow 

prices, which are a measure of overall policy intensity and expected to increase on a 

straight-line basis over the period. The annual carbon price has been interpolated based 

on the final carbon price reached at the end of the scenario modelling period. The global 

average carbon prices reached by the end of our scenario modelling period are:

•  1.5˚C = USD 75 per tonne 

•  2°C – 3°C = USD 5 to USD 45 per tonne

•  > 4°C = USD 0 per tonne 

Our strategic response 

•  In FY 2022/23, we published our Burberry Beyond: Climate Positive by 2040 report, which 

details our current GHG emissions footprint and our commitment to reducing this

•  We have reduced our absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 93% from our FY 2016/17 

base year and will continue to identify the energy efficiency opportunities required to reach 

and maintain our 95% reduction target in FY 2023/24. We also aim to reduce our absolute 

scope 3 GHG emissions by 46% by FY 2029/30. Our emissions targets are recognised by 

SBTi, and we will continue to report our progress against these

•  The remuneration of our Executive Directors is partly linked to our progress in building a 

more sustainable future, including progress towards our Group climate goals 

•  Our £300 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) is linked to our scope 3 GHG emissions 

reduction target

•  To support our strategic response, we have also quantified the potential impact of our 

Climate Positive by 2040 ambition on the Group’s exposure to this risk

The quantifiable financial investments associated with these actions are included in our 

financial plans. We will continue to embed our Climate Positive by 2040 roadmap and 

monitor this through KPIs applied across the business. We continue to monitor regulatory 

and market developments in carbon pricing to inform our strategy and financial plans.

animal-based products, towards organic, regenerative or recycled fabrics. This shift is 
expected to happen in the short to medium term, and more quickly in geographical regions 

where public attention on sustainable materials used to produce clothing is greater. The 

shift will be more apparent in a lower temperature scenario, which assumes that a higher 

proportion of consumers will adopt more sustainable choices.

Key assumptions 

•  Consumer perception of Burberry products is assumed to be linked to the carbon 

footprint of sourcing raw materials, production and distribution 

•  Scenario analysis is based on Burberry’s future product strategy, aligned with its 

updated strategic vision and projected raw material usage

•  We have considered how shifts in consumer preferences may impact operating margin 

and net cash. This has been assessed in line with our current cost structure

Our strategic response 

•  We are committed to shifting to more sustainable, low-impact materials. We have a 

series of ambitious targets to achieve this aim with Product being a key pillar of our 

Burberry Beyond strategy

•  We are a member of the Textile Exchange, which is a not-for-profit organisation working 

to increase the global market for sustainable fibres and to create certifiable 

sustainability standards for key raw materials

•  In FY 2022/23 we joined Fashion For Good, a global platform established to drive 

sustainable solutions within the textile industry. We have hired a Materials Innovation 

Manager to pilot innovation in the raw materials space

•  We are aiming to ensure all key materials are 100% traceable by FY 2029/30, supported  

by our use of certified materials where the country of origin is verified and disclosed. 

To support this, we are investing in a traceability solution. The quantifiable financial 

investments associated with these actions are included in our financial plans

share. Despite minimal shifts in consumer preferences in the short term under a >4°C 

scenario, a section of society may engage in general activism against organisations due to 

their inaction in relation to climate change, resulting in disruption and lost revenue.

Key assumptions

•  Scenario analysis is based on Burberry’s future Product strategy, aligned with its 

updated strategic vision

•  We have considered the extent to which financial impacts incurred may be passed on to 

consumers. This has been assessed in line with expectations of market capacity for price 

increases and impact on net cash

•  Scenario analysis uses a performance percentile to benchmark Burberry against its 

wider industry in terms of GHG emissions

Our strategic response

•  Sustainability is an increasingly important factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. 

Consumers, particularly the younger generations, expect brands to have a clear and 

comprehensive agenda with respect to sustainability and social responsibility, including 

carbon reduction efforts; sustainable raw material sourcing and traceability; fair labour 

practices; diversity and inclusion, and protecting nature

•  We are working to reduce our environmental footprint and meaningfully support our 

global communities while seeking to transform our industry 

•  We have made a number of industry-leading climate change commitments, which have 

been recognised externally:

•  Burberry received a Highly Commended in Communicating Integrated Thinking at the 

2022 Finance for the Future awards

•  In 2022, Burberry was ranked by CDP in the Leadership band, receiving an A for its 

climate change submission

•  We continue to play a role in shaping policy and regulation within our industry and are 

working collaboratively with partners, suppliers and other organisations to achieve our 

ambition. This includes the United Nations Global Compact, the Fashion Pact, The UN 

Fashion Charter, RE100, Race to Zero, Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest

Opportunities
In addition to these climate-related risks, there are also opportunities for risk mitigation and growth, which may arise for the 

Group as it transitions toward a lower-carbon economy.

The Group’s approach to identifying climate-related opportunities is integrated within its wider strategy to deliver positive 

change with sustainability at its core. Supported by the Group’s overarching Climate Positive by 2040 ambition, the Sustainability 

Committee is key to the identification, prioritisation and realisation of climate-related opportunities.

Risk Management
Climate change has been identified as a principal risk 

to Burberry see page 95 and has the potential to 

impact our business in the short, medium and long 

term as detailed on page 99. 

The overarching approach to identifying 

climate-related risks is the same as for all principal 

risks and is described on page 97. Additionally for 

climate-related risks, we have undertaken qualitative 

Climate-related risks and opportunities are 

continually monitored as part of our Enterprise Risk 

Management framework. This allows us to evaluate 

the relative significance of our risks based on their 

likelihood and impact, and to prioritise accordingly. 

The Group has also developed a risk platform, which 

enables us to track our business objectives, including 

those that create or protect financial, social, 

environmental and reputational value. 

scenario analysis since FY 2018/19 and a quantitative 

We also monitor the environment for new and 

scenario analysis since FY 2019/20 to support our 

emerging risks, and to keep abreast of evolving 

regulatory requirements. We will continue to develop 
our scenario analysis to improve our understanding of 

these risks and opportunities and align our strategy 

and actions accordingly. 

Metrics and targets
We have a number of metrics and targets in place to 

monitor and manage the most significant risks and 

opportunities arising from climate change. These are 

outlined in the tables on pages 105 to 109 and are 

linked to the risks modelled as part of the scenario 

analysis and the opportunities identified by the Group.

identification and understanding of such risks.

For each principal risk we have a risk management 

framework detailing the controls in place and those 

responsible for managing the overall risk and the 

relevant mitigating controls. We monitor risks 

throughout the year to identify changes in principal 

risk profiles. Management of climate-related risks  

is distributed throughout the organisation,  

depending on where the risk resides. For example, 

climate-related risks in relation to raw materials in 

the supply chain are managed by our Sourcing team 

responsible for buying commodities. 

The cross-functional TCFD working group defined 

the risk management methodology and approach for 

identifying and assessing climate-related risks and 

mitigating controls. Using scenario analysis, the 

working group quantified climate-related risks to 

Burberry and evaluated their size and scope. This 

supported the working group in prioritising risks and 

assessing the resilience of our business strategy to 

potential climate-change impacts.

When sustainability and climate-related risks are 

assessed, existing mitigating activities and controls 

are highlighted and, where relevant and appropriate, 

additional activities and controls are implemented  

if risks fall outside of appetite. Progress against 

these mitigating activities is assessed by the Risk 

Committee and is subject to independent review by 

Group Internal Audit as part of the annual audit plan. 

During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed  

the work performed by the TCFD working group, 

including progress against the four TCFD pillars and 

proposed disclosure.

Risk and Viability Report

Risk management at Burberry supports value creation and protects existing 
value. Our approach is to understand external and internal risks to Burberry, 
quantify the value at risk, implement and monitor controls, and maintain 
governance processes. This approach allows us to make informed decisions  
about which risks to prioritise and the controls necessary to mitigate and 
manage them. 

Our approach to risk 
Comprehensive risk management is essential to 

effective decision making in executing our strategy 
and delivering sustainable financial, environmental, 

The Group Risk team (Group Risk) comprises risk 

management, risk analytics, business continuity and 

insurance. This team assesses and prioritises risks to 
determine mitigating actions and to secure a more 

social and reputational value. We identify risks to our 

resilient organisation. Group Risk also promotes 

strategic objectives and support the implementation 

agility, by highlighting areas of control, which require 

of mitigations to manage those risks within our 

appetite. Risk assessments are formally updated, 

documented and approved at least twice a year.

The Board is ultimately responsible for determining 

the nature and extent of the principal risks that 

impact our ability to achieve our strategic objectives

Risk appetite 
We seek to protect the long-term value and 

reputation of our brand, maximising commercial 

benefits to support responsible and sustainable 

growth within a defined risk tolerance. 

We accept some risk in pursuit of growth through 

brand elevation commensurate with our position in 

luxury fashion. 

We approve capital investment in strategic projects 

and accept a moderate to high level of risk in our 

dynamic pursuit of profitable growth through our 

creativity and innovation, balancing a reasonable 

return on capital with a proportionate level of 

commercial risk within the approved Capital 

Allocation Framework. 

Complying with applicable laws and regulations and 

doing the right thing are part of our culture and 

underpin our strategic ambition. In evaluating risks 

and opportunities, we prioritise the interests and 

safety of our customers and our people. 

Our principal risks 
The Board considers principal risks to be the most 

significant risks faced by the Group, including those 

most material to our performance and those which 

could threaten our business model or the future 

long-term solvency or liquidity of Burberry. The Risk 

Committee, Audit Committee and Board approve the 

risk positions, movements and outlooks for each of 

the principal risks at least twice a year. Where any 

risks are outside of tolerance, we put additional plans 

in place to mitigate the risk exposure within a 

reasonable timeframe. The principal risks do not 

comprise all the risks associated with our business 

and are not set out in priority order in the Annual 

Report. We conduct horizon scanning to identify 

additional risks not known to management, or 

currently deemed to be less material, which may also 

have an adverse effect on our business. 

Our risk framework is structured using the following 

categories of risk: External, Strategic, Operational 

and Compliance. Each principal risk is linked to one of 

these categories and may impact one or more of our 

strategic priorities. Climate change has been included 

in our strategic risk category for FY 2022/23.

Our business continuity approach focuses on critical 

risks and controls, enabling the business to prioritise

simulated with the Group Incident Management  

team to plan a response to the materialisation of 

significant risks. 

Interruption principal risk to incorporate pandemic 

risk and the separate categorisation of a Supply 

Chain principal risk. We have revised our Global 

Chinese Consumer Spending principal risk to be 

included under a new principal risk of Global 

Consumer Demand to better align to our global 

strategy. The UK withdrawal from the EU has been 

incorporated into Regulatory risk and Ethical/ 

Environmental standards. 

For each principal risk, we have assessed the level  

of risk compared to the previous financial year and 

discussed the risk outlook for the year ahead with  

the business risk owners.

Our reviews of and changes to principal risks are 

approved by the Risk Committee, Audit Committee, 

and Board. The business has implemented a new 

reporting tool to monitor the risk movement and 

outlook of principal risks as well as the status of 

controls and mitigating actions.

Macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty 

The Group operates in a wide range of markets and is exposed to changing 
economic, regulatory, social and political developments, which may impact 
consumer demand or affect our supply chain and manufacturing, and therefore 
our profitability. Adverse macroeconomic conditions or country-specific crises, 
such as natural disasters, global health emergencies or civil unrest, may significantly 
impact our markets and our ability to operate.

Risk movement and outlook 
The risk has increased since last year. The outlook

Risk tolerance 
We recognise external factors can be more difficult

This requires us to be resilient, while retaining 

the agility required to respond effectively.

Image and reputation

We invest in building trust in our brand and protecting our image and reputation 
globally. Unfavourable incidents, unethical behaviour or negative media coverage

as well as a loss of customers, and negatively impact the value of our brand. 
While internal enhancements continue to be made to protect Burberry’s image 
and reputation, we operate in an increasingly complex and volatile external 
environment and scrutiny of our brand is high. As such, the risk to our brand

Global consumer demand 

Global consumer demand for Burberry’s creative and innovative products is 
subject to influence by external factors, including economic, regulatory and social 
or political disruption, which could alter regional spending and consumer 
preferences for the consumption of luxury products. 

Burberry’s product design, quality and range of product offerings combined with 
the effectiveness of marketing and customer service channels impact demand for 
Burberry products.

Inability to offer a global assortment of luxury products that appeal to consumers in 
key luxury markets or nationalities would impact the Group’s revenue and profits. 

Risk movement and outlook 
Global Consumer Demand is a new risk for

consumers, for example Mainland China

Despite headwinds from geopolitical tensions, 

elevated levels of inflation, reduced Gross 

Domestic Product (GDP) growth and COVID-19 

continuing to impact key regions, the luxury 

industry held up well during FY 2022/23. 

The outlook for the luxury industry is positive. 

Burberry’s creative transition supports global 

growth opportunities and the key pillars of 

Burberry’s strategy. Burberry remains 

responsive to factors that could impact demand 

for Burberry products. 

Link to strategy 
All strategic pillars 

Risk tolerance 
Burberry operates a global strategy that is 

underpinned by the creation of innovative product, 

requiring Burberry to adapt to changes in consumer 

demands and preferences. To maximise growth 

opportunities, we recognise the need to take a 

moderate level of risk in our exposure to changes 

in preferences on the part of consumer 

nationalities and socio-economic groups. 

•  Strong luxury market growth and/or dominance by 

a particular region, increasing geographical 

concentration risk 

•  Regional market growth and financial performance 

does not meet the expected return on investment 

either in magnitude or in timing 

•  Failure to identify new growth opportunities in new 

regions, channels or product lines. For example, 

inability to capture additional consumer spend 

resulting in lost sales opportunities in these markets 

•  Failure to adapt our product and creative offering 

to emerging consumer preferences and changing 

demographics causing a deterioration in brand 

desirability. This includes changes to consumer 

demand for luxury, digital offerings, online delivery, 

sustainable materials, circular business models and 

other emerging consumer preferences 

•  Inefficiency or ineffectiveness of customer 

services, e-commerce and fulfilment to deliver a 

positive luxury customer journey 

•  Product, marketing quality, design or our range of 

offerings does not meet consumer expectations or 

respond to local cultural sensitivities in key markets

Climate change 

The success of our business over the long term will depend on the social and 
environmental sustainability of our operations, the resilience of our supply chain 
and our ability to manage any potential climate change impacts on our business 
model and performance. As the global climate crisis becomes more critical, 
we recognise the importance of addressing long-term sustainability challenges 
and potential impacts of climate change on our business in reputational, 
operational compliance and financial terms. Failure to implement appropriate 
cross-functional action plans and strategies, such as incorporating the 
recommendations of TCFD and our Climate Positive by 2040 ambition, could 
hinder mitigation of long-term climate risks and our ability to future-proof 
our business. 

Link to strategy 
Our values and our approach to sustainability support 

our seamless execution strategic pillar. Our Climate 

Positive by 2040 target is part of our ambition to be an 

industry leader in responsible and sustainable luxury, 

and to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. 

Key milestones include reducing our absolute scope 3 

emissions by 46% against a 2019 baseline by 2030, 

and neutralising our residual emissions. 

Risk tolerance 
We have a low tolerance to business disruption and 

reputational damage from climate change. We are 

dedicated to achieving our Climate Positive by 2040 

ambition and building resilience in our operations and 

supply chain.  

Risk movement and outlook

Physical risk movement and outlook: 
The aggregated physical risks and impacts of climate 

change on the business continues to increase. 

During FY 2022/23, several episodes of extreme 

weather including flooding, droughts and new 

temperature records were reported. Without 

significant global mitigation efforts from government, 

businesses and their value chains alongside 

collaboration from wider industry and civil society, 

the effects are predicted to increase year on year  

and cause irreversible impacts.

Transitional risk movement and outlook: 
Transitional risks have continued to increase in 

significance since last year with more stringent 

environmental standards and greater customer 

expectations for businesses in the luxury industry  

to transition to sustainable operations and reduce 

contributions to climate change. This trend is 

expected to continue. The business will continue 

investment to support these regulatory standards 

and customer expectations aligned to its 

climate targets.

Group’s business areas and functions 

•  A “top-down” process to assess key risks to our 

strategic priorities, overseen by the Risk Committee 

Key risk themes were analysed and our principal risks

Group’s principal risks was discussed at the Risk 

Committee and Audit Committee meetings, and 

approved by the Board in March 2023.

area of focus. We undertake detailed horizon 

scanning in conjunction with our Strategy team and 

principal risk owners to identify and assess emerging 

risks and opportunities and how to address them. 

Emerging risks are by their nature highly uncertain; 

to better understand them and their potential 

impacts we involve specialist third parties where 

necessary. Our risk management approach considers 

short-term to be one year, medium-term to be two 

to five years and long-term more than five years.

External emerging risk considerations

Political

•  Trade restrictions – increasing geopolitical tensions and resulting policies may restrict free trade, 
for example through quotas and higher customs duties, as well as limit access to countries where 

we sell product and/or our suppliers and extended supply chain

Economic

•  Energy and raw material availability and price volatility – unpredictable changes in energy costs or 

availability may disrupt our operations and cost base

•  Wage inflation and labour shortages – may bring challenges to our ability to operate and achieve 

our target margins

Social

•  Acceleration of consumer Environmental, Social and Governance preferences – the pace of 

change in consumer expectations with respect to sustainable luxury may increase faster than the 

business is able to adapt, impacting revenues. This includes raised expectations regarding 

sustainable sourcing and circular business models featuring recycled materials, as well as rental 

and repair services

•  Consumer focus on Environmental, Social and Governance performance – increasing scrutiny of 

operations and expectations around transparency

•  Influential groups and third parties – influencers having greater impact on consumer spending 

patterns in the luxury goods industry, requiring increased investment in collaborations

Technology

•  Expanding digital channels – changing consumer spending habits and expectations may accelerate 
demand for digital luxury (for example, virtual products and stores, NFTs, access to the metaverse, 

payment methods, integrated channels and seamless end-to-end customer journeys) 

•  Full supply chain traceability – may require investment in new technologies and/or complex data 
systems in combination with greater collaboration between participants in the fashion value chain

•  Cyber risk – may accelerate (for example, quantum computing) requiring enhanced encryption to 

protect corporate data and systems

•  AI technology – expectations around the use of and the implications of generative AI may increase 

risks to luxury fashion and our business 

145

Burberry 2022/23Strategic Report | Risk Management Activities

External emerging risk considerations continued

Legal

•  Data and financial reporting regulations – increasing financial reporting requirements and data 

compliance standards (including UK corporate governance regulations); and Chinese data 

regulations (including, the Personal Information Protection Law and Multi-Level Protection of 

Information Security legislation), increase the risk of non-compliance and complexity of operations

•  Environmental standards/regulations – increased regulatory requirements around sustainability 
disclosures and detailed evidence of progress on Environmental, Social and Governance initiatives 

and commitments and new regulations aimed at promoting the circular economy and reducing 

waste, increase the risk of non-compliance and complexity of operations

•  Shifting sanctions and counter-sanctions landscape – sanctions impacting access and complexity 

of international trade

Environmental

•  Physical climate risks – chronic and acute changes in extreme weather and climatic conditions 
increase the risk of interruption to our business operations. This includes reduced raw material 

availability (including water), reduced energy availability, natural catastrophe impacting key sites or 

sourcing locations (for example, flooding), transportation delays, and unsuitable human working 

conditions (extreme temperatures)

Identification of risks

Investing in risk management
The volatility in the external risk environment has 

continued to challenge the operating environment of 

large multi-national corporate organisations and 

further intensified the need for an effective approach 

to managing risk and uncertainty. We identify and 

manage risks, which could prevent us creating and 

protecting financial, environmental and social value. 

Throughout FY 2022/23, we invested in our risk 

analytics capabilities to support our leadership teams 

with identification and high-quality risk insights that 
support decision making. This included investment in 

technology to support the business with a systemic 

approach to risk monitoring and reporting, in addition 

to scenario modelling. Our Risk, Insurance, Business 

Continuity and Risk Analytics functions are managed 

together. This integrated approach allows us to focus 

on value growth and protection, while prioritising 

Environmental, Social and Governance considerations. 

Together, these functions ensure audit resources are 

deployed effectively to provide assurance to the most 

significant risk areas of our business. 

We also carry out work programmes to ensure our 

Business Continuity Planning function and our 

insurance strategy are as effective and efficient as 

possible, addressing our need for a resilient business, 

able to take rapid, effective decisions on key risks. 

Risk process
Our approach aligns the risks reported by our regional 

businesses with those identified in our principal risk 

analysis. By aligning our risks, we are better able to 

support the business by investing in appropriate 

Group and local controls. In addition, we have focused 

areas of risk capability, specifically: 

•  Legal and ethics: our Legal team manages a  

wide spectrum of risks through in-house experts 

and a network of external specialist advisors. 

Ethics matters are governed through a dedicated 

Ethics Committee 

•  IT: our IT function manages operational risks on 
significant IT programmes, assuring delivery, 

efficiency and value for money. IT is responsible  

for the cybersecurity framework and operation. 

Our IT risk capability works very closely with our 

Business Continuity and Incident Response 

Manager, ensuring that we prioritise key systems 

and processes 

Strategic risk 
We have reviewed the key risks, which may impede 

our ability to achieve our strategic goals, and use 

scenario analysis and risk appetite mechanisms to 

manage them. 

Scenario analysis 
Risk modelling capability is used to quantify risks and 

understand the impacts of various scenarios on the 

luxury industry and on Burberry. The model is 

designed to quantify the risks posed by significant 

world trends, including global recession, pandemic 

and others at various levels of severity. The modelling 

and scenario analysis provide information for the 

Group Financial Planning and Group Strategy 

functions, and will be expanded further to incorporate 

more of the principal risks in FY 2023/24.

value of the Burberry brand while ensuring we 

secure the financial headroom required to fuel 

growth as market opportunities arise. The business 

is expected to remain strongly cash generative 

creating further optionality for investment and 

increased returns to shareholders

The key assumptions considered in our strategic plan 

are future sales performance by product, channel and 

geography; the cost to procure and produce our 

products; other expenditure plans; cash generation, 

and that there is no material long-term impairment 

to the Burberry brand. We also consider the Group’s 

projected liquidity, balance sheet strength and the 

potential impact of the plan on shareholder returns. 

Where appropriate, we have made adjustments to our 

planning process to include scenarios relating to key 

assumptions as a result of the uncertain 

macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.

Assessment of prospects 
We remain confident in our ability to consolidate our 

position in luxury fashion and are committed to our 

strategic vision for Burberry. The Group’s strategy is 

set out on pages 20 to 29. Key strategic focus areas 

to respond to the current industry backdrop are: 

•  Harness the power of our brand: the luxury market 

continues to demonstrate resilience despite 

macroeconomic uncertainty, and a strong luxury 

positioning is paramount during this period. We are 

leveraging the British heritage that makes 

Burberry special to deepen our relationship with 

customers and drive growth. In a challenging 

macroeconomic environment, consumers are likely 

to become increasingly discerning in their 

purchases, orientating towards strong brands. 

Diminished demand in certain markets is also likely 

to increase competition and reinforce the 

importance of investing in brand and inspiration

Burberry 2022/23Corporate Governance Statement | Chair’s Introduction

Chair’s Introduction

“Burberry’s long-term success depends on our 
values and strong culture, underpinned by 
robust governance.”

Dear Shareholder,

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Report for the 

year ended 1 April 2023. This report describes Burberry’s corporate governance framework 

and procedures and summarises the work of the Board and its Committees to illustrate how 

we have discharged our responsibilities this year.

Burberry’s long-term success depends on our values and strong culture, underpinned by 

robust governance. This report sets out how our governance processes support Burberry’s 

long-term success and the Board’s role in overseeing the implementation of strategy and 

monitoring of the Group’s culture. We explain the various ways in which we engage with our 

key stakeholders to assess whether Burberry’s culture is embedded across the business and 

is reflected in the way we do business and in our dealings with stakeholders.

During the year, the Board has overseen the development of the sustainability strategy  

under the banner Burberry Beyond. The Board has taken time, with a dedicated session in 

May 2022 led by the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, to discuss Burberry’s 

sustainability performance, strategic evolution and key focus areas. Other areas of Board 

focus are detailed on pages 168 to 171.

It is just over a year since Jonathan Akeroyd joined Burberry as CEO. I have welcomed the 

wealth of experience and insight he brings to the Board and his energy and commitment to 

drive important changes within Burberry.

Board changes during FY 2022/23
Julie Brown stepped down from the Board as CO&FO on 1 April 2023 after more than six years 

at Burberry. During her tenure, Julie played a key role in Burberry’s transformation and built a 

strong financial base for the next chapter of growth. On behalf of the Board, I would like to 

thank Julie and wish her the best in her future endeavours.

Following a recruitment process led by the Nomination Committee, we appointed Kate Ferry 

as Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Kate will join Burberry on 17 July 2023 and, in the interim, 

Ian Brimicombe has been appointed as Interim Chief Financial Officer from 2 April 2023.  

Ian is exceptionally qualified to lead our financial strategy during this transition period,  

having played a central role in steering our financial strategy over the past six years.

155

Burberry 2022/23Corporate Governance Statement | Chair’s Introduction

We also welcomed Alan Stewart who was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2022. 

More information on the recruitment process for Kate and on Alan’s induction programme 

can be found in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 186 and 187.

There were further changes to the Committees during the year. Orna NíChionna was 

appointed as Senior Independent Director on 2 April 2022. Danuta Gray succeeded Orna as 

Chair of the Remuneration Committee on 1 September 2022. As announced on 5 August 2022, 

Matthew Key will retire as a Non-Executive Director following the Annual General Meeting 

(AGM) in July 2023 having served on the Board for just over nine years. Following Matthew’s 

retirement, Alan Stewart will be appointed as Chair of the Audit Committee.

Board effectiveness
This year the Board undertook an internal performance review. An explanation of the process 
undertaken and the findings of the review can be found on pages 179 to 181, together with an 

update on our progress in addressing the actions identified following the FY 2021/22 review. 

My role as Chair includes ensuring that the Board operates effectively within an environment 

of openness and inclusivity and that all Board members contribute to the fullest extent, so 

that we make the most of their diverse skills and experience. We ensure that new Board 

members receive everything they need to contribute fully as soon as possible and I review the 

performance of individual Board members with a view to ensuring the optimum functioning of 

the Board. 

Following the 2022 AGM we contacted shareholders who had voted against the re-election of 

Antoine de Saint-Affrique to understand their concerns. We explain on page 184 why we 

believe that Antoine continues to be an effective and valuable member of the Board and the 

actions taken to understand shareholder concerns since the 2022 AGM.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Burberry Directors’ Remuneration Policy was last approved by shareholders in 2020  

and shareholders will be asked to renew that approval at the 2023 AGM in line with the 

Companies Act 2006 which requires shareholder approval at least every three years.  

As set out in the letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, which introduces  

the Directors’ Remuneration Report commencing on page 200 of this Annual Report, 

the Committee is not recommending any material changes to the Policy. When considering 

changes to Executive Director remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into 

account the experience of the wider workforce and has been particularly mindful of the  

impact of the cost-of-living crisis on colleagues, particularly those in lower-paid roles.

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Burberry complied with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code during 

FY 2022/23 with the exception of Provision 38, which refers to Executive Directors’ pensions 

compared to the wider workforce. Full compliance with Provision 38 was confirmed with 

effect from 1 January 2023 when the pension contribution levels for our CO&FO were aligned 

with the maximum rate available to the majority of our UK workforce.

Burberry 2022/23Corporate Governance Statement | Corporate Governance Report

Governance structure and division 
of responsibilities
The Board (supported by its Committees) is collectively 

responsible for how Burberry is directed and 

controlled. Its responsibilities include:

•  Promoting Burberry’s long-term success

•  Setting its strategic aims and values

•  Supporting leadership in delivering strategy

•  Supervising and constructively challenging 

leadership on the operational running of 

the business

•  Ensuring a framework of prudent and 

effective controls

•  Reporting to shareholders on the 

Board’s stewardship

More information on the Company’s governance 

structure can be found on page 173.

Environmental, Social and Governance
Sustainability is an essential element of Burberry’s 

strategy for which the Board is responsible. 

Accordingly, the Board is also responsible for 

ensuring its approach to sustainability is integrated 

into and implemented across the business, reflecting 

the increasing importance of these topics to the 

Group and society as a whole. The governance 

framework of committees and advisory forums (as 

shown in the diagram on page 173) provides regular 

updates and key information to the Board, to ensure 

that it is able to make informed decisions. 

Sustainability is embedded into the remit of the 

committees where appropriate.

For more information on the Group’s Environmental, 

Social and Governance priorities see pages 50 to 93.

Stakeholder engagement
As highlighted by the Code, the Board recognises the 

The Board has chosen to engage with the workforce 

through the formally-constituted Global Workforce 

Advisory Forum which is one of the methods set out 

in Code Provision 5. The Board uses additional ways 

to understand employee views including the employee 

engagement survey and site visits. During the year, 

the Board visited Italy and had the opportunity to 

tour our manufacturing facility and speak to colleagues.

Our Investor Relations team met with over 280 

investors during the financial year. Our Chair, the 

Chair of the Remuneration Committee, Executive 

Directors and other members of senior management 
met with over 60 investors. This engagement 

included presentations to institutional shareholders 

and analysts following the release of the Group’s 

half- and full-year results (available on the Group’s 

website Burberryplc.com), as well as meetings with 

the Group’s 20 largest investors. Topics discussed in 

investor meetings included Jonathan Akeroyd’s 

strategy, Daniel Lee’s appointment and first show, 

regional performance and management changes. 

The team also arranged specific ESG engagements

Monitoring our Corporate Culture

In FY 2022/23, we continued to build on Burberry’s Leadership Standards, using 
our organisation’s purpose and values as a common framework for how we 
operate and the expectations we have of our colleagues. As a Board, we 
recognise the vital role of ensuring that Burberry’s workplace culture is aligned 
with our purpose, values and strategy. We are equally cognisant of the 
opportunities created when our colleagues bring this purpose to life.

How we measure culture
The Board has continued its programme of day-to-

day interactions with Burberry colleagues, through 
site and store visits. Our Global Workforce Advisory

the Board to discuss key topics. 

In FY 2022/23, the Forum met three times and 

discussed reward and benefits, sustainability,

Composition, Succession

Board evaluation 

Evaluating our performance
The Board undertakes a formal annual review of its 

effectiveness, which is designed to help identify 

opportunities to improve and enhance its own 

performance and that of the Group. The evaluation 

process is led by the Chair and includes a review of 

the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the 

Board’s Committees and each individual Director. 

Every three years, the evaluation is facilitated 

externally with the last external evaluation taking 
place in FY 2020/21.

Internal evaluation in FY 2022/23
In November 2022, the Board decided to conduct an 

internal questionnaire-based review for FY 2022/23 

with the support of Independent Audit’s Thinking 

Board tool. Independent Audit Limited has no other 

connection with the Company. The Chair of the Board 

and the Chairs of each of the Board Committees 

worked with the Company Secretary to devise the 

questionnaires, which were circulated in February 

2023. The results were evaluated and discussed at 

the March Board meeting, following which the Board 

confirmed its view that the Board continues to 

operate effectively within an inclusive and 

transparent environment and displays a number of 

strengths, including: 

The questionnaires were supplemented by meetings 

between the Chair and each Director to discuss 

individual performance, seek additional feedback and 

raise any issues or concerns regarding the 

management of the Company or the Board’s 

performance. On resignation, Non-Executive 

Directors are also encouraged to provide a  

written statement of any concerns to the Chair. 

No such concerns were raised in FY 2022/23. 

These discussions, together with the Nomination 

Committee’s considerations of independence, time 

commitment and tenure, are used as the basis for 
recommending the re-election of Directors by 

shareholders. The Board is satisfied that all Non-

Executive Directors bring robust, independent 

oversight and continue to remain independent.

The evaluation process also concluded that the Audit, 

Nomination and Remuneration Committees continue 

to operate well and provide effective support to the 

Board in carrying out its duties.

Separate to the formal Board evaluation process, the 

Senior Independent Director led a review of the 

Chair’s performance. The review included circulation 

of a short questionnaire, one-to-one meetings with 

each of the Non-Executive Directors and a final 

meeting of the Non-Executive Directors, without the 

Chair being present, to conclude on the review. The 

unanimous view was that the Chair continued to 

perform very effectively and to provide strong

Principal role and responsibilities
As set out in the terms of reference, which are 

Given the Board appointments made during 

FY 2022/23, we believe there is a good balance 

available on the Company’s website, Burberryplc.com, 

between more recently appointed Directors and

number of areas across three main categories 

as listed below.

those who have served for longer periods and  

provide consistency with respect to experience and 

knowledge of Burberry as a brand and as a company.

Board composition
•  Reviewing the composition, size, skills and diversity 

of the Board and its Committees to maintain the 

relevant balance of skills and independence

•  Identifying and making recommendations to the  

Board on suitable candidates to fill Board vacancies

Talent and executive succession planning
•  Considering succession planning for the Executive 

Committee and other key senior management roles 

in line with the talent management framework

Corporate governance
•  Considering the independence and time 

commitments of Non-Executive Directors

•  Making recommendations to the Board on election 

and re-election of Directors at the AGM

•  Reviewing the Board Composition and Diversity 

Principles to ensure they remain fit for purpose

Update on Antoine de Saint-Affrique’s 
time commitment
At Burberry’s AGM in 2022, some shareholders 

expressed concerns about the number of Antoine de 

Saint-Affrique’s other listed directorships and the 

potential impact on his time commitment to Burberry. 

Since the 2022 AGM, we have contacted major 

shareholders who voted against Antoine’s re-election 

to understand their views and reassure them that 

Antoine has brought, and continues to bring, 

considerable business and management experience 

and exceptional knowledge of sustainability and global 

consumer markets to Board discussions. The Board 

believes that Antoine makes valuable contributions  

to the work of the Board and Committees of which  

he is a member, drawing from his wide experience 

across many industries. The Chair reviews each 

Non-Executive Director’s effectiveness each year 

and, when considering Antoine’s performance,

with appropriate competencies and values are better 

boards. In line with the Board’s Composition and 

Diversity Principles, all new Board appointments will 

continue to be made on merit. Our approach includes:

•  Ensuring the search pool includes candidates from 

diverse backgrounds with experience and insights 

relevant to the Group’s strategic priorities

•  Taking into account Burberry’s purpose, culture 

and values, as well as changing business needs, 

while also having regard to wider stakeholder 

requirements and environmental factors

•  Promoting diversity, including in terms of gender, 

social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and 

personal strengths

Antoine’s attendance record speaks for itself: in 

FY 2022/23, Antoine attended 100% of the Board 

and Committee meetings, including the Board’s visit 

to Burberry sites in Italy in October 2022, 100% of 

Audit Committee meetings and 100% of Nomination 

Committee meetings. He also attended the AGM and 

has attended additional Board calls and meetings during 

the year when required. He has also participated  

in a number of additional opportunities to meet 

colleagues and engage with other stakeholders 

throughout the year. Antoine’s attendance at our 

scheduled meetings and participation in all ad hoc 

discussions demonstrated his capacity to fulfil his 

obligations in each of his roles, even during 

exceptionally demanding periods.

184

Burberry 2022/23Corporate Governance Statement | Report of the Nomination Committee

The Board has therefore determined that Antoine 

has sufficient time to meet his Board responsibilities 

as required by Principle H of the UK Corporate 

Senior management talent and 
succession planning
The Committee monitored changes to the talent 

Governance Code.

Antoine has spent his working life in large 

international companies with globally renowned 

consumer brands. He is a world-class Director and 

his wealth of knowledge and experience would be 

hard to replace. Burberry’s experience of Antoine  

as a committed and engaged Director has been  

very positive, not least in the areas of executive and 

global brand management, sustainability and deep 
operational experience in our key markets in Asia, 

Europe and North America. 

In summary, the Board has carefully considered the 

concerns raised by certain shareholders regarding 

Antoine’s ability to devote sufficient time to his 

duties at Burberry and has determined that, based  

on experience to date, Antoine’s capacity to perform 

his role is not impaired in any way by his other time 

commitments. As an executive of the highest calibre, 

we feel it would not be in the best interests of the 

Company to deprive Burberry of Antoine’s services. 

The Board will of course monitor this position closely 

and, should circumstances change, the Chair would 

take appropriate action.

The Board is satisfied that all Directors, including 

Antoine, continue to make effective and valuable 

landscape during the year and reviewed the talent 

pipelines for the Executive Committee and other key 

leadership roles. When considering the succession 

plans, the Committee reviewed progress in increasing 

diversity of gender and ethnicity, considered the core 

capabilities required to deliver the Group’s strategic 

priorities and agreed plans to provide opportunities 

for Board members to meet key senior executives in 

order to deepen relationships and support engagement. 

During FY2022/23, the CEO provided regular 

updates to the Board and Board Committees to  

keep them informed of changes to senior leadership 

and the composition of the Executive Committee, 

including newly-created roles designed to support 

implementation of the next phase of the strategy. 

The Committee supports the CEO in hiring the right 

talent to strengthen brand capabilities and drive 

business growth. 

Board changes
The composition of the Board and its Committees 

was a key area of focus for the Committee during 

FY 2022/23. In addition, we continued to focus on the 

Board’s evolution and, in light of Matthew Key having 

served on the Board for nine years, we identified a 

need for an additional Non-Executive Director who

Disclosures required under Listing Rule 9.8.6 as at 1 April 2023
The Financial Conduct Authority introduced a new listing rule on diversity and inclusion disclosures applying to financial periods 

commencing on or after 1 April 2022. As at 1 April 2023 (being the reference date selected by the Board for the purposes of this 

disclosure), the Company complied with the regulatory targets set out in Listing Rule 9.8.6 R (9) as the Board was 41.7% female, 

both the Senior Independent Director and the CO&FO were women and the Board had two Directors from a minority ethnic 

background. Julie Brown, the CO&FO, stepped down from the Board on 1 April 2023 and as a result female representation on the 

Board has temporarily dropped below 40%. Following the AGM on 12 July 2023 female representation will return to 40% and will

Report of the Audit Committee

“I am confident that over 
the course of the year the 
Committee has carried out 
its duties effectively and to 
a high standard.” 

Matthew Key

We also focused on accounting judgements relating 

to inventory provisioning and store impairments,  

and management’s consideration of uncertain 

tax positions.

Further information on how the Audit Committee 

addressed significant matters during the year is set 

out in the table on pages 193 to 195.

The Committee reviewed and challenged 

management’s approach, analysis and 

recommendations, taking into account input from the 

external auditor, in order to conclude on the 

appropriateness of the treatment in the Financial 

Statements. All matters reviewed were concluded to 

the satisfaction of the Committee. 

In relation to the Group’s risk management, we 

carried out a detailed review of management’s 

assessment of principal risks, tolerance levels and 

mitigations, and concluded these were appropriate. 

We reviewed management’s proposed expansion  

of TCFD reporting, reflecting new data and

was appropriate. We also considered the risks 

associated with cybersecurity, including ransomware, 

and reviewed the revised fraud risk framework and its 

application to internal audit.

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present the FY 2022/23 Report of 

the Audit Committee. The purpose of this report  

is to describe how the Committee carried out its 

responsibilities during the year.

The role of the Audit Committee is to monitor and 

review the integrity of financial information and to 

provide assurance to the Board that the Group’s 

internal controls and risk management processes  

are appropriate and regularly reviewed. We also 

oversee the work of the external auditor, approve  

its remuneration and recommend its appointment. 

Details of how the Audit Committee has monitored 

Ernst & Young’s audit are available on page 196. 

In addition to the disclosure requirements relating to 

audit committees under the Code, the Committee’s 

report sets out areas of significant and particular 

focus for the Committee.

Following the FRC audit quality team’s review of 

Ernst & Young’s audit of the Group’s Consolidated 

Financial Statements for the year ended 2 April 

2022, the FRC wrote to the Chair of the Audit 

Committee setting out the scope of its review, 

its principal key findings and areas of good practice 

identified. Overall the Audit Committee noted the 

review did not raise any key findings to consider and, 

accordingly, the Committee confirmed it was 

satisfied this was a high quality audit.

equipment and right-of-use 

including property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets relating to store leases.

The Committee considered the approach applied by management to update assessments

of previously impaired cash generating units and their review for potential indicators of 

impairment for other retail cash generating units.

The Committee reviewed and challenged the sensitivities applied to the estimates of 

future store performance and reviewed management’s proposed disclosures relating to 

these uncertainties. The Committee concluded that the carrying value of assets held in 

retail cash generating units and disclosures contained in the Financial Statements for the 
period were appropriate. The results of the impairment assessment of assets held in 

retail cash generating units, together with related sensitivities, are set out in note 13 of 

the Financial Statements.

The recoverability of the cost of 

In November and March, the Committee considered management’s assessment of the 

inventory and the resulting 

recoverability of the cost of inventory and the resulting amount of provisioning required. 

amount of provisioning required

The Committee reviewed the Group’s current provisioning policy, the expected loss rates 

on inventory held at the balance sheet date and the nature and condition of current 

inventory. The review included analysis of actual inventory noting the age and expected 

exit routes for the remaining surplus inventory held at the balance sheet date and the 

actual loss rates experienced. The Committee considered the sensitivity to the 

assumptions of loss rate and exit route in order to understand how management 

quantified the range of potential outcomes and level of estimation applied. The Committee 

concluded that the inventory assets recognised and disclosures contained in the Financial 

Statements for the period were appropriate.

Movements in inventory provisioning and the related sensitivities are set out in note 17 of 

the Financial Statements.

How the Audit Committee addressed these matters

Uncertain tax positions

The Committee reviewed the Tax Update and Tax Strategy, developments relating to 

discussions with tax authorities, the status of any ongoing tax audits, and their impact on 

the Financial Statements. The Committee reviewed and challenged the appropriateness of 

assumptions and estimates applied in order to estimate the amount of assets and 

liabilities to be recognised in relation to uncertain tax positions and the disclosure of any 

significant estimates applied to tax balances. The Committee also discussed matters with 

external advisors where significant estimation was required. The Committee concluded 

that the assets and liabilities recognised and disclosures contained in the Financial 

Statements for the period were appropriate. Details of movements in tax balances are set 

out in notes 9 and 15 of the Financial Statements and further disclosure of tax contingent 

liabilities is given in note 31.

Going concern and viability

The Committee considered the going concern and viability analysis carried  

out by management. The Committee considered the risks that could threaten the Group’s 

business model, future performance, solvency, liquidity and reputation and how these were 

included in the severe but plausible downside scenario, which included an aggregation of a 

number of severe impacts of these principal risks and the reverse stress test scenario 

alongside the facilities available to the Group as well as mitigating actions that could be 

taken. The Committee concluded that a robust assessment had been carried out  

and in all the scenarios considered the Group was able to maintain sufficient liquidity to 

continue trading.

Task Force on Climate-related 

The Committee considered the TCFD reporting on behalf of the Board. The Committee 

Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

considered the approach taken by management to further develop the scenario analysis, 

including new data and measurement bases that had been updated since the prior report. 

The Committee noted the impact of climate scenarios, which had been updated to reflect 

Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase (CMIP6). The Committee paid particular 

attention to the increase in the quantified impact of physical risks arising from the 

changes to the climate model as well as transition risks, in particular the transition risk 

relating to market and consumer preference.

The Committee reviewed the disclosure in the Annual Report on behalf of the Board to 

ensure that it was in compliance with the TCFD recommendations and the limited 

assurance provided by the Group’s auditors.

Fair, balanced and 

The Committee considered the Annual Report and Interim Report, on behalf of the Board, 

understandable reporting

to ensure that they were fair, balanced and understandable, in accordance with requirements 

of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee paid particular attention to  

the approach taken by management to separate presentation of any items relating to 

impairments of assets or reversal of previous impairments, which were separately 

presented, together with the disclosure of the basis of the treatment applied. The 

Committee reviewed the report from the strategic report drafting team, comments 

arising from the review of the Financial Statements by the Executive Directors and 

comments raised by the Group’s auditors. The Committee also considered the use of 

alternative performance measures by the Group, and concluded that they were 

appropriate and their disclosure in the Financial Statements and Strategic Report was 

fair, balanced and understandable.

Other matters 

During the year the Committee also considered management’s papers on other subjects, 

including the carrying value of goodwill and associated disclosures, the consistency of 

policy and accuracy for the recognition and measurement of adjusting items for 

restructuring costs, and significant judgements relating to lease term and impairment 

of receivables.

External auditor
EY commenced their first year of audit in FY 2020/21 

following a competitive tender process. The current 

audit partner is Michael Rudberg who has held the 

role since EY were appointed as external auditor.

The Audit Committee oversees the work undertaken 

by EY and in FY 2022/23 the Committee monitored 

and reviewed activities including:

The Committee’s recommendation on the 

appointment and reappointment of the external 

auditor is free from influence by a third party  

and there are no contractual obligations, which 

restrict the Committee’s ability to make such 

a recommendation.

The Committee also reviewed the proposed audit  

fee and terms of engagement for FY 2022/23. 

•  The audit plan, including scope and materiality

Details of the fees paid to the external auditor

analytics and how the auditor demonstrated 

professional scepticism

•  The limited assurance work carried out on the 

TCFD disclosures, which is a separate non-audit 

service provided by EY

•  Reports at interim and full year

Non-audit services
The Committee recognises that the independence of 

the external auditor is an essential part of the audit 

framework and the assurance that it provides. In line 

with the Revised Ethical Standard issued by the FRC 

in December 2019, the Committee has adopted a 

policy, which sets out a framework for determining

auditor for non-audit services and pre-approving 

Independence and effectiveness
One of the Committee’s primary responsibilities is to 

make a recommendation on the appointment, 

reappointment and removal of the external auditor. 

Every year, the Committee assesses the 

qualifications, expertise, resources and independence 

of the external auditor and the effectiveness of the 

previous audit process. Over the course of the year, 

the Committee reviewed the audit process and the 

quality and experience of the audit partners engaged 

in the audit to satisfy itself that it received the 

highest quality audit possible. To support this 

assessment in the third year, a survey was sent to 

the Audit Committee Chair, key members of the 

Finance team and other members of the senior 

management team as part of the year-end process. 

The Committee considered the results of the survey 

and concluded that the external audit process 

was effective.

non-audit fees.

The overall objective is to ensure that the provision of 

non-audit services does not impair the external 

auditor’s independence or objectivity. This includes, 

but is not limited to, assessing:

•  Any threats to independence and objectivity 

resulting from the provision of such services; any 

safeguards in place to eliminate or reduce these 

threats to a level where they would not 

compromise the auditor’s independence and 

objectivity; the nature of the non-audit services; 

and whether the skills and experience of the 

audit firm make it the most suitable supplier of the 

non-audit service

•  The value of non-audit services, that can be billed 

by the external auditor is restricted by a cap, which 

is set at 70% of the average audit fees for the 

preceding three years as defined by the FRC

During FY 2022/23 the non-audit services provided by 

Burberry’s external auditor did not exceed this cap.

year-end, the Audit Committee reviews all non-audit 

services provided by the auditor during the period, 

and the fees relating to these services.

During the year, the Group spent £0.1m on non-audit 

services provided by EY (3% of the average of Group 

audit fees incurred over the last two years).

The rationale for using the external auditor to 

perform these services was to reduce complexity. 

Further details can be found in note 7 to the 

Financial Statements.

FRC’s Audit Quality Review
In January 2023, we were notified by the FRC’s Audit 

Quality Review (AQR) team that an inspection of EY’s 

audit of the Company for FY 2021/22 had been 

completed. The Committee discussed the report with 

the external auditor and management and how this 

was reflected in the audit plan. The Committee noted 

the review did not raise any key findings to consider 

and was satisfied that the audit was of high quality.

Evaluation of internal controls
The Board is responsible for the Group’s internal 

controls and risk management procedures. Details 

of the Group’s risk management processes and the 

management and mitigation of each principal risk, 

together with the Group’s Viability Statement, 

can be found in our Risk and Viability Report on 

pages 118 to 151. 

•  Challenging management’s implementation of 

effective processes of risk identification, 

assessment and mitigation

The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the 

effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls. 

Ongoing review of these controls is provided through 
internal governance processes and the work of the 

Group is overseen by management, particularly the 

work of the Group Internal Audit team and the Risk 

Committee. Regular reports on these activities are 

provided to the Audit Committee as reflected in the 

standing items on the Audit Committee agenda.

The Board, through the Audit Committee, has 

conducted a robust assessment of the principal and 

emerging risks and internal control framework. It has 

considered the effectiveness of the internal controls 

in operation across the Group for the year covered by 

the Annual Report and Accounts and up to the date 

of its approval by the Board. This review covered the 

material controls, including financial, operational and 

compliance, as well as risk management processes. 

No significant control weaknesses were identified. 

The internal controls are designed to manage rather 

than eliminate the risk of not achieving business 

objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 

absolute assurance against material misstatement 

or loss.

The process followed by the Board, through the Audit 

Committee, in regularly reviewing the system of 

internal controls and risk management processes 

complies with the Guidance on Risk Management, 

Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 

Reporting issued by the FRC. It also accords with the 

provisions of the Code.

for the delegation of authorities to ensure that 

approval for matters that are considered significant 

is provided at an appropriate level. In addition, we 

have policies and procedures in place that are 

designed to support risk management across the 

Group. These include policies relating to treasury and 

the conduct of employees and third parties with 

whom we do business, including prohibiting bribery

procedures are kept under regular review.

The scope of Internal Audit work is considered for 

each operating company and Group function. This 

takes account of risk assessments, input from senior 
management and the Audit Committee and previous 

audit findings. For example, in FY 2022/23, there was 

continued emphasis on assurance over controls to 

manage cybersecurity risk (particularly ransomware), 

and the maturity of controls over IT projects and

also a continued focus on assessing the maturity

Financial reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and 

The Audit Committee was pleased with the outcome 

of the review and noted that there were no questions 

maintaining adequate internal controls over financial 

or queries that the FRC wished to raise with the 

reporting. These are designed to provide reasonable 

Company on their disclosures. The FRC’s role is to 

consider compliance with reporting standards and 

not to verify the information provided. Therefore, 

given the scope and inherent limitations of their 

review, which does not benefit from any detailed 

knowledge of the Group, it would not be appropriate 

to infer any assurance from their review that our 

FY2021/22 Annual Report and Accounts are correct 

in all material respects.

Fair, balanced and understandable
As a whole, the Annual Report and Accounts are 

required to be fair, balanced and understandable and 

to provide the information necessary for shareholders 

to assess the Group’s position, performance, 

business model and strategy. On behalf of the Board, 

the Audit Committee considered whether the fair, 

balanced and understandable statement could properly 

be given on behalf of the Directors. The processes 

followed to provide the Committee with assurance 

were considered and the Committee provided a 

recommendation to the Board that the fair, balanced 

and understandable statement could be given on 

behalf of the Directors.

Based on this recommendation, the Board is  

satisfied that it has met this obligation. A summary 

of the Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the 

Financial Statements is set out on page 252. 

The Independent Auditor’s Report on pages 253  

to 264 includes a statement concerning the auditor’s 

reporting responsibilities.

reporting and the preparation of Financial 

Statements for external reporting purposes.

We have comprehensive planning, budgeting, 

forecasting and monthly reporting processes in place. 

A summary of financial results, supported by 

commentary and performance measures, is provided 

to the Board each month.

In relation to the preparation of Group Financial 

Statements, the controls in place include:

•  A centre of expertise responsible for reviewing new 

developments in reporting requirements and 

standards to ensure that these are reflected in 

Group accounting policies, Financial Statements 

and disclosures

•  A global finance function and governance structure 

consisting of colleagues with the appropriate 

expertise to ensure that Group policies and 

procedures are correctly applied. Effective 

management and control of the Finance function is 

achieved through our finance leadership team, 

consisting of key finance colleagues from the 

regions, Burberry Business Services and our 

London headquarters

Our financial reporting process is supported by 

transactional and consolidation Finance systems. 

Reviews of financial controls are carried out by senior 

members of the Finance function. The results of 

these reviews are considered by the Audit Committee 

as part of its monitoring of the performance of 

controls governing financial reporting.

The Audit Committee reviews the application of 

financial reporting standards and any significant 

accounting judgements made by management. These 

matters are also discussed with the external auditor.

During the year, the Financial Reporting Council

Directors’ Remuneration Report

“We remain committed to 
engaging with our shareholders 
to ensure an open and 
transparent dialogue around 
executive remuneration 
arrangements at Burberry.”

Danuta Gray
Chair, Remuneration Committee 

2. Talent evolution – a key focus for the CEO and the 
Board has been ensuring that we have the right 

senior talent in place to execute the next phase of 

our strategy and drive revenue growth and 

acceleration. The Committee has been supporting 

the CEO with appropriate remuneration structures 

for this evolution.

3. Directors’ Remuneration Policy review – we are 
required to review our Directors’ Remuneration 

Policy every three years. The Committee concluded 

that the broad framework remained appropriate 

and fit for purpose for the next phase of our 

strategy and therefore only minor changes 

are proposed. 

The remainder of this letter provides further detail of 

the work of the Committee and other important 

changes to reward at Burberry during the year.

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you the Directors’ 

Remuneration Report for the year ended 1 April 

2023. This is my first report since assuming the  

role of Chair of the Remuneration Committee  

(the Committee) and I would like to thank my 

predecessor, Orna NíChionna, for her leadership  

of the Committee.

Key areas of focus for the year
This year the Committee has been focused on three 

key areas to support the business to deliver our 

strategy to realise our potential as the modern 

British luxury brand and to support our colleagues:

1. Supporting our colleagues – at Burberry, we 

employ around 9,000 colleagues globally and the 

Committee is acutely aware of the impact of rising 

prices and the cost-of-living pressures on many of 

them. During the year, the Committee spent a lot 

of time considering how we best support our 

colleagues in this period, and we are pleased with 

the interventions that management has been able 

to make.

Our commitment to sustainability
At Burberry, we are committed to creating a 

Business context
Overall, FY 2022/23 was a strong year despite 

sustainable future and sustainability is an important 

disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly 

part of our strategy. We have reinforced this through 

in Mainland China. Burberry delivered revenue of 

our remuneration design for Executive Directors for 

£3.1 billion (+5% at CER and +10% at reported rates) 

a number of years with environmental and social 

and adjusted operating profit of £634 million (+8% 

metrics in the annual corporate bonus plan for 

at CER).

Executive Directors and a sustainability underpin 

in the Burberry Share Plan (BSP). Building on this 

commitment, in FY 2023/24 we are introducing 

specific sustainability metrics linked to our ambition 

to become Climate Positive by 2040 to the annual 

corporate bonus plan for the wider workforce. 

We believe that cascading sustainability targets 

represents an invaluable opportunity to drive the 

cultural evolution necessary to achieve our 

long-term goals.

We continued to make good progress against our 

strategy to realise Burberry’s potential as the 

modern British luxury brand to drive revenue growth 

and acceleration. We also made further progress 

against our environmental and social objectives.

against (i) our strategy and our brand and (ii) 

environmental and social targets.

Reflecting the wider business context, the Group 

performed well and delivered adjusted operating 

profit of £634 million (+8% at CER). The payout for 

the profit element was 52% of maximum (i.e. 39% 

out of 75%). As previously set out, Burberry’s 

strategic focus for the next phase is on realising our 

potential as the modern British luxury brand to drive 

revenue growth and acceleration. During the year, we 

made good progress on executing our plan, while 

delivering a strong financial performance. We have 

started to bring more clarity to the brand, refocusing 

on Britishness and broadening our appeal. In addition, 

we have made further progress against our 

environmental and social objectives. We continued to 

advance our decarbonisation agenda, including 

year-on-year reductions in our scope 1, 2 and 3 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions against our 

FY 2018/19 base year. We also continued to deliver 

against our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and 

leadership goals. Based on the Committee’s 

assessment of performance and the CEO’s 

contribution to this, the total payout against the 

strategic objectives was 20% out of 25%. Further 

detail is provided on pages 227 to 229. 

The final bonus for the CEO in respect of FY 2022/23 

was 59% of maximum. The Committee considers this 

outcome to be appropriate in the context of the 

performance of the business, the CEO’s excellent 

personal contribution for the year and the 

shareholder experience which saw the share price 

increase significantly during the year, and has not 

applied discretion in respect of the outcome. 

Following her resignation as Chief Operating and 

Financial Officer (CO&FO), Julie Brown was not 

eligible for an annual bonus in respect of FY 2022/23.

delivery of our strategic priorities. 

Strategic context 
In November 2022, Jonathan Akeroyd set out the

in the market and therefore goes above and beyond 

typical market practice. The current approach also 

adds complexity for participants and shareholders.

unchanged at five years but the vesting structure is 

much simpler. 

Shareholder consultation 
We remain committed to engaging with our 

shareholders to ensure an open and transparent 

dialogue around executive remuneration arrangements 

at Burberry. During the year, I wrote to Burberry’s 

major shareholders and the key proxy bodies to 

discuss the simplification of the BSP vesting period 

and the vast majority of shareholders were 

supportive of this change. I would like to thank the 

shareholders who took the time to engage with us. 

The Committee greatly values the views of our 

shareholders and their continued support.

When we last renewed our Directors’ Remuneration 

Policy in 2020 the most material change was the 

introduction of the BSP. The Committee had 

identified that a restricted share plan model was a 

better fit with the characteristics of the luxury 

industry compared to a traditional performance share 

plan. As discussed with our key shareholders at the 

time, the Committee introduced the BSP because 

Burberry had, at that time, only recently embarked on 

a multi-year journey to become a true luxury brand. 

We considered that the BSP would better support  

a consistent approach to pricing and distribution, 

alongside the flexible investment decision-making 

that is required to build a luxury brand, especially in  

a rapidly changing external environment. It avoids 

relying on levers to enhance short-term financial 

performance and ultimately supports the delivery of 

the business strategy to build the brand over the 

longer term and deliver value for shareholders. 

Following our review of the Directors’ Remuneration 

Policy, the Committee continues to believe that the 

BSP is the right plan for Burberry and that it will 

appropriately support the delivery of the next phase 

of our strategy. However, we recognise that in the 

UK-listed market Burberry was an early adopter of a 

restricted share plan structure at Executive Director 

level and therefore we are taking the opportunity to 

refine its operation going forward taking into account 

developments in market practice.

Approach to remuneration for FY 2023/24

Salary and Board fees
Having carefully considered the broader context and 

the approach for the wider workforce, the Committee 

determined that Jonathan Akeroyd would receive a 

salary increase of 3.5% with effect from 1 July 2023. 

This is below the rate for the broader UK employee 

population as set out on page 226. The Chair’s fee 

and the base fee for the Non-Executive Directors will 

also be increased by 3.5% for FY 2023/24.

Annual bonus
The annual bonus will operate on broadly the same 

basis as FY 2022/23. Executive Directors will be 

eligible for a maximum bonus of 200% of salary. 

The annual bonus will be based 75% on adjusted 

operating profit and 25% on performance against 

strategic objectives for the CEO and the CFO linked 

to our strategy and brand as well as our environmental 

and social targets. Further details are provided 

on page 230. 

BSP awards
For FY 2023/24, the CEO will receive a BSP award of 

162.5% of salary and the CFO will receive a BSP 

award of 150% of salary.

BSP awards for FY 2023/24 will be granted with  

the simplified vesting schedule set out on pages 233 

to 234, subject to shareholder approval of the 

Directors’ Remuneration Policy. Awards will continue 

to be subject to the same performance underpins: (i) 

revenue, (ii) ROIC and (iii) brand and sustainability. 

The Committee considers that these underpins 

continue to reflect a good overall balance of 

safeguarding the financial stability of the business, 

delivery of the strategy and elevation of the brand. 

Having reviewed our internal budget and relevant 

forecasts, the Committee has increased the revenue 

underpin relative to the 2022 BSP awards. Further 

details are provided on pages 233 to 234.

211

Burberry 2022/23Corporate Governance Statement | Directors’ Remuneration Report

2023 Directors’ Remuneration Policy

Burberry’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy as set out 

in this report (the 2023 Directors’ Remuneration 

Policy) will be put to shareholders for approval at the 

2023 AGM to be held on 12 July 2023. It is the 

Committee’s intention that the 2023 Directors’ 

Remuneration Policy will apply to payments made and 

share awards granted from the date of the 2023 AGM. 

The Committee believes that Burberry’s executive 

remuneration should be simple and transparent while 

being linked to business performance and strategic 
direction, taking into account the global markets in 

which the Company operates and from which it 

recruits talent as well as our approach to 

remuneration throughout the Group. The 2023 

Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been developed 

taking into account the following principles: 

•  Simple and clear: the remuneration framework 

should be simple and transparent to ensure that it 

is clear to shareholders, participants and other 

stakeholders. Our policy is that Executive Directors 

only participate in an annual bonus and a single 

restricted share plan, the BSP, to ensure this 

simplicity. Incentive awards are capped so that  

the maximum potential award under each plan 

is transparent

•  Aligned to culture, purpose and the wider 

workforce: the remuneration framework has been 

designed to support our culture and business 

purpose. When developing the 2023 Directors’ 

Remuneration Policy the Committee reviewed in 

detail our approach to remuneration throughout 

the organisation to ensure that arrangements are 

appropriate in the context of our approach to 

reward for the wider workforce

•  Linked to the performance and strategy of the 

business: the remuneration framework should 

provide a balance between incentivising key 

short-term objectives through the annual bonus 

and long-term business objectives and shareholder 

value creation through the BSP. More detail on the 

Company’s KPIs linked to executive remuneration 

and their strategic alignment is set out on 

pages 30 to 37

•  Shareholder value and alignment: remuneration 

should provide close alignment with long-term 

value creation for shareholders through the 

selection of appropriate performance measures 

and targets for the annual bonus and performance 

underpins for the BSP. Remuneration should also 

be aligned to the future success of the Company, 

and should emphasise variable reward outcomes 

and deliver a significant proportion of remuneration 

in shares, some of which are expected to be 

retained in accordance with the shareholding 

guidelines. Our post-employment shareholding 

guideline supports this continued alignment after 

an Executive Director steps down. Annual bonus 

plan targets are normally set taking into account 

our strategic plan as well as external expectations 

of performance. Annual bonus targets are set to 

ensure that maximum remuneration can only be 

earned for delivering exceptional performance  

while not encouraging excessive risk-taking. 

The performance underpins for the BSP are in 

place to ensure that failure is not rewarded 

•  Mitigating risk: our remuneration framework should 

mitigate risk where appropriate. The 2023 

Directors’ Remuneration Policy includes provisions 

which enable the Committee to exercise discretion 

to ensure that incentive awards and outcomes are 

appropriate; it also includes provisions which allow 

for the application of clawback and/or malus in 

specific negative circumstances 

•  Competitive in the global talent market: total 

remuneration should be sufficient to attract, 

motivate and retain exceptional talent. The

subject to a sale restriction until the fifth anniversary of the date 

of grant of the award, aside from in very limited circumstances.

If the Company does not meet one or more performance 

underpins at the date of vesting then the Committee would 

consider whether it was appropriate to scale back the number  

of shares that vest under the award.

Dividend equivalents may be paid in shares or in cash in respect of 

shares that vest.

Discretion: the Committee may determine that it is appropriate 

to adjust the vesting outcome if, for example, outcomes are not 

considered to be reflective of underlying financial or non-financial 

performance of the business or the performance of the individual, 

where underpins are no longer considered appropriate or where 

the outcome is not considered appropriate in the context of

Director. This post-employment guideline will apply to shares

Directors’ Remuneration Policy in July 2020. 

The Committee retains discretion to waive this guideline if it is 

not considered appropriate in the specific circumstances.

Notes on share awards:

1.  Adjustment of share awards: the number of shares subject to an award (and the option price, where relevant) can be adjusted on a rights issue, special dividend, demerger 
or variation of capital or similar transaction. Subject to the plan rules, share awards can be satisfied by a cash payment equal to the value of shares the participant would 
otherwise have received. For Executive Directors, this provision will only be used in exceptional circumstances, such as where, for regulatory reasons, it is not possible to 
settle awards in shares.

Selection of performance measures

•  The annual bonus is normally based on a 

combination of financial, strategic and 

environmental and social metrics to support the 

delivery of key business priorities 

•  BSP awards are subject to performance underpins. 

For 2023, awards will be linked to financial 

measures, brand and sustainability. 

These underpins have been selected as they  

are considered to be good yardsticks of the overall 

financial stability and sustainability of the 

organisation and are therefore aligned with 
shareholder value creation and the long-term 

interests of the Company

Summary of decision-making 
process and changes to Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy

During the year, the Committee undertook a review 

of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and its 

implementation to ensure that the Directors’ 

Remuneration Policy supports the execution of 

strategy and the delivery of sustainable long-term 

shareholder value. The Committee discussed the 

content of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy at 

Committee meetings during the year. Throughout 
the review process, the Committee took into account 

the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, wider 

workforce remuneration and emerging best practice 

in relation to Executive Director remuneration. 

The Committee also considered input from management 

and our independent advisors as well as considering 

best practice and guidance from major shareholders. 

The Committee considers the potential for conflicts 

of interest and manages them as necessary. 

No Director was present when their own 

remuneration was discussed. 

The main change to the Directors’ Remuneration 

Policy is to simplify the vesting period for BSP 

awards. Under the existing Directors’ Remuneration 

Policy, BSP awards vest in equal tranches after 

three, four and five years following the date of award, 

with a holding period to year five. Under the 2023 

Directors’ Remuneration Policy, to simplify the 

approach and to better align with market practice, 

BSP awards vest after three years with a two-year 

post-vesting holding period. 

Other changes have been made to the wording of the 

Directors’ Remuneration Policy to increase flexibility, 

to aid operation, to increase transparency and to 

reflect typical market practice.

Approved payments

The Committee reserves the right to make any 

remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of 

office (including exercising any discretions available 

to it in connection with such payments) 

notwithstanding that they are not in line with the 

2023 Directors’ Remuneration Policy set out in the 

document where the terms of the payment were 

agreed (i) before the 2023 Directors’ Remuneration 

Policy came into effect, provided that the terms of 

the payment were consistent with any applicable 

shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
in force at the time they were agreed or were 

otherwise approved by shareholders; or (ii) at a time 

when the relevant individual was not a Director of the 

Company (or other persons to whom the Directors’ 

Remuneration Policy set out above applies) and, in 

the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not 

in consideration for the individual becoming a 

Director of the Company or such other person. For 

these purposes “payments” includes the Committee 

satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in 

relation to an award over shares, the terms of the 

payment are “agreed” no later than the time the 

award is granted. This Policy applies equally to any 

individual who is required to be treated as a Director 

under the applicable regulations.

Policy on recruitment and 
promotion arrangements

When determining the remuneration package for a 

newly appointed Executive Director, the Committee 

would seek to apply the following principles:

•  The package should be market-competitive to 

facilitate the recruitment of individuals of sufficient 

calibre to lead the business. At the same time, the 

Committee would intend to pay no more than it 

believes is necessary to secure the required talent

•  New Executive Directors will normally receive a 

base salary, benefits and pension contributions in 

line with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 

described on pages 213 to 218 and would also be 

eligible to join the bonus and share incentive plans 

up to the limits set out in the Directors’ 

Remuneration Policy

•  In addition, the Committee has discretion to 

include any other remuneration component or 

award, including a performance-based award, 

which it feels is appropriate taking into account the 

specific circumstances of the recruitment, subject 

to the limit on variable remuneration set out below. 

The key terms and rationale for any such 

component would be disclosed as appropriate in 

the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 

relevant year

•  Where an individual forfeits outstanding variable 

pay opportunities or contractual rights at a 

previous employer as a result of appointment, the 

Committee may offer compensatory payments or 

awards, in such form as the Committee considers 

appropriate, taking into account all relevant factors 

including the form of awards, expected value and 

vesting timeframe of forfeited opportunities. When 

determining any such buy-out award, the guiding 

principle would be that awards would generally be 

on a like-for-like basis unless this is considered by 

the Committee not to be practical or appropriate

•  Excluding any buy-out awards (referred to above), 

the maximum level of variable remuneration which 

may be awarded in respect of recruitment is 

362.5% of salary (which is in line with the 

maximum limit under the annual bonus and BSP 

in this Directors’ Remuneration Policy)

221

Burberry 2022/23Corporate Governance Statement | Directors’ Remuneration Report

Employees are able to communicate their views 

internally on any topic including the Directors’

communications platform (Yammer) or by raising 

questions at global and functional town halls. They 

are also able to refer to the Burberry Resolution Hub 

which provides guidance on the channels for providing 

feedback or sharing concerns at Burberry, including 

our Steps to Resolution Framework and global

an Employee Engagement Survey. Views of our 

employees generally and on their remuneration will be 

taken into account when building future plans. The 

two-way dialogue we have developed with our Global 

Workforce Advisory Forum gives the Committee 

important insight into employees’ views on the overall 

remuneration framework and how this aligns to the 

Directors’ Remuneration Policy. However, given the 

scale, geographic spread and diversity of roles of 

Burberry’s employees, the Committee does not

1.  Remuneration in the table above in relation to Jonathan Akeroyd for the year to 2 April 2022 relates to his period of employment as CEO from 15 March 2022. 

2.  The value shown in the ESP column in respect of FY 2021/22 represents the vesting of the 2019 ESP award for Julie Brown. The value has been updated to reflect the 
share price on the date of vesting (31 July 2022) of £17.960. The figure disclosed in last year’s single figure table was £392k for Julie Brown. The amount now includes 
the value of dividends on these shares using a cumulative dividend per share of 101 pence. The share price used to calculate the number of shares at grant (31 July 2019) 
was £22.8917. The share price on vesting of £17.960 was lower than this price and therefore no portion of the amount disclosed relates to share price growth.

3.  The value shown in the all-employee share plans column in respect of FY 2022/23 for Julie Brown represents the vesting of her 2019 award of free shares granted under 

the Share Incentive Plan (SIP).

4.  The value shown in the prior company buy-out awards column for Jonathan Akeroyd represents the value of certain buy-out awards granted to him on 15 March 2022. 

Further details are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report FY 2021/22. The value in respect of FY 2021/22 has been updated to reflect the share price on the date 
of vesting of part of his buy-out awards (15 June 2022) of £16.41. 

Salary (audited)
The table below details annual salaries as at 1 April 2023 and those that will apply from 1 July 2023. When setting Jonathan 

Akeroyd’s salary with effect from 1 July 2023, the Committee took into account a number of factors, including the approach  

for our wider employee population, individual performance and overall contribution to the business during the year, cost to the 

Company, the external economic climate and market positioning. The salary increase of 3.5% for Jonathan Akeroyd is below the 

rate for the broader UK employee population. The budgeted salary increase for our UK workforce for 2023, including increases to 

reflect the UK real Living Wage, was 6.7%.

Julie Brown’s annual salary was £747,300 until her departure from Burberry on 1 April 2023.

Kate Ferry will join as CFO on 17 July 2023 and will receive an annual salary of £675,000.

Burberry 2022/23Corporate Governance Statement | Directors’ Remuneration Report

Strategic performance
Taking into account the progress achieved during the year against key strategic, brand and environmental and social measures as 

well as the CEO’s personal contribution to the delivery of this performance, the Committee determined that this element would 

pay out at 20% (out of 25%). Performance highlights delivered include:

•  Strategy and brand – in November 2022, the CEO set out the ambition and strategy for Burberry’s next phase, to realise our 

potential as the modern British luxury brand, building on our strong foundations, reinterpreting our heritage and unique 

attributes with a modern vision and aesthetic and leveraging them to drive revenue growth and acceleration. This was well 

received by both the market and colleagues. During the year, we made good progress on executing our plan, while delivering a 

strong financial performance, and have started to bring more clarity to the brand, refocusing on Britishness and broadening our 

appeal. During FY 2022/23, we developed and elevated our product offer, exciting our customers with new and desirable 

products supported by a strong programme of brand activations. In outerwear, comparable store sales grew 7% in the period. 

We put the iconic Burberry Trench Coat front and centre of our brand campaign which helped deliver a very strong acceleration 

in heritage rainwear sales in the last quarter. In leather goods, comparable store sales grew 12% in the year. Ready-to-wear 

excluding outerwear grew broadly in line with the Group average for the year with womenswear increasing a double-digit 

percentage and men’s up a mid single-digit percentage. 

•  Sustainability – we continued to advance our decarbonisation agenda, including year-on-year reductions in our scope 1, 2 and 3 

GHG emissions against our FY 2018/19 base year. Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduced by 93% from our FY 2016/17 baseline and 
scope 3 emissions reduced by 40%^ from our FY 2018/19 baseline. We also made good progress during the year on achieving 
our targets for sourcing sustainable materials, including 31%^ of our cotton being certified organic; 44% of our nylon and 
polyester being recycled; 100% of our viscose being Canopy ‘Green Shirt’ rated; 46% of our wool in soft accessories and knits 

being certified; and 96% of our leather coming from tanneries with environmental, traceability and social compliance 

certification. For further details see pages 50 to 67. 

•  People – during the year we made meaningful progress against our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and leadership objectives. 

In FY 2022/23, shortlists across all recruitment campaigns consisted of 60% female, 38% male and 2% ‘other’ candidates. 

In FY 2022/23, hiring representation consisted in the UK of 39.5% ethnic minority candidates and in the US of 16% Black/

African-American candidates. The CEO has also made excellent progress on repositioning our talent capabilities to ensure we 

have the leadership team in place to successfully execute the strategy.

Burberry 2022/23Corporate Governance Statement | Directors’ Remuneration Report

Annual bonus outcome for FY 2022/23
Based on the performance against targets, Jonathan Akeroyd will receive an annual bonus for FY 2022/23 of £1,298,000. 

This represents a bonus payment of 59% of his maximum bonus. The Committee considers that this level of bonus payout 

is appropriate given the progress delivered this year, the CEO’s personal contribution to the business and his excellent start 

at Burberry, the actions that the Company has taken to support our colleagues and the shareholder experience which has seen 

the share price rise significantly during the course of the year. 

Under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Executive Directors are required to invest 50% of any net bonus earned into 

Burberry shares until their shareholding guideline of 300% of salary is met. Jonathan Akeroyd had already met his shareholding 

guideline and therefore this requirement does not apply to his bonus for FY 2022/23.

Julie Brown forfeited her entitlement to an annual bonus for FY 2022/23 on her departure from Burberry.

Annual bonus for FY 2023/24
For FY 2023/24 the Executive Directors will be

The annual bonus for FY 2023/24 will be based 75%

FY 2022/23 CER) and 25% on strategic objectives. 

The adjusted operating profit targets are considered 

to be commercially sensitive and will be disclosed in 

the Directors’ Remuneration Report FY 2023/24. 

The strategic objectives for FY 2023/24 for the CEO 

and the CFO will continue to be based on a combination 

of strategic, operational and environmental and social 

measures, with strategic and operational KPIs related 

to strategy execution, growth in key product areas, 

store productivity and growth in digital sales. The 

environmental and social measures will be assessed 

based on progress embedding sustainability across 

the business, driving execution of climate positive 

ambitions through decarbonisation interventions and 

the delivery of key people goals based on talent 

retention and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

For each strategic area, the Committee will determine 

the payout in the round taking into account our 

progress in the year against our long-term objectives 

in these areas. Details of the progress achieved and 

the Committee’s determination of bonus outcomes 

will be provided in the Directors’ Remuneration 

Report FY 2023/24.

Jonathan Akeroyd’s 2022 BSP award will vest one third after three years, one third after four years and one third after five years 

from the grant date, subject to the performance underpins outlined below. Each tranche is subject to a holding period so that the 

total time horizon before any sale of shares (except to cover any tax liabilities arising from the award) is five years for the entire 
award. Awards are granted in the form of conditional share awards.

The face value of each award is calculated using the three-day average price prior to the date of grant (£17.1658), which was the 

price used to determine the number of shares awarded.

BSP awards granted in 2022 are subject to the following underpins:

relevant metrics. These metrics are all considered to be aligned with our strategy of 

elevating the brand to generate long-term value for shareholders

•  Sustainability: when assessing the sustainability underpin the Committee will consider 

whether reasonable progress has been delivered against our sustainability and carbon

Burberry 2022/23 
Corporate Governance Statement | Directors’ Remuneration Report

If the Company does not meet one or more of the performance underpins outlined above for the year of vesting 

then the Committee would consider whether it was appropriate to scale back the level of payout under the BSP 

award. The intention of the performance underpins is to provide a “safeguard” to ensure that the BSP awards 

do not pay out if the Company has under-performed and vesting is not justified; the Committee will take this 

intention into account when assessing the underpins.

In addition to the underpins described above, the Committee also retains the discretion to adjust the vesting 

outcome if it is not considered to be reflective of underlying financial or non-financial performance of the 

business or the performance of the individual, where underpins are no longer considered appropriate or where 

the vesting outcome is not considered appropriate in the context of the experience of shareholders or 

other stakeholders.

Share interests and shareholding guideline (audited)
Executive Directors are subject to a shareholding guideline of 300% of base salary. There is no specific timeline in which 

shareholding guidelines must be achieved. However, there is an expectation that Executive Directors make annual progress 

towards their guideline, regardless of any annual bonus paid or shares vesting. In line with the Investment Association best 

practice guidance, our shareholding guideline permits any incentive shares that have vested but are unexercised or that have not 

yet vested but are not subject to any further performance conditions/underpins to count towards the shareholding requirement 

at 50% of their face value. Other members of the Executive Committee are also subject to a shareholding guideline.

The following table sets out the total beneficial interests of the Executive Directors (and their connected persons) in ordinary 

shares of Burberry Group plc as at 1 April 2023, as well as their progress against the shareholding guidelines. The table also 

summarises conditional interests in share or option awards, with further detail of the underlying awards in the subsequent table.

Based on the three-month average share price to 1 April 2023 (our standard approach to assessing the guideline), both Jonathan 

Akeroyd and Julie Brown had met the guideline.

3.  On 1 August 2022, Julie Brown exercised a nil-cost option over 2,788 shares granted to her on 31 July 2018 under the ESP and retained these shares (post tax liabilities). 
On the same day she also exercised a nil-cost option over 10,458 shares granted to her on 31 July 2019 under the ESP and retained these shares (post tax liabilities). 
The market value of Burberry shares on the date of exercise was £17.85. On 2 August 2022, Julie Brown transferred 30 shares from her 2017 SIP award to her nominee 
account with no change to her beneficial ownership other than the sale of two shares to fund the fee arising from the transfer. On 30 November 2022, Julie Brown sold 
16,000 shares.

4.  In line with the shareholding guideline, only 50% of the face value of these shares counts towards the Executive Director’s shareholding guideline calculation (other than 

shares under the all-employee SIP, which are held beneficially and count towards the Executive Director’s shareholding guideline calculation). This also includes ShareSave

1.  The comparator group includes all UK employees. As noted above, Burberry Group plc does not have any employees and therefore this group has been chosen to align  
with the location of the Executive Directors and with the pay ratio reporting. For the comparator group of employees, the year-on-year salary changes include the  
annual salary review in July but exclude any additional changes made in the year, for example on promotion. For FY 2021/22 benefits, the maximum employer pension 
contribution available to the majority of the UK workforce was increased from 6% of salary to 10% of salary with effect from 1 January 2022. The change in the value of 
benefits shown for the Executive Directors reflects the market cost of the same benefits.

2.  In order to provide a meaningful comparison, the figures in the table above have been calculated on a full-year equivalent basis where Directors have served for part of the 

year only.

3.  Where a Director was appointed during a financial year, it is not possible to calculate a percentage change for them and they are shown as N/A.

4.  The Executive Directors did not receive an annual bonus for FY 2019/20 and therefore it is not possible to calculate a percentage change on bonus in respect of 

FY 2020/21. Jonathan Akeroyd did not receive an annual bonus for FY 2021/22 and therefore it is not possible to calculate a percentage change on bonus in respect 
of FY 2022/23.

5.  The Directors in role at the time voluntarily agreed to waive 20% of their salary/base fee for a three-month period between April and June 2020. This is reflected in the 

negative changes shown in respect of FY 2020/21 and the corresponding positive changes shown in respect of FY 2021/22.

6.  The allowances and benefits figures for FY 2020/21 for Gerry Murphy and Orna NíChionna were low due to the impact of COVID-19. In order to provide a meaningful 

comparison, the percentage change figure for FY 2021/22 was calculated relative to the allowances and benefits figure for FY 2019/20.

7.  Allowances and benefits increased for Non-Executive Directors during FY 2022/23 due to the return of regular in-person meetings.

8.  Orna NíChionna was appointed as Senior Independent Director with effect from 2 April 2022.

9.  Danuta Gray replaced Orna NíChionna as Remuneration Committee Chair on 1 September 2022.

CEO pay ratios
The ratios set out in the table below compare the total remuneration of the CEO (as included in the single figure table on 

page 226) to the remuneration of the median UK employee as well as the UK employees at the lower and upper quartiles. 

The disclosure will build up over time to cover a rolling 10-year period.

Notes regarding calculation
The ratios are calculated using option A in the disclosure regulations. The employees at the lower quartile, median and upper 

quartile (P25, P50 and P75, respectively) were determined based on total remuneration using a valuation methodology consistent 

with that used for the CEO in the single figure table on page 226. The employees were identified based on all UK employees as at 

year end. This option was selected on the basis that it provided the most accurate means of identifying the median, lower and 

upper quartile employees.

The total remuneration in respect of FY 2022/23 for the employees identified at P25, P50 and P75 is £28k, £37k and £59k, 

respectively. The base salary in respect of FY 2022/23 for the employees identified at P25, P50 and P75 is £23k, £30k and 

£51k, respectively.

The Committee considers pay ratios as one of many reference points when considering remuneration. Throughout the Group, pay 

is positioned to be fair and market-competitive in the context of the talent market for the relevant role, fairly reflecting local 

market data and other relevant benchmarks (such as the UK Living Wage). The Committee notes the limited comparability of pay 

ratios across companies and sectors, given the diverse range of business models and employee population profiles which exist 

across the market.

A significant proportion of the CEO’s total remuneration is delivered in variable remuneration, and particularly via long-term share 

incentives, historically under the ESP and since 2020 under the BSP. In order to drive alignment with investors, the value 

ultimately received from ESP and BSP awards is linked to long-term share price movement. As a result, the pay ratio is likely to 

be driven largely by the CEO’s incentive outcomes and may therefore fluctuate significantly on a year-to-year basis.

The pay ratio for FY 2022/23 has decreased compared to the ratio for FY 2021/22. This is primarily driven by the fact that 

Jonathan Akeroyd’s single figure for FY 2021/22 included the majority of his buy-out awards which had a higher value than the 

bonus and buy-out award values for FY 2022/23. 

The Committee considers that the median pay ratio for FY 2022/23 and the recent trends in the pay ratios are consistent with 

Burberry’s remuneration framework and reflect the variable nature of the CEO’s total remuneration. The Committee believes the 

pay ratio is consistent with our pay policies in the UK.

Ten-year performance graph and Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration
The following graph shows the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for Burberry Group plc compared to the FTSE 100 Index 

assuming £100 was invested on 31 March 2013. The FTSE 100 Index has been selected as the comparator because Burberry is a 

constituent of the index. Data is presented on a spot basis and sourced from Datastream. The table below shows the total 

remuneration earned by the incumbent CEO over the same 10-year period, along with the percentage of maximum opportunity 

earned in relation to each type of incentive. The total amounts are based on the same methodology as used for the single figure of

Burberry 2022/23Corporate Governance Statement | Directors’ Remuneration Report

Regular attendees at Committee meetings include: the Chair of the Board; the CEO; the Company Secretary; the Chief People 

Officer; the VP Head of Reward; and representatives of the Committee’s advisors. Other members of the senior management 

team may attend Committee meetings from time to time. No one is present when their own remuneration is being discussed. 

Advisors to the Committee
Deloitte was appointed as an independent advisor to the Committee in 2017 and reappointed in 2021 following a competitive 

tender process. Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group (RCG), which is responsible for the 

development and maintenance of the voluntary Code of Conduct that clearly sets out the role of executive remuneration 

consultants and the professional standards by which they advise their clients. Fees are charged on a time and expenses basis and 

totalled £125,400 (plus VAT) during FY 2022/23. During the year Deloitte also provided other consulting services (including 

mergers and acquisitions and due diligence advice, technology implementation and analytics), tax compliance and advisory and 

transfer pricing services. The Committee is satisfied that advice received from Deloitte during the year was objective and 

independent and that all individuals who provided remuneration advice to the Committee had no connections with Burberry or its 

Directors that may impair their independence. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that 

there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.

Linklaters LLP also provided advice to the Committee in relation to the operation of the Company’s share plans, employment law 

considerations and compliance with legislation.

Remuneration voting results
The table below shows the results of the latest remuneration-related shareholder votes on the Directors’ Remuneration Report 

(at the 2022 AGM) and the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (at the 2020 AGM).

We have continued to engage with and listen to our shareholders during FY 2022/23 as we have developed our remuneration 

proposals. The Committee and I would like to thank all of you who have invested time with us, as it has helped to inform our 

thoughts on executive remuneration at Burberry. Going forward, as part of our commitment to build on the constructive dialogue 

we have established, we look forward to continuing to engage with you.

Financial Statements | Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 

in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 

prepared the Group consolidated financial statements in accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and 

the Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 

Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ and applicable law). Under company law the Directors 

must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 

Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing these financial statements the Directors 

are required to: 

•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 

•  state whether applicable UK-adopted International Accounting Standards have been followed for the Group financial statements 

and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the Company financial statements, subject 

to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and parent Company financial statements respectively;  

•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  

•  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 

information; and 

•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company 

will continue in business. 

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 

Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company 

and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies 

Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 

steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 

governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 

The Directors consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 

information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and the Company’s position and performance, business model 

and strategy. 

Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 157 to 162 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 

•  the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 

Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and 

applicable law), give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company; 

•  the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting 

Standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and 

•  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group 

and the Company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Opinion 
In our opinion: 

•  Burberry Group plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 1 April 2023 and of the Group’s profit for the 52-week 

period then ended; 

•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards;  

•  the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 

Accounting Practice; and 

•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 

We have audited the financial statements of Burberry Group plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the 52-week 

period ended 1 April 2023 which comprise:

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 

UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of 

the Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced 

Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 

Basis for opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 

responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 

statements section of our report.  

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

Independence 
We are independent of the Group and Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 

financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have 

fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.  

The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company and we remain 

independent of the Group and the Company in conducting the audit.

Financial Statements | Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Burberry Group plc 

Conclusions relating to going concern 
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 

preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group and Company’s 

ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included: 

•  We assessed the risk around going concern at the planning and year end phases of the audit 

•  In conjunction with our walkthrough of the Group’s financial statement close process, we confirmed our understanding of 
management’s going concern assessment process and engaged with management early to understand and assess the key 

assumptions made in their assessment. 

•  We checked the logic and arithmetical integrity of management’s going concern model that includes the cash forecasts for the 

going concern assessment period covering the period up to 28 September 2024.  

•  We considered the appropriateness of the assumptions used to calculate the cash forecasts under base and plausible downside 

case scenario and that the downside scenario utilised was sufficiently severe for the going concern assessment.  

•  We reviewed the Group’s debt agreements to check the covenant requirements and tested to check that no covenants have 
been breached and there is no forecasted covenant breach in either the base or plausible downside case scenarios during the 

going concern assessment period.  

•  We agreed the 1 April 2023 cash and cash equivalent balances included in the going concern assessment to the Group’s year end 

cash and cash equivalent balances.  

•  We assessed the reasonableness of the cashflow forecasts included in the going concern assessment by analysing 

management’s historical forecasting accuracy and understanding the potential impact of principal risks such as macroeconomic 

and political instability, global consumer demand and the impact of climate change have been reflected in the forecasts.  

•  We evaluated the key assumptions by searching for contrary evidence to challenge these assumptions, including third party 

sector forecasts and analyst expectations. Further, we tested these assumptions for consistency with the budget approved by 

the Board.  

•  We also challenged the measurement and completeness of the downside scenario modelled by management, whether the risks 

considered are sufficiently severe, and how these compare with the principal risks and uncertainties of the Group. 

•  We considered the mitigating factors included in the severe but plausible downside scenario that are within control of the Group. 
This includes review of the Group’s non-operating cash outflows and evaluating the Group’s ability to control these outflows  

as mitigating actions if required. 

•  We considered whether the Group’s forecasts in the going concern assessment were consistent with other forecasts used by 

the Group in its accounting estimates, including goodwill impairment, retail store impairment and deferred tax asset recognition. 

•  We performed reverse stress testing to identify the magnitude of decline in revenue that would lead to the Group utilising all 

liquidity during the going concern assessment period and we have considered the likelihood of such a decline.  

•  We reviewed the Group’s going concern disclosures included in the Annual Report to assess that they were accurate, sufficiently 

detailed and in conformity with the reporting standards.  

We observe that in management’s base case and severe but plausible downside scenario, there is significant headroom without 

taking the benefit of any identified mitigations. 

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 

individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a 

period up to 28 September 2024. 

In relation to the Group and Company’s reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing 

material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the 

Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting. 

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of 

this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 

Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Overview of our audit approach 

Audit scope 

•  We performed an audit of the complete financial information of seven components and audit procedures on 

specific balances for a further one component. 

•  The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 91% of profit before 

tax (on an absolute basis), 78% of revenue and 80% of total assets.

Key audit matters 

•  Valuation of finished goods inventory provision. 
•  Impairment and impairment reversals of retail store right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment.
•  Provision for uncertain tax positions.

Materiality 

•  Overall Group materiality of £30m which represents 4.7% of profit before tax. 

An overview of the scope of the Company and Group audits 

Tailoring the scope 
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 

for each company within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 

We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the 

business environment and other factors such as recent Internal Audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at 

each component. 

In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 

coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, we selected eight components covering entities within the United 

Kingdom, Mainland China, Japan, Korea, the United States and Hong Kong S.A.R., China, which represent the principal business 

units within the Group. 

Of the eight components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of seven components (“full scope 

components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics or to ensure that, at an overall Group level, we 

reduced and appropriately covered the residual risk of error. For one component (“the specific scope component”), we performed 

audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the 

significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.  

The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 91% of the Group’s profit before tax (on an 

absolute basis) (2022: 94% of adjusted profit before tax on an absolute basis), 78% (2022: 83%) of the Group’s revenue and 80% 

(2022: 82%) of the Group’s total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 91% of the Group’s profit 

before tax (on an absolute basis) (2022: 94% of adjusted profit before tax on an absolute basis), 74% (2022: 79%) of the Group’s 

revenue and 77% (2022: 78%) of the Group’s total assets. The specific scope component contributed 4% (2022: 4%) of the 

Group’s revenue and 3% (2022: 4%) of the Group’s total assets. The audit scope of this component may not have included testing 

of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group.  

Of the remaining components that together represent 9% of the Group’s profit before tax (on an absolute basis) (2022: 6% of 

adjusted profit before tax on an absolute basis), none are individually greater than 5% (2022: 5%) of the Group’s profit before tax 

(on an absolute basis). For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review, testing of consolidation 

journals and intercompany eliminations and foreign currency translation recalculations to respond to any potential risks of material 

misstatement to the Group financial statements.

Changes from the prior year  
We have not changed the full scope or specific scope components from the prior year as these components remain the most 

significant to the Group, by size and risk, and the coverage remains consistent with the prior year.  

Involvement with component teams  
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of 

the components by us, as the Group audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms 

operating under our instruction. Of the seven full scope components, audit procedures were performed on four of these directly by 

the Group audit team. For the three full scope components not audited by the Group audit team and for the specific scope 

component (where the work was performed by component auditors), we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable 

us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole. 

The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned virtual visits to the component teams in Mainland China, Korea, 

Japan and Hong Kong S.A.R., China. These visits have been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor virtually visited 

all those full and specific scope audit locations not audited by the Group audit team at least once during the year. These visits 

involved video calls with local management, including members of finance, marketing and property teams depending on the 

component and with the local EY component teams. During the visits we held discussions on the audit approach and understood 

any issues arising from their work and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. We reviewed the 

component team’s working papers remotely to validate that the required procedures had been performed to the appropriate 

quality. We also virtually attended year end closing meetings at all components and interacted regularly with the component teams 

throughout the year. 

As the Group audit team, we performed the audit for the components in the United Kingdom and the United States. We also met 

in person where possible, or virtually, with local management for these components. This, together with the additional procedures 

performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.

Climate change  
Stakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact the Group. The Group has determined that the most 

significant future impacts from climate change on their operations are expected to be from climate transition risks, specifically 

market risks associated with changing consumer preferences in a lower carbon economy. These are explained on pages 94 to 111 in 

the required Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures and on pages 128 to 130 in the principal risks and uncertainties. 

They have also explained their climate commitments on pages 30 to 33. All of these disclosures form part of the “Other information,” 

rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of 

considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course  

of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on “Other information”.  

In planning and performing our audit, we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the Group’s business and any 

consequential material impact on its financial statements.  

The Group has explained in their Basis of Preparation note how they have reflected the impact of climate change in their financial 

statements including how this aligns with their commitments in their sustainability strategy. There are no significant judgements 

and estimates relating to climate change.  

Our audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating management’s 

assessment of the impact of climate risk and their climate commitments, specifically on the finished goods inventory provision, 

impairment of retail store right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment and going concern. We have assessed whether 

these risks have been appropriately reflected in asset values where values are determined through modelling future cash flows, 

this primarily being impairment assessments following the requirements of UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. 

As part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, supported by our climate change internal specialists and  

senior members of the audit team. This included meetings with the Group’s Sustainability and Group Financial Reporting teams, 

a specific climate change risk workshop and a review of peer disclosures and sector guidance on climate change to determine the 

risks of material misstatement in the financial statements from climate change which needed to be considered in our audit.  

We also challenged the Directors’ considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and viability and 

associated disclosures. Where considerations of climate change were relevant to our assessment of going concern, these are 

described above.  

Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to 

impact a key audit matter.

Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 

statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not  

due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the 

allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the 

context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion  

on these matters.

Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on 

the audit and in forming our audit opinion.  

Materiality 
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 

economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of 

our audit procedures.  

We determined materiality for the Group to be £30 million (2022: £24 million), which is 4.7% of profit before tax (2022: 4.9% of 

adjusted profit before tax). We have changed to profit before tax as the basis of materiality in line with the default basis used 

before COVID-19. As the previous basis of materiality (adjusted profit before tax) was considered an exception for COVID-19, 

we have made the decision to change to profit before tax given the significantly reduced value of adjusting items. Profit before  

tax provides us with the most relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the Group, hence it has been selected as 

the benchmark. 

We determined materiality for the Company to be £21.5 million (2022: £21.5 million), which is 1% (2022: 1%) of total assets. 

For any Company balances that are consolidated into the Group financial statements, an allocation of Group performance 

materiality was used. 

Basis 

Materiality 

•  Profit before tax – £634m 

•  Materiality of £30m (4.7% of Profit before tax) 

During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality based on forecasts provided by management. Our final 

assessment reflected the actual reported performance for the period. 

Performance materiality 
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 

the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality. 

On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement 

was that performance materiality for the Group should be 75% (2022: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £22.5m (2022: 

£18m). We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment 

and the likelihood of undetected misstatements. 

Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 

undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based 

on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that 

component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £4m to £20m (2022: £3.3m 

to £14.8m). 

Reporting threshold 
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial. 

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £1.5m (2022: 

£1.2m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 

reporting on qualitative grounds. 

We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of 

other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Other information  
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report as set out on pages 2 to 251, including the 

Strategic Report and Corporate Governance Statement, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 

The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report.  

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated 

in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 

inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be 

materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 

determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we 

have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact. 

We have nothing to report in this regard. 

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 

Companies Act 2006. 

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 

•  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 

are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and  

•  the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 

Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the 

audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report. 

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 

to you if, in our opinion: 

•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 

branches not visited by us; or 

•  the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 

the accounting records and returns; or 

•  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 

•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit 

Corporate Governance Statement 
We have reviewed the Directors’ Statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate 

Governance Statement relating to the Group and Company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 

Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules. 

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 

Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit: 

•  Directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 

uncertainties identified set out on page 248;

Responsibilities of Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 252, the Directors are responsible for the 

preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as 

the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 

whether due to fraud or error.  

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going 

concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors 

either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 

level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 

misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 

they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 

responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to 

fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for 

example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of 

detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. 

However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of 

the Company and management. Our approach was as follows: 

•  We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the 
most significant frameworks which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those that relate 

to the reporting framework (UK adopted International Accounting Standards, UK GAAP, the Companies Act 2006 and the UK 

Corporate Governance Code) and the relevant tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. In 

addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination of 

the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements being the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, and those laws and 

regulations relating to health and safety, employees, environmental and bribery and corruption practices. 

•  We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, including internal audit, 
those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our 

review of Board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee and observation in Audit Committee meetings, as well as 

consideration of the results of our audit procedures across the Group. 

•  We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur 
and met with finance and operational management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there 

was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their potential to influence management to manage 

earnings or influence the perceptions of analysts. We have determined there is a risk of fraud associated to inventory provisions 

and a risk of management override in manual revenue journals that do not follow the expected process. We considered the 

policies, processes and controls that the Group has established to address the risks identified, including the design of controls 

over inventory provisions and each significant revenue stream. We also considered the controls that the Group has that 

otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud, and how senior management monitors these controls. We performed audit 

procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the 

financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, due to fraud or error. 

•  Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations 
including providing specific instructions to full scope and specific scope component teams and where necessary, using our 

forensic and other relevant specialists. Our procedures included journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journal entries, 

consolidation journals and journal entries indicating large or unusual transactions using data analytics. We based this testing on 

our understanding of the business, enquiries of management, including internal audit, legal and other advisors, the company 

secretary and reading relevant reports. We performed specific searches derived from forensic investigations experience and 

leveraged our data analytics platform in performing our testing. We have also reviewed the whistleblowing reports issued during 

the year. Any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations identified that might have an impact on components were 

communicated to the component audit teams and considered in our audit approach, if applicable.

Financial Statements | Notes to the Financial Statements  

1. Basis of preparation 
Burberry Group plc and its subsidiaries (the Group) is a global luxury goods manufacturer, retailer and wholesaler. The Group also 

licenses third parties to manufacture and distribute products using the ‘Burberry’ trademarks. All of the companies which 

comprise the Group are controlled by Burberry Group plc (the Company) directly or indirectly. 

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 

Act 2006 and UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (IFRS). These consolidated financial statements have been 

prepared under the historical cost convention, except as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial 

liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.  

The consolidated financial statements are presented in £m. Financial ratios are calculated using unrounded numbers. The Group Income 

Statement for the current and prior period has been updated to provide separate disclosure on amounts of other operating income 

and operating expenses that make up total net operating expenses. The Group Statement of Cash Flows for the current and prior 

period has also been updated to start the reconciliation of net operating cash flows from profit before tax rather than operating profit.  

Consideration of climate-related matters 
The Group has performed a climate-related scenario analysis as required by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 

Disclosures. This scenario analysis takes into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario. 

Based on this scenario analysis, consideration has been given to the impact of climate-related risks on management’s judgements 

and estimates, including inventory provisions and the impairment of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets.  

The incurred costs and investments associated with our sustainability strategy are reflected in the Group’s financial statements, 

including within inventories, property, plant and equipment, and operating profit.  

The impact of climate-related risks on the consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023 is not material. 

The committed future financial investments associated with our sustainability strategy are included within our budget and  

three-year forward-looking financial plans. These financial plans have been used to support our impairment reviews and going 

concern and viability assessment. Future plans may incur additional investment on research and development and higher 

expenditure on raw materials and other as yet unidentified costs. 

Going concern 
In considering the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements, the Directors have 

assessed the potential cash generation of the Group and considered a range of downside scenarios. This assessment for any 

indicators that the going concern basis of preparation is not appropriate covers the period from the date of signing the financial 

statements up to 28 September 2024. 

The scenarios considered by the Directors include a severe but plausible downside scenario reflecting the Group’s base plan 

adjusted for severe but plausible impacts from the Group’s principal risks. These scenarios were informed by a comprehensive 

review of the macroeconomic scenarios using third-party projections of macroeconomic data for the luxury fashion industry:  

•  The Group central planning scenario reflects a balanced projection with a continued focus on growing markets and maintaining 

momentum built as part of the strategy 

•  As a sensitivity, this central planning scenario has been flexed to reflect a 16% downgrade to revenues in FY 2023/24 and 16% 
over the period to 28 September 2024, as well as the associated consequences for EBITDA and cash. Management consider 

this represents a severe but plausible downside scenario appropriate for assessing going concern 

The severe but plausible downside scenario modelled the following risks occurring simultaneously:  

•  A more severe and prolonged reduction in the GDP growth assumptions in the Eurozone and Americas compared to the central 

planning scenario 

•  A significant reduction to our global consumer demand arising from a change in consumer preference 

•  A significant reputational incident such as negative sentiment propagated through social media  

•  The impact of a business interruption event over three months and consequent two-week interruption in one of our geographies 

arising from the supply chain impact  

•  The impact of a one-month interruption to one of our channels following a technology vulnerability  

•  The occurrence of a one-time physical risk relating to climate change in FY 2023/24 and the materialisation of a severe but 
plausible ongoing market risk relating to climate change in line with a scenario reflecting a 2°C global temperature increase 

compared to pre-industrial levels 

•  The payment of a settlement arising from a regulatory or compliance-related matter 

•  A short-term impact of a 10% weakening in a key non-sterling currency for the Group before it is recovered through price adjustment

Financial Statements | Notes to the Financial Statements  

1. Basis of preparation continued 

Going concern continued 
Further mitigating actions within management control would be taken under each scenario, including working capital reduction 

measures and limiting capital expenditure, but these were not incorporated into the downside modelling. 

The Directors have also considered the Group’s current liquidity and available facilities. As at 1 April 2023, the Group Balance 

Sheet reflects cash net of overdrafts of £961 million. In addition, the Group has access to a £300 million revolving credit facility, 

which is currently undrawn and not relied upon for the purpose of this going concern assessment. The Group is in compliance with 

the covenants for the revolving credit facility and the borrowings raised via the sustainability bond are not subject to covenants. 

Details of cash, overdrafts, borrowings and facilities are set out in notes 19, 23 and 24 respectively of these financial statements. 

In all the scenarios assessed, taking into account current liquidity and available resources and before the inclusion of any 

mitigating actions within management control, the Group was able to maintain sufficient liquidity to continue trading. On the basis 

of the assessment performed, the Directors consider it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 

the consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 1 April 2023.  

New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted in the period 
There have been no new standards or interpretations issued and made effective for the financial period commencing 3 April 2022 

that have had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.  

Standards not yet adopted  
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the 52 weeks to 1 April 

2023 and have not been early adopted by the Group. These standards are not expected to have a material impact on the entity in 

the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions. 

Basis of consolidation 
The Group’s annual financial statements comprise those of Burberry Group plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries, presented as a 

single economic entity. The results of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent 

accounting policies across the Group.  

The financial year is the 52 weeks ended 1 April 2023 (last year: 53 weeks ended 2 April 2022). 

Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity 

when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 

those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred 

to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Where there is a loss of 

control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include the results for the portion of the reporting period during 

which the Group had control. Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised profits on transactions between Group companies 

are eliminated in preparing the Group financial statements. The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as 

transactions with equity owners of the Group. For acquisitions of additional interests in subsidiaries from non-controlling 

interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the 

subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals of interests in subsidiaries to non-controlling interests are also 

recorded in equity. 

Key sources of estimation uncertainty  
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires that management make certain estimates 

and assumptions that affect the measurement of reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of 

contingent liabilities.  

If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best estimates at the date of the financial 

statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be updated as appropriate in the 

period in which the circumstances change. 

Estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 

events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key areas where the estimates and assumptions applied 

have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 

are discussed below. Further details of the Group’s accounting policies in relation to these areas are provided in note 2.

1. Basis of preparation continued 

Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued 

Impairment, or reversals of impairment, of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets  
Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate 

that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset 

or a cash generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared using management’s best estimates and 

assumptions at the time. Refer to notes 13 and 14 for further details of retail property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets 

and impairment reviews carried out in the period and for sensitivities relating to this key source of estimation uncertainty. 

Inventory provisioning 
The Group manufactures and sells luxury goods and is subject to changing consumer demands and fashion trends. The recoverability 

of the cost of inventories is assessed every reporting period, by considering the expected net realisable value of inventory compared to 

its carrying value. Where the net realisable value is lower than the carrying value, a provision is recorded. When calculating inventory 

provisions, management considers the nature and condition of the inventory, as well as applying assumptions in respect of anticipated 

saleability of finished goods and future usage of raw materials. Refer to note 17 for further details of the carrying value of inventory 

and inventory provisions and for sensitivities relating to this key source of estimation uncertainty. 

Uncertain tax positions 
In common with many multinational companies, the Group faces tax audits in jurisdictions around the world in relation to  

transfer pricing of goods and services between associated entities within the Group. These tax audits are often subject to  

inter-government negotiations. The matters under discussion are often complex and can take many years to resolve.  

Tax liabilities are recorded based on management’s estimate of either the most likely amount or the expected value amount 

depending on which method is expected to better reflect the resolution of the uncertainty. Given the inherent uncertainty in 

assessing tax outcomes, the Group could, in future periods, experience adjustments to these tax liabilities that have a material 

positive or negative effect on the Group’s results for a particular period. 

Refer to note 9 for further details of management estimates surrounding the outcome of all matters under dispute or negotiation 

between governments in relation to current tax liabilities recognised at 1 April 2023, and for sensitivities relating to this key source 

of estimation uncertainty. 

Key judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
Judgements are those decisions made when applying accounting policies which have a significant impact on the amounts recognised 

in the Group financial statements. Further details of the Group’s accounting policies are provided in note 2. Key judgements that 

have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the Group financial statements for the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023 and the 

53 weeks to 2 April 2022 are as follows:  

Where the Group is a lessee, judgement is required in determining the lease term at initial recognition, and throughout the lease 

term, where extension or termination options exist. In such instances, all facts and circumstances that may create an economic 

incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option, have been considered to determine the lease term. 

Considerations include, but are not limited to, the period assessed by management when approving initial investment, together 

with costs associated with any termination options or extension options. Extension periods (or periods after termination options) 

are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). Where the lease term has 

been extended by assuming an extension option will be recognised, this will result in the initial right-of-use assets and lease 

liabilities at inception of the lease being greater than if the option was not assumed to be exercised. Likewise, assuming a break 

option will be exercised will reduce the initial right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.  

Refer to note 21 for further details surrounding the judgements regarding the impact of breaks and options on lease liabilities.

2. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies of the Group are: 

a) Revenue 
The Group obtains revenue from contracts relating to sales of luxury goods to retail and wholesale customers. Retail purchases 

are paid at time of purchase while wholesale and licensing purchases are paid on short-term credit terms. The Group also obtains 

revenue through licences issued to third parties to produce and sell goods carrying ‘Burberry’ trademarks. Revenue is stated 

excluding Value Added Tax and other sales-related taxes. 

Retail and wholesale revenue 
For retail and wholesale revenue, the primary performance obligation is the transfer of luxury goods to the customer. For retail 

revenue this is considered to occur when control of the goods passes to the customer. For in-store retail revenue, control 

transfers when the customer takes possession of the goods in store and pays for the goods. For digital retail revenue, control is 

considered to transfer when the goods are delivered to the customer. The timing of transfer of control of the goods in wholesale 

transactions depends upon the terms of trade in the contract. Principally for wholesale revenue, revenue is recognised either when 

goods are collected by the customer from the Group’s premises, or when the Group has delivered the goods to the location 

specified in the contract. Provision for returns and other allowances are reflected in revenue when revenue from the customer is 

first recognised. A sales return liability and a corresponding return asset within gross inventory are recognised. Retail customers 

typically have the right to return product within a limited time frame while wholesale customers typically have the right to return 

damaged and, under agreement, certain current season products. Returns are initially estimated based on historical levels and 

adjusted subsequently as returns are incurred. 

Some wholesale contracts may require the Group to make payments to the wholesale customer for services directly relating to the 

sale of the Group’s goods, such as the cost of staff handling the Group’s goods at the wholesaler. Payments to the customer 

directly relating to the sale of goods to the customer are recognised as a reduction in revenue, unless in exchange for a distinct 

good or service. These charges are recognised in revenue at the later of when the sale of the related goods to the customer is 

recognised or when the customer is paid, or promised to be paid, for the service. Payments to the customer relating to a service 

which is distinct from the sale of goods to the customer are recognised in operating costs. 

The Group sells gift cards and similar products to customers, which can be redeemed for goods, up to the value of the card,  

at a future date. Revenue relating to gift cards is recognised when the card is redeemed, up to the value of the redemption. 

Unredeemed amounts on gift cards are classified as contract liabilities. Typically, the Group does not expect to have significant 

unredeemed amounts arising on its gift cards.  

Licensing revenue 
The Group’s licences entitle the licensee to access the Group’s trademarks over the term of the licence. Hence revenue from 

licensing is recognised over the term of access to the licence. Royalties receivable under licence agreements are usually based on 

production or sales volumes and are accrued in revenue as the subsequent production or sale occurs. Any amounts received which 

have not been recognised in revenue are classified as contract liabilities. 

b) Segment reporting 
As required by IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the segmental information presented in the financial statements is reported in a 

manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Chief Operating Decision 

Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance, has been identified as the Board of Directors.  

The Group has centralised activities for designing, making and sourcing, which ensure a global product offering is sold through 

retail and wholesale channels worldwide. Resource allocation and performance is assessed across the whole of the retail/wholesale 

channel globally. Hence the retail/wholesale channel has been determined to be an operating segment. 

Licensed products are manufactured and sold by third-party licensees. As a result, this channel is assessed discretely by the  

Chief Operating Decision Maker and has been determined to be an operating segment. 

The Group presents an analysis of its revenue by channel, by product division and by geographical destination.

2. Accounting policies continued 

c) Business combinations 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition 

is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of 

exchange. Contingent payments are remeasured at fair value through the Income Statement. All transaction costs are expensed 

to the Income Statement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 

are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.  

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity, and are initially measured either at  

fair value or at a value equal to the non-controlling interests’ share of the identifiable net assets acquired. The choice of the basis 

of measurement is an accounting policy choice for each individual business combination. The excess of the cost of acquisition 

together with the value of any non-controlling interest over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded 

as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is 

recognised directly in the Income Statement. 

d) Share schemes 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation schemes, under which services are received from 

employees (including Executive Directors) as consideration for equity instruments of the Company. The cost of the share-based 

incentives is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant, including share 

awards and options. Appropriate option pricing models, including Black-Scholes, are used to determine the fair value of the option 

awards made. The fair value takes into account the impact of any market performance conditions, but the impact of non-market 

performance conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant. Vesting conditions which relate to 

non-market conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of share awards or options expected to vest. 

The estimate of the number of share awards or options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.  

In some circumstances, employees may provide services in advance of the grant date. The grant date fair value is estimated for 

the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between the service commencement period and the grant date. 

The cost of the share-based incentives is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the share awards, or options,  

with a corresponding increase in equity. 

When share awards or options are exercised, they are settled either via issue of new shares in the Company, or through shares 

held in an Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) trust, depending on the terms and conditions of the relevant scheme. For new 

shares issued, the proceeds received from the exercises of share options, net of any directly attributable transaction costs,  

are credited to share capital and share premium accounts. When ESOP shares are used, any difference between the exercise  

price and their cost are recognised in retained earnings. 

e) Leases 
The Group is both a lessee and lessor of property, plant and equipment. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys 

the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. An identified asset may be 

specifically or implicitly specified. Control exists when the lessee has both the right to direct the use of the identified asset and the 

right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from that use.  

Lessee accounting 
The Group’s principal lease arrangements where the Group acts as the lessee are for property, most notably the lease of  

retail stores, corporate offices and warehouses. Other leases are for office equipment, vehicles, and supply chain equipment. 

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.  

The Group recognises all lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets on the Balance Sheet, with the exception of 

certain short-term leases (12 months or less) and leases of low value assets, which are expensed as incurred. Leases and the 

corresponding right-of-use assets are initially recognised when the Group obtains control of the underlying asset. Leases for new 

assets are presented as additions to lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. 

Lease liabilities are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following 

lease payments: 

•  Fixed payments, less any incentives 

•  Variable lease payments that are based on a future index or rate 

•  Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees and 

•  The cost of exercising a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option

2. Accounting policies continued 

e) Leases continued 

Lessee accounting continued 
Where the lease contains an extension option or a termination option which is exercisable by the Group, as lessee, an assessment 

is made as to whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the extension option, or not exercise the termination option, 

considering all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive. Considerations may include the contractual 

terms and conditions for the optional periods compared to market rates, costs associated with the termination of the lease and 

the importance of the underlying asset to the Group’s operations.  

Variable lease payments dependent upon a future index or rate are measured using the amounts payable at the commencement 

date until the index or rate is known. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate, including lease payments based 

on a percentage of turnover, are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities.  

Payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee, unless the interest rate implicit in the lease can be 

readily determined.  

Right-of-use assets are classified as property or non-property. The Group has elected not to apply the short-term exemption to 

the property class of right-of-use assets. Where the exemption is applied to the non-property class of right-of-use assets, lease 

payments are expensed as incurred. The low value asset exemption has been applied to both the property and non-property class 

of assets on a lease-by-lease basis where applicable.  

In circumstances where the Group is in possession of a property but there is no executed agreement or other binding obligation in 

relation to the property, rent is expensed until such time the obligation becomes binding, at which point, a right-of-use asset and lease 

liability will be recognised prospectively. These lease costs are disclosed as lease in holdover expenses. Refer to notes 5 and 21.  

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: 

•  The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability 

•  Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received and 

•  Any initial direct costs incurred in entering into the lease 

The Group recognises depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the Income Statement over the lease 

term. Repayments of lease liabilities are classified separately in the Statement of Cash Flows where the cash payments for the 

principal portion of the lease liability are presented within financing activities, and cash payments for the interest portion are 

presented within operating activities. Payments in relation to variable lease payments based on turnover, short-term leases and 

leases of low value assets which are not included on the Balance Sheet are included within operating expenses.  

Modifications to lease agreements, extensions to existing lease agreements and changes to future lease payments relating to 

existing terms in the contract, including market rent reassessments and index-based changes, are presented as remeasurements 

of the lease liabilities. The related right-of-use asset is also remeasured. If the modification results in a reduction in scope of the 

lease, either through shortening the lease term or through disposing of part of the underlying asset, a gain or loss on disposal may 

arise relating to the difference between the lease liabilities and the right-of-use asset applicable to the reduction in scope.  

Right-of-use assets are included in the review for impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite 

economic lives, if there is an indication that the carrying amount of the cash generating unit may not be recoverable. 

COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions 
The COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions amendment to IFRS 16 Leases was adopted by the IASB on 28 May 2020. The amendment 

was applied until 30 June 2022. The amendment allowed for a simplified approach to accounting for rent concessions occurring as a 

direct result of COVID-19 and for which the following criteria are met: 

•  The revised consideration is substantially the same, or less than, the consideration prior to the change 

•  The concessions affect only payments originally due on or before 30 June 2022 and  

•  There is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the lease 

From 1 July 2022, the Group has applied the principles of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and continues to account for eligible rent 

forgiveness as negative variable lease payments where: 

•  The rent concessions are occurring as a direct result of COVID-19 

•  The revised consideration is substantially the same, or less than, the consideration prior to the change and 

•  There is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the lease

2. Accounting policies continued 

e) Leases continued 

COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions continued 
Lessees are not required to assess whether eligible rent concessions are lease modifications, allowing the lessee to account for 

eligible rent concessions as if they were not lease modifications. The Group may agree rent concessions both in the form of rent 

forgiveness in which the landlord has agreed to forgive all or a portion of rents due with no obligation to be repaid in the future, 

and rent deferrals in which the landlord has agreed to forego rents in one period with a proportional increase in rents due in a 

future period.  

The Group has chosen to account for eligible rent forgiveness as negative variable lease payments. Rent concessions are 

recognised once a legally binding agreement is made between both parties, by derecognising the portion of the lease liability that 

has been forgiven and recognising the benefit in the Income Statement. As a result, the Group has recognised £13 million (last 

year: £18 million) in COVID-19-related rent concessions in the Income Statement within other operating income in the current 

period. This has been presented as an adjusting item (refer to note 6). In the Statement of Cash Flows, the forgiveness results in 

lower payments of lease principal. The negative variable lease payments in the Income Statement comprise a non-cash item which 

is adjusted for to calculate cash generated from operating activities. 

Rent deferrals do not change the total consideration due over the life of the lease. Deferred rent payments are recognised as a 

payable until the period the original rent payment is due. Payments relating to rent deferrals are recognised as payments of lease 

principal when the payment is made. 

f) Dividend distributions 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividend 

becomes a committed obligation. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders. Interim dividends are 

recognised when paid. 

g) Pension costs 
Eligible employees participate in defined contribution pension schemes, the principal one being in the UK with its assets held in an 

independently administered fund. The cost of providing these benefits to participating employees is recognised in the Income 

Statement as they fall due and comprises the amount of contributions to the schemes. 

h) Intangible assets 

Goodwill 
Goodwill is the excess of the cost of acquisition together with the value of any non-controlling interest, over the fair value of 

identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill on acquisition is recorded as an intangible asset. Fair values are attributed to the 

identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that 

date. Adjustments are also made to align the accounting policies of acquired businesses with those of the Group.  

Goodwill is assigned an indefinite useful life. Impairment reviews are performed annually, or more frequently if events or changes in 

circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed 

in future periods. 

Trademarks, licences and other intangible assets 
The cost of securing and renewing trademarks and licences, and the cost of acquiring other intangible assets, is capitalised at 

purchase price and amortised by equal annual instalments over the period in which benefits are expected to accrue, typically ten 

years for trademarks, or the term of the licence. The useful life of trademarks and other intangible assets is determined on a case-

by-case basis, in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement and the nature of the asset. 

Computer software 
Computer software costs are capitalised during the development phase at the point at which there is sufficient certainty that the 

software will deliver future economic benefits to the Group. The cost of acquiring computer software (including licences and 

separately identifiable development costs) is capitalised as an intangible asset at purchase price, plus any directly attributable cost 

of preparing that asset for its intended use. Software costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, 

which may be up to seven years.

2. Accounting policies continued 

i) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment, with the exception of assets in the course of construction, is stated at cost or deemed cost, based 

on historical revalued amounts prior to the adoption of IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any 

impairment in value. Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and transferred to 

completed assets when substantially all of the activities necessary for the asset to be ready for use have occurred. Cost includes 

the original purchase price of the asset and costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 

Depreciation 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off the cost or deemed cost, less residual value, of the assets 

in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: 

Type of asset 

Land 

Freehold buildings 

Category of property, plant and equipment

Profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
Profits and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets represent the difference between the net 

proceeds and net book value at the date of sale. Disposals are accounted for when the relevant transaction becomes unconditional. 

j) Assets held for sale 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale 

transaction rather than through continued use, and a sale within the next 12 months is considered to be highly probable. 

Assets classified as held for sale cease to be depreciated and they are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 

cost to sell. 

k) Impairment of non-financial assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets under 

construction are also tested annually. Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment 

whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 

recognised for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 

asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, retail assets are grouped at the 

lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, being individual stores (cash generating units), and goodwill 

assets are considered at the lowest level being monitored by management. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill, for which an 

impairment has been previously recognised are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment at each reporting date. 

l) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost consists of all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, 

design costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their first point of sale location and condition. The cost of 

inventories is determined using a weighted average cost method, taking account of the fashion seasons for which the inventory 

was offered. Where necessary, provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard to the nature 

and condition of inventory, as well as its anticipated utilisation and saleability.

Financial Statements | Notes to the Financial Statements  

2. Accounting policies continued 

m) Taxation 
Tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax charge. 

Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement 

because it excludes items of income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items which 

are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates which have been enacted or 

substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 

Deferred tax is recognised, using the liabilities method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 

liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the temporary difference arises from 

initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction 

affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, no deferred tax will be recognised. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates 

(and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related 

deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 

temporary differences can be utilised.  

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal 

of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 

foreseeable future.  

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 

tax liabilities and when deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 

same taxable entities or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 

n) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable 

that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably 

estimated. When the effect of the time value of money is material, provision amounts are calculated based on the present value of the 

expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. The present value is calculated using forward market interest rates as 

measured at the balance sheet reporting date, which have been adjusted for risks specific to the future obligation. 

Property obligations 
A provision for the present value of future property reinstatement costs is recognised where there is an obligation to return the 

leased property to its original condition at the end of a lease term. The reinstatement cost at the end of a lease usually arises due to 

leasehold improvements and modifications carried out by the Group in order to customise the property during tenure of the lease. As 

a result, the cost of the reinstatement provision is recognised as a component of the cost of the leasehold improvements in property, 

plant and equipment when these are installed and amortised to the income statement over the expected life of the lease. 

o) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 

equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 

Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any 

directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to owners of the Company until the shares are 

cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any 

directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is credited to share capital and share 

premium accounts included in equity attributable to owners of the Company.

2. Accounting policies continued 

p) Financial instruments 
Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs on the Balance Sheet when 

the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual 

rights to the cash flow expire or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised 

when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.  

At initial recognition, all financial liabilities are stated at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities are 

stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method except for derivatives which are held at fair value and which are 

classified as fair value through profit and loss, except where they qualify for hedge accounting. Financial assets are classified as 

either amortised cost or fair value through profit and loss depending on their cash flow characteristics. Assets with cash flows 

that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. The fair value of the Group’s financial 

assets and liabilities held at amortised cost mostly approximate their carrying amount due to the short maturity of these 

instruments. Where the fair value of any financial asset or liability held at amortised cost is materially different to the book value, 

the fair value is disclosed.  

The Group classifies its instruments in the following categories:

1.  Cash flow hedge and net investment hedge accounting is applied to the extent it is achievable. 
2.  The fair value measurement hierarchy is only applicable for financial instruments measured at fair value. 
3.  Forward foreign exchange contracts used for hedging are classified as Fair value – hedging instruments under IFRS 9, however IAS 39 hedge accounting has been applied.  

The measurements for financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy 

based on the inputs to the valuation technique used. The different levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the 

measurement date. 

Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 

or indirectly. 

Level 3: includes unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 

Observable inputs are those which are developed using market data, such as publicly available information about actual events or 

transactions. The Group has an established framework with respect to measurement of fair values, including Level 3 fair values. 

The Group regularly reviews any significant inputs which are not derived from observable market data and considers, where 

available, relevant third-party information, to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of IFRS. 

The classification level in the fair value hierarchy is also considered periodically. 

The fair value of those cash and cash equivalents measured at fair value through profit and loss, principally money market funds, 

is derived from their net asset value which is based on the value of the portfolio investment holdings at the balance sheet date. 

This is considered to be a Level 2 measurement.

2. Accounting policies continued  

p) Financial instruments continued 
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, equity swap contracts and trade and other receivables, principally cash 

settled equity swaps, is based on a comparison of the contractual and market rates and, in the case of forward foreign exchange 

contracts, after discounting using the appropriate yield curve as at the balance sheet date. All Level 2 fair value measurements are 

calculated using inputs which are based on observable market data. 

The fair value of the contingent payment component of deferred consideration is considered to be a Level 3 measurement and is 

derived using a present value calculation, incorporating observable and non-observable inputs. This valuation technique has been 

adopted as it most closely mirrors the contractual arrangement. 

The Group’s primary categories of financial instruments are listed below:  

Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and short-term deposits on the Balance Sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term highly liquid deposits 

with a maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk 

of changes in value. In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts, which are recorded 

under current liabilities on the Balance Sheet. 

While cash at bank and in hand is classified as amortised cost, some short-term deposits are classified as fair value through profit 

and loss.  

Cash and cash equivalents held at amortised cost are subject to impairment testing at each period end.  

Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet 

date. Most receivables are held with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and are therefore recognised initially at  

fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. 

A provision for the expected credit losses on trade receivables is established at inception. Expected credit loss rates are calculated 

by reviewing lifetime expected credit losses using historic and forward-looking data. The amount of the movement in the provision 

is recognised in the Income Statement.  

Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance 

sheet date. Payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 

rate method. 

Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, inclusive of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 

amortised cost and the difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 

Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method. Borrowings are classified as current 

liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance 

sheet date. 

Deferred consideration 
Deferred consideration is initially recognised at the present value of the expected future payments. It is subsequently remeasured 

at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value relating to changes in expected future payments recorded in the 

Income Statement as an operating expense or income. Changes in fair value relating to unwinding of discounting to present value 

are recorded as a financing expense. 

Derivative instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising on certain 

trading transactions. The principal derivative instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge highly 

probable cash flows in relation to future sales, and product purchases. The Group also may designate forward foreign exchange 

contracts or foreign currency borrowings as a net investment hedge of the assets of overseas subsidiaries.

2. Accounting policies continued  

p) Financial instruments continued 

Derivative instruments continued 
When hedge accounting is applied, the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between the spot 

element of the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking 

various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of 

whether the hedging instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or 

cash flows of hedged items.  

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method 

of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the 

nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised 

assets and liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedges); (2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow 

hedges); (3) hedges of net investment of the assets of overseas subsidiaries (net investment hedges); or (4) classified as fair value 

through profit and loss.  

The forward elements of the hedging instrument are recognised in operating expenses. 

Changes in the fair value relating to the spot element of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are 

recorded in the Income Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable 

to the hedged risk. 

The effective portion of changes in the fair value relating to the spot element of derivatives that are designated and qualify as 

cash flow hedges is deferred in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of the gain or loss 

is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Amounts deferred in other comprehensive income are recycled through the 

Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item affects the Income Statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is 

sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time 

remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement. When a 

forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 

transferred to the Income Statement within ‘net exchange gain/(loss) on derivatives – fair value through profit and loss’. If a 

derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the subsequent change to the fair value is recognised in the Income Statement 

within operating expenses or interest depending upon the nature of the instrument. 

Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations through derivative instruments or foreign currency borrowings, the 

gains or losses on the effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net 

investment, or the gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are recognised in other comprehensive income and are 

reclassified to the Income Statement when the foreign operation that is hedged is disposed of.  

Cash settled equity swaps are classified as fair value through profit and loss. 

q) Government grants 
Government grants related to assets are recognised as deferred income when there is reasonable certainty that any conditions 

attached to the grant will be met and the grant will be received. They are amortised to operating income over the useful life of the 

asset. Government grants related to income are presented as operating income when it is reasonably certain that any conditions 

attached will be met and that the grant will be received.

2. Accounting policies continued  

r) Foreign currency translation  

Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 

economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented 

in sterling which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency. 

Transactions in foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies within each entity in the Group are translated into the functional currency at the 

exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which 

are held at the year end, are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date (closing 

rate). Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise, except 

where these exchange differences form part of a net investment in overseas subsidiaries of the Group, in which case such 

differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. 

Translation of the results of overseas businesses 
The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into the Group’s presentation currency of sterling each month at the average 

exchange rate for the month, weighted according to the phasing of the Group’s trading results. The average exchange rate is used, 

as it is considered to approximate the actual exchange rates on the date of the transactions. The assets and liabilities of such 

undertakings are translated at the closing rates. Differences arising on the retranslation of the opening net investment in 

subsidiary companies, and on the translation of their results, are recognised in other comprehensive income.  

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the 

foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. 

The principal exchange rates used were as follows:

s) Adjusted profit before taxation 
In order to provide additional understanding of the underlying performance of the Group’s ongoing business, the Group’s results 

include a presentation of Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted profit before taxation (adjusted PBT). Adjusted PBT is defined as 

profit before taxation and before adjusting items. Adjusting items are those items which, in the opinion of the Directors, should be 

excluded in order to provide a consistent and comparable view of the performance of the Group’s ongoing business. Generally, 

this will include those items that are largely one-off and/or material in nature as well as income or expenses relating to 

acquisitions or disposals of businesses or other transactions of a similar nature, including the impact of changes in fair value of 

expected future payments or receipts relating to these transactions. Adjusting items are identified and presented on a consistent 

basis each year and a reconciliation of adjusted PBT to profit before tax is included in the financial statements. Adjusting items 

and their related tax impacts, as well as adjusting taxation items, are added back to/deducted from profit attributable to owners 

of the Company to arrive at adjusted earnings per share. Refer to note 6 for further details of adjusting items.

3. Segmental analysis 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors. The Board reviews the Group’s internal 

reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the operating segments based on 

the reports used by the Board. The Board considers the Group’s business through its two channels to market, being 

retail/wholesale and licensing.  

Retail/wholesale revenues are generated by the sale of luxury goods through Burberry mainline stores, concessions, outlets and 

digital commerce as well as Burberry franchisees, prestige department stores globally and multi-brand speciality accounts. The 

flow of global product between retail and wholesale channels and across our regions is monitored and optimised at a corporate 

level and implemented via the Group’s inventory hubs and principal distribution centres situated in Europe, the US, Mainland China 

and Hong Kong S.A.R. China. 

Licensing revenues are generated through the receipt of royalties from global licensees of beauty products, eyewear and from 

licences relating to the use of non-Burberry trademarks in Japan.  

The Board assesses channel performance based on a measure of adjusted operating profit. This measurement basis excludes the 

effects of adjusting items. The measure of earnings for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Board includes an 

allocation of corporate and central costs. Interest income and charges are not included in the result for each operating segment 

that is reviewed by the Board.

Impact of COVID-19 
At 1 April 2023, impairments and provisions recorded as adjusting items in prior periods as a result of the impact of COVID-19 

have been reviewed and the assumptions updated where appropriate, to reflect management’s latest expectations. The impact of 

changes in assumptions has been presented as an update to the adjusting item charge. Further details regarding the approach 

applied to measure these updates are set out below for each of the specific adjusting items.  

Impairment of retail cash generating units 
During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, the impairment provisions remaining have been reassessed, using management’s latest 

expectations, with a reversal of £6 million recorded (last year: charge of £5 million). A related tax charge of £1 million (last year: 

credit of £1 million) has also been recognised in the year. Any charges or reversals which did not arise from the reassessment of 

the original impairment adjusting item, had they arisen, would not have been included in this adjusting item. Refer to notes 13 and 

14 for details of impairment of retail cash generating units. 

Impairment of inventory 
During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, reversals of inventory provisions, relating to inventory which had been provided for as an 

adjusting item at the previous year end and has either been sold, or is now expected to be sold, at a higher net realisable value than 

had been assumed when the provision had been initially estimated, of £1 million (last year: £16 million) have been recorded and 

presented as an adjusting item. No related tax charge (last year: £4 million) has been recognised in the year. All other charges and 

reversals relating to inventory provisions have been recorded in adjusted operating profit. Refer to note 17 for details of inventory 

provisions. 

Impairment of receivables 
During the 53 weeks to 2 April 2022, a reversal of £1 million was recorded as an adjusting item relating to the one-off impact of 

COVID-19 on expected credit losses. No amounts were recorded during the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023. Refer to note 27 for details 

of impairment of receivables.  

COVID-19-related rent concessions 
Eligible rent forgiveness amounts have been treated as negative variable lease payments, resulting in a credit of £13 million (last 

year: £18 million) for the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023 being recorded within other operating income. This income has continued to be 

presented as an adjusting item given that it is explicitly related to COVID-19. The amendment to IFRS 16 expired on 30 June 

2022; however the Group continues to apply the same accounting treatment applying the principles of IFRS 9. A related tax 

charge of £3 million (last year: £4 million) has also been recognised in the current year.  

COVID-19-related grant income  
The Group has recorded grant income of £2 million (last year: £2 million) within other operating income for the 52 weeks to 1 April 

2023, relating to government support to alleviate the impact of COVID-19. This income has been presented as an adjusting item 

as it is explicitly related to COVID-19, and the arrangements are expected to last for a limited period of time. A related tax charge 

of £1 million (last year: £1 million) has also been recognised in the current year. 

Other adjusting items 

Gain on disposal of property 
During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, the Group completed the sale of an owned property in the US for cash proceeds of £22 

million resulting in a net gain on disposal of £19 million, recorded within other operating income. The net gain on disposal was 

recognised as an adjusting item, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, as it is considered to be material and one-off in 

nature. A related tax charge of £5 million was also recognised in the year.

6. Adjusting items continued 

Other adjusting items continued 

Restructuring costs  
Restructuring costs of £16 million (last year: £11 million) were incurred in the current year, arising primarily as a result of the 

organisational efficiency programme announced in July 2020, and completed in the current year, that included the creation of 

three new business units to enhance product focus, increase agility and elevate quality, and to further streamline office-based 

functions and facilities. The costs for the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023 principally relate to impairment charges on non-retail assets 

and redundancies and are recorded in operating expenses. They are presented as an adjusting item, in accordance with the Group’s 

accounting policy, as the anticipated cost of the restructuring programme is considered material and discrete in nature. A related 

tax credit of £4 million (last year: £3 million) has also been recognised in the current year. 

Items relating to the deferred consideration liability 
On 22 April 2016, the Group entered into an agreement to transfer the economic right of the non-controlling interest in Burberry 

Middle East LLC to the Group in exchange for consideration of contingent payments to be made to the minority shareholder over 

the period to 2023.  

A charge of £2 million in relation to the revaluation of this balance has been recognised in operating expenses for the 52 weeks to 1 

April 2023 (last year: £1 million). This movement is unrealised. No tax has been recognised on this item, as the future payments 

are not considered to be deductible for tax purposes. This item is presented as an adjusting item in accordance with the Group’s 

accounting policy, as it arises from changes in the value of the liability for expected future payments relating to the purchase of a 

non-controlling interest in the Group and acquisition of a subsidiary respectively.

Uncertain tax positions 
The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world and is subject to factors that may affect future tax charges 

including transfer pricing, tax rate changes, tax legislation changes, tax authority interpretation, expiry of statutes of limitation, 

tax litigation, and resolution of tax audits and disputes. 

At any given time, the Group has open years outstanding in various countries and is involved in tax audits and disputes, some of 

which may take several years to resolve. Provisions are based on best estimates and management’s judgements concerning the 

likely ultimate outcome of any audit or dispute. Management considers the specific circumstances of each tax position and takes 

external advice, where appropriate, to assess the range of potential outcomes and estimate additional tax that may be due.  

At 1 April 2023 the Group had recognised provisions of £86 million in respect of uncertain tax positions (increasing from 

£64 million in 2022), being provisions of £103 million net of expected reimbursements of £17 million (last year: £69 million  

net of expected reimbursements of £5 million). The majority of these provisions relate to the tax impact of intra-group 

transactions between the UK and the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates, as would be expected for a Group 

operating internationally. 

The Group believes that it has made adequate provision in respect of additional tax liabilities that may arise from open years, tax 

audits and disputes. However, the actual liability for any particular issue may be higher or lower than the amount provided, 

resulting in a negative or positive effect on the tax charge in any given year. A reduction in the tax charge may also arise for other 

reasons such as an expiry of the relevant statute of limitations. Depending on the final outcome of tax audits which are currently in 

progress, statute of limitations expiry, and other factors, an impact on the tax charge could arise. The tax impact of intra-group 

transactions is a complex area and resolution of matters can take many years. Given the inherent uncertainty, it is difficult to 

predict the timing of when these matters will be resolved and the quantum of the ultimate resolution. Management estimate that 

the outcome across all matters under dispute or in negotiation between governments could be in the range of a decrease of 

£32 million, to an increase of £27 million, in the uncertain tax position over the next 12 months.

9. Taxation continued 

Legislative changes 
The UK corporation tax rate increased from 19% to 25% on 1 April 2023; consequently we expect an increase in the Group’s 

effective tax rate to around 27% for FY 2023/24.  

The OECD Pillar Two GloBE Rules introduce a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% applicable to multinational enterprise 

groups with global revenue over €750 million. All participating OECD members are required to incorporate these rules into 

national legislation. The Group will be subject to the Pillar Two Model Rules from FY 2024/25 but does not meet the threshold for 

application of the Pillar One transfer pricing rules. It is not expected that there will be a material impact on the effective tax rate 

for the Group. 

10. Earnings per share  
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on profit or loss attributable to owners of the Company for the year divided by 

the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. Basic and diluted earnings per share based on adjusted 

profit before taxation are also disclosed to indicate the underlying profitability of the Group.

The weighted average number of ordinary shares represents the weighted average number of Burberry Group plc ordinary shares 

in issue throughout the year, excluding ordinary shares held in the Group’s ESOP trusts and treasury shares held by the Company 

or its subsidiaries. This includes the effect of the cancellation of 21.1 million shares during the period as a result of the share 

buyback programmes. Refer to note 25 for additional information on the share buybacks. 

Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. In addition, 

account is taken of any options and awards made under the employee share incentive schemes, which will have a dilutive effect 

when exercised. Refer to note 28 for additional information on the terms and conditions of the employee share incentive schemes.

been proposed for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting subsequent to the balance sheet date. The final 

dividend has not been recognised as a liability at the year end and will be paid on 4 August 2023 to the shareholders on the 

register at the close of business on 30 June 2023. The ex-dividend date is 29 June 2023 and the final day for dividend 

reinvestment plan (DRIP) elections is 14 July 2023.

1.  Goodwill which arose on acquisition of Burberry Manifattura S.R.L. has been allocated to the group of cash generating units which make up the Group’s Retail and Wholesale 

operating segment cash generating unit. This reflects the lowest level at which the goodwill is being monitored by management. 

The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or when there is an indication that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable 

amount of all cash generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis. Value-in-use calculations for each cash 

generating unit are based on projected pre-tax discounted cash flows together with a discounted terminal value. The cash flows 

have been discounted at pre-tax rates reflecting the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country-specific tax 

rates and risks. Where the cash generating unit has a non-controlling interest which was recognised at a value equal to its 

proportionate interest in the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the acquisition date, the carrying amount of the 

goodwill has been grossed up, to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest, for the purpose of impairment 

testing the goodwill attributable to the cash generating unit. The key assumptions contained in the value-in-use calculations 

include the future revenues, the operating profit margins achieved and the discount rates applied. 

The value-in-use calculations have been prepared using management’s cost and revenue projections for the next three years to 

28 March 2026 and a longer-term growth rate of 5% to 1 April 2028. A terminal value has been included in the value-in-use calculation 

based on the cash flows for the year ending 1 April 2028, incorporating the assumption that growth beyond 1 April 2028 is 

equivalent to nominal inflation rates, assumed to be 2%, which are not significant to the assessment.  

The value-in-use estimates indicated that the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit exceeded the carrying value for 

each of the cash generating units. As a result, no impairment has been recognised in respect of the carrying value of goodwill in 

the year. 

For the material goodwill balances of Mainland China, Korea and the Retail and Wholesale segment, management has considered 

the potential impact of reasonably possible changes in assumptions on the recoverable amount of goodwill. The sensitivities 

include applying a 10% reduction in revenue and gross profit and the associated impact on operating profit margin from 

management’s base cash flow projections, considering the macroeconomic and political uncertainty risk on the Group’s retail 

operations and on the global economy. Under this scenario, the estimated recoverable amount of goodwill in Mainland China, 

Korea and the Retail and Wholesale segment still exceeded the carrying value. 

The pre-tax discount rates for Mainland China, Korea and the Retail and Wholesale segment were 12%, 12% and 12% respectively 

(last year: Mainland China 13%, Korea 12%, and the Retail and Wholesale segment 10%). No reasonably possible change in these 

pre-tax discount rates would result in the carrying value to exceed the estimated recoverable amount of goodwill.  

The other goodwill balance of £14 million (last year: £14 million) consists of amounts relating to seven cash generating units, 

none of which have goodwill balances individually exceeding £7 million as at 1 April 2023 (last year: £7 million).

During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, management carried out a review of retail cash generating units for any indication of 

impairment or reversal of impairments previously recorded. Where indications of impairment charges or reversals were identified, 

the impairment review compared the value-in-use of the cash generating units to their net book values at 1 April 2023. The pre-tax 

cash flow projections used for this review were based on financial plans of expected revenues and costs of each retail cash 

generating unit, approved by management, reflecting their latest plans over the next three years to 28 March 2026, followed by 

longer-term growth rates of mid-single digits and inflation rates appropriate to each store’s location. The pre-tax discount rates 

used in these calculations were between 11.1% and 13.7% (last year: between 9.9% and 18.4%) based on the Group’s weighted 

average cost of capital adjusted for country-specific borrowing costs, tax rates and risks for those countries in which a charge or 

reversal was incurred. Where indicators of impairment have been identified and the value-in-use was less than the carrying value 

of the cash generating unit, an impairment of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use asset was recorded. Where the 

value-in-use was greater than the net book value, and the cash generating unit had been previously impaired, the impairment was 

reversed, to the extent that could be supported by the value-in use and allowing for any depreciation that would have been 

incurred during the period since the impairment was recorded. A review for any other indicators of impairment charges or 

reversals across the retail portfolio was also carried out.

13. Property, plant and equipment continued 
During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, impairments previously charged as an adjusting item related to the impact of COVID-19 were 

reassessed. This resulted in an impairment reversal of £6 million (last year: net charge of £5 million), which has been presented as 

an adjusting item in the current year. The reversal is recorded against right-of-use assets (last year: net reversal of £1 million 

recorded against property, plant and equipment and a net charge of £6 million recorded against right-of-use assets). Refer to 

note 14 for further details of right-of-use assets. Refer to note 6 for details of adjusting items.  

A net charge of £7 million (last year: £3 million) was recorded within net operating expenses as a result of the annual review of 

impairment for all other retail store assets. A charge of £2 million (last year: £2 million) was recorded against property, plant and 

equipment and a net charge of £5 million (last year: charge of £1 million) was recorded against right-of-use assets.  

The net impairment charge recorded in property, plant and equipment related to two retail cash generating units (last year: 13 

retail cash generating units) for which the total recoverable amount at the balance sheet date is £1 million (last year: £7 million).  

Management has considered the potential impact of changes in assumptions on the impairment recorded against the Group’s 

retail assets. Given the macroeconomic and political uncertainty risk on the Group’s retail operations and on the global economy, 

management has considered sensitivities to the impairment charge as a result of changes to the estimate of future revenues 

achieved by the retail stores. The sensitivities applied are an increase or decrease in revenue of 10% from the estimate used to 

determine the impairment charge or reversal. We have also considered retail cash generating units with no indicators of 

impairment but with a significant asset balance. It is estimated that a 10% decrease/increase in revenue assumptions for the 52 

weeks to 30 March 2024 , with no change to subsequent forecast revenue growth rate assumptions, would result in a less than 

£10 million increase/less than £10 million decrease in the impairment charge of retail store assets in the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023. 

At 2 April 2022 the Group had three freehold properties that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. The sale of these 

properties was completed during the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023 resulting in a net gain on disposal of £19 million.

As a result of the assessment of retail cash generating units for impairment, a net impairment reversal of £1 million (last year: 

£7 million) was recorded for impairment of right-of-use assets. Refer to note 13 for further details of impairment assessment of 

retail cash generating units. This net impairment reversal comprises a £6 million reversal arising from the change in assumption 

due to the impact of COVID-19 on the value-in-use of retail cash generating units (last year: charge of £6 million) and an 

impairment charge of £5 million relating to other trading impacts which was recognised during the year (last year: £1 million). 

The reversal relating to COVID-19 has been presented as an adjusting item (refer to note 6). 

The net impairment reversal recorded in right-of-use assets relates to three retail cash generating units (last year: 12 retail cash 

generating units) for which the total recoverable amount at the balance sheet date is £17 million (last year: £26 million). 

A net impairment charge of £3 million (last year: £nil) was recognised in relation to non-retail right-of-use assets arising as a 

result of the Group’s restructuring programmes and has been presented as an adjusting item (refer to note 6). 

As a result, the net impairment charge for right-of-use assets was, in total, £2 million (last year: £7 million).

1.  Deferred balances within Other category in the analysis above include temporary differences arising on other provisions and accruals of £21 million (last year: £18 million).  

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related benefit through 

future taxable profits is probable. The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of £46 million (last year: £47 million) in respect 

of losses and temporary timing differences amounting to £181 million (last year: £185 million) that can be set off against future 

taxable income. There is a time limit for the recovery of £6 million of these potential assets (last year: £6 million) which ranges 

from one to seven years (last year: one to seven years).  

Included within other temporary differences above is a deferred tax liability of £1 million (last year: £1 million) relating to 

unremitted overseas earnings. No deferred tax liability is provided in respect of any future remittance of earnings of foreign 

subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the remittance of earnings and it is probable that such earnings will not be remitted 

in the foreseeable future, or where no liability would arise on the remittance. The aggregate amount of temporary differences in 

respect of unremitted earnings is £281 million (last year: £287 million).

Inventory provisions of £57 million (last year: £83 million) are recorded, representing 11.4% (last year: 16.3%) of the gross value of 

inventory. The provisions reflect management’s best estimate of the net realisable value of inventory, where this is considered to 

be lower than the cost of the inventory.  

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales amounted to £874 million (last year: £786 million). 

During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, £1 million (last year: £16 million) has been released upon re-assessment of the provision 

related to the impact of COVID-19 where inventory previously provided for has been sold, or is now expected to be sold, for a 

higher net realisable value than had been estimated last year as performance during the current year has exceeded, and is 

expected to continue to exceed, the assumptions made at last year end. This reversal is presented as an adjusting item. Refer to 

note 6 for details of adjusting items. All other charges and reversals relating to inventory provisions have been included in adjusted 

operating profit.

17. Inventories continued 
Taking into account factors impacting the inventory provisioning including trading assumptions being higher or lower than 

expected, management considers that a reasonable potential range of outcomes could result in an increase or decrease in 

inventory provisions of £9 million in the next 12 months. This would result in a potential range of inventory provisions of 9.6% to 

13.1% as a percentage of the gross value of inventory as at 1 April 2023. 

The net movement in inventory provisions included in cost of sales for the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023 was a release of £1 million 

(last year: release of £1 million). The total reversal of inventory provisions during the current year, which is included in the net 

movement, was £22 million (last year: reversal of £43 million). Both these amounts include the reversal of £1 million (last year: 

£16 million), referred to above, which has been presented as an adjusting item. 

18. Derivative financial instruments 
Master netting arrangements 
The Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 

master netting arrangements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in 

respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single amount that is payable by one party to 

the other. In certain circumstances, such as when a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are 

terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions. The ISDA 

agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the Balance Sheet as the Group’s right to offset is enforceable only on the 

occurrence of future events such as default. The Group has amended the ISDA agreement with two banks to require it to net 

settle its forward foreign exchange contracts. There were no derivatives subject to net settlement agreements and offset on the 

Balance Sheet at 1 April 2023 (last year: nil). The Group’s Balance Sheet would not be materially different if it had offset its 

forward foreign exchange contracts and equity swap contracts subject to the standard ISDA agreements.

2.  Deferred consideration relates to acquisition of the economic right to the non-controlling interest in Burberry Middle East LLC on 22 April 2016. The change in the deferred 
consideration liability in the period arises as a result of a financing cash outflow and non-cash movements. In the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023 payments of £6 million were made 
in relation to Burberry Middle East LLC (last year: £3 million) and no payment was made to the previous owners of Burberry Manifattura S.R.L (last year: £9 million). 

Included in total trade and other payables are non-financial liabilities of £153 million (last year: £168 million).  

Contract liabilities 
Retail contract liabilities relate to unredeemed balances on issued gift cards and similar products, and advanced payments

1.  The amount paid of £243 million (last year: £229 million) includes £210 million (last year: £202 million) arising as a result of a financing cash outflow and £33 million (last 

year: £27 million) arising as a result of an operating cash outflow.  

2.  Remeasurements include COVID-19-related rent forgiveness of £13 million (last year: £18 million) and other remeasurements of £111 million (last year: £20 million). COVID-
19-related rent forgiveness has been recognised as a credit in the Income Statement at 1 April 2023. This credit is included as an adjusting item. Refer to note 6. Other 
remeasurements relate largely to changes in the lease liabilities that arise as a result of management’s reassessment of the lease term based on existing break or extension 
options in the contract, as well as those linked to an inflation index or rate review. 

The Group enters into property leases for retail properties, including stores, concessions, warehouse and storage locations and 

office property. The remaining lease terms for these properties range from a few months to 15 years (last year: few months to 16 

years). Many of the leases include break options and/or extension options to provide operational flexibility. Some of the leases for 

concessions have rolling lease terms or rolling break options. Management assess the lease term at inception based on the facts 

and circumstances applicable to each property including the period over which the investment appraisal was initially considered.  

Potential future undiscounted lease payments related to periods following the exercise date of an extension option not included in the lease 

term, and therefore not included in lease liabilities are approximately £399 million (last year: £423 million) in relation to the next available 

extension option and are assessed as not reasonably certain to be exercised. Potential future undiscounted lease payments related to 

periods following the exercise date of a break option not included in the lease term, and therefore not included in lease liabilities, are 

approximately £130 million (last year: £157 million) in relation to break options which are expected to be exercised. During the 52 weeks to 

1 April 2023, significant judgements regarding breaks and options in relation to individually material leases resulted in approximately £38 

million (last year: £35 million) in undiscounted future cash flows not being included in the initial right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. 

Management reviews the retail lease portfolio on an ongoing basis, taking into account retail performance and future trading 

expectations. Management may exercise extension options and negotiate lease extensions or modifications. In other instances, 

management may exercise break options, negotiate lease reductions or decide not to negotiate a lease extension at the end of the 

lease term. The most significant factor impacting future lease payments is changes management choose to make to the store portfolio.  

Future increases and decreases in rent linked to an inflation index or rate review are not included in the lease liability until the change in 

cash flows takes effect. Approximately 18% (last year: 20%) of the Group’s lease liabilities are subject to inflation linked reviews and 30% 

(last year: 33%) are subject to rent reviews. Rental changes linked to inflation or rent reviews typically occur on an annual basis.

21. Lease liabilities continued 
Many of the retail property leases also incur payments based on a percentage of revenue achieved at the location. Changes in 

future variable lease payments will typically reflect changes in the Group’s retail revenues, including the impact of regional mix. 

The Group expects the relative proportions of fixed and variable lease payments to remain broadly consistent in future years. 

The Group also enters into non-property leases for equipment, advertising fixtures and machinery. Generally, these leases do not 

include break or extension options. The most significant impact to future cash flows relating to leased equipment, which are 

primarily short-term leases, would be the Group’s usage of leased equipment to a greater or lesser extent.  

The Group’s accounting policy for leases is set out in note 2. Details of income statement charges and income from leases are set 

out in note 5. The right-of-use asset categories on which depreciation is incurred are presented in note 14. Interest expense 

incurred on lease liabilities is presented in note 8. Commitments relating to off-balance sheet leases are presented in note 26. 

The maturity of undiscounted future lease liabilities are set out in note 27.  

Total cash outflows in relation to leases in the 52 weeks ended 1 April 2023 are £396 million (last year: £376 million). This relates 

to payments of £210 million on lease principal (last year: £202 million), £33 million on lease interest (last year: £27 million), 

£122 million on variable lease payments (last year: £124 million), and £31 million on other lease payments principally relating to 

short-term leases and leases in holdover (last year: £23 million).

23. Bank overdrafts  
Included within bank overdrafts is £65 million (last year: £45 million) representing balances on cash pooling arrangements in the Group. 

The Group has a number of committed and uncommitted arrangements agreed with third parties. At 1 April 2023 and 2 April 

2022, the Group held no bank overdrafts excluding balances on cash pooling arrangements. 

The fair value of overdrafts approximates the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

24. Borrowings 
On 21 September 2020, Burberry Group plc issued medium term notes with a face value of £300 million and 1.125% coupon 

maturing on 21 September 2025 (the sustainability bond). Proceeds from the sustainability bond will allow the Group to finance 

projects which support the Group’s sustainability agenda. Refer to page 92 for the sustainability bond use of proceeds report. 

There are no financial penalties for not using the proceeds as anticipated. Interest on the sustainability bond is payable semi-

annually. The carrying value of the bond at 1 April 2023 is £298 million (last year: £298 million); all movements on the bond are 

non-cash. The fair value of the bond at 1 April 2023 is £273 million (last year: £285 million). 

On 26 July 2021, the Group entered into a £300 million multi-currency sustainability-linked revolving credit facility (RCF) with a 

syndicate of banks, maturing on 26 July 2026. There were no drawdowns or repayments of the RCF during the current or previous 

year, and at 1 April 2023 there were no outstanding drawings. 

The Group is in compliance with the financial and other covenants within the facilities above and has been in compliance 

throughout the financial period.

The Company has a general authority from shareholders, renewed at each Annual General Meeting, to repurchase a maximum of 

10% of its issued share capital. During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, the Company entered into agreements to purchase £400 

million of its own shares, excluding stamp duty and fees, through two share buyback programmes of £200 million each (last year: 

one share buyback programme of £150 million). Both programmes were completed during the year.  

The cost of own shares purchased by the Company, as part of a share buyback programme, is offset against retained earnings, as 

the amounts paid reduce the profits available for distribution by the Company. When shares are cancelled, a transfer is made from 

retained earnings to the capital reserve, equivalent to the nominal value of the shares purchased and subsequently cancelled. 

In the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, 21.1 million shares were cancelled (last year: none).  

As at 1 April 2023 the Company held 6.1 million treasury shares (last year: 8.4 million), with a market value of £157 million (last 

year: £140 million) based on the share price at the reporting date. The treasury shares held by the Company are related to the 

share buyback programme completed during the 53 weeks to 2 April 2022. During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, 2.3 million 

treasury shares were transferred to ESOP trusts (last year: none). During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, no treasury shares were 

cancelled (last year: none). 

The cost of shares purchased by ESOP trusts are offset against retained earnings, as the amounts paid reduce the profits 

available for distribution by the Company. As at 1 April 2023, the cost of own shares held by ESOP trusts and offset against 

retained earnings is £42 million (last year: £11 million). As at 1 April 2023, the ESOP trusts held 2.3 million shares (last year: 0.6 

million) in the Company, with a market value of £60 million (last year: £10 million). In the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023 the ESOP trusts 

and the Company have waived their entitlement to dividends.

Other commitments 
On 28 March 2023, Burberry announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire a business from Italian technical outerwear 

supplier Pattern SpA for an agreed purchase price of €21 million (£18 million), subject to closing conditions and working capital 

adjustments. The acquisition is expected to complete in FY 2023/24.  

27. Financial risk management 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise derivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings (including 

overdrafts), deferred consideration, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables arising directly from operations. 

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), 

credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. 

Risk management is carried out by the Group treasury department (Group Treasury) based on forecast business requirements to 

reduce financial risk and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest in cash and cash 

equivalents safely and profitably. The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Group Treasury does not 

operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying business requirements. The policies of Group Treasury 

are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.

27. Financial risk management continued 

Market risk 

Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various non-sterling currencies. 

The Group’s Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency. To reduce exposure to currency 

fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign 

exchange contracts (refer to note 18). These transactions are recorded as cash flow hedges. The Group’s foreign currency 

transactions arise principally from purchases and sales of inventory. 

The Group’s treasury risk management policy is to hedge, prior to market opening, 70-90% of its anticipated foreign currency 

exposure by currency, by season and where the net currency exposure is greater than £20 million. Currently, the Group does  

not hedge anticipated intercompany foreign currency transactions. The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its 

currency risk.  

The Group designates the spot component of foreign currency forwards in hedge relationships and applies a ratio of 1:1. The 

forward elements of the foreign currency forward are excluded from designation of the hedging instrument and are separately 

accounted for as a cost of hedging and recognised in operating expenses on a discounted basis. 

The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on 

the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each 

hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the 

dollar offset method.  

In these hedge relationships ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally 

estimated, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty. There was no ineffectiveness in 

the 52 weeks ending 1 April 2023 (last year: no ineffectiveness). 

The Group monitors the desirability of hedging the net assets of overseas subsidiaries when translated into sterling for reporting 

purposes. The Group would use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge net assets of overseas subsidiaries, relating to 

surplus cash whose remittance is foreseeable. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as at 1 April 2023 (last year: no 

outstanding net investment hedges). 

At 1 April 2023, the Group has performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of sterling strengthening/weakening by 

10% (last year: 10%) against other currencies with all other variables held constant. The effect on translating foreign currency 

denominated net cash, trade, intercompany and other financial receivables and payables and financial instruments at fair value 

through profit or loss as at 1 April 2023 would have been to increase/decrease operating profit for the year by £4 million (last year: 

increase/decrease £3 million) on a post-tax basis. The effect on translating forward foreign exchange contracts designated as 

cash flow hedges as at 1 April 2023 would have been to decrease/increase equity by £12 million (last year: decrease/increase £5 

million) on a post-tax basis. 

The following table shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the year end in currencies other 

than the local currency of operation, after accounting for the effect of any specific forward foreign exchange contracts used to 

manage currency exposure. Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, overdrafts, borrowings and other amounts to be 

received or paid in cash. Amounts exclude intercompany balances which eliminate on consolidation. Foreign exchange differences 

on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are recognised in Net operating expenses.

27. Financial risk management continued 

Market risk continued 

Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to cash, borrowings, short-term deposits 

and overdrafts. 

The floating rate financial liabilities at 1 April 2023 are £65 million (last year: £45 million) due to cash pool overdrafts. The fixed 

rate financial liabilities at 1 April 2023 are borrowings of £298 million (last year: £298 million). If interest rates on floating rate 

financial liabilities had been 100 basis points higher/lower (last year: 100 basis points), excluding the impact on cash pool overdraft 

balances and with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £nil (last year: £nil) lower/higher, 

as a result of higher/lower interest expense. 

The floating rate financial assets as at 1 April 2023 comprise short-term deposits of £874 million (last year: £1,097 million), 

interest bearing current accounts of £2 million (last year: £6 million) and cash pool asset balances of £67 million (last year: 

£41 million). At 1 April 2023, if interest rates on floating rate financial assets had been 100 basis points higher/lower (last year: 

100 basis points), excluding the impact on cash pool asset balances and with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for 

the year would have been £8 million (last year: £9 million) higher/lower, as a result of higher/lower interest income. 

Credit risk 

Trade receivables  
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The trade receivables balance is spread across a large number of 

different customers with no single debtor representing more than 5% of the total balance due (last year: 5%). The Group has 

policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Sales to retail customers 

are made in cash or via major credit cards. In some retail locations, where the Group’s store is contained within a department store 

or mall, for example a concession, the sales proceeds may be initially held by the operator of the wider location, giving rise to retail 

debtors. In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad 

debts is not significant and default rates have historically been very low.  

The Group applies the simplified approach when measuring the trade receivable expected credit losses. The approach uses a 

lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on segment, 

geographical region and the days past due. The expected loss rates are reviewed annually, or when there is a significant change in 

external factors potentially impacting credit risk, and are updated where management’s expectations of credit losses change. 

No changes have been made to the expected loss rates during the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023. 

The expected credit loss allowance for receivables was determined as follows: 

As at 1 April 2023 

Trade receivables

In aggregate, as at 1 April 2023 , the movement in the impairment provision on trade and other receivables and recorded in the 

Income Statement was an increase of £1 million, of which £1 million relates to contracts with customers and £nil relates to other 

receivables (last year: reversal of £1 million of which £1 million related to contracts with customers and £nil related to other 

receivables). During the 53 weeks to 2 April 2022, a reversal of £1 million was presented as an adjusting item relating to the one-

off impact of COVID-19 on expected credit losses. Refer to note 6. 

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date with respect to trade and other receivables is approximated by the 

carrying amount on the Balance Sheet. 

Receivables excluding trade receivables 
The counterparty credit risk of other receivables is reviewed on a regular basis and the impairment is assessed as follows:  

At inception the receivable is recorded net of expected 12-month credit losses. If a significant change in the credit risk occurs 

during the life of the receivable, credit losses are recorded in the profit and loss account and the effective interest is calculated 

using the gross carrying amount of the asset. If a loss event occurs, the effective interest is calculated using the amortised cost of 

the asset net of any credit losses.  

During the year ended 31 March 2013 the Group entered into a retail leasing arrangement in the Republic of Korea. As part of this 

arrangement, a KRW 27 billion (£19 million) 15-year interest-free loan was provided to the landlord. The Group holds a registered 

mortgage over the leased property for the equivalent value of the loan which acts as collateral. At 1 April 2023, the discounted fair 

value of the loan is £14 million (last year: £14 million). The book value of the loan, recorded at amortised cost, is £14 million (last 

year: £13 million). Other than this arrangement, the Group does not hold any other collateral as security. Management considers 

that the security provided by the mortgage is sufficient risk mitigation and hence the credit loss relating to this receivable is 

not significant. 

Other financial assets 
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short-term deposits and certain derivative 

instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to 

the carrying value of these instruments. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution 

and only deposits funds with independently rated financial institutions with a minimum rating of ‘A’ other than where required for 

operational purposes. A total of £6 million (last year: £7 million) was held with institutions with a rating below ‘A’ at 1 April 2023. 

These amounts are monitored on a weekly basis by the Treasury Committee.

27. Financial risk management continued 

Liquidity risk 
The Group’s financial risk management policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet foreseeable needs and 

close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in 

funding by keeping committed credit lines available. For further details, refer to notes 23 and 24.  

All short-term trade and other payables, accruals, and bank overdrafts mature within one year or less. The carrying value of all 

financial liabilities due in less than one year is equal to their contractual undiscounted cash flows, with the exception of lease 

liabilities. The undiscounted contractual cash flows for lease liabilities due in less than one year is £237 million (last year: 

£218 million). 

The maturity profile of the contractual undiscounted cash flows of the Group’s non-current financial liabilities, excluding 

derivatives used for hedging, is as follows: 

In more than 1 year, but not more than 2 years  

In more than 2 years, but not more than 3 years  

In more than 3 years, but not more than 4 years  

In more than 4 years, but not more than 5 years

Capital risk 
The Board reviews the Group’s capital allocation policy annually. The Group’s capital allocation framework defines its priorities  

for uses of cash, underpinned by its principle to maintain a strong balance sheet with a solid investment grade credit rating. 

The framework has four priorities for the use of cash generated from operations: 

•  re-investment in the business to drive organic growth 

•  maintaining a progressive dividend policy 

•  continuing to pursue selective inorganic strategic investment and 

•  to the extent that there is surplus capital to these needs, providing additional returns to shareholders 

At 1 April 2023, the Group had net cash of £961 million (last year: £1,177 million), borrowings of £298 million (last year: £298 million) 

and total equity excluding non-controlling interests of £1,533 million (last year: £1,613 million). The borrowings at 1 April 2023 

relate to medium term notes with a face value of £300 million (last year: £300 million). For further details, refer to note 24. 

Potential additional sources of funding available to the Group include undrawn and additional bank facilities, longer-term debt and 

equity funding. The Group’s current capital resources, together with the potential additional sources of funding, are considered 

sufficient to address the Group’s capital risk. 

Having considered the future cash generation, growth, productivity and investment plans, taking into consideration the current 

challenging external environment and relevant financial parameters, the Group decided to continue the share buyback programme 

it began in May 2016. During the year ended 1 April 2023, the Company entered into agreements to purchase £400 million 

(last year: £150 million) of its own shares as part of the programme. For further details, refer to note 25.

Shares and share options granted to Directors and employees 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation schemes for its Directors and employees; the fair value 

charge relating to these schemes is £19 million. Details of each of these schemes are set out in this note. The share option 

schemes have been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The share awards have been valued using the closing 

price of an ordinary share at the date of grant.  

The key inputs used in the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value include: the share price at the commencement 

date; the exercise price attached to the option; the expected life of the option; an appropriate risk-free interest rate; a dividend 

yield discount for those schemes that do not accrue dividends during the course of the vesting period; and an expected share price 

volatility, which is determined by calculating the historical annualised standard deviation of the market price of Burberry Group plc 

shares over a period of time, prior to the grant, equivalent to the expected life of the option.  

Where applicable, equity swaps have been entered into to cover future employer’s national insurance liability (or overseas 

equivalent) that may arise in respect of these schemes.

The Burberry Share Plan 2020 (the BSP) 
The BSP was approved by shareholders and adopted by the Company in the year ended 27 March 2021 to replace the Burberry 

Group plc Executive Share Plan (ESP) as the Group’s main long-term incentive plan. 

Under the BSP rules, participants may be awarded either conditional share awards or phantom awards, up to a maximum value of 

three times base salary per annum. Awards may be subject to performance underpins. If the Company does not meet one or more 

of the performance underpins over the relevant vesting period, the Remuneration Committee would consider whether it is 

appropriate to scale back the level of pay-out under the BSP award. For the BSP awards made to the Executive Directors, 1/3 of 

the award will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, 1/3 of the award will vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date 

and the remaining balance of the award will vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued employment. 

Awards made to senior employees will not be subject to performance conditions or underpins and will vest in full on the third 

anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued employment. 

During the year, the fair value charge relating to the BSP awards was £9 million and the following grants were made under 

the BSP:

The Burberry Group plc Executive Share Plan (the ESP) 
The ESP was approved by the shareholders and adopted by the Company in the year ended 31 March 2015 with the final grant 

made on 27 February 2020.  

Under the ESP, participants were awarded shares, structured as either nil-cost options, conditional share awards or phantom 

awards, up to a maximum value of normally four times base salary per annum. Awards may be subject to a combination of non-

market performance conditions, including: compound annual Group adjusted PBT growth; compound annual Group revenue 

growth; and average retail/wholesale adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC). Performance conditions were measured over a 

three-year period from the last reporting period prior to the grant date and awards vested in two tranches in years 3 and 4. 

Thresholds and targets for all ESP schemes have now been assessed and the number of shares awarded has been approved. 

Awards made to management were not subject to performance conditions apart from continued service during the vesting period. 

Obligations under this plan will be met either by market purchase shares, the transfer of treasury shares or by the issue of 

ordinary shares of the Company, for which the ESOP trust may be used to facilitate the process. 

During the year, the fair value charge relating to the ESP awards was £1 million.

One-off awards 
The Company grants conditional share awards as one-off awards. Some of these awards vest in tranches, which vary by award,

The fair values for these awards are equivalent to the closing price of an ordinary share on the grant date. 

During the year, the fair value charge relating to the one-off awards was £5 million.

over the vesting period. 

The fair value charge for these schemes was £4 million.

31. Contingent liabilities 
The Group is subject to claims against it and to tax audits in a number of jurisdictions which arise in the ordinary course of 

business. These typically relate to Value Added Taxes, sales taxes, customs duties, corporate taxes, transfer pricing, payroll taxes, 

various contractual claims, legal proceedings and other matters. Where appropriate, the estimated cost of known obligations has 

been provided in these financial statements in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. The Group does not expect the 

outcome of current similar contingent liabilities to have a material effect on the Group’s financial position.

1.  Excludes the impact of adjusting items. Refer to note 2s for the Group’s policy on adjusting items. 
2.  Following the adoption of IFRS 16 in the year ending 28 March 2020, Net cash flow from operations excludes cash outflows for lease principal and other lease payments. 

Free cash flow is presented including these lease payments and hence free cash flow is on a comparable basis to prior years.

Financial Statements | Notes to the Company Financial Statements  

Burberry 2022/23 

A. Basis of preparation 
Burberry Group plc (the Company) is the parent Company of the Burberry Group. Burberry Group plc is a public company which  

is limited by shares and is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company’s principal business is investment and it is 

incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The Company is registered in England and Wales and the address of its registered office is 

Horseferry House, Horseferry Road, London, SW1P 2AW. The Company is the sponsoring entity of The Burberry Group plc ESOP 

Trust and The Burberry Group plc SIP Trust (collectively known as the ESOP trusts). These financial statements have been 

prepared by including the ESOP trusts within the financial statements of the Company. The purpose of the ESOP trusts is to 

purchase shares of the Company in order to satisfy Group share-based payment arrangements.  

Burberry Group plc and its subsidiaries (the Group) is a global luxury goods manufacturer, retailer and wholesaler. The Group also 

licenses third parties to manufacture and distribute products using the ‘Burberry’ trademarks. All of the companies which

been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and UK-adopted International Accounting 

Standards. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared for public use and can be obtained at Horseferry House, 

Horseferry Road, London, SW1P 2AW. 

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced 

Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101). The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost 

convention, as modified by derivative financial assets and derivative financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or 

loss, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has 

not presented its own Income Statement. 

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. 

It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s accounting policies (refer to note C).

Financial Statements | Notes to the Company Financial Statements  

Burberry 2022/23 

A. Basis of preparation continued 

Going concern 
The Company financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as set out in note 1 of the Group consolidated financial 

statements of Burberry Group plc. 

New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted in the period 
There have been no new standards or interpretations issued and made effective for the financial period commencing 3 April 2022 

that have had a material impact on the financial statements of the Company.  

B. Accounting policies 
The following principal accounting policies have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements. These policies have 

been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated:  

Share schemes 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation schemes, under which services are received from employees 

(including executive Directors) as consideration for equity instruments of the Company. Instruments used include awards and options. 

The cost of the share-based incentives is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of 

grant. Appropriate option pricing models, including Black-Scholes, are used to determine the fair value of the option awards made.  

The fair value takes into account the impact of any market performance conditions, but the impact of non-market performance 

conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant. Vesting conditions which relate to non-market 

conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of share awards or options expected to vest. The estimate of 

the number of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.  

In some circumstances, employees may provide services in advance of the grant date. The grant date fair value is estimated for 

the purpose of recognising the expense during the period between the service commencement period and the grant date. 

The grant by the Company of share awards or options over its equity instruments to employees of subsidiary undertakings in the 

Group is treated as a capital contribution. In the Company’s financial statements, the cost of the share-based incentives is 

recognised over the vesting period of the awards as an increase in investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding 

increase in equity. Where amounts are received from Group companies in relation to equity instruments granted to the employees 

of the subsidiary undertaking, the amount is derecognised from investments in Group companies. 

When share awards or options are exercised, they are settled either via issue of new shares in the Company, or through shares 

held in the ESOP trusts, depending on the terms and conditions of the relevant scheme. For new shares issued, the proceeds 

received from the exercises of share options, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital and 

share premium accounts. When ESOP shares are used, any difference between the exercise price and their cost are recognised in 

retained earnings. 

Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the year in which the dividend becomes a 

committed obligation. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised 

when paid. 

Investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provisions to reflect impairment in value. 

Impairment of investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is 

recognised for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 

asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest 

level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Investments for which an impairment has been 

previously recognised are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment at each reporting date. 

Taxation 
Tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax charge. 

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit because it excludes items of 

income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items which are never taxable or 

deductible. The current tax liability is calculated using tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 

sheet date.

Financial Statements | Notes to the Company Financial Statements  

Burberry 2022/23 

B. Accounting policies continued 

Taxation continued 
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liabilities method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 

and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, if the temporary difference arises from initial 

recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 

neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, no deferred tax will be recognised. 

Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 

and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 

temporary differences can be utilised.  

Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 

contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flow expire or 

substantially all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in 

the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. 

At initial recognition, all financial liabilities are stated at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities are 

stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, except for derivatives which are held at fair value and which are 

classified as fair value through profit and loss. Financial assets are classified as either amortised cost or fair value through profit 

and loss depending on their cash flow characteristics. Assets with cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and 

interest are measured at amortised cost. The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost approximate 

their carrying amount due to the use of market interest rates. 

The Company classifies its instruments in the following categories:

The Company’s primary categories of financial instruments are listed below: 

Cash at bank and in hand 
On the Balance Sheet, cash at bank and in hand comprises cash held with banks. Cash at bank and in hand held at amortised cost 

is subject to impairment testing each period end. 

Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are included in current assets. Trade and other receivables with maturities greater than 12 months 

after the balance sheet date are classified in trade and other receivables amounts falling due after more than one year. The 

assessment of maturities of loan receivables takes into consideration any intention to renew the loan, where the loan is provided 

under a facility which has a maturity of more than 12 months from the balance sheet date. Most receivables are held with the 

objective to collect the contractual cash flows and are therefore recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at 

amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the expected loss on 

receivables is established at inception. This is modified when there is a change in the credit risk. The amount of the movement in 

the provision is recognised in the Income Statement. 

Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet 

date. Payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 

rate method.

B. Accounting policies continued 

Financial instruments continued 

Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, inclusive of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 

amortised cost and the difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 

Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method. Borrowings are classified in 

creditors amounts falling due within one year unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 

at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 

Derivative instruments 
The Company uses equity swap contracts to economically hedge its exposure to fluctuations in the Company’s share price 

which impacts the social security costs payable by Group companies in relation to share-based compensation schemes. 

The equity swap contracts are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date and classified as fair value through profit and loss. 

All subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in the Income Statement up to the maturity date.  

Cash settled equity swaps are classified as fair value through profit and loss.  

Foreign currency translation 

Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 

Company operates (the functional currency). The financial statements are presented in sterling which is the Company’s functional 

and presentation currency. 

Transactions in foreign currencies  
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the 

date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are held at the year end, are 

translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date (closing rate). Exchange differences 

on monetary items are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise.  

Called up share capital  
Called up share capital is classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 

shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 

Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 

attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to owners of the Company until the shares are cancelled, 

reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 

attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to owners of 

the Company. 

C. Key sources of estimation uncertainty and judgements 

Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires that management make certain estimates and 

assumptions that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. If in the 

future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best estimates at the date of the financial statements, 

deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be updated as appropriate in the period in which 

the circumstances change. 

Estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 

events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There were no key sources of estimation uncertainty for the 

52 weeks to 1 April 2023 and the 53 weeks to 2 April 2022. 

Key judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies 
Judgements are those decisions made when applying accounting policies which have a significant impact on the amounts 

recognised in the Company’s financial statements. Further details of the Company’s accounting policies are provided in note B. 

There were no key judgements arising in the current year or prior year that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in 

the Company’s financial statements for the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023 and the 53 weeks to 2 April 2022.

The Company has reviewed the recoverable value of its investments to identify if there is any indication of impairment of the 

carrying value. Where applicable, the value in use has been estimated using management’s best estimates of future cash 

generation of its investments. 

The Company has not impaired the carrying value of its investments as their cash generation in the long-term is considered 

sufficient to support the carrying value. The subsidiary undertakings and investments of the Burberry Group are listed in note 30

G. Borrowings 
On 21 September 2020, Burberry Group plc issued medium term notes with a face value of £300 million and 1.125% coupon 

maturing on 21 September 2025 (the sustainability bond). Proceeds from the sustainability bond will allow the Group to finance 

projects which support the Group’s sustainability agenda. Refer to page 92 for the sustainability bond use of proceeds report. 

There are no financial penalties for not using the proceeds as anticipated. Interest on the sustainability bond is payable semi-

annually. The carrying value of the bond at 1 April 2023 is £298 million (last year: £298 million); all movements on the bond are 

non-cash. The fair value of the bond at 1 April 2023 is £273 million (last year: £285 million). 

H. Credit risk 
The Company’s principal financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings, trade and other receivables and trade and other 

payables arising directly from operations. 

Trade and other receivables  
The trade and other receivables balance comprises intercompany loans with companies within the Group. These Group companies 

are assessed at each reporting date as to their ability to repay outstanding balances. The amounts owed by Group companies at 1 

April 2023 comprise £587 million owed by Burberry Limited, and £1 million owed by other Group companies (last year: £609 

million owed by Burberry Limited, and £1 million owed by other Group companies). 

The counterparty credit risk of trade and other receivables is reviewed on a regular basis and assessed for impairment as follows: 

At inception the receivable is recorded net of expected 12-month credit losses. If a significant increase in the credit risk occurs during the 

life, credit losses are recorded in the profit and loss account and the effective interest is calculated using the gross carrying amount of the 

asset. If a loss event occurs, the effective interest is calculated using the amortised cost of the asset net of any credit losses.  

The Company’s most significant debtor, Burberry Limited, is the holder of the Burberry brand and the main operating company of 

the Group. Based on its liquidity and expected cash generation, the expected 12 months credit loss for Burberry Limited trade and 

other receivables is not considered to be significant. As a result, no impairment has been recorded for amounts owed by Group 

companies as at 1 April 2023. 

Other financial assets 
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and certain other receivables, the Company’s 

exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these 

instruments. The Company has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution and only deposits funds 

with independently rated financial institutions with a minimum rating of ‘A’, other than where required for operational purposes.

The Company has a general authority from shareholders, renewed at each Annual General Meeting, to repurchase a maximum of 

10% of its issued share capital. During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, the Company entered into agreements to purchase £400 

million of its own shares, excluding stamp duty and fees, through two share buyback programmes of £200 million each (last year: 

one share buyback programme of £150 million). Both programmes were completed during the year.  

The cost of own shares purchased by the Company, as part of a share buyback programme, is offset against the profit and loss 

account, as the amounts paid reduce the profits available for distribution by the Company. When shares are cancelled, a transfer is 

made from the profit and loss account to the capital reserve, equivalent to the nominal value of the shares purchased and 

subsequently cancelled. In the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, 21 million shares were cancelled (last year: none).  

As at 1 April 2023 the Company held 6.1 million treasury shares (last year: 8.4 million), with a market value of £157 million (last 

year: £140 million) based on the share price at the reporting date. The treasury shares held by the Company are related to the 

share buyback programme completed during the 53 weeks to 2 April 2022. During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, 2.3 million 

treasury shares were transferred to ESOP trusts (last year: none). During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023, no treasury shares were 

cancelled (last year: none).

I. Called up share capital continued 

The cost of shares purchased by ESOP trusts are offset against the profit and loss account, as the amounts paid reduce the 

profits available for distribution by the Company. As at 1 April 2023, the cost of own shares held by ESOP trusts and offset 

against the profit and loss account is £42 million (last year: £11 million). As at 1 April 2023, the ESOP trusts held 2.3 million shares 

(last year: 0.6 million) in the Company, with a market value of £60 million (last year: £10 million). In the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023 

the ESOP trusts and the Company have waived their entitlement to dividends.

A final dividend in respect of the 52 weeks to 1 April 2023 of 44.5p (last year: 35.4p) per share, amounting to £167 million, has 

been proposed for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting subsequent to the balance sheet date. The final 

dividend has not been recognised as a liability at the year end and will be paid on 4 August 2023 to the shareholders on the 

register at the close of business on 30 June 2023. The ex-dividend date is 29 June 2023 and the final day for dividend 

reinvestment plan (DRIP) elections is 14 July 2023. 

K. Financial guarantees 
On 26 July 2021, the Group entered into a £300 million multi-currency sustainability-linked revolving credit facility (RCF) with a 

syndicate of banks, maturing on 26 July 2026. There were no drawdowns or repayments of the RCF during the current or previous 

year, and at 1 April 2023 there were no outstanding drawings. 

The Group is in compliance with the financial and other covenants within the facility and has been in compliance throughout the 

financial period. 

The companies acting as guarantor to the facility consist of Burberry Group plc, Burberry Limited, Burberry Asia Limited, 

Burberry (Wholesale) Limited (US) and Burberry Limited (US). Based on the liquidity and expected cash generation of Burberry 

Limited, the expected credit loss in respect of these financial guarantees, as at 1 April 2023, is not considered to be significant. 

As a result, no liability has been recorded (last year: £nil). 

A potential liability may arise in the future if one of the Group members defaults on these loan facilities. Each guarantor, including 

Burberry Group plc, would be liable to cover the amounts outstanding, including principal and interest elements. 

L. Audit fees 
The Company has incurred audit fees of £0.1 million for the current year which are borne by Burberry Limited (last year: £0.1 million). 

M. Employee costs 
The Company has no employees and therefore no employee costs are included in these financial statements for the 52 weeks to 

1 April 2023 (last year: £nil).

Tips on protecting your information
•  Keep any documentation that contains your shareholder 

reference number in a safe place and shred any 
unwanted documentation

•  Inform our registrar, Equiniti, promptly when you 

change address

•  Be aware of dividend payment dates and contact the  

registrar if you do not receive your dividend cheque or,  
better still, make arrangements to have the dividend  
paid directly into your bank account

•  Consider holding your shares electronically in a CREST  

account via a nominee

Unauthorised brokers (boiler room scams)
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount, or offers of free company 
reports. These are typically from overseas-based “brokers” who 
target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out 
to be worthless or high-risk shares in US or UK investments. 
These operations are commonly known as boiler rooms.

If you receive any unsolicited investment advice, get the correct 
name of the person and organisation, and check that they are

Dividends
An interim dividend for FY 2022/23 of 16.5p per ordinary share 
was paid on 27 January 2023. A final dividend of 44.5p per share 
has been proposed and, subject to approval at the AGM on 12 July 
2023, will be paid according to the following timetable:

Ex-dividend date:

Final dividend record date:

Deadline for return of Dividend Reinvestment 
Plan (DRIP) mandate forms:

Final dividend payment date:

29 June 2023

30 June 2023

14 July 2023

4 August 2023

The ADR local payment date will be approximately five business 
days after the proposed dividend payment date for ordinary 
shareholders.

Dividends can be paid by BACS directly into a UK bank account,  
with the dividend confirmation being sent to the shareholder’s 
address. This is the easiest way for shareholders to receive 
dividend payments and avoids the risk of lost or out-of-date 
cheques. A dividend mandate form is available from Equiniti or 
online at www.shareview.co.uk/info/directdividends.

If you are a UK taxpayer, please note that you are eligible for a 
tax-free dividend allowance in each tax year (£1,000 in the tax year 
from 6 April 2023 to 5 April 2024).

Any dividends received above this amount will be subject to 
taxation. Dividends paid on shares held within pensions and 
Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) will continue to be tax-free. 
Further information can be found at www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends.

Dividends payable in foreign currencies
Equiniti is able to pay dividends to shareholder bank accounts in 
over 30 currencies worldwide through the Overseas Payment 
Service. An administrative fee will be deducted from each dividend 
payment. Further details can be obtained from Equiniti or online at 
www.shareview.co.uk/info/ops.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)
Our DRIP enables shareholders to use their dividends to buy 
further Burberry shares. Full details of the DRIP can be obtained from 
Equiniti or online at www.shareview.co.uk/info/drip.

Electronic communication
Shareholders may at any time choose to receive all shareholder 
documentation in electronic form via the internet, rather than in 
paper format. Shareholders who decide to register for this option 
will receive an email each time a shareholder document is published 
on the internet. Shareholders who wish to receive documentation 
in electronic form should register online at www.shareview.co.uk.

Equiniti offers a range of shareholder information and services 
online at www.shareview.co.uk.
